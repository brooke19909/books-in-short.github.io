    <p>  The future commander, politician, writer was from the patrician family Yuliev.  At one time, this family played a significant role in the life of Rome.  Like any ancient clan, they had their own mythical version of origin.  The line of their surname led to the goddess Venus. </p><p>  Guy's mother was Aurelius Cott, descended from a family of wealthy plebeians.  By name it is clear that her family was named after Aureliev.  <span>Guy Julius Caesar</span> Sr. was the father.  He belonged to the patricians. </p><p>  Intense discussions continue regarding the dictator's birth year.  Most often called 100 or 101 BC  Also, there is no consensus on the number.  As a rule, three versions are called: March 17, July 12, July 13. </p><p>  To understand who Caesar is, one should turn to his childhood.  He grew up in a Roman area, which had a pretty bad reputation.  He studied at home, mastering the Greek language, literature, rhetoric.  Knowledge of Greek allowed him to receive further education, since most of the scientific works were written on it.  One of his teachers was the famous rhetorician Gnifon, who once taught Cicero. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Presumably in 85 BC  Guy had to lead the Julian family due to the unexpected death of his father. </p><h2>  Personality: appearance, character, habits </h2>

    <p>  A lot of descriptions are left about the appearance of Guy Julius, a lot of his sculptural portraits, including lifetime ones, have been made.  Caesar, whose photo (reconstruction) is presented above, was, according to Suetonius, tall, with fair skin.  He was well built and had dark, vibrant eyes. </p><p>  The politician and military leader took care of himself rather carefully.  He cut his nails, shaved, plucked his hair.  Having a bald spot on the front of his head, he hid it in every possible way, combing his hair from the parietal part to his forehead.  According to Plutarch, Caesar's physique was very frail. </p><p>  Ancient authors are unanimous that the dictator was energetic.  He quickly reacted to changing circumstances.  According to Pliny the Elder, he communicated with many people through correspondence.  If desired, the dictator could simultaneously read and dictate letters to different addressees to several secretaries.  Moreover, at that moment he could write something himself. </p><p>  Guy Julius practically did not drink wine and was very unpretentious in food.  At the same time, he brought elements of luxury from his military campaigns, such as <span>mosaic floors,</span> expensive dishes.  He bought paintings, statues, beautiful slaves. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Family and personal life </h2><p>  Julius Caesar, whose biography is under consideration, was officially married three times.  Although there is also information that before these marriages he was engaged to Kossucia.  His wives were: </p><ul><li>  Cornelia from the consul's family. </li><li>  Pompey is the granddaughter of the dictator Sulla. </li><li>  Kalpurnia is a representative of a wealthy plebeian clan. </li></ul>

    <p>  Cornelia and the commander had a daughter, whom he married to his associate Gnei Pompey.  As for his relationship with Cleopatra, they took place while Guy Julius was in Egypt.  After this, Cleopatra gave birth to a child, to whom the Alexandrians gave the name Caesarion.  However, Julius Caesar did not recognize him as his son and did not write him in his will. </p><h2>  Military and political activities </h2><p>  The beginning of his career was the post of Jupiter's flaming, which Guy took in the 80s BC  To do this, he terminated the engagement and married the daughter of Cornelius Zinn, who nominated him to this honorable position.  But things quickly changed when power changed in Rome, and Guy had to leave the city. </p><p>  Many examples from his life allow us to understand who Caesar is.  One of them is the case when pirates captured him, demanding a ransom.  The politician was ransomed, but immediately after that he organized the capture of his captors and executed them, crucified on crosses. </p><p>  Who was Julius Caesar in Ancient Rome?  He held the following positions: </p><ul><li>  pontiff; </li><li>  military stands; </li><li>  financial investor in Far Spain; </li><li>  the caretaker of the Appian Way, which he repaired at his own expense; </li><li>  kurul edil - was engaged in the organization of urban construction, trade, celebrations; </li><li>  head of the permanent criminal court; </li><li>  lifetime great pontiff; </li><li>  Viceroy of Far Spain. </li></ul><p>  All these posts were expensive.  He took funds from his creditors, who provided them with understanding. </p><h2>  First triumvirate </h2><p>  After successful governorship in Far Spain, politics awaited Triumph in Rome.  However, he refused such honors for reasons of career growth.  The fact is that the time has come (by age) when he could be elected consul to the Senate.  But for this it was required to personally register his candidacy.  At the same time, the person who is waiting for the Triumph must not appear in the city ahead of time.  He had to make a choice in favor of his further career, abandoning the honors inherent in the winner. </p><p>  After studying who Caesar is, it becomes clear that his ambition was more flattered to take a seat in the Senate in the first year, when it is permissible by law.  At that time it was considered very honorable. </p>

    <p>  As a result of long political combinations, the politician reconciled between his two associates, as a result of which the first triumvirate arose.  The expression means "union of three husbands."  The year of its creation is not known for certain, since this alliance was secret.  Historians suggest that this happened in 59 or 60 BC.  It included Caesar, Pompey, Crassus.  As a result of all the actions, Guy Julius managed to become a consul. </p><h2>  Participation in the gallic war </h2>

    <p>  By his triumvirate, Julius Caesar, whose biography is presented in the article, began to disappoint the citizens of Rome.  However, due to his departure to the province, all discontent should have resulted in Gnei Pompey. </p><p>  At this time, in the territory of modern France, the province of Narbonne Gaul was formed.  Caesar arrived in Genoa, on the site of which Geneva is now located, for negotiations with the leaders of one of the Celtic tribes.  Under the onslaught of the Germans, these tribes began to settle on the territory of the <span>Roman Republic.</span>  Guy had to fight for the lands of the province with the Gauls and Germans.  At the same time, he conducted an expedition to Britain. </p><p>  After a series of victories, Caesar succeeded by 50 BC.  subjugate all of Gaul to Rome.  However, he did not forget to follow the events in the Eternal City.  Sometimes he even intervened in them through his proxies. </p><h2>  Establishment of a dictatorship </h2><p>  Returning to Rome, the commander came into conflict with Gnei Pompey.  In 49-45 BC  this led to the Civil War.  Guy Caesar had many supporters throughout Italy.  He drew a large part of the army to his side and headed to Rome.  Pompey was forced to flee to Greece.  The war unfolded throughout the republic.  The commander and his legions alternated victories and defeats.  The decisive battle was the battle of Farsalus, whose winner was Caesar. </p>

    <p>  The wrath had to flee again.  This time he went to Egypt.  Julius set off after him.  None of the opponents expected Pompey to be killed in Egypt.  Here Guy Julius was forced to linger.  At first, the reason was the wind, unfavorable for ships, and then the commander decided to improve his financial situation at the expense of the Ptolemaic dynasty.  Thus, he became a participant in the struggle for the throne between Ptolemy the Thirteenth and Cleopatra. </p><p>  In Egypt, he spent several months, after which he continued his campaign to restore the territory of Rome, which began to decay due to the Civil War. </p><p>  Caesar became a dictator three times: </p><ol><li>  In 49 BC, for a period of 11 days, after which he resigned. </li><li>  In 48 BC, for a period of one year, after which he continued to rule as a proconsul, and later a consul. </li><li>  In 46 BC  became a dictator without formal justification for a period of 10 years. </li></ol><p>  All his power rested on the army, so the election of Caesar for all subsequent posts was a formality. </p><p>  During his reign, Guy Julius Caesar (photo of the sculpture can be seen above), along with his associates carried out many reforms.  However, to determine which of them relate directly to the time of his reign is quite difficult.  The most famous is the reform of the Roman calendar.  Citizens had to go to the solar calendar, which was developed by a scientist from Alexandria Sozingen.  So, from 45 BC  The <span>Julian calendar</span> , known today for all, appeared <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Death and testament </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear who Julius Caesar is, whose biography ended rather tragically.  In 44 BC  a conspiracy formed against his autocracy.  Opponents and supporters of the dictator were afraid that he would call himself king.  One of the groups was led by Mark Junius Brutus. </p>

Apparently, the success of his actions to popularize his own personality exceeded his expectations.  Perhaps that is why in the modern world of Guy Julius Caesar, both schoolchildren and representatives of the art world know. </p>
