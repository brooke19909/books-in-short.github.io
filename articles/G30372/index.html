    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Everything was simple with its predecessor: the MTK 6589 4-core processor with a frequency of 1.2 GHz was the basis of the Lenovo S820.  S820T (MTK6592, an 8-core CPU, indicated in the specifications of one of the modifications of this smartphone, and MTK6589, integrated in a simplified version of the device) can be equipped with one of these processors, depending on the modification of the gadget: "flagship" or "stripped down". </p><p>  But according to the test results, it turns out that instead of the first of them, MTK6572 is installed with two real cores and six stopped and a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz instead of 1.7 GHz.  To verify this, just download the utility "CPU - Z" from third-party sources and install it.  Yes, it really will show after the launch that MTK6592 is installed.  But this is bad luck - only two out of eight cores work.  The rest are in stop mode and it is impossible to start them.  As a result, it turns out that the MTK6572 processor is really integrated into the device.  He has the same architecture - ‚ÄúCortex A7‚Äù, clock frequency - 1.3 GHz and only 2 cores on board.  In general, the Chinese software trick: you buy one thing, it‚Äôs like what you ordered (at least the software convinces you of this), but behind all this is hidden completely different at the hardware level. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The only difference is the presence of an external communication module for working in third-generation networks.  This is the basic configuration of the <span>Lenovo S820T.</span>  Reviews of frustrated owners about this smartphone confirm the previously stated trick.  But with the 4-core version, everything is fine.  It uses the classic MTK65859T with a frequency of 1.5 GHz.  The more cores, the more productive the smartphone, the longer it will have enough hardware resources.  Two cores are not enough for comfortable gameplay, but four will do just fine with this task.  A similar situation is with resource-intensive applications.  Therefore, when buying, you need to clarify the real processor model that is installed in this device. </p>

    <h2>  Graphics adapter and screen </h2><p>  The screen size of this smartphone is 5 inches.  The claimed resolution for the 8-core model is 1920 by 1080 pixels.  But given that he has only 2 of them in work, most of the applications will slow down.  Do not forget that in such a situation a maximum of two touches will be processed, not five.  In turn, the model with the MTK 6589 CPU has more modest characteristics - 1280 by 720 pixels and is capable of processing up to five touches inclusive.  Type of installed matrix AMOLED.  The picture quality is excellent.  But with graphics adapters the situation is interesting.  In the 8-core version, 450 MP from the Mali company is programmatically registered.  But in reality, according to the test results, 400 of the same developer for Lenovo S820T will be indicated there.  Specifications <strong> </strong>  this graphics accelerator is an order of magnitude worse.  Again, this adapter usually comes with the MTK 6572 central processor and 512 MB of random access memory.  Moreover, this is an outdated model today.  But the 4-core modification is equipped with the SGX544 graphics card from PowerVR.  This is a more productive solution that will perfectly cope with most tasks today. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Memory and its quantity </h2><p>  An interesting memory situation is obtained with the Lenovo S820T.  The feedback from the perplexed owners is another confirmation of this.  Let's start with the basic version of this smartphone.  According to the documentation, 2 GB of DDR3 RAM is integrated.  But after turning on and checking the parameters, an interesting picture is revealed.  Yes, its really 2 GB.  But the system is constantly in a strange way takes 1.6 GB or more.  In the best case, 200 MB is allocated for the user's needs, and maybe even less.  In general, again, Chinese programmers cheated.  They designed 2 GB of software, but in fact, 512 MB are installed, which are standard for the MTK6572 processor.  But in the second modification with four cores, everything is fine, and 1 GB is integrated there.  With the internal memory, everything is fine.  In both the first and second cases, its 4 GB, of which 2 GB is occupied by the system, and the rest is provided to the user.  There is also a slot for installing flash cards in MicroSD format with a maximum capacity of 32 GB. </p>

    <h2>  Body and ergonomics </h2><p>  The case of the Lenovo S820T is excellently made.  A review of its external components only confirms this.  The device itself is a candy bar with touch input support.  The diagonal of the screen, as noted earlier, is 5 inches.  Under it are three classic buttons: ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù.  And above the screen are the earpiece and camera for making video calls.  Covering the front panel is kind of like a gorilla eye glass, but given the nuances previously stated, you shouldn't believe this.  Therefore, you can‚Äôt do without a protective film, since it comes with the kit and there‚Äôs no need to buy it additionally.  The volume swing and the power button are located on the right.  Because of this, you can easily manage this device with one hand.  Another plus of them - they are made for metal, they will not get so dirty so much.  On the back there is a <span>front camera</span> and a loud speaker.  The entire back cover is made of glossy plastic.  This is an obvious flaw - such a coating simply attracts dirt and easily scratches.  Again, a leather case is included, there should be no problems with the safety of the case. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Camera and its features </h2><p>  As noted earlier, Lenovo's cell phone of this model is equipped with two cameras at once.  One of them on the front of the device is designed to make video calls.  According to the documentation, it is indicated that it uses a 1.3 MP matrix.  In reality, it is 0.3 megapixels.  The image quality from it leaves much to be desired.  She is barely suitable for such communication.  The second is located on the back of the gadget.  It is based on a 13 megapixel matrix according to the manufacturer, but in reality it is 8 megapixels.  There is also a backlight and autofocus.  The quality of the pictures and video recordings obtained with its help is quite acceptable. </p>

    <h2>  The battery and everything connected with it </h2><p>  The Lenovo cell phone of this model is equipped with a very capacious 2800 milliampere / hour battery.  With not very high intensity of use of this smart phone, its resource will last for 4 days.  This is a great indicator for such a device.  With more intensive use of the battery capacity is enough for 1-2 days.  If you listen to music, then one charge is enough for 12 hours of battery life.  In general, there are no obvious problems, as with the processor, memory and graphics adapter.  Another plus is the ability to replace a faulty battery.  It is enough to buy a new battery and open the back cover.  Remove the old accessory and install a new one. </p>

    <h2>  OS </h2><p>  Now about the operating system that runs the Lenovo S820T.  A review without this will turn out to be inferior.  Now this gadget is running "Android" with the outdated version 4.2.  In addition, we can say that updates are not expected.  That is, all the time this device will only work under the control of this OS.  So far, of course, compatibility problems do not arise, but after some time they may appear. <br><strong></strong></p>

    <h2>  Application software </h2><p>  In its original form, a complete set of applications from "Google" for this Lenovo model is installed.  The S820T phone allows you to view videos from ‚ÄúUTuba‚Äù, communicate on the Google + network and conduct correspondence using the ‚ÄúZh-Mail‚Äù mail service.  Also installed "Play Market".  From here you can easily and simply install other necessary programs.  There are also overseas social services such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.  But domestic will have to be installed separately. </p><h2>  What do you need to add to the OS? </h2><p>  To read books in various formats, it is recommended to put ‚ÄúKingsoft office‚Äù on this device.  It will also allow you to work with text tables.  To view the tables, you must install the ‚ÄúMX player‚Äù.  You also need to supplement your smartphone with antivirus and optimization utility.  For these purposes, ‚ÄúSM Security‚Äù and ‚ÄúWedge Master‚Äù are perfect.  All this will significantly improve the performance of Lenovo S820T.  A review of further software does not make sense to produce, since everything depends on the user's tasks.  For example, to perform complex mathematical calculations, you can put some kind of calculator with an expanded set of functions.  You also need to install social services for the domestic networks "VKontakte", "My World" and "Classmates".  This will allow you to communicate with friends and relatives using your smartphone.  In general, all the necessary applications and games can be found and downloaded from the "Play Market". </p><h2>  Data Capabilities </h2><p>  Finally, we consider the communication capabilities of this smartphone.  For wireless connection to the Global Web, you can use Wi-Fi (maximum speed up to 100 Mbit / s) and mobile networks of the third or second generation (in the first case we get a maximum of 3 Mbit / s, in the second - hundreds of kilobytes).  If you need to download large content (for example, a movie), then it is better to stop the choice on wi-fi.  But you can even browse sites and communicate on social networks even on JMS networks.  For navigation, the ZhSM module is installed.  Alas, it does not work with the GLONASS system.  From this side, this Lenovo model looks flawlessly.  Phone S820T, a review of wireless connections indicates this, is not equipped with an infrared port.  But this technology, both morally and physically outdated.  So there is nothing to worry about.  Among the wired data transfer, the following types of connectors can be distinguished: MicroUSB (for connecting to a PC and charging the battery) and 3.5 mm audio jack for connecting external speakers or headphones.  It should be noted right away that the stereo headset that comes with the smart phone is of very poor quality.  Therefore, lovers of quality sound should buy other headphones. </p><h2>  Smartphone Reviews </h2><p>  Detailed review of Lenovo phones <strong> </strong>  says that this is a branded gadget of a leading Chinese manufacturer.  Problems with the processor, camera, graphics adapter and memory - this is not a complete list of nuances that indicate that this is a fake.  Perhaps it is made at the same factory with other devices of this brand, but the quality is poor.  This confirms the many reviews of this model on various information resources on the global web.  In general, you need to weigh everything well before buying this Lenovo smartphone.  The S820T on paper has superior features and specifications, but in reality it is not. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  To summarize.  Oddities with the processor, memory and graphics adapter cause a lot of complaints on the Lenovo S820T.  Reviews only confirm this.  In any case, two cores today are not enough.  A similar situation exists with RAM (only 512 MB in the basic configuration) and with a graphics adapter ("Mali-400" is clearly outdated).  At the same time, the Lenovo S820T has practically no positive points.  The price of $ 140 is clearly overpriced.  If it was based on a full-fledged 8-core chip, then this was an excellent acquisition.
