This is a popular resort on the Black Sea, on the border of Odessa and <span>Nikolaev regions.</span>  It’s also known that Koblevo is a famous winemaking center in Ukraine.  But there is one more thing that makes the resort very attractive.  And this is a water park.  In Koblevo, mostly families with children have a rest.  And the kids want fun.  And adults (at least some) like to tickle their nerves with adrenaline.  Therefore, the idea of ​​building a water park has always been relevant.  First, the recreation center “Orbita” acquired a water entertainment town.  And since 2007, the city water park began to work, which is called “Koblevo”.  This article, based on reviews and photos taken by tourists, will help you understand how to get to the rides, how much the entrance costs, what interesting slides there are and what discounts you can get. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Water park orbit in Koblevo" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/971099.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Koblevo </h2><p>  Administratively, the resort belongs to the Nikolaev region.  But it is located much closer to Odessa - forty kilometers against seventy.  Regular buses run from both regional centers very often.  Koblevo resort is, as it were, on a cape, so from the Odessa-Nikolaev highway, where the bus station is located, you still need to get to the town itself.  Minibuses deliver passengers to the new water park, driving along local recreation centers and boarding houses.  "Orbit" is located near the sea.  Here you can decide which water park in Koblevo to choose - new or old.  But it is better to use buses that go to the resort itself.  From Odessa they depart from Privoz (50 hryvnias, that is, about 150-200 rubles or more, depending on the rate).  From Nikolaev - from the main bus station.  There is another option, the so-called "free".  If you take a ticket for the whole day, then travel to the water park from Odessa, Nikolaev and Kherson will not cost you anything.  But then, reviews warn, discounts and flyers do not apply. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Waterpark "Orbit" in Koblevo </h2><p>  This <span>recreation center</span> is located near the sea.  Therefore, there is no need to drill a well in order to get water for the water park.  This has its advantages.  The smell of bleach does not hover in the air, does not <span>hurt the eyes</span> from diving.  Sea water is filtered, and therefore there are no algae and jellyfish in it.  The infrastructure in this institution is thought out even better than in Odessa.  Everything is clean and tidy.  Reviews mark the courtesy and care of the staff.  Visitors were pleasantly surprised by the range of entertainment for children.  For them in the water park "Orbit" built a whole amusement town.  With nutrition, everything is the best possible way.  Of course, as in any water parks, visitors are asked not to bring food and drinks.  But if in Odessa, a real search is made at the entrance, then here, people say, no one rummages through their bags.  The water park has a pizzeria, bistro and Italian cafe.  What pleased the visitors, here you can go out for a while (at least in order to have lunch).  They put a stamp on hand, and then you can return for free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Water park in Koblevo photo" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/971098.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Entertainment in Orbit </h2><p>  Visitors got the impression that this water park in Koblevo is focused mainly on the smallest.  An extensive playground is built for children here.  There are slides even for fearful three-year-olds - Baby Slide.  And younger students can try to slide into the Kids Slide.  Enough of adrenaline for adults.  All reviews, without exception, called the “Rocket” (aka “Capsule”) the most extreme attraction.  Many took their breath away on the “Black Hole” hill, which the people dubbed more precisely - “Toilet”.  It turns, flips and carries into the darkness a stormy stream.  Many liked the "Mountain Descent" and "Bottom Up."  Reviews point to one nice feature of this place.  In Orbit there is no such influx of people, as in Odessa or even the new Koblevo water park.  Therefore, the day spent here will be remembered for fun and entertainment, rather than boring queuing in an embittered crowd. </p>

    <h2>  Prices in Orbit </h2><p>  The lion's share of tourists mentions that they visited the water park in Koblevo for a special offer.  Yes, regular prices "bite": a day ticket (from opening at 10.00 and completion of work at 18 hours) costs 380 hryvnias for adults and 280 for children whose height does not exceed 140 centimeters.  Admission is free for children up to three years old.  If you go to the water park after 14.00, then the prices fall to 350 and 250, respectively.  The last two hours before closing will cost you 310 and 210 hryvnia.  But in the season, water park agents give out flyers that give you the opportunity to get a discount of up to 50 percent.  You can also get shares on the Internet.  If you are celebrating a birthday, the original and a copy of your passport (or birth certificate) will open the doors of the water park for you absolutely free.  And this is not only in the name day itself.  The fun continues for the next two days.  But weekends and holidays do not affect prices at the water park.  Visitors warn that a deposit (60 hryvnias) is taken for a locker and a bracelet with a key. </p>

    <h2>  Food and other services </h2><p>  "Orbit" is a very popular water park in Koblevo.  Reviews say that children's pools are better than in the new.  All sing laudatory odes at low prices in the cafe and dining room of the water park.  The food is very tasty.  Around the pools are sunbeds, and there is enough space for everyone.  The slide for adults is less than in the new water park, but it is enough for a fun holiday with the whole family.  The rides are quite safe, the joints on the slides are not felt.  Around each pool, two staff members are on duty.  On the slides, they help to sit on the bun, instruct how and where to go.  The courtesy and friendly participation of the staff are repeatedly mentioned by visitors in reviews. </p><h2>  Water park "Koblevo" </h2><p>  It opened in August 2007 and now is worthy of competition to the Odessa institution.  And many people come from regional centers to visit this particular water park in Koblevo.  The photos show that the water in the pools is <span>azure.</span>  And this is not a hoax.  Water is pumped from a deep artesian well.  The new water park uses modern technology for cleaning it.  Therefore, there is also no smell of bleach, although the water is fresh.  The safety of guests is monitored by a team of instructors and rescuers.  Reviews say that the new water park in Koblevo is a whole town.  There are pools, a relaxation area with a jacuzzi, slides, cafes and restaurants, parking and even your own hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel </h2><p>  The administration took note of the experience of water parks in the UAE.  In such entertainment cities you can live in the literal sense of the word.  True, the Koblevo hotel is small - only four double rooms.  But these are luxury rooms.  They are equipped with air conditioning, plasma TV with satellite channels, refrigerator, electric kettle.  Each room is uniquely designed.  Breakfast is included.  The price for a double room was seven hundred hryvnias (2100-2800 rubles depending on the course) per day.  What is not so much for a quality vacation in Koblevo.  The water park provides its residents with free access to attractions in case guests stay for the night for 3 days or more. </p>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  In the summer of 2015, they increased markedly.  Now the price of a single visit is four hundred hryvnias (1200-1500 rubles).  But there is still a system for attracting customers with various promotional offers, raffle tickets and discounts.  To save money, you need to regularly look at the site of the water park.  Unlike Orbit, Koblevo’s rates change depending on the days of the week and even the season.  So, on weekends and holidays, from July 25 to August 31 this year, prices were 540 hryvnias (1650 rubles) per adult and 460 hryvnias (1400 rubles) per child.  And this is only for using the services of the water park from ten in the morning to two in the afternoon.  Therefore, the hotel, at which prices did not rise, began to enjoy such popularity.  The same expensive seemed to tourists who left reviews, food.  And since it is impossible to bring even drinking water to the territory of the complex, this rule has been severely criticized by vacationers. </p><h2>  Slides in the water park "Koblevo" </h2><p>  Reviews say that here you will find many different attractions: children’s, for family riding, adults and even extreme.  Judging by the reviews, the kids like Water Tower, serpentine and multi-slide.  The last attraction is a wide slide, from which you can slide the whole crowd - at speed. </p>

    <p>  Family rafting is a descent on a four-seater raft.  And the “Flying Boat” is a glide in double “buns”.  Not many dare to ride on the ride "Black Hole" or fall into the "Space Funnel".  Basically, reviews are noted, queues are lined up for “goodies” and on a multi-slide.  The administration of the water park all the time thinks out what else to amuse its guests with.  So, last year the new Boomerang slide was opened.  Take a break from the surging adrenaline by the large swimming pool with sun loungers and umbrellas. </p>
