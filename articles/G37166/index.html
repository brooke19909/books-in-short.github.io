But how can one calmly study the culture of other countries without fully knowing one's own?  That is why it is worth visiting all corners of beloved Russia.  And one of the most tempting is the Krasnodar Territory, filled with delicious traditional food, ripe fruits and hospitable hosts.  After the memorable Olympic Winter Games, the city of Sochi received undoubted popularity.  This event led to an increase in the already rather big tourist flow in the Krasnodar Territory.  "Azimut Hotel Sochi" 3 stars takes part of this client "river".  What attracts travelers to it? </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  This hotel received a very favorable and convenient location.  "Azimut Hotel Sochi" 3 * address has the following: Adler district, st.  Continental, 6. Finding it is very simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="azimuth hotel sochi 3 address" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/563028.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is located on the second coastline, that is, at a distance of two hundred to a thousand meters from the beach.  In addition, hotel owners of this type often send a daily free shuttle to the sea.  You can not be afraid of this path, it is literally overcome in 7-15 minutes.  But such a small distance has its indisputable plus in the form of the absence of evening and night noise from young and not only companies walking on the coast.  In addition, the close proximity to the Olympic Park and themed entertainment venue on the border with the hotel (and the corresponding stop) pleasantly surprises guests.  Also just 1 kilometer from the Azimuth is the track of the famous Formula 1, which will delight all fans of motor sports.

In many of Russia's largest cities, the Azimuths have already taken their place of honor: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Voronezh, Ufa, Murmansk, Nizhny Novgorod, Kostroma, Siberia, Astrakhan, Vladivostok and Samara.  They all have a neat interior in the same style (the combination of soft white and bright red colors looks very nice), good service and high rating. </p><h2>  Moscow "sister" </h2><p>  One of the most popular sister hotels in Sochi, Azimut, is based in the capital of our country.  This hotel has the highest rating deservedly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="azimuth hotel sochi 3 photos" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/563027.jpg" width="500"></div>  A huge building in the business center of the city in close proximity to Sheremetyevo Airport (half an hour by car), a short distance to the "heart of Moscow" - the Kremlin - won a large number of regular customers.  For whom, by the way, a loyalty program is currently operating throughout the country, giving many interesting special offers on accommodation, participation in preferred promotions, as well as discounts.  Azimut in the capital has a whole club twelfth floor, designed only for especially important guests.  It is delimited from ordinary rooms and is served by its own butler.  It is in this place that they constantly think about their customers (here they are especially treated).  For example, they are offered refreshments throughout the day.  And the floor itself and, accordingly, the rooms are under tight control by the security for greater security.

    <h2>  "Brother" in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  The second-best hotel in the Azimut chain (after its Moscow counterpart) is located in St. Petersburg.  It is divided into two compartments: large (for "everyday" travelers who came to the cultural capital for excursions) and small (for businessmen and business people).  In contrast to the hotel considered above, the type of food here is a breakfast buffet, from which nothing can be taken from the rules of etiquette (but everyone who wants to break them).  The hotel is popular among foreigners, so many Chinese, Germans and French live here.  The rooms in this hotel are very free and stylish.  In addition, a pen and notebook with company logos are included in the minimum package of services. </p><h2>  Room reservation in "Azimuth" </h2><p>  "Azimut Hotel Sochi" 3 * gives its customers the opportunity to independently book rooms.
