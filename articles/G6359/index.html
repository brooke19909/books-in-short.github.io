That is how many vacationers, including Russians, speak of Viva Sharm Hotel 3 *.  Almost all tourists have the same reviews about Ras-um-al-Cid Bay on the coast of Sharm el-Sheikh, where this hotel is located: one of the most beautiful places in Egypt.  It is no coincidence that this region is a favorite when choosing a hotel for vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Viva Sharm Hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/894401.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ras Um El Cid </h2><p>  It is here, along with other hotels, that Viva Sharm Hotel 3 is located. Reviews of holidaymakers suggest that the resort has one of the most beautiful coral reefs on the entire Sharm coast.  Unlike the neighboring Nabq Bay, Ras-um al-Sid does not have a large number of starfish and sea urchins in the water.  Magnificent coral reefs attract divers from all over the world.  Thanks to its incredible beauty of underwater landscapes and the huge variety of underwater marine life, the bay, which has become their favorite place, is of interest to divers. </p><p>  Its name is translated from Arabic as "mother's cape."  Even the famous researcher and scientist Jacques Cousteau, who has seen many wonderful places, once included this region in the list of the top ten around the world.  The coastline of Ras um al-Sid Bay, along which there are many hotels, including Viva Sharm (Egypt), gradually descends to a depth of almost twenty meters.  This creates the most comfortable conditions for divers to watch the diverse life of local marine life.  In some areas, the bottom drops sharply to great depths, so when bathing in the bay, you must constantly remember to be careful. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Near Ras um al Sid is a real wall of gorgon corals.  And in numerous grottoes and caves hiding a variety of marine life.  Here you can meet moray eels, lionfish, groupers and schools of beautiful glass fish.  During a period of strong currents, fishermen catch tropical horse mackerel near the reefs, often meeting large groups of barracudas during fishing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Viva Sharm Hotel 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/894396.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  The visiting card of the bay, in which the Viva Sharm Hotel 3 is located (a photo is taken with almost all tourists who have been here), is a lighthouse.  It is located next to two hotels that occupy leading positions in the top ranking.  These are the four-star Iberotel Club Fanara and the five-star Renaissanse.  The lighthouse is operational, so tourists are not allowed to climb it, however, you can approach the minimum distance to take a picture. </p><p>  The famous El Mercato street is within walking distance of all local hotels.  You can reach her in a maximum of ten minutes.  Many tourists resting in the bay of Ras um al-Cid, in the evenings go on the promenade here.  The street is a piece of civilization, which is full of shops and boutiques.  Most vacationers remember it for its restaurant Fares.  This establishment is known throughout Sharm for its amazing fish delicacies.  Those who stay in hotels located in Ras Um El Sid Bay must visit this restaurant.  Viva Sharm Hotel 4 is no exception. Reviews of Russians vacationing in it indicate that many have not tried such a seafood soup, like here, even in the most expensive restaurants in our capital. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotels in Ras Um El Cid Bay </h2><p>  As you know, most tourists, including our compatriots, come to Egypt to rest precisely because of the Red Sea, its coral reefs and underwater inhabitants.  In general, many first-line hotels in the bay are designed for families with small children.  A good location contributes to this resort relative to the nearest airport.  In just twenty minutes you can drive from Sharm El Sheikh Airport Terminal.  This is a definite plus for family tourists, because after the flight the first thing you want is to get a room as soon as possible to relax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Viva Sharm Hotel 3 pics" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/894398.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An exception to the huge number of hotels designed for a relaxing holiday with children is Renaissanse 5 *.  A large number of steps leads from it to the sea, which is not very convenient for kids and their parents. </p><p>  Over the past few years, more than fifty hotels have been built in the Ras Um El Sid area.  The largest hotel complexes are located directly on the seashore.  Their advantage is their own beaches.  Among the high-level hotels on the peninsula there are such as El Faraana Club, Reef Oasis Beach Resort and others.  Their sandy beaches and excellent access to the sea, as well as the presence of pontoons are very convenient for exploring coral reefs.  Smaller hotels are located mainly in the interior of the peninsula.  This is the second and third lines.  Viva Sharm Hotel 3 is no exception. Guest reviews indicate that even the absence of a private beach does not at all affect the fact that tourists can swim in the sea calmly and comfortably.  Here you can use the urban swimming areas, which are no less comfortable. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Viva <span>Sharm (Sharm</span> El Sheikh) is located five kilometers from Naami Bay.  Its territory, although not very large in area - only twenty thousand square meters, is well landscaped.  Everywhere beautifully trimmed lawns with flowers and dense grass.

    <p>  Some, mostly young people, dance in a nightclub called Le Pasha or listen to music at one of the most iconic waterfront establishments - Hard Rock Cafe. </p><p>  Vacationers are required to vacate their rooms until noon.  When returning electronic keys, they must finally pay for those services that are not included in the tour price.  For convenience, you can close the account in cash or plastic cards.  However, for those who prefer a non-cash type of payment, it is better to first discuss with the administration the possibility of a specific type of payment. </p><p>  In general, the life of the main promenade of the Sharm el-Sheikh resort only calms down only in the wee hours, when pretty tired, but very satisfied tourists drive to hotels, including Viva Sharm. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Hotels located in the bay of Ras um al-Sid, differ not only in remoteness from the sea and starry.  They also have different prices.  Many of those Russians who come to have a rest in Sharm el-Sheikh in the "economy" class stop at three-star options.  Viva Sharm Hotel 3 * is no exception.  Reviews about it, left by our compatriots, indicate that vacationers are completely satisfied not only with affordable prices, but also with a good location. </p><p>  Many thank their tour operators for a wonderful vacation.  Good clean and comfortable rooms, decent food, fun animation, pools ... This is not a complete list of all the advantages of this hotel.  Near one of the pools music is constantly playing and animators are working that will not let you get bored.  The interesting show programs organized in the evenings were remembered by Russians for a long time. </p><p>  Egypt among tour operators is considered a resort state in which hotels are judged not by their stardom.  This approach also applies to Viva Sharm Hotel, which, despite its low category, has recently become very popular among Russians.  It is designed for vacationers who do not make special claims.  Located on the outskirts of Sharm, it has one big plus: here you can calmly and measuredly relax couples and even older people. </p><p>  Our compatriots say a lot of good words about the work of the staff - conscientious and unobtrusive.  Always friendly maids and a receptionist who helps tourists were rated by Russians as the highest.  However, the shortcomings of the hotel found their place in the reviews.  Firstly, it is the remoteness of the main promenade of the resort - Naami Bay, as well as a small area.  But this is not especially true for those who come to Egypt to enjoy the sea and go diving. </p>
