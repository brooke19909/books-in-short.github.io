Guest house (Loo - a small village) to find, however, will not be difficult, since it was built on the main street.  Of course, to overcome the distance from the station to the hotel on foot with suitcases is not the best idea.  You can get to the hotel by any minibus following the main street Loo.  You need to exit at the stop "Mountain air".  Also, many tourists book a transfer at the hotel.  This, of course, is the most convenient way.  But you will have to pay for delivery to the hotel separately.  Of course, you need to arrange a transfer in advance. </p>

    <h2>  Guest House "At Nikitich" (Loo): features of the number of rooms </h2><p>  The rooms in this hotel, according to most guests, are equipped in full accordance with the category of the hotel.  That is, if desired, guests have the opportunity to use a TV and refrigerator.  The hotel also has air conditioning. </p><p>  According to many tourists, the guest house "At Nikiticha" (Loo) offers tourists very good rooms.  Of the positive aspects, vacationers note primarily the cleanliness of rooms and bedding.  This hotel, like most others on the Black Sea coast, is cleaned upon request.  Linen at the hotel is changed once every five days.  Television in the rooms is satellite. </p><p>  Guests of this hotel do not say too well about bathrooms and showers.  The former are often clogged, and secondly, the water does not drain well.  A total of 42 standard rooms are rented at the hotel.  The rooms are designed to accommodate one to three guests (plus one extra bed if necessary).  Each room includes a balcony. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Having your own dining room is also what I received good reviews from guests at the U Nikitich Guest House (Loo).  Description of rooms and infrastructure of this hotel was given by us above.  As for the food in the hotel, tourists generally have only positive reviews about this. </p><p>  Rooms at the Nikiticha Hotel are rented with breakfast, board or half board.  Three meals a day in a hotel costs about 600 rubles per day per person.  The food in the hotel dining room, judging by the reviews of vacationers, is not bad.  The choice of dishes here is quite diverse.  However, many tourists consider the portions themselves too small. </p><p>  In addition to the dining room, the hotel also has a small bar.  Here you can order a variety of drinks.  The guests are served by a friendly elderly woman. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Infrastructure </h2><p>  In addition to quite comfortable rooms, the guest house "At Nikiticha" (Loo) offers its guests a large number of various additional amenities.  So, for example, on-site guests can use free Wi-Fi.  For swimming in the courtyard of the hotel provides a large pool.  The water in it is quite clean and warm.  Therefore, swimming in the hotel pool, according to many guests, is comfortable. </p><p>  For children, the Nikitich Hotel has a small playground.  Adults, if desired, can sit and relax in the gazebo.  Other facilities include karaoke and table tennis.  You can iron the linen in the hotel in a separate room specially equipped for this purpose.  The hotel also has its own small tour desk. </p><h2>  Opinion of tourists about the service </h2><p>  In general, the guests of Loo respond well about the hotel infrastructure.  The only thing, some complaints from tourists are parking.  The hotel is under constant video surveillance.  However, free but unguarded parking is located, unfortunately, not in the courtyard of the hotel, but away from it.  Also, tourists do not leave very good reviews about this hotel due to the lack of an elevator in it. </p>

    <h2>  Beach Hotel "At Nikitich" </h2><p>  To the coastline from this hotel you need to go only about five minutes.  The guest house ‚ÄúU Nikiticha‚Äù (Loo) is not located on a hill.  Therefore, the path to the beach and back is quite convenient.  But many tourists on specialized sites express dissatisfaction with the fact that you need to go to the sea from the hotel along the banks of the local river, into which all the nearby hotels drain sewage.  It smells in its surroundings so it is not too pleasant.  The river flows directly into the Black Sea.  And while no treatment facilities in its mouth is not provided.  All waste is poured directly into the water. </p><p>  This is the place on the sea in Loo is considered the most inappropriate for a beach holiday.  Many tourists report poisoning after bathing in front of the Nikitich Hotel.  The guest house <span>(Loo</span> deserved good <span>reviews of</span> vacationers, including for the pretty clear sea), thus, it is opposite the beach, which is not very convenient for taking water procedures.  However, if desired, guests of this hotel can always go along the beach to the right.  There are no obstacles on the way in this place of the coast.  In this case, you have to go on ordinary pebbles, which is quite convenient. </p><p>  There are no crowds on the coastline in Loo even at the peak of the season.  This is primarily due to the fact that this village is relatively small, and the beaches here are very long and quite wide.  Near the sea in Loo there are also small cafes.  There are not so many of them (they are mainly concentrated in the center - at the pier), but finding a place suitable for lunch or breakfast near the beach will not be difficult. </p>

    <p>  Entrance to the sea on the beaches of Loo is not particularly convenient.  Under the water near the shore there are many rather large stones.  Therefore, swimming should be careful and always in the shales. </p><h2>  Available Attractions </h2><p>  The water park is, of course, the most interesting place that guests of the hotel in U Nikitich Loo can visit.  The guest house (his address is Dekabristov St., 165) is located, in the opinion of most tourists, in a very good place, in terms of attractions.  In addition to the water park, the famous old Loo Temple is located near the hotel. </p><p>  Of course, hotel guests can look at different sights of Sochi.  To go to the city the residents of the guest house are on a minibus.  The train station from the hotel is still quite far away.  It‚Äôs not difficult to get to the stop ‚ÄúMountain Air‚Äù. </p>
