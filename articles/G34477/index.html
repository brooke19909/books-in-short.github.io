    <p>  If you try to understand how the appearance of the iPhone 4 from 4s, it is first seen that a later model continues the version of the iPhone 4s.  The differences are concentrated in the "stuffing" of the phone.  At least twice the processor power, in the later version it is dual-core, which allows the phone to process image files many times faster and better.  In fact, it was after the 4s model that it became possible to talk about major competition even with the latest Android phones. </p><p>  In connection with these changes, it became possible to install a more powerful camera: now the resolution has reached 8 megapixels, compared to 5 megapixels on the iPhone 4. In addition, the manufacturer has equipped the new version with two antennas, which is designed to improve communication in different conditions. </p><p>  The capacity of the hard drive has increased.  That's the difference between <span>iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s:</span> now you can buy a model with a memory capacity of 64 GB, and, of course, there are 16 and 32 GB models, and they will cost less.  The battery capabilities have not remained unchanged.  Now the phone began to work up to 8 hours in the case of working with the 3G protocol and 9 hours - in Wi-Fi mode. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There was a voice control option, it was called Siri.  Another technological innovation is iCloud: it is a system that allows you to synchronize all electronic devices from a Mac and store files in storage on the server.  This is necessary so that in case of data loss, they can be easily restored.  Users liked this option so much that when asked about how iPhone 4 differs from iPhone 4s, many people mentioned iCloud in the first place. </p>

    <p>  Speaking about the modifications of the models, we can recall the debate about how iPhone 3g differs from 3gs.  For those who like to show off with new things, the news that the phones are visually almost identical, and it‚Äôs not written anywhere that this is the iPhone 4s, and not its predecessor, may be disappointing.  By and large, manufacturers simply took into account all the shortcomings of the iPhone 4 model and tried to fix them, simultaneously making other modifications.  The goal was not to improve the appearance, in principle, so you should take the phone as an improved version of the previous model, and not as an independent device. </p><p>  If to summarize, what is the difference between iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s, then it should be recognized that the new phone is significantly better than the previous one in all respects.  Both the performance and the camera became better, and software improvements appeared. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about whether it is worth changing your iPhone 4 to his "brother", you should think about the requirements that the user makes to the phone.  Software update and application release are carried out equally successfully for both versions, there is no talk that the old model will soon cease to be serviced.  It is worth considering whether you are comfortable with the speed of the phone, and whether you need voice control and a better camera.  If you use the phone for its intended purpose more and do not expect graphic power from it, it may well be that you should stay with your old mobile and thereby avoid unnecessary expenses. </p>
