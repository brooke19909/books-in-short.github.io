This is a relatively small island of volcanic origin in the Atlantic Ocean, very popular among tourists who prefer a quiet family vacation, diving. </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  A distinctive feature of the island is that it is narrow, therefore, wherever a tourist finds himself, he will always get to the beach.  And the coast here is mostly sandy with a total length of 340 kilometers. </p><p>  Very few people live on this piece of land compared to all the Canary Islands. </p><p>  The island got its name due to strong winds.  After all, here is a low landscape, with mountains no higher than 1 thousand meters.  Therefore, a huge number of surf lovers come here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itaka.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ithaca Funtifura" class="if uuid-2536890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2536890.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Fuerteventura has a single airport.  It is 7 kilometers from the resort of Castillo Caleta de Fuste.  The distance to the capital of Puerto Del Rosario is slightly less (5 kilometers). </p><p>  Most of the flights are from European Union countries, domestic flights make their way to Madrid and the nearest islands. </p><p>  Most of the tourists of the Russian Federation initially fly to Tenerife, and already from this island they choose a flight to Fuerteventura. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can also get to the island from Madrid, Zurich, Cologne, Pisa (almost from the international airport of any city in the European Union). </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="28.3587436" data-lng="-14.053675999999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/2/2/1/4221.png"></div><h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  Fuerteventura's weather is dry, and the landscape itself even resembles an African one.  Therefore, here you can swim and sunbathe year-round.  The average temperature in July is from +27 degrees, in January it can drop to +17 degrees, but usually in the afternoon +25. </p><p>  The water temperature near the coast of the island is almost always stable, kept at +20 degrees, with a slight deviation up or down about 2 degrees. </p><p>  There is constant wind on the island, but not strong.  There are no clearly defined climatic zones.  The inhabitants have a difficult situation with fresh water, so agriculture does not develop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.senditur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ecological tourism" class="if uuid-2536895" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2536895.jpg"></div><h2>  Cities, resorts and attractions </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of Fuerteventura is the villa of Gustav Winter.  It is located among the rocks, near the village of Kofete and looks very similar to a fortress.  It began to be built only in 1940, and all the dirty work was done by the prisoners of the Tefiya concentration camp. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is the most mysterious structure of the island, which together with the land was purchased from local authorities.  It was assumed that there will be a farm (official version).  However, the construction participants claim that work was carried out on the construction of the runway, there are many cellars and grottoes that go into the rock.  There is a version that near the villa there are underwater caves, which included submarines.  The territory was guarded by dogs. </p><p>  The construction was completed in 1958, then Winter lived here until his last days.  After his death, the descendants tried to reconstruct, but outsiders could only enter the villa in the 90s of the last century.  All the grottoes and basements were walled up, and divers claim that there are no underwater caves near the villa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fischer.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="local beauties" class="if uuid-2536893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2536893.jpg"></div><h2>  City of Puerto Del Rosario </h2><p>  This is the capital of the island, once the city was called Puerto de Cabras, which means ‚ÄúGoat Port‚Äù in Spanish.  Today, goats are a real symbol of the island, there are really a lot of them, even more than people.  The city has all the administrative state institutions, there are many attractions: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  eco-museum "Alcohida", where you can learn a lot of new and interesting about the indigenous inhabitants of these places; </li><li>  Juan Izmail Center for the Arts; </li><li>  Exhibition Hall of the House of Culture; </li><li>  Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario Church; </li><li>  concert hall. </li></ul><p>  In the district of the city there are many ancient churches. </p><h2>  Antigua </h2><p>  According to reviews of Fuerteventura, the town of Antigua is famous for its windmills, perhaps there is no such massive concentration in any place in the world. </p><p>  It is believed that in ancient times, it was the most densely populated area.  In support of this, many archaeological artifacts have been found in the Los Corraletes area.  Arriving in the town, you should definitely visit the fortress of Caleta de Fustes.  It is a vivid example of the architecture of the war of the XVIII century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.surcando.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Puerto del rosario" class="if uuid-2536901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2536901.jpg"></div><h2>  Betancuria </h2><p>  It is believed that this settlement is the main attraction of Fuerteventura.  The town was founded in 1404, when the island was conquered by Jean de Betancourt, and was the capital until 1834. </p><p>  The main attraction of the village is the Temple of Santa Maria, but it was destroyed in 1593 when the Berbers attacked the island.  In the XVII century it was completely reconstructed, some elements have still been preserved since its foundation. </p><p>  The town has a museum of religious art, archeology and ethnography. </p><h2>  La Oliva and Corralejo </h2><p>  This is the northern part of the island where the city of Tidaya is located.  The peculiarity of the region is that there are many natural monuments, namely: </p><ul><li>  the basaltic massif of Montagna de Tindaya; </li><li>  Corralejo Park, with dunes of natural and volcanic origin. </li></ul><p>  Corralejo is the second resort on the island, which receives the most tourists.  And once it was a small fishing port.  There is a ten-meter coastline, well-developed infrastructure and many young people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.summitpost.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Playa barlovento" class="if uuid-2536896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2536896.jpg"></div><h2>  Popular resorts </h2><p>  In addition to Corralejo, the Jandia peninsula, which is separated from the island by a narrow small isthmus, is very popular.  This is the most important resort and main attraction of Fuerteventura.  The peninsula attracts Germans and nudists.  European-class hotels are located here. </p><p>  The most beautiful beach on the peninsula is considered Sotavento.  This is 30 kilometers of gorgeous sand from the city of Morro del Jable to the eastern part of Handi.  In fact, there are three beaches, but there are no borders between them. </p><p>  You can also highlight the resorts Playa de Matorral and Costa Calma.  For lovers of rocky shores, the town of Caleta de Fustes is suitable.  It should also be noted that most of the island is covered with golden sand, and not volcanic - black, as on the island of Tenerife. </p><p>  In the west of the peninsula the most ‚Äúwild‚Äù beach is Cofete, but there is always a strong wind, from 25 m / s.  and higher.  And you can get to the coast only by car. </p><p>  Do not forget that nudism is allowed on the island, so do not be surprised that on the shore you will meet nudity of people, and not at a very young age. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vysnia.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Morro jable" class="if uuid-2536897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2536897.jpg"></div><h2>  Ecological tourism </h2><p>  Fuerteventura sights are also nature reserves, where unique plants grow, live cute animals. </p><p>  Not far from the beaches of Corralejo (2 km) there is a nature reserve - Lobos Island.  About 130 different plants grow here.  In the area, in the ocean, an even more amazing variety represented by vegetation and the inhabitants of the underwater world. </p><p>  A visitor is also recommended to Mount Tindaya (northwest of the island), near the town of La Oliva.  In ancient times, it was considered sacred.  It is low, only 400 meters, but it stands out from the plain landscape of the island.  More than 300 footprints were found on the mountain, which confirms the theory that she was worshiped.  An ecological trail runs along the mountain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.urlaubsguru.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fuerteventura Spain" class="if uuid-2536887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2536887.jpg"></div><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  As you know, vacation in the Canary Islands is an inexpensive pleasure.  However, the island boasts relatively low prices.  Traveling from one end of the island to the other is possible for 70 euros (5000 rubles). </p><p>  Fuerteventura has many hotels with different levels of comfort, there are villas and bungalows.  Therefore, the minimum cost per day is 25 euros (1800 rubles). </p><p>  The simplest and most affordable transport is a scooter, which can be rented for 40 euros per day (2900 rubles).  Of course, there are buses, but they do not go to all parts of the island.  You can also find a car rental for 40 euros (2900 rubles), but you have to try, in general, the cost starts from 70 euros (5000 rubles). </p><p>  The island has a lot of fish and other seafood, because here almost every local resident is a fisherman.  Uniforms often offer potatoes baked in their uniforms.  You can also indulge in authentic Spanish cuisine on the island, such as paella, tortilla and tapas.  According to experienced tourists, a day on food leaves from 5 euros / 360 rubles.  per person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ffuerteventura.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Goat port" class="if uuid-2536899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2536899.jpg"></div><h2>  Island Features </h2><p>  Do not be surprised that on the island you can meet goats and chipmunks more often than people.  If goats are the official symbol of Fuerteventura, then the chipmunk is not official.  Therefore, from the island you can bring a lot of photos of rodents, here they practically do not fear anyone, not even people.  Sometimes chipmunks seem to perceive people as a kind of feeding trough, which is the supplier of all goodies.  They love peanuts, but do not refuse chips. </p><p>  Be sure to bring goat cheese from the island as a souvenir, it is here that it is prepared according to the original recipe. </p>
