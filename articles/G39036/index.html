  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where did the Slavs come from: definition, description and history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Questions about where the Slavs came from, when and where the Slavic people arose, concern people who want to know their roots.  Science studies the ethnogenesis of Slavic tribes, relying on archaeological, linguistic and other discoveries, but does not give an unambiguous answer to many difficult questions.  There are different, sometimes opposing points of view of scientists, but their reliability raises doubts even among the authors themselves due to insufficient source material. </p><h2>  The first information about the Slavs </h2><p>  It is known for certain where the first information about the Slavs came from.  Written evidence of the existence of Slavic tribes dates back to I millennium BC.  These data are credible scientists, as found in sources of Greek, Roman, Byzantine and Arab civilizations, which already had their own written language.  The appearance of the Slavs on the world stage takes place in the V century BC.  e. </p><p>  The modern peoples inhabiting Eastern Europe were once a single community, which is commonly called the Pre-Slavs.  They, in turn, in the II century.  BC  e stood out from an even more ancient Indo-European community.  Because all the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the Slavic group, scientists attribute to this language family. </p><p>  However, for all the similarities of languages ‚Äã‚Äãand culture between the Slavic peoples, there are big differences.  So say anthropologists.  So are we from one tribe? </p><h2>  Where is the habitat of the Slavs? </h2><p>  According to scientists, in ancient times there was a certain community, ethnos.  This people lived in a small area.  But experts cannot call the address of this place, tell humanity where the Slavs came from in the history of European states.  Rather, they cannot agree on this issue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="istoriarusi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic family" class="if uuid-3159809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3159809.jpg"></div><p>  But they are united in that the Slavic peoples took part in the mass migration of the population, which occurred in the world later, in the V-VII centuries, and was called the Great Migration of Peoples.  Slavs settled in three directions: in the south, on the Balkan Peninsula;  in the west, to the rivers Oder and Elba;  in the east, along the East European Plain.  But where from? </p><h2>  The territory of central Europe </h2><p>  On a modern map of Europe you can find a historical area called Galicia.  Today, part of it is located in Poland, and the other in Ukraine.  The name of the region gave scientists the opportunity to assume that the Gauls (Celts) lived here before.  In this case, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe initial residence of the Slavs may be the north of Czechoslovakia. </p><p>  And yet, where did the Slavs come from?  The description of their habitat in the 3rd-4th centuries remains, unfortunately, at the level of hypotheses and theories.  There are almost no sources of information for this time.  Archeology is also not able to shed light on this period of time.  Specialists are trying to see the Slavs in the media of different cultures.  But this is much controversial even for the professionals themselves.  For example, <span>Chernyakhov culture</span> for a long time belonged to the Slavic, and on this basis many scientific conclusions were made.  Now, more and more specialists are inclined to believe that this culture was formed by several ethnic groups with a predominance of Iranians. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="perstni.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Classes of the Slavs" class="if uuid-3159783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3159783.jpg"></div><p>  Scientists have made attempts to determine the place of residence of the Slavs by analyzing their vocabulary.  The most reliable could be the determination of where the Slavs came from, by the names of the trees.  The absence of beech and fir names in the Slavic vocabulary, that is, ignorance of such plants, indicates, according to scientists, possible places for the formation of an ethnic group in northern Ukraine or southern Belarus.  Again, reference is made to the fact that the boundaries of the growth of these trees over many centuries could change. </p><h2>  Great relocation </h2><p>  The Huns, a nomadic warlike tribe moving across the territory of the Far East and Mongolia, for a long time waged war with the Chinese.  Having suffered a crushing defeat in the II century BC, they rushed west.  Their path ran through the populated areas of Central Asia and Kazakhstan.  They engaged in clashes with the tribes inhabiting those places, taking along with them along the way from Mongolia to the Volga peoples of another ethnic group, primarily Ugric and Iranian tribes.  This mass approached Europe, no longer being ethnically homogeneous. </p><p>  The tribal union of the Alans, who lived at that time on the Volga, showed strong resistance to the advancing force.  Also nomadic people, seasoned in battle, they stopped the movement of the Huns, delaying them for two centuries.  However, at the end of the IV century, the Alans were defeated and freed the Huns road to Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Wild warlike tribes crossed the Volga and rushed to the Don, to the habitats of the tribes of Chernyakhov culture, causing horror in them.  On the way, they defeated the country of Alans and Goths, some of which went to the Ciscaucasia, and some rushed west with a mass of victors. </p><h2>  The result of the Hunnic invasion </h2><p>  As a result of this historical event, a significant displacement of the population, a mixture of ethnic groups and the displacement of traditional habitats occurred.  With this change of guidelines, to formulate reliably and briefly, where did the Slavs come from, scientists do not undertake. </p><p>  Most of all, migration affected the steppe and forest-steppe regions.  Presumably, the Slavs who retreated to the east peacefully assimilated the peoples of other tribes, including local Iranians.  The mass of people of complex ethnic composition, fleeing the Huns, in the V century came to the middle Dnieper.  Scientists reinforce this theory by the appearance in these places of a settlement called Kiev, which means ‚Äútown‚Äù in one of the Iranian dialects. </p><p>  Then the Slavs crossed the Dnieper and advanced into the Desna River basin, which was called the Slavic name "Right".  You can try to trace where and how the Slavs appeared in these places, by the names of the rivers.  In the south, the large rivers did not change their name, leaving the old, Iranian names.  The Don is just a river, the Dnieper is a deep river, Russia is a bright river, etc. But in the north-west of Ukraine and almost throughout Belarus, the rivers bear purely Slavic names: Berezina, Teterev, Goryn, etc. Undoubtedly, this evidence of the dwelling in these places of the ancient Slavs.  But to determine where the Slavs came from here, to establish the route of their movement is very difficult.  All assumptions are based on very controversial material. </p><h2>  Expansion of Slavic territory </h2><p>  The Huns were not interested in where the Slavs came from in these parts, and where they were retreating under the pressure of the nomads.  They did not seek to destroy the Slavic tribes, their enemies were the Germans and Iranians.  Taking advantage of the current situation, the Slavs, who had previously occupied a very small territory, significantly expanded their habitat.  Towards the 5th century, the Slavs continue to move west, where they push the Germans further to the Elbe.  At the same time, the Balkans were colonized, where the local tribes of Illyrians, Dalmatians and Thracians were assimilated quite quickly and peacefully.  One can confidently speak of a similar movement of the Slavs in the eastern direction.  This gives some idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhere the Slavs came from on Russian lands, in Ukraine and Belarus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hiztory.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prayer before the battle" class="if uuid-3159819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3159819.jpg"></div><p>  A century later, with the local population of Greeks, Volokhs and Albanians remaining in the Balkans, the Slavs increasingly play a major role in political life.  Now their movement towards Byzantium was directed both from the Balkans and from the lower Danube. </p><p>  There is another opinion of a number of experts who, when asked about where the Slavs came from, briefly answer: ‚ÄúNowhere.  They always lived on the East European Plain. ‚Äù  Like the rest of the theory, this is confirmed by unconvincing arguments. </p><p>  Nevertheless, we will assume that once the united Proto-Slavs were divided into three groups in the 6th-8th centuries: the southern, western and eastern Slavs under the onslaught of the migratory mass of people of a mixed ethnic group.  In the future, their fates will touch and influence each other, but now each branch will have its own history. </p><h2>  The principles of the settlement of Slavs in the east </h2><p>  Starting from the VI-VII centuries, more documentary evidence about the Slavs appears, and therefore more reliable information on which experts work.  Since that time, science knows where the Eastern Slavs came from.  Moving away from the Huns, they populated the territory of Eastern Europe: from Ladoga to the Black Sea coast, from the Carpathian mountains to the Volga region.  Historians count the ranges of thirteen tribes in this territory.  These are the Vyatichi, Radimichi, Polyana, Polochanians, Volhynians, Ilmen Slovenes, Dregovichi, Drevlyans, Ulitsa, Tivertsy, Northerners, Krivichi and Duleby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="istoriarusi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The resettlement of the Slavs" class="if uuid-3159808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3159808.jpg"></div><p>  Where the Eastern Slavs came from on Russian lands can be seen from the settlement map, but I want to pay attention to the specifics of the choice of places of settlement.  Obviously, there were geographical and ethnic principles of resettlement. </p><h2>  Lifestyle of the Eastern Slavs.  Management Issues </h2><p>  In the V-VII centuries, the Slavs still lived in the clan system.  All members of the community were related by consanguinity.  V.O. Klyuchevsky wrote that the clan union rested on two pillars: on the power of the clan foreman and the inseparability of clan property.  Important issues were decided by the national assembly, veche. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hiztory.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Princely court" class="if uuid-3159820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3159820.jpg"></div><p>  Gradually, family relations began to disintegrate, the family becomes the main economic unit.  Neighboring communities are being formed.  Family property included a house, livestock, equipment.  And the meadows, water, forests and land remained the property of the community.  The division into free Slavs and slaves began, which captured captives became. </p><h2>  Slavic squads </h2><p>  With the advent of cities, armed squads appeared.  There were times that they seized power in those settlements that were supposed to protect, and became princes.  There was a merger with tribal power, as well as the stratification of ancient Slavic society, classes were formed, the ruling elite.  Power over time became hereditary. </p><h2>  Classes of the Slavs </h2><p>  The main <span>occupation of the ancient Slavs</span> was agriculture, which over time became more perfect.  Tools improved.  But agrarian labor was not the only one. </p><p>  The inhabitants of the plain raised cattle and poultry.  Much attention was paid to horse breeding.  Horses and oxen were the main draft force. </p><p>  The Slavs were engaged in hunting.  We caught elk, deer, and other game.  There was a hunt for fur animals.  In the warmer months, the Slavs were engaged in flight support.  Honey, wax and other products went for food, and in addition, was appreciated during the exchange.  Gradually, a separate family could already do without the help of the community - so private property was born. </p><p>  Crafts developed, first necessary for conducting business.  Then the possibilities of artisans expanded, they increasingly moved away from agricultural labor.  Masters began to settle in places where it was easier to sell their labor.  These were settlements on trade routes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru-sled.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trade route" class="if uuid-3159814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3159814.jpg"></div><p>  Trade relations were of great importance in the development of ancient Slavic society.  It was in the VIII-IX century that the path "from the Varangians to the Greeks" was born, on the way of which large cities arose.  But he was not the only one.  Slavs mastered other trade routes. </p><h2>  Religion of the Eastern Slavs </h2><p>  Eastern Slavs professed a pagan religion.  They worshiped the power of nature, prayed to many Gods, made sacrifices, and raised idols. </p><div class="photo" data-original="slavculture.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The temple of the gods" class="if uuid-3159800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3159800.jpg"></div><p>  The Slavs believed in brownies, goblin, mermaids.  To protect themselves and their home from evil spirits, they made charms. </p><h2>  Slavic culture </h2><p>  Slavic holidays were also associated with nature.  They celebrated the turn of the sun for the summer, seeing off winter, the meeting of spring.  Observance of traditions and rites was considered mandatory, and some of this has survived to this day. </p><p>  For example, the image of the Snow Maiden, which comes to us during the winter holidays.  But it was not invented by modern authors, but by our ancient ancestors.  Where did the Snow Maiden come from in the pagan culture of the Slavs?  From the northern regions of Russia, where winter amulet figures were built from ice.  The young girl melts with the arrival of heat, but other amulets appear in the house until the next winter. </p>
