Unfortunately, the state does not take enough measures to prevent its destruction, so it is likely that subsequent generations will talk about it as a forever lost historical monument. </p>

    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  Those who are interested in Brandenburg Castle will be curious to find out why the German knights came to these parts. </p><p>  So, it all began in the year 1206, when Pope Innocent the Third issued a bull on the need to Christianize the Prussians, who at that time were pagans.  After 11 years, a crusade was announced for this purpose.  In 1226, the Teutonic Order, to which the pope gave the right to baptize the Prussians, decided to take part in this ‚Äúcharitable cause‚Äù. </p><p>  The German crusaders had long been planning to expand Eastern Europe.  As a result of their actions, the state of the Teutonic Order appeared on the map soon.  The colonization of Prussia was not peaceful, since a significant part of the Prussian leaders conducted active hostilities with the crusaders.  In particular, in 1242-1249.  and in 1249-1260 there were two major uprisings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, many representatives of the local nobility converted to Christianity voluntarily.  For such Prussians, the Teutonic Order provided for a number of privileges, and over time they even began to occupy fairly high steps in the hierarchy of the new state. </p>

    <h2>  Base </h2><p>  It is believed that Brandenburg Castle began to be built in 1266.  A record confirming this date is in the ‚ÄúChronicle of the Land of Prussia‚Äù by a certain Peter from Dusburg.  In addition, the chronicler names the founder of the castle, Margrave of Brandenburg Otto III. </p><p>  There were several reasons for the construction of a new fortified citadel.  In particular, the first Prussian uprising that took place in 1242-1249 showed that the main stronghold of the Teutonic Order in this area - Balga Castle - can be easily blocked by enemies, and the nearest fortress of Lenzenburg did not have a port.  Then the knights began to look for a convenient place for a new castle.  The most convenient, on the basis of safety and transport accessibility, turned out to be the right bank of the Frisching River, not far from its mouth.  It was ideal for the foundation of the port, which was to facilitate the advance of the Teutonic Order inland Prussia.  In addition, after the recent loss of Lenzenburg, Brandenburg could become a link between the capital's Koenigsberg and Balga. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The significance of the castle for Catholic chivalry </h2><p>  Immediately after its founding, Brandenburg became one of the main Comturian castles and remained so until the destruction of the Teutonic Order.  In addition, it was a place of pilgrimage, since in 1322 a Catholic relic, a fragment of the Cross of the Lord on which Jesus was crucified, was delivered and stored there for several centuries.  Another shrine - a particle of the relics of St.  Katarina - was presented to the chapel of the Brandenburg castle by the emperor Karl Six, who thus thanked Komtur Gunther von Hohenstein.  The latter distinguished himself in the course of negotiations with Lithuania, having achieved the conclusion of an agreement on the most favorable conditions for the Teutonic Order. </p><h2>  The heyday of Brandenburg Castle </h2><p>  A powerful fortress was a reliable defense for those who decided to establish a settlement near its walls.  It was home to innkeepers, gardeners, fishermen and artisans.  A school was founded there at the beginning of the 15th century, and by 1425 there were already three mills in the settlement. </p><p>  Despite the defense of the garrison of Brandenburg Castle (Ushakovo), the village, located near its walls, repeatedly suffered from fires.  The most devastating of them occurred during the siege of the castle in 1454, 1456 and 1520. </p>

    <h2>  In the new time </h2><p>  The citadel reached its greatest prosperity in the XVI-XVII centuries.  First of all, this was due to the fact that in 1525 the great master of the Order, Albrecht of Brandenburg, turned him into the duchy of Prussia.  By 1604, at that time quite a lot of people (50 yards) lived in the village at the castle and there were 7 taverns.  In addition, fairs were held there, as Brandenburg was located on a busy road, next to the bay and the navigable river.  It is also known that at the beginning of the XVIII century the King of Prussia was going to give him the status of a city, but then changed his mind.  However, from 1716 to 1736.  the 12th cuirassier regiment was stationed in Brandenburg, which indicates a certain level of development of the city. </p><p>  In the 19th century, Brandenburg Castle, whose photographs of this period, with rare exceptions, were not preserved, had the status of magkfeskep, that is, a village entitled to organize markets.  In 1817, there was a new bridge and a road that improved the already good transport accessibility of the castle. </p><h2>  In the 20th century </h2><p>  By 1900, only pottery, linen and horse fairs were organized in Brandenburg.  The decline of the settlement began after the Eastern Railway was built far from it.  Its laying meant a sharp decrease in traffic along routes passing through Brandenburg. </p><p>  In 1914, the territory of <span>East Prussia</span> turned into an arena of fierce hostilities.  Already in August, Russian troops occupied a significant part of its lands, but Brandenburg remained aloof from the front line. </p><p>  The fate of the castle and the settlement in 1945 was completely different.  Then Brandenburg was in the zone of fierce fighting and medieval buildings were seriously damaged. </p>

    <h2>  After WWII </h2><p>  According to the agreement concluded during the Potsdam Conference, the state of Prussia was liquidated, and its eastern part was divided between the USSR and Poland.  The Soviet Union withdrew the region around the city of Koenigsberg.  It was renamed the Kaliningrad region and included in the RSFSR.  As for Brandenburg, he received the status of a village and began to be called Ushakovo.  The renaming also affected the Frushing River, which has since been called Prokhladnaya. </p><p>  In the second half of the 40s, several families from the eastern regions of the USSR settled in the southeastern outhouse of forburg.  The rest of the premises, not destroyed during the fighting, began to be used as sheds. </p><h2>  Restoration </h2><p>  In 1964, it was decided to explore the castle in order to register it as a historical monument.  However, the corresponding work was not carried out, and no one was engaged in the protection of the structures of the citadel. </p><p>  By the beginning of the 80s, the roof of the southeastern outbuilding was almost destroyed.  Residents began to settle, and the castle was completely abandoned.  The local population took advantage of this situation and began to disassemble it into building materials. </p><p>  Only in 2007, the state of the ruins of the Brandenburg castle again interested the authorities of the Kaliningrad region, and it received the status of a cultural heritage monument of regional significance. </p><p>  In 2010, the Russian Forbes included the Brandenburg Castle in Kaliningrad in the list of 6 attractions of the Russian Federation that are in danger of complete disappearance.  In 2013, a citadel restoration project appeared, but the work was frozen. </p><p>  The restoration of Brandenburg Castle is currently underway. </p>
