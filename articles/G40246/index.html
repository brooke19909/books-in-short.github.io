Reviews of tourists about Barcelona will also be discussed below. </p><h2>  The main areas of the city </h2><p>  Barcelona is Spain‚Äôs second largest city, second only to Madrid in terms of population.  About 1,600,000 people live here.  Officially, the city is divided into 10 districts.  But all tourism infrastructure is concentrated in only three of them.

The Eixample district, where you can see the work of the famous architect Gaudi, is no less interesting for tourists.  The development of the streets of Barcelona took place here in the second half of the 19th century.  The Maujik district is another noteworthy place that attracts tourists, located on the hillsides, which bears the same name.  And for art lovers, travelers recommend in their reviews to visit the Gracia district, where free artists and students live. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="41.38506389999999" data-lng="2.1734034999999494" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/7/0/0/7700.png"></div><p>  Where to stay in Barcelona?

Worthy sections of the coast are on the territory of the city itself.  For example, in reviews, travelers especially praise the beaches of Barseloneta, Sant Sebastia, Nova Icaria and others.  Small settlements can be advised to tourists who love nature and solitude. </p><h2>  Excursion program: museums and main attractions </h2><p>  First of all, Barcelona is famous for its amazing and colorful architecture, because it is not in vain that it is called an open-air museum.  It was here that the famous architect Gaudi created, who created many masterpieces for the city.  At the same time, most of the sights of Barcelona are located in the historical center.  Tourists in the reviews note that this is quite convenient, since they do not have to spend a lot of time on the road. </p><p>  The list of interesting places in Barcelona that are worth visiting can be listed for a very long time.  Each building in the Old Quarter, for example, has its own history.  But still there are significant sights that cannot be missed during the trip.  In reviews, tourists are advised to visit the famous unfinished Sagrada Familia.  Be sure to take a walk along the Gothic quarter, built up with buildings of the XIV-XV centuries.  Nearby is Casa Batllo, built by Gaudi.  In the center, it is worth walking along the pedestrian street of La Ramba and climbing the slope of Mount Mantjuic. </p><p>  A huge number of museums are open in Barcelona.  They are dedicated to the history of the city, the culture of Catalonia, science and even football.  Some of them tell about the life of artists who lived and worked in Barcelona.  So, the most popular museums are Pablo Picasso and Antonio Gaudi. </p><h2>  Sagrada Familia </h2><p>  Many tourists consider the unfinished Sagrada Familia Cathedral the most <span>beautiful place</span> in Barcelona.  Its construction began at the end of the XIX century.  According to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe chief architect Antonio Gaudi, he was to become a unique original temple, unlike any other in the world.  The cathedral was to consist of three facades.  Gaudi wanted to decorate each of them with four towers up to 120 meters high.  The architect considered the Sagrada Familia to be his main work.  He worked on it for more than 40 years, and for some time even lived on its territory in a special cell. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotelarclarambla.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sagrada Familia" class="if uuid-2736580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2736580.jpg"></div><p>  However, the construction of the cathedral has not been completed so far.  However, this does not prevent thousands of tourists from visiting it at any time of the year.  Free of charge, they can admire its external design.  But the entrance fee is charged.  In the reviews, tourists are advised to pay an English-language audio guide at the entrance in order to better study the history and structure of this original cathedral.  Sagrada Familia will be included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.  The government of Barcelona plans to complete the cathedral by 2026, to coincide with its opening on the centenary of the death of Gaudi. </p><h2>  Casa Batllo </h2><p>  Not sure what to see in Barcelona on your own?  Go to the Eixample district, where you can see the most original creations of Antonio Gaudi.  For example, the house of Casa Batllo.  It is also sometimes called the "House of Bones."  It is noteworthy that the original building, built at the end of the 19th century for the Catalan magnate, looked a little different.  It received a unique appearance only in 1906, when Gaudi took up its restructuring.  At first they wanted to demolish the building, but the architect decided to keep it, redoing only two main facades.  A unique feature of this house is the complete absence of straight lines in its design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.safestay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House of Bones" class="if uuid-2736615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2736615.jpg"></div><p>  In the reviews, tourists indicate that this is one of the most original buildings in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãso you need to see it.
