Where can I go in Moscow?  Where can I organize a good rest?  Next, we consider the best options for interesting places both within the capital itself and in the suburbs. </p><h2>  Senezh Lake </h2><p>  Where can I go on vacation in Moscow?  According to most residents of the capital, the ideal option for relaxation is Lake Senezh - a large and very clean reservoir, surrounded by beautiful nature.  This place is a favorite haven of metropolitan fishermen, because it is here that you can catch real eel, the length of which reaches 1 meter, or large crucians. </p><p>  Senezhsky Lake is a reservoir with crystal clear water, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is 8.5 km <sup>2</sup> .  As for its depth, in some places it reaches 6 meters. </p><p>  Senezh Lake is the place that is most actively visited from April to December - in the rest of the year there is complete calm.  In the warmer months, the lake is especially popular, so if you want to visit it, you should pre-book a place for yourself.  This is done by phone number of the administration. </p><p>  Fans of outdoor activities can take the opportunity to ride on catamarans, boats, as well as windsurfing and diving in the water.  An excellent clean beach is equipped on the shore of the lake, on which there is everything that is necessary for a relaxing holiday. </p><p>  Senezhsky Lake is located in the northern part of the Moscow Ring Road, at the entrance to Solnechnogorsk.  In order to catch fish in the lake, you need to get a special permit from the administration, the cost of which is 1,500 rubles.  If you want to rent a room in a hotel located on the shore, you will have to pay 3,000 rubles per day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="--." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where can I go today to Moscow" class="if uuid-3146499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3146499.jpg"></div><h2>  Pilgrim porto </h2><p>  There is a desire to get a walk outside the capital, but do not know where you can go from Moscow?  In the Solnechnogorsk district of the Moscow Region there is the famous Serednyakovo estate, and on its territory there is a unique object - Piligrim Porto - a park created specifically for filming films of various formats. </p><p>  In the comments left by Muscovites, it is quite often noted that the site in question is that place, a stay in which, of course, will appeal to many children. </p><p>  It is worth noting that on the site under consideration you can find objects whose style is characteristic of different eras.  Among these are the scenery of this seaport, taverns, cemeteries and even prisons. </p><p>  The facility under consideration is located 30 km from the capitals, in the village of Firsanovka.  Moreover, you can easily get here by public transport.  The cost of one visit to Piligrim Porto ranges from 50 to 150 rubles, depending on the age of the guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tropki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go for a walk in Moscow in winter" class="if uuid-3146501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3146501.jpg"></div><h2>  Park-Museum "Ethnomir" </h2><p>  Considering those places where you can go with your child in Moscow, you should definitely pay attention to another site, the territory of which is a haven for exhibits showing the features of different peoples of the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Ethnomir complex occupies a large territory - a little over 80 hectares.  It is divided into several park zones, each of which reflects the identity of a particular people.  In particular, it is here that you can familiarize yourself in detail with the features of the life of Indians, Japanese, Australians, Greeks, Italians, etc. </p><p>  On the sites of the park in question it is often possible to become a participant in various master classes.  Guests of the complex note the well-developed infrastructure on its territory, as well as the presence of a large number of catering establishments and hotels, where you can stay for a daily rest. </p><p>  The park-museum in question is located in the direction of the Minsk and Kiev Highways, just over 100 km from the capital.  The cost of visiting the sites is 600 rubles, and for representatives of privileged categories - 450 rubles. </p><h2>  Quarry in Lytkarino </h2><p>  Where in Moscow can I go for a beach holiday?

In 2005, in the Moscow Region, on the territory of the Zhukovsky District of the Kaluga Region, a unique Sparrow Park was opened, visiting which you can admire the unique species of birds, as well as just relax in beautiful nature. </p><p>  Park "Sparrows" is a place in which there are several sites for active and passive recreation, barbecues are installed and there is a place for playing paintball.
