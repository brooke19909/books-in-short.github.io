In this case, do not despair.  Some people prefer to buy smartphones that were previously in use.  However, there is such a thing as a refurbished phone.  There are a lot of such devices, and their cost is much less than the original ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stuff.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="refurbished phones" class="if uuid-2568574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2568574.jpg"></div><h2>  What device is called restored? </h2><p>  Sometimes, buyers return the purchased phone within two weeks.  The reasons for this action can be objective and subjective.  The former should include the presence of marriage, and the latter should include the lack of design, problematic characteristics, and so on.  Therefore, speaking about what a restored telephone means, it should be noted that such devices are so called. </p><p>  Sometimes those smartphones that have been deformed or have lost their working capacity and are subsequently restored to the factory workshop are classified as such.  In this case, spare parts are used only from the manufacturer, and the repair was carried out in special service centers.  Such devices can be called restored. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What does a restored iPhone mean?" class="if uuid-2568577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2568577.jpg"></div><h2>  How to distinguish a restored device from a new one? </h2><p>  It should be noted that it is impossible to distinguish a restored device from the latest one, since they are completely identical.  Therefore, when buying, you need to pay attention to some nuances: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The word ‚Äúrestored‚Äù will be written on the box from the device. </li><li>  You need to check IMEI on the manufacturer‚Äôs website, it will not be activated. </li><li>  Where IMEI, production address and barcode are indicated on the box, the full name of the device will be indicated.  If the additional letters RFB are indicated, then this is a restored telephone. </li><li>  It is advisable to double-check the serial number of the phone and the packaging in which it is sold. </li></ul><p>  You should pay attention to the price.  As a rule, for later models of devices, the discount can be a large amount.  Therefore, the advantage of such a purchase is obvious.  However, an important note: the purchase should be done only in official stores, so as not to purchase a Chinese fake. </p><h2>  Feedback &amp; Warranty </h2><p>  Reviews about the restored phones, Samsung, Apple and others are quite positive.  Outwardly, the devices do not differ from the new models, and in terms of functionality they are not inferior.  This is due to the fact that the recovery process is carried out by the manufacturer. </p><p>  After rebuilding the device, the warranty is issued again.  It is a year or two, depending on the model and manufacturer.  This is a separate advantage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to restore the phone" class="if uuid-2568580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2568580.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Having understood what a restored telephone means, it is important to understand what it is equipped with.  Most manufacturers have a complete set.  If the original new model included a headset, charging, a wire for connecting to a computer, warranty documents and instructions for using the phone, then such a set will also be present in the restored version. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Is it worth it to purchase? </h2><p>  Many are interested in whether such a purchase is worth the money.  What does a restored phone mean is already described in the article, so you should pay attention to the subtleties of the issue.  Some devices are made with a certain defect, which is already eliminated at the factory after the phone arrives on the shelves.  Such a phone will already be considered restored, so it will cost less.  Therefore, you do not need to consider such a used smartphone or something like that. </p><p>  At the moment, in the Russian Federation there are few stores where such devices are sold.  However, overseas sales of refurbished phones are successfully practiced.  In order not to burn out on a purchase, you need to monitor the rating of the buyer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="refurbished samsung phones" class="if uuid-2568582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2568582.jpg"></div><h2>  Buying Tips </h2><p>  <span>What does a refurbished</span> phone <span>mean</span> ?  This is a smartphone that was repaired after purchase by someone and again put into the store in good condition.  The packaging that came with the device always says who restored the gadget.  You need to choose the device that has the Manufacturer Refurbished signature.  It is such devices that are restored at the factories of the original manufacturers, which means that they can guarantee the quality of all the materials used.  At the moment, restored iPhone phones are quite popular.  What does it mean?  The fact that it is more profitable for many buyers to buy a repaired device than to fork out for a new device. </p><p>  Sometimes another inscription flaunts on the boxes: Seller refurbished.  This suggests that the phone was restored by the seller himself.  Therefore, no one guarantees quality.  You need to be extremely careful, since such devices are sold even on large Internet sites. </p><p>  It should be noted that there are now a large number of scammers.  Having wondered whether it is possible to restore the phone, they carry out all the work manually using Chinese parts, and then sell the devices at a high price.  Some sellers even buy batches of repaired appliances and sell as new.  You should not forget that officially on the restored phones a long-term guarantee is provided, therefore it is more profitable to buy from trusted sellers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cdn-images-1.medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="refurbished samsung phones" class="if uuid-2568587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2568587.jpg"></div><h2>  Buying a refurbished iPhone: how to check? </h2><p>  Verification can be done through the company's website and through iTunes.  Let's consider both ways: </p><ul><li>  Website.  You need to look at the smartphone serial number.  You need to use data specifically from the information on the phone, and not from the box.  Next, you should go to the site in the tab "Check eligibility for support."  In the page that opens, enter the code, click ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù.  If the device is activated, then it is not restored. </li><li>  iTunes  Popular scam scheme: fake <span>serial number</span> sewn into unofficial firmware.  You should run the program, connect the phone to the PC and wait until it is fully synchronized.  Next you need to click on the smartphone icon and see its characteristics.  The serial number must match. </li></ul><h2>  How to use? </h2><p>  Refurbished phones work just like new phones.  Therefore, there are no important nuances and operating rules.  All phones, both new and refurbished, must be treated with care and not dropped.  Do not forget about the viruses that are on the Internet. </p>
