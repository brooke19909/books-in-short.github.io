Engineers strive to make it so that the performer does not feel the difference with an acoustic instrument, therefore, as a rule, digital pianos are more expensive than synthesizers, although they are much inferior to them in functionality.  One of the great budget options is the Casio CDP 130 piano. <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="casio cdp 130" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45314/1776785.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mechanics reviews </h2><p>  The first thing you pay attention to when buying a digital piano is the mechanics of the keyboard.  In terms of stiffness, they are divided into weighted, unweighted and half-weighted.  Unweighted keyboards are very soft - such, as a rule, are installed on synthesizers.  Weighted ones are closest to their acoustic counterpart, and it is precisely such a keyboard that is installed in the Casio CDP 130 piano. Many owners note that the sensations during the game are really very realistic.  This is especially important for concert musicians who constantly play acoustic pianos. </p><p>  Quite convenient is the ability to control the sensitivity of the keys, which can be set to one of three levels or disabled at all.  However, for many owners, an unpleasant surprise was the poor lateral stability of the keys, due to which extraneous noise may occur during the game.  This is especially noticeable during sudden jumps and transitions, as well as with large-scale game techniques, but the tool does an excellent job with the school curriculum.  When playing quickly, your fingers may slip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The keys are full-sized, their number also corresponds to a full-fledged piano keyboard (88 keys).  Users note such a drawback as shiny plastic.  Fingerprints remain on the glossy surface of the keyboard, so it must be regularly wiped with an alcohol cloth or a damp cloth. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  For some tones, polyphony is 24 voices.  Digital effects are represented by reverb (parameters - from 1 to 10, it is also possible to completely turn off) and chorus (from 1 to 5 or off).  There are 5 tracks in the instrument's memory to demonstrate the capabilities of tones.  The transpose function allows you to lower or increase the pitch by 12 semitones.  For a convenient game with folk musical instruments and winds, there is the possibility of tuning in the range from 415.5 to 465.9 hertz.  The default is 440 Hz. </p><p>  There is a USB port for connecting to a computer, so the piano can be used as a MIDI keyboard, and the capabilities of the instrument itself increase dramatically.  Casio CDP 130 weighs about 11 kilograms, which is quite a bit for such a tool.  Oval speakers have reduced the total length to 132 cm, so it fits in almost any car and is relatively convenient to carry.  However, it is still better to install it on a stand together, as the case is made of plastic and quite fragile. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When ordering online, it is worth considering that the tool comes in two colors: black and silver.  The model in black has the designation VK and silver in the designation SR. </p>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The Casio CDP 130 digital piano has two built-in 12x6 cm oval speakers with a total power of 16 watts.  Users unanimously acknowledge that this is a lot for built-in acoustics.  The instrument is perfectly audible when playing in an ensemble, without additional sound it can even cover a fairly spacious room (but not a concert hall).  However, if the middle and the top are perfectly represented, the bass does not hold out, especially when choosing the ‚ÄúString‚Äù timbre. </p><p>  The instruments nevertheless sound realistic due to the improved signal processor based on AHL technology.  The performer is offered ten different tones and a 48-voice polyphony, as well as the ability to superimpose two tones on top of each other.  Users note that using this feature to its fullest does not give a limit of 48 notes: Casio CDP 130 does not cope with the load if you play two sounds with fast arpeggiato with the sustain pedal held down. </p>

    <h2>  About features </h2><p>  In their reviews, the owners note the pleasant sound of tones.  There is practically no ‚Äúmidi flavor‚Äù in strings, and if you listen to them separately, you can hear synthetics in the sound, but when playing in a collective this flaw is hidden.  A separate word also requires an electric piano.  Artists speak of this timbre as soft and ‚Äútube‚Äù, it fits almost any style of modern music, which is also important when playing an ensemble.  In addition to all the timbres, there is an organ and harpsichord, often used by many performers. </p><p>  Connecting household headphones suitable for a phone or computer is only possible with the purchase of a special adapter from the jack to the mini-jack.  You can buy it for a price of less than a hundred rubles in each musical instrument or radio electronics store.  They are in many computer stores. </p><p>  By connecting headphones, the performer gets an additional advantage: you can play at any time of the day without disturbing your neighbors at all. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The final price of the Casio CDP 130 depends on the kit. Customer reviews are mixed: someone believes that you can save on a company stand and not pay about four thousand rubles for it, but someone considered it a necessity and bought it right away.  Instead of a proprietary rack, you can use a similar one from any synthesizer, which will reduce costs.  The X-shaped stand is more compact than the branded one, but the tool does not hold tightly on it, so you will have to take care of independently finalizing the mounts. </p><p>  The downside is the lack of the ability to connect a unit with a triple pedal.  Due to the insufficient degree of polyphony, the capabilities of such a pedal will not be shown as well as in a device with 128 voices. </p><p>  The price of this piano in the minimum configuration is not more than 25 thousand rubles, and this is a significant advantage.  A power supply unit, music stand, and sustain pedal are usually supplied with the instrument.  Everything else can be bought separately. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Casio CDP 130 is not without drawbacks, but provides maximum money for its money.  Yes, the manufacturer saved on the quality of plastic, lateral stability and a little on the speaker system, however, buyers got the opportunity to purchase a good compact tool for classes for a feasible amount. </p>
