This problem has become quite relevant recently.  The reason for this is a lot of reasons that we will meet today.  The main thing - do not panic and do not think that the gadget should be thrown away and buy a new one.  Let's find out why the iPhone does not connect to WiFi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone does not connect to wifi" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/857363.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Out of range </h2><p>  Let's start with the most common cause of the problem.  This is nothing more than finding the gadget out of range of the network.  After all, any Wi-Fi has its own radius of "defeat."  It is worth deviating from it - and you can lose the Internet.  Therefore, users note that the iPhone does not connect to WiFi. </p><p>  Fortunately, here you can easily and simply fix everything.  Let's start by getting closer to the Wi-Fi source.  Moreover, so that we are in the zone of "defeat".  After that, you need to turn on the Wi-Fi function on the iPhone, and then find the network to which we will connect.  Remember: if you are in range, you will soon find the corresponding Wi-Fi name.  Click on it and wait a while.  That's all, the problems are solved.  Now you know what to do if the iPhone does not connect to WiFi.  But this is not all possible scenarios.  There are a number of more difficult situations.  And now we will get to know them all. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Wrong data </h2><p>  Does your iPhone not connect to home WiFi?  Then it makes sense to check how accurately and correctly you entered the password for the connection.  This scenario, as you might guess, applies only to secure Wi-Fi networks.  After all, to join them you have to enter a special secret combination, or simply a password. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the iPhone does not connect to wifi" class="if" height="206" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/857364.jpg" width="401"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Here you can get into two positions.  The first is when you yourself own Wi-Fi.  In this case, it is enough to double-check the correctness of the entered data, correct all errors and try to connect again.  After typos are eliminated, everything will work fine.  Well, good.  The second scenario is when you connect to someone else‚Äôs network.  In cases where the owner has given you permission to do this, you can ask him for a password, and then resume attempts to work with the Internet.  In cases when you are trying to secretly connect to someone else's network, you will have to give up attempts.  Anyway, it is very, very difficult to guess the correct password.  That's all, the problems are solved.  Thus, if the iPhone 4S does not connect to WiFi (or any other model of it), you can work a little with the data entered when connecting.  Very often this option works great. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Only not always the situation depends on the password and user login.  More often, people face more serious problems when trying to connect any gadget to Wai-Fay.  Which ones?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><h2>  System crashes </h2><p>  For example, if the iPhone does not connect to WiFi, you can try restarting both gadgets - both the phone and the modem.  Sometimes the cause of this behavior can be the most common system failure.  This is not the most dangerous, but a very unpleasant situation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 5 does not connect to wifi" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/857365.jpg" width="306"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Fortunately, it is eliminated quite easily, quickly and simply.  In truth, if you have problems connecting to the Internet, then it is from this point that you can begin to combat the situation.  Most users, as a rule, do not attach importance to system crashes and reboots.  And in vain.  Sometimes only this move can help you fix a situation in which iPhone 4 does not connect to WiFi (or any other gadget model). </p><p>  But do not think that all the problems will end there.  On the contrary, the most acute and large-scale causes of this kind of behavior are just beginning.  And now we will get to know them, and also learn to deal with the lack of an Internet connection. </p><h2>  Fake </h2><p>  If iPhone 5 does not connect to WiFi (or any other gadget), then try to find out which particular model in front of you is the original or not.  Indeed, very often all the problems of working with equipment arise due to the most common fakes.  And this scenario, to be honest, is very common in the modern world. </p><p>  Here you have two moves.  The first is when you, without knowing it, bought a "pirated" version of the gadget in a regular store.  Then it‚Äôs enough to come there with all the documents confirming the fake purchase, as well as the transaction with the store.  Tell us about your intentions to change the gadget to the original.  After all, that's why the iPhone does not connect to WiFi.  In general, you must replace the gadget.  Only sometimes do workers refuse to do this.  In this case, it will be necessary to scare them with a court, or maybe file a lawsuit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What to do if the iPhone does not connect to wifi" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/857366.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The second scenario is when you consciously bought a fake.  Most of these stores do not provide any guarantees for their equipment.  Therefore, you will either have to take the iPhone in for repair, or replace it with a new one.  In this case, buy original gadgets.  After all, only they can give you real guarantees for their work.  But do not dwell on this point.  We have another option in which the iPhone does not connect to WiFi. </p><h2>  Viruses </h2><p>  Of course, with the development of technology, so-called viruses also began to develop.  Now they apply not only to computers, but also to smartphones.  And it is this type of infection that becomes the source of so many problems with gadgets.  Of course, this applies to those models that work with the network, and also have documents downloaded from sites. </p><p>  In general, it is very easy to diagnose a virus now.  For this, as a rule, there are special anti-virus telephone programs.  It is possible to eliminate this option of events independently, but it is very difficult.  Sometimes such steps are not justified.  If you suspect that the iPhone is not connected to WiFi precisely because of virus attacks, then it is better to take your gadget to professionals and explain the situation.  They, as a rule, will cope with your problem faster and better. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone does not connect to home wifi" class="if" height="206" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/857367.jpg" width="375"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, today we learned with you why the iPhone may not connect to the Internet through the Wi-Fi function.  As you can see, there are a lot of possible scenarios.  And most of them are eliminated much easier than it might seem at first glance. </p><p>  To be honest, if you suspect serious problems with the iPhone, it is best to contact specialists at service centers.  Only there you will be able to provide full assistance. </p>
