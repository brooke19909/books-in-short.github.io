  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jacksonville, Florida: attractions with photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the north-east of the state of Florida in the USA, the city of Jacksonville is located, surpassing all the cities of the country located on the continent in occupied space.  Only in the vast expanses of Alaska can you see larger settlements. </p><p>  A favorable position off the coast of the ocean made Jacksonville in Florida one of the most popular and dynamically developing cities in the country. </p><h2>  City with a huge port </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jacksonville harbor" class="if uuid-3210204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3210204.jpg"></div><p>  The whole history of the village is directly related to river and sea transportation.  In the middle of the 16th century, a small Fort Caroline was founded on this convenient coast by colonists from Europe. </p><p>  Later, in 1859, when Florida had already become part of the United States, the settlement received official city status.  It received its name in honor of Andrew Jackson, who was then the governor of Florida.  And then he became the seventh president of the United States. </p><p>  Already in those years, for the state of Florida, Jacksonville became the largest port through which significant volumes of cotton and timber were transported by a constant stream.  And today, the city‚Äôs deep-sea port remains one of the largest in the south of the country.  In addition to significant commercial traffic and tourist flow, the port provides several military bases nearby.  For example, to the north of the city is the large Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, where combat submarines are based. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, despite such a formidable neighborhood, every year the city is visited by a huge number of tourists, attracted by a pleasant climate, sandy beaches and numerous attractions. </p><h2>  Acquaintance with the city </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.metrojacksonville.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Airport terminal" class="if uuid-3210209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3210209.jpg"></div><p>  Most guests who decide to visit the city on the coast arrive at Jacksonville International Airport in Florida.  Its terminals accept flights from most major cities in the United States and other countries. </p><p>  The airport is 24 kilometers from the city center, so a trip to the coast does not take tourists a lot of time.  If you wish, you can immediately rent a car on the territory and go sightseeing. </p><h2>  Main bridge </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jacksonville Bridge" class="if uuid-3210216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3210216.jpg"></div><p>  When approaching the business center of the city, tourists notice one of the most popular symbols of the city, the bridge that connects the two central areas.  This greatly facilitates the movement around the city, unloading its streets.  In addition to the busy four lanes for cars, the bridge provides safe paths for pedestrians and run along these paths, enjoying the fresh river air and admiring the dawn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The bridge offers stunning views of the city center and the Jacksonville Hotel, a popular tourist destination.  Walking along the bridge, you can go down to the promenade, where restaurants with local cuisine always work.  Even from the city center you can go on a boat trip along the river, admire the surroundings and try to see dolphins, which often swim here. </p><h2>  Museum of Science and History </h2><div class="photo" data-original="thegolfclub.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the museum exhibits" class="if uuid-3210369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3210369.jpg"></div><p>  This museum, which locals call MOSH (Museum Of Science &amp; History), is dedicated to nature, historical events and significant scientific achievements.  On three floors there are exhibits that allow guests to learn about the structure of the human body, the life of the inhabitants of the ocean and the history of the country. </p><p>  Among the exhibits demonstrating the life of underwater animals, a huge life-size whale model stands out.  It is near him that most tourists stop to make a memorable photo from Jacksonville in Florida. </p><p>  The Florida Naturalist's Center has a collection of birds and reptiles that could die without human help.  Here they feel good and are not at all afraid of visitors. </p><p>  More guests are attracted to the ‚ÄúSpace Exhibits Hall‚Äù, where you can see real space suits and equipment that help maintain the life and health of people on the ship. </p><h2>  Zoo and aviary </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mamamelia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="At the city zoo" class="if uuid-3210348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3210348.jpg"></div><p>  Residents of the city of Jacksonville in Florida are not without reason proud of the zoo of the city: on the territory of more than 45 hectares, more than two thousand living inhabitants freely live.  It is believed that the second largest collection of animals in the country is collected here.  Huge enclosures with elephants, many primates, several Malay tigers and, of course, jaguars, whose life and habits are devoted to a whole program. </p><p>  In addition to open-air cages with exotic animals, there is a small contact zoo for children (Children's Play), a botanical garden with a collection of exotic plants, and a huge Bird Aviary, which hosts more than a hundred species of vibrant tropical birds. </p><p>  The zoo is constantly evolving: in 2008, guests were presented with a huge swimming pool, which housed several rare species of stingrays.  And in 2009, an exhibition was opened dedicated to monitor lizards from the island of Komoda.  For giant reptiles, a freshwater pond, large rocks and a real bamboo garden were arranged. </p><h2>  Friendship fountain </h2><div class="photo" data-original="jaxwingquest.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Friendship Fountain at night" class="if uuid-3210350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3210350.jpg"></div><p>  Among the most popular Jacksonville attractions in Florida, the Friendship Fountain, set in the eponymous park, should be named.  Once upon a time, in 1965, immediately after construction, it was considered the largest and most beautiful in America.  However, over the course of several decades, the structure deteriorated and in 2000 the fountain and the park were closed for reconstruction. </p><p>  Construction work continued until 2011, and when the fountain was reopened, the residents were pleasantly amazed.  The jets became much more powerful and higher, at night the water of the fountain was lit in different colors, and musical accompaniment can be ordered additionally. </p><h2>  Jazz festival </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yousense.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Annual jazz festival" class="if uuid-3210351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3210351.jpg"></div><p>  Every year, the city hosts the famous jazz festival, which is considered one of the best in the country.  The best jazz musicians in the world who perform at several venues are invited to perform.  In addition to several private events, admission to all concerts is absolutely free, so the festival is always very crowded. </p><p>  Some of the concerts take place in the central park of the city, the rest in several theaters of the city. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vrbo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jacksonville Beach" class="if uuid-3210353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3210353.jpg"></div><p>  Lovers of relaxation by the water and bright beach parties from all over the country are attracted by beaches in the vicinity of the city.  As elsewhere in Florida, the weather in Jacksonville pleases with stable heat, even in winter there are rarely frosts.  Surprisingly, even in high season there are not very many people on the beaches, so you can safely enjoy your vacation. </p><p>  On windy days, it is a real paradise for lovers of surfing and water sports.  And on warm nights on the city beaches, beach parties so popular in Florida often take place.  Representatives of youth from all over the country gather on the coast to enjoy the participation in them. </p><h2>  Amelia Island </h2><p>  The nature of the Atlantic coast is quite picturesque, and the surroundings of Jacksonville in Florida were no exception.  About an hour's drive from the city is the island of Amelia, which was the base for pirates in the XVII-XVIII centuries.  Since then, much has changed and now it is a quiet place with a series of amazing beaches, hiking trails and winding paths for cyclists. </p><p>  Two national parks are located on the island at once, whose employees monitor wildlife and maintain it in an untouched state.  You can stay here at campsites in the forest or on the coast, fish with the locals and roam the deserted beaches. </p>
