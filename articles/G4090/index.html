Some of them shared their impressions of the time spent.  The houses are quite comfortable and equipped in accordance with the standard requirements of visitors.

Some users did not like the price, which they consider overpriced for such an institution.  This point can be considered controversial, because other users have noted a good combination of cost-quality.  For a family holiday, nightlife can become a problem, when young people want to have fun.  Music plays loudly and sounds are heard in the houses.  Holidays with children can also be a problem due to the characteristics of the estuary.  There are bulk beaches, but the coastal stripes are small.  The entrance to the water is too steep, in a few steps the adult average person will get the liquid to the chest or even the neck.  Stairs to enter the reservoir appeared not so long ago.  Another significant drawback is the presence of snakes in the water, which can be a big barrier for lovers to swim a lot.  The audience cannot be called quiet, although each visitor has his own fenced house. </p><div class="photo" data-original="katalogturbaz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center rainbow taganrog reviews" class="if uuid-2411935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2411935.jpg"></div><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the recreation center "Rainbow" located near Taganrog can be a great place for a weekend trip.  This is notified by all visitors who managed to stay at the institution.  In terms of price and quality, the option is quite acceptable, in the rooms the furniture is not old, care and cleanliness are visible.  In summer, noisy companies can interfere for a quiet family time, but this is not a very significant minus.  Parents should definitely watch the children on the beach and keep them out of the water without supervision.  The choice of rooms will delight visitors with a variety, because here you can settle in low-cost housing or book a lux room.  For most people, the rest left a pleasant impression and the recreation center "Rainbow" is recommended for visiting. </p>
