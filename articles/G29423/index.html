    <h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  It is 40 km from Kamran Airport, and <span>Nha Trang Airport</span> is 32 km away.  Located in the northern part of the city, in an area called Vinh Hai.  All additional information can be clarified on the official website. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  First you need to be in Vietnam, in the city of Nha Trang.

Further from the arrival airport to the hotel can be reached in three ways: </p><ul><li>  Alone on public transport (travel).  This method is highly not recommended for foreign tourists who are in the country for the first time, do not know the language and do not navigate in Nha Trang. </li><li>  Taxi. </li><li>  Transfer from the hotel.  The safest and budget option, the organization of which is worth worrying in advance. </li></ul><p>  It is important for guests to know a few points before deciding whether to use a mode of transport such as a taxi: </p><ol><li>  Most taxi drivers in the country do not know English </li><li>  If there is no counter, it is better not to get into the car, but if there is no other option, then you need to agree on the cost of the trip in advance (with a language barrier, a leaf and a pen will come to the rescue) </li><li>  The cost will directly depend on the size of the machine (the larger the more expensive) </li><li>  Vinasun and some others have GPS navigation. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Seasing Boutique Hotel 3 * (Vietnam): reviews </h2><p>  All tourists note several positive points that they managed to notice during their vacation.  Firstly, this is a convenient location on the city map.  Secondly, at the <span>Seasing Boutique Hotel (Vietnam), some enthusiastic reviews are received by enthusiastic</span> staff who speak several languages ‚Äã‚Äãat the same time (you can use the services of an interpreter if necessary).  Thirdly, families with small children claim that the rest was excellent due to the fact that you can hire a nanny who will monitor the child during the absence of parents.  Little guests are never bored; several playgrounds are installed on the territory of the Seasing Boutique Hotel.  Fourth, they note quality room service and excellent sound insulation.  Foreign tourists recommend eating only at the hotel, since all the products here are always fresh, and the chefs prepare local dishes better than in any cafe and restaurant nearby.  They are advised to try Vietnamese pancakes, Lau soup and GoiBuoi salad.  It is best to settle on the upper floors, from the balconies of these rooms offer the most picturesque views.  For those who smoke, there are specially equipped smoking areas.  It is more profitable to buy souvenir products from merchants in small tents, which are found at almost every step, than in shopping malls.  Important information for tourists: there is a public transport stop near the hotel, 4 km from the railway station and bus station.  The local hospital is 2 km, a pharmacy is 1 km. </p>
