Only 15 years ago it was hard to imagine that a cell phone would turn from a necessary means of communication, accessible only to managers and businessmen, into a toy for a 5-year-old child, without whom no caring mother would send her child for a walk. </p><h2>  Special Call Filter </h2><p>  Each mobile device is equipped with a unique identifier - a SIM card that stores a huge amount of information, with which you can keep in touch with anyone from anywhere in the world.  It often happens that this most important element needs to be restored again.  In this article, we will talk about how to block a Beeline SIM card and set up an unwanted call filter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="block beeline sim card" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16531/349238.jpg" width="244"></div>

    <p>  We can contact any person at the right time by dialing his number from his mobile device.  But what if you want to limit the access of a certain circle of people or one specific person to the opportunity to call you daily?  How to block a sim card?  Beeline, taking care of the peace of its subscribers, provides services for making incoming calls to the black list. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Useful features </h2><p>  How to block a Beeline subscriber?

    <p>  There are some more useful features.  The combination * 110 * 773 # allows you to find out who is already on your blacklist. </p><p>  The alternate entry of these numbers and symbols * 110 * 775 # displays how many times, when during the last day and which of the blocked subscribers called you. </p><h2>  How <span>to transfer money</span> from one phone account to another? </h2><p>  Suddenly the money in your personal account ran out, but nowhere to replenish the balance?  Especially for such unforeseen cases, Beeline provided the service of transferring funds from one account to another.  All you need to do is dial the combination in tone mode: <span>* 145 * phone number, the</span> account of which you intend to top up * amount in rubles #.  Then confirm your actions by entering the received verification code after the combination * 145 *.  In this case, the size of the commission will be 5 rubles, and you will receive a notification about debiting funds from the account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For a long time there are many ways to withdraw money from a mobile phone account, but not all users know about it.  We will analyze one of the fastest and easiest options - how to cash through the Qiwi wallet system.  Note <span>that so</span> far only Beeline, Megafon and MTS provide <span>such a service</span> . </p><p>  To withdraw funds, you need to have a wallet and attach it to your mobile number.  After that, go in and click on the ‚ÄúRecharge‚Äù button.  For Beeline subscribers, the commission charged for the transfer is 5.95%, with a limit of 15 thousand rubles.  For security reasons, corporate numbers are deprived of such a service, nor can you withdraw cash from the starting balance. </p><h2>  How to block a Beeline number? </h2>

Why block your number, and with it the ability to receive calls from loved ones, acquaintances or colleagues?  However, this may come in handy if you do not intend to use the SIM card in the near future from your mobile device, or it is lost.  Blocking a Beeline SIM card is not difficult.

    <p>  To do this yourself, go to your personal account on the official website and follow the instructions.  Or call 8 800 700 0611. At the same time, be prepared to give the passport details of the owner of the contract.  And in the case of registration of a number for an organization - its TIN and legal address.  You can also ask for help at any nearest branch of the Beeline network. </p><p>  In order to subsequently unlock your number, you will need to send an e-mail to the address specified in the contract in the contacts for mobile communications.  Or you need to call 8 800 700 0611, again providing passport data, or contact the salon. </p><h2>  What to do if the SIM card is lost </h2><p>  We have already talked about how to block the Beeline SIM card, now let's figure out what to do in case of its loss.  As a rule, this is done when the phone itself is lost.  Therefore, remember that when buying a new cellular device, you must record its serial number.  Dial the combination * # 06 # and the call key.  The screen should display a 15-digit code.  This combination of numbers is unique for each phone, write it down and keep it in a safe place.  In case of theft, you should call your mobile operator and block the phone, after which, even after changing the SIM card, it will be impossible to turn on the mobile device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to block a beeline number" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16531/349235.jpg?1394212864820" width="600"></div>
