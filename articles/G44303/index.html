    <h2>  Galliot <span>Hotel (Nha Trang) 4 *:</span> reviews of Russian travelers </h2><p>  Many experienced travelers are well aware of the importance of a responsible approach to vacation planning abroad.  In this case, special attention should be paid to the choice of a hotel where you plan to stay for several days or even weeks.  Moreover, even if you consider yourself to be a category of unassuming tourists, you probably still would like to return to a bright, pleasantly decorated and cleanly furnished room every day, sleep in comfortable beds, be able to enjoy the beautiful view from the window and count on an attentive and respectful attitude from the staff.  Therefore, travelers, long before the expected date of travel, begin to collect information about the hotels of the city in which they plan to relax.  An invaluable source, many consider the reviews of those who have already stayed in a particular hotel.  After all, former guests try to share not only the positive aspects of hotel accommodation, but also often mention the shortcomings that they had to face.  This allows you to make a more complete and reliable idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat will await you on vacation.  To save your time and energy, we suggest that you review generalized reviews of Russian travelers who stayed at the Galliot Hotel (Nha Trang) 4 * during their recent vacation in Vietnam.

However, experienced travelers are advised to choose rooms with balconies if possible.  In this case, you can not only admire the surroundings, but also dry clothes here.  To do this, enterprising tourists even bring with them from the house a string, which they pull on the terrace.  If this factor is not critical for you, then you can save a little and book deluxe apartments.  They have large floor-to-ceiling <span>panoramic windows</span> .  The view from them is also excellent.  Also, guests warn those who book the cheapest hotel rooms that they will most likely have tiny windows.  If this is not critical for you, then there will be no problems.  But still, it is advisable to find out in detail about the features of the reserved apartments so as not to experience disappointment upon arrival. </p><p>  The rest of the tourists note that the rooms of the Galliot Hotel 4 *, reviews of which we are considering, are quite spacious, pleasantly decorated, bright.  Furniture and appliances are not new, but everything is in good and working condition.  If something fails, then report it to the reception.  Hotel staff will quickly repair the problem.  Guests considered the availability of wireless Internet access in the rooms to be a big plus.  Moreover, Wi-Fi here has a fairly high connection speed and is free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vietnam galliot hotel 4" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1073296.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, the guests liked that the rooms are cleaned at a convenient time for guests.  For example, when leaving the apartment, you can press the corresponding button near the door.  Be sure that the number will be removed by your return.  As for tips, some travelers say that if you leave 1-2 dollars every one or two days, you will notice how much better cleaning will begin.  However, most of the guests were satisfied with the work of the maids.  Rooms are cleaned and towels are changed every day, but bed linen is updated approximately once a week.  As expenditures, maids replenish supplies of bottled drinking water and personal hygiene products. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Many guests of Galliot <span>Hotel 4 * (Nha Trang,</span> Vietnam) appreciated the attentive attitude towards guests by the hotel administration.  So, for example, if for the period of your stay here you have a significant date - birthday, wedding anniversary, etc., then you can count on a present from Galliot.  True, according to our compatriots, it is advisable to notify the administrator at the reception in advance about such an event.  So, according to the guests, on their birthdays they received a compliment from the hotel in the form of a bottle of wine or champagne, a basket of fruit and a bouquet of flowers (for ladies).  And on the wedding anniversary couples were presented with tasty small cakes with wishes. </p><p>  Also, if necessary, you can always order a transfer from or to the airport.
