  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Informatization of society</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Informatization of society is a system-active process aimed at mastering information as a management resource.  Informatics are used in the further continuation of the progress of civilization. </p><p>  Some authors believe that the informatization of society consists of three related processes: mediation, computerization and intellectualization. </p><p>  Mediation is the improvement of the means of storage, collection and dissemination of information. </p><p>  Computerization is called the improvement of search tools, methods of processing knowledge. </p><p>  Intellectualization is the <span>development of the ability to</span> generate and perceive information.  In other words, the informatization of society at this stage is expressed in increasing the intellectual potential of the population, using, among others, artificial intelligence. </p><p>  According to experts, the entire process of mastering knowledge is often understood as the development <span>of information and communication processes</span> only on the basis of the latest telecommunication and computer technology.  However, the informatization of society in principle should be interpreted as a qualitative improvement, development, as well as radical strengthening using modern means, cognitive (cognitive) <span>social processes</span> and structures.  An integral part of the whole process should be the intellectualization of the population, which significantly contributes to increasing the creative potential of not only the individual, but also the environment of her knowledge. </p><p>  During the discussion at the end of the 80s, the concept of informatization of the Russian state by experts was the main idea.  She consisted, to a greater extent, in the information development of all social structures.  Experts said that the informatization of society is a companion of democratization.  It should be noted that the development of the process of mastering knowledge is objective in the whole world and affects Russia externally.  However, insignificant successes in democratization of the country's population do not contribute to the development of the need to improve the knowledge environment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Defining the role of informatization in the <span>development of society,</span> it should be noted that this process of improving, mastering and applying knowledge is focused on all possible areas of activity of the state, market entity or individual.  At the same time, it is envisaged to use the latest technologies to effectively maintain the functioning of any social, organizational and economic structure. </p><p>  The main task of social informatization is to increase the level of <span>social production,</span> available types of services and products in order to improve the social and economic conditions of the population. </p><p>  At the same time, it is necessary to reduce various types of material, financial, energy and other flows by partially compensating them and replacing them with information flows. </p><p>  To implement the above tasks, appropriate systems are used. </p><p>  Creating an information environment, encompassing services, the social sphere, as well as <span>material production,</span> includes: </p><p>  - the creation of information technology (IT) and technology that can ensure the processing, production and dissemination of knowledge; </p><p>  - development of infrastructure capable of ensuring the development and application of processes and means of improving knowledge acquisition; </p><p>  - production of information, its products. </p><p>  The objects of the process of improving the mastery of knowledge include: </p><p>  - documents, arrays of databases or messages in PC (personal computers); </p><p>  - individually developed technologies; </p><p>  - programming tools; </p><p>  - Networks and IVS (information computing systems). </p>
