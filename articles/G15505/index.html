Famous swindlers and scammers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The 20th century went down in history as a century of fraud and grandiose deceit.  The sale of the Eiffel Tower, financial pyramids, MMMs, robberies, medical quackery - an incomplete list of frauds that shocked humanity.  So, we present to your attention the TOP-10: the most ambitious scams of the century. </p><h2>  10th place.  A duet who can't sing </h2><p>  The rating of the great scams of the 20th century is opened by the popular in the 80-90s.  German pop group Milli Vanilli.  Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan went down in history as a duet who cannot sing. </p><p>  Milli Vanilli is the protege of the famous German producer Frank Farian.  The duo was created in the early 80s of the last century and quickly gained worldwide recognition.  Grandiose shows, performances in the largest cities of Europe, millions of fans - all this has become a reality for former dancers Rob and Faris.  The peak of the duo's popularity was 1990, when Milli Vanilli received the prestigious Grammy Award in the nomination "Best New Artist".  However, soon the activities of the group were interrupted due to a scandal.  During a concert in Bristol (USA), where Rob and Faris sang "live", there was a technical malfunction of the disc on which the phonogram was recorded.  As a result, the phrase from the famous song ‚ÄúGirl You Know It's True‚Äù was repeated many times, and the duo was forced to leave the stage.  It turned out that during their performances, Pilatus and Morvan imitated singing, and the original voices belonged to American vocalists Charles Shaw, Brad Howell and John Davis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  5th place.  Mmm </h2><p>  5th place in the ranking of great scams is the financial pyramid MMM.  Mavrodi Sergey is considered the organizer of the largest scam in the history of Russia.  The structure was founded in 1989 and continued its activities until 1994.  Organizing the MMM, Mavrodi decided to compose the name from the first letters of the names of its founders (Sergei Panteleevich himself, his brother and Olga Melnikova).  Initially, the company was engaged in the sale of computers.  Since 1992, the organization began to issue its own shares, which were sold very rapidly.  Then Mavrodi introduced the so-called MMM tickets.  The price of one ticket was 1/100 shares.  Outwardly, they were similar to Russian rubles, but in the center of the paper was a portrait of Mavrodi himself.  In 1994, there were over 12 million contributors to MMM.  In August 1994, the scandalous founder of the financial pyramid was arrested, and the activities of MMM ceased.  According to various sources, about 10 million investors suffered from the Sergey Mavrodi scam. </p>

    <p>  Financial fraud is one of the main problems of the 20th century.  The structure of Sergey Mavrodi was not only one of the few companies that affected millions of people.  The list of financial pyramids of the XX century you can see below. </p><h2>  The most famous financial pyramids </h2><ul><li>  Pyramid of Dona Branca.  In 1970, Portuguese citizen Donna Branca opened her own bank.  To attract investors, she promised a monthly rate of at least 10% to each client.  Thousands of people from all over the country have entrusted their deposits to the bank.  But in 1984, Don Branca was arrested for fraud, and the grandiose <span>financial pyramid</span> collapsed. </li><li>  The scheme of Lou Perlman.  The resourceful swindler became famous for having sold nearly 300 million dollars in shares of non-existent companies. </li><li>  The Royal European Club is a company created by Hans Schpachtholz and Damara Bertges.  As a result of the activities of the fraudulent organization, thousands of investors from different countries lost about $ 1 billion. </li></ul><h2>  Financial Pyramids XXI </h2><p>  Financial pyramids are not only a problem of the 20th century.  A variety of criminal schemes continue to be implemented so far.  We present to your attention a list of the most famous financial pyramids of the 21st century. </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúDouble Shah‚Äù is a scheme developed by a regular teacher from Pakistan, Saed Shah.  First, he made an advantageous offer to his neighbors, promising to quickly double their investments.  Soon, the pyramid expanded throughout the country.  As a result, Shah managed to lure investors from more than $ 800 million. </li><li>  The Barnard Medoff Pyramid - a major scam organized by an American businessman, is considered one of the biggest financial frauds in history.  As a result of the Medoff Investment Fund, more than 3 million people were deceived.  The damage suffered by investors is estimated at 65 billion dollars. </li></ul><h2>  4th place.  Financial genius Charles Ponzi </h2><p>  4th place in our ranking ‚ÄúThe Most Amazing Scams of the Century‚Äù is occupied by the financial frauds of Charles Ponzi.  Mr. Ponzi is considered one of the largest scammers in US history.  The future financial crook came to the country in 1903.  According to Ponzi himself, in his pocket was "$ 2 and a million dollars of hope."  In 1919, he borrowed $ 200 from a friend and founded his own financial pyramid SXC.  Ponzi offered his investors earnings on the sale and purchase of goods in different countries.  In addition, the fraudster promised his customers 50% of the profit on deposit for 3 months.  The Ponzi scheme began to work successfully.  However, the brilliant plan collapsed when a friend of Charles, who had once lent him money, demanded half of Ponzi's income.  A lengthy trial followed, during which the "financial genius" was declared bankrupt and deported to his homeland.  Charles Ponzi died in Rio de Janeiro, where he was buried for his last 75 dollars. </p>

    <h2>  3rd place.  Wunderkind Cheater </h2><p>  3rd place in the ranking of ‚ÄúThe Most Amazing Scams of the Century‚Äù is occupied by Martin Frenkel‚Äôs fraud.  This man, along with Charles Ponzi, is considered the largest con man in US history.  From childhood, Martin was discredited by the fate of a successful businessman.  The boy graduated from school ahead of time, and then went to university. </p><p>  The ingenious fraudster began his criminal path in 1986, having founded the investment company Creative Partners Fund LP.  As a result, Martin Frenkel managed to lure about $ 1 million from his investors.  A few years later, the con man founded another investment fund and thereby significantly increased his income. </p><p>  A few years later, Frenkel came up with a new scam and began to buy insurance companies in different states. </p><p>  In 1998, a genius fraudster made two very useful acquaintances: with the American ambassador to the USSR and with the famous Catholic priest, father Jacob.  With their help, he organized a charity fund in support of the American church, which, in fact, was another financial pyramid. </p><p>  Mr. Frenkel's activities were suspended only in 2001, when he was arrested and sentenced to 200 years. </p>

    <p>  At the beginning of the XX century, a native of the Czech Republic <span>Victor Lustig</span> settled in Paris.  Here he cranks up a few scams, and then moves to the United States.  In 1925, Lustig returned to Paris.  There, on the pages of one of the newspapers, I read a message that the Eiffel Tower was practically unusable and needed repair or demolition.  This information served as the basis for a new brilliant scam.  Lustig, introducing himself as a French minister, sends telegrams to the richest tycoons in Europe with a proposal to take part in the discussion of the future fate of the main symbol of Paris.  At the same time, it assures them of the need to keep this information secret.  As a result, Victor Lustig sold the right to utilize the Eiffel Tower to Andre Poisson for 50 thousand dollars.  The scandal that followed shortly afterwards was hushed up by the French authorities. </p><p>  Lustig emigrated to the United States, but a few years later he returned to Paris and again sold the Eiffel Tower (this time for 75 thousand dollars). </p>
