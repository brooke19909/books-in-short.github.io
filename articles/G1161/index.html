Of course, <span>this is a DJ.</span>  <span>This</span> word refers to a specialist who plays music files using special technical means.  Due to the popularity of the above profession, many are interested in how much a DJ earns.  We will deal with this issue in more detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="djruffy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do DJs earn on the radio" class="if uuid-2923489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2923489.jpg"></div><h2>  average salary </h2><p>  The income level in this profession, as in most others, varies greatly.  There are famous DJs who can boast of serious fees. </p><p>  However, most musicians in this field begin their careers by playing various tracks at school discos. </p><p>  If a young DJ seriously considers this profession, he begins to work for his popularity.  In the future, his income will greatly depend on the number of performances.  The more often they invite a musician to various parties, the more they manage to earn money. </p><p>  If we talk about the average salary of a DJ, then it is not as high as many expect.  It is about twenty to thirty thousand Russian rubles. </p><h2>  In Moscow </h2><p>  The capital is the most attractive option for DJs.  It is in this city that a huge number of parties take place.  There is every opportunity to learn the profession and gain popularity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, if you know how much DJs earn in Moscow, we can conclude that the numbers differ for the better compared to other Russian cities. </p><p>  For example, even with little experience, you can get into a nightclub with an income of about fifty thousand rubles a month. </p><h2>  Additional income </h2><p>  Even with a permanent job, a DJ can increase his own income.  This is due to additional part-time jobs. </p><p>  Do you know how much a DJ earns per night?  In just one set, which lasts no more than one and a half hours, a musician can earn about seven to eight thousand rubles.  Agree, this is a very good fee for the specified period of work. </p><p>  The salary of a DJ on the radio can be hourly.  The longer the shift, the higher the income.  Usually the rate starts at 500 rubles per hour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="golocall.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much djs earn in moscow" class="if uuid-2923491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2923491.jpg"></div><p>  If the musician has to answer for the musical accompaniment of the wedding, then for an eight-hour shift the newlyweds will have to pay an average of twenty to thirty thousand rubles. </p><p>  In addition to the above-mentioned side jobs, a professional DJ can perform a considerable number of additional services, having income from them.  For example, mixing tracks, audio, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now you know how much DJs earn in clubs.  Also, you will not be surprised by the fact that due to regular part-time jobs you can have a good extra income in excess of salary. </p><h2>  Working conditions </h2><p>  You need to understand that the work of a DJ involves the complete absence of a normalized schedule.  As a rule, you have to work at night. </p><p>  However, if this is a wedding, then a DJ will be needed in the afternoon. </p><p>  In addition, some musicians take additional orders for processing audio files.  They have to perform in their free time. </p><p>  DJs, who often have to tour, must be prepared for the need to constantly change their location.  Each time you have to reinstall the equipment and perform other additional settings.  This is not always convenient. </p><p>  You need to understand that working as a DJ is not as simple as it might seem.  That is why you need to be prepared for various difficulties.  It is especially difficult for novice musicians who have no connections.  Often DJs are used in clubs, almost for free.  Because of their precarious situation, they are afraid of losing their jobs, so they agree to unfavorable conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much dj earns per night" class="if uuid-2923492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2923492.jpg"></div><h2>  Career </h2><p>  The profession of DJ allows anyone who wants to succeed, if only he is ready to make enough of his own efforts and be industrious.  In addition, such a musical specialty is considered quite prestigious.  However, only promoted and popular people can count on a high salary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  High fees await those DJs who regularly organize tours.  If there are no speeches, then you should not count on high incomes. </p><p>  How much a DJ earns is greatly influenced by the number of useful contacts.  For example, at the very beginning of a career, specialists have to work for a symbolic fee or completely free of charge.  This allows a beginner DJ to make acquaintances and contacts, earn a name for himself and gain popularity at least within his city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do DJs earn in clubs" class="if uuid-2923493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2923493.jpg"></div><h2>  How to learn a profession? </h2><p>  Those who are attracted by the salary of a DJ in Moscow are interested in where to start.  Perhaps for some it will come as a surprise to the fact that education is not important for this musician.  However, this does not mean that special training can be neglected. </p><p>  The bottom line is that a DJ does not need to master the theory, but practice every skill in practice.  Some graduate from specialized courses, someone turns to friends who are already employed in this profession.  DJs will learn all the secrets and subtleties in practice, so you should start it as soon as possible. </p><h2>  What does income depend on? </h2><p>  As you already understood, DJ fees can vary greatly.  What affects their income?  If you put aside the popular representatives of this profession, the event at which you are going to speak is almost a decisive factor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="welcometoibiza.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DJ salary on the radio" class="if uuid-2923494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2923494.jpg"></div><p>  What are the options? </p><ul><li>  Night club.  This is precisely the widest segment in which almost any DJ will find application.  The average rate per night starts with just a thousand rubles and increases as the DJ's popularity increases.  Professional musicians earn twelve to fifteen thousand a night.  A tip from visitors and a bonus from the owners of the establishment are also possible. </li><li>  Radio.  On average, a shift lasts three to four hours or six to eight.  In this case, the salary is calculated for every hour.  How much do DJs earn on radio?  The basic rate is four hundred to five hundred rubles.  These figures can already be called attractive if we compare the fees of DJs with the average Russian salaries. </li><li>  Weddings and other special occasions.  Such orders become an additional side job for most DJs.  You will have to work for several hours in a row, but the final fee may be ten thousand rubles or more. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="news.djcity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DJ salary in the club" class="if uuid-2923495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2923495.jpg"></div><h2>  pros </h2><p>  Seriously considering this profession as the main occupation, you need to be interested not only in the level of income.  Indeed, over time, even the highest salary of a DJ may seem like an unworthy reward for his own work. </p><p>  There are pros and cons to this profession.  First, discuss the benefits. </p><ul><li>  Early start.  You can learn from experience how much a DJ earns, at the age of sixteen-seventeen.  It is at this age that musicians can start a career.  At first they will be expected at school and student discos.  Over time, you can become a club star. </li><li>  Lack of age requirements.  This applies not only to young young people, but also to more adult representatives of the profession.  It's never too late to become a musician if you are attracted to the salary of a DJ in a club. </li><li>  The ability to travel.  If a specialist is invited to tour, he has a great prospect of going around many countries.  Moreover, such trips will occur during working hours, and it is possible that due to the inviting party. </li><li>  New acquaintances.  Work as a DJ involves a huge amount of communication.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the DJ gradually acquires various acquaintances. </li><li>  Exciting work.  For those who are interested in music, it is not so important how much a DJ earns.  After all, the prospect of doing their favorite thing, which brings both pleasure and income at the same time, is much more attractive to them. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="wwd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DJ salary" class="if uuid-2923496" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2923496.jpg"></div><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Probably no profession can be perfect.  DJ is no exception. </p><ul><li>  Inconvenient schedule.  Usually DJs perform at night parties.  This imposes certain nuances on the lifestyle. </li><li>  Loud music.  As you know, high volume negatively affects your hearing.  A DJ often has to work in such conditions, so over time he may begin to notice a negative effect on his own health. </li><li>  Expensive equipment.  Good musical equipment that a DJ needs is worth a lot of money.  A bad one will not allow you to organize high-quality sound of music.  At the same time, you need to understand that club visitors can damage equipment.  Owners of institutions are not always ready to compensate for repairs. </li></ul><h2>  How much do DJs pay? </h2><p>  Of course, everyone has heard about the fabulous fees of world famous musicians.  However, you need to understand that there is a huge gap between the incomes of such a pro and a beginner DJ.  The latter have a long time to build a reputation and promote their own brand.  Therefore, at least the first time will have to agree to not the most favorable conditions, working almost for food. </p><p>  DJs from Moscow and St. Petersburg have some advantage.  It‚Äôs easier for them to arrange tours with the directors of provincial clubs than for local musicians.  The latter, incidentally, are not at all sweet. </p><p>  On average, a provincial DJ is paid about a thousand rubles per night.  It would seem that for a month it is quite possible to get at least an average salary.  However, you need to understand that work only happens on weekends.  And that is not always the case.  Therefore, the amount of potential earnings is significantly reduced by reducing the number of working days. </p><h2>  Competition </h2><p>  You need to understand that, as in any other profession, you have to fight for your own place under the sun.  New DJs have a long time to gain popularity, make useful contacts and contacts, competing with more experienced and well-known colleagues. </p><p>  Now a huge number of people want to become DJs.  At the same time, there are not so many worthy sites.  On the issue of competition, it is especially difficult for musicians from large cities.  However, to some extent this is offset by the high demand for their services. </p><p>  In provincial cities, there is little competition among DJs.  However, the need for their services is low.  Beginner musician and it will be difficult to break through.  Therefore, it is desirable to have an additional source of income until the profession of a DJ begins to bring a steady income. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Among representatives of many professions there is no consensus on their own activities.  DJs are no exception. </p><p>  The reviews of those who managed to get along pretty well are mostly positive.  Creative work enables self-realization and brings moral satisfaction.  In addition, such a lesson is adequately paid. </p><p>  However, there are opposing reviews.  Those who failed to gain a foothold in the profession were not satisfied.  After all, a non-promoted DJ can earn only an average salary. </p><h2>  Is it worth it? </h2><p>  Learning about the fantastic fees of world-famous DJs, many begin to envy and decide to master such a profession.  However, they are very disappointed to learn that a beginner DJ has to work for a small fee.  In addition, further promotion and promotion require enormous time and financial costs.  As practice shows, not everyone is ready for this. </p><p>  In addition, you need to be realistic and understand that behind each popular DJ is a team of professionals, in which each of its members performs its own functions.  Someone is engaged in marketing, someone negotiates with customers, etc. As a result, all this gives a result that others envy. </p><p>  That's why, finding out what salaries DJs have, one should not give up everything and go to learn this profession.  On the way to high fees, you will have to go through the thorns.  First decide if you are ready for this.  If high fees are the only thing that drives you, it is likely that you will be disappointed in the profession of a DJ.  Some come into this profession at a young age, but few remain in it. </p>
