From the very beginning, this project was conceived as a breakthrough thanks to the use of foreign technologies and the capacities of Soviet industry. </p><h2><br>  The state of the industry on the eve of World War II </h2><p>  In the 30s of the XX century, tank building rapidly developed around the world.  It was a relatively new industry in the military industry, and states invested a lot of money in promising developments.  The USSR did not stand aside, where against the background of unfolding industrialization, domestic tanks were created from scratch.  In that decade, the T-26 took a leading position among the light class.  It was a great way to support infantry on the battlefield. </p><p>  However, very soon, the armies of developed countries acquired cheap anti-tank artillery.  The Soviet designers set a goal to create a machine that could effectively defend themselves against new types of weapons.  The military noted that the main drawbacks of the existing tank are insufficient engine power, overloaded suspension and low mobility during hostilities. </p><p>  Active actions to create new prototypes also began due to the fact that almost the entire old command of the Red Army was repressed in the late 30s.  Young cadres wanted to take the initiative wherever possible. </p><p>  In addition, the <span>Soviet-Finnish war began,</span> which once again showed that the old bulletproof armor could not withstand artillery strikes.  An important modernization project was entrusted to the design bureau under the direction of Semyon Ginzburg.  His team already had considerable experience in this field. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The influence of foreign tanks </h2><p>  At first, the specialists decided to tackle the T-26 modification.  In particular, the designers changed the suspension of prototypes in the likeness of those used on Czech tanks Skoda (model LT vz. 35).  Then the Soviet government planned to buy this equipment, but in the end revised its decision. </p><p>  Another model that influenced the technical solutions of domestic experts was the German PzKpfw III.  One such tank was accidentally received by the Red Army as a military trophy during the Polish campaign in 1939.  After that, another copy was officially obtained from the Wehrmacht in agreement with the government of the Third Reich.  The machine was more maneuverable and reliable compared to Soviet models.  The authorities in the person of Voroshilov received notes that it was useful to use these technologies when developing new items in the Red Army. </p><p>  It was not yet a T-50 tank, but many of the ideas implemented then, as a result, became an integral part of the new machine. </p>

    <h2>  Production </h2><p>  War was approaching.  At this time, German cars already triumphantly traveled around France.  Final decisions on the design that the T-50 light tank will receive were made already in 1941. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The Council of People's Commissars</span> issued a decree according to which the production of the new model was to begin in July.  However, war broke out, and plans had to be hurriedly changed. </p><p>  Leningrad Plant No. 174, which was supposed to start mass production of the new model, was hastily evacuated to the rear.  The ordeals of specialists and great organizational difficulties associated with starting work in unprepared conditions led to the fact that the production of the T-50 ended in the spring of 1942.  Mass product failed. </p><h2>  Rarity </h2><p>  Unlike other well-known and widespread vehicles of this series, the T-50 tank was sold in a small number of copies.  Experts agree on an approximate figure of 75 finished pieces off the assembly line. </p><p>  And, despite its rarity, this model was recognized as one of the most efficient and best in its class due to the combination of various characteristics. </p>

    <h2>  Using </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the manufacturer was initially located in Leningrad, the Soviet T-50 tank was used mainly on the north-western front.  Some specimens fell on the Karelian Isthmus, where there were fights with Finnish units.  Memoirs of war veterans that the Soviet light tank T-50 were used during the battles near Moscow during the most difficult period of the war have been preserved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Due to the confusion at the beginning of the conflict, it was not possible to create a clear system for the supply of cars on a specific route.  Most often, the decision for each tank was made individually.  Some of them went to the training of personnel, others immediately went into battle to replace the outdated T-26.  Therefore, often the ‚Äúfifties‚Äù had to act together with other models. </p><p>  Since the machines were used in battles immediately after they were shipped from the factories, many elements of their structures had to be modified on the go.  For example, the first operation near Leningrad showed that the engine starting system requires some refinement. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  The production of T-50 tanks was carried out according to the classical scheme, when each part was created separately, and the assembly of the finished machine went from bow to stern.  Externally, the model was very similar to the famous 34 series due to the same angles of inclination of the hull and tower. </p><p>  The characteristics of the tanks were designed for four crew members.  Three of them were in a special tower.  It was a commander, loader and gunner.  The driver was separately in the control compartment, which was slightly off to the side on the port side.  The gunner was located to the left of the gun, while the loader was sitting on the right side.  The commander was in the rear compartment of the tower. </p><h2>  Armament </h2><p>  The T-50 tank received a semi-automatic rifled gun.  It was developed back in the 30s and, with minor changes, was accepted as an integral part of the new machine.  Two machine guns were mated to the cannon, which could be easily removed as needed and used separately from the <span>tank</span> design <span>.</span>  <span>The firing range of the</span> projectile could reach 4 kilometers.  The mechanisms responsible for the tip were controlled using a manual drive.  Standard ammunition consisted of 150 shells.  The rate of fire of the car ranged from 4 to 7 rounds per minute, depending on the skill of the crew.  Machine guns were equipped with 64 disks, in which there were about 4 thousand rounds. </p>

    <h2>  Chassis </h2><p>  The engine of the tank was based on a six-cylinder diesel device.  Its power was 300 horsepower.  Depending on the situation on the battlefield, the crew could resort to various methods of starting the machine.  First, a manual starter was available.  Secondly, air tanks worked that started the engine using compressed air. </p><p>  Fuel tanks had a volume of 350 liters of fuel.  According to calculations, this was enough to cover 340 kilometers on a good road.  Part of the tanks was located in the fighting compartment, another part - in the transmission. </p><p>  Specialists argued for a long time about the device of this part of the machine.  Finally, it was decided to install a mechanical transmission from a double-disc clutch, a four-speed gearbox and two final drives. </p><p>  For each of the road wheels, its own suspension was created.  Steel tracks consisted of small links and had open metal hinges.  They were supported by three small rollers. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Despite little use, the personnel who worked with this tank noted its positive qualities compared to other domestic equipment.  For example, the high reliability of the transmission and suspension was praised.  The last of them generally had a structure innovative for Soviet industry. </p><p>  Prior to this, the crews often complained about excessive crowding and inconvenience inside the cabin.  Ergonomics problems were resolved after the design of German cars was taken as the basis.  This made it possible to give each crew all the conditions for effective work on the battlefield, which would not be violated in the face of inconvenience inside the cockpit. </p><p>  Soviet WWII tanks often suffered from poor visibility, which the crew had to put up with.  The T-50 was devoid of this drawback.  Compared to its predecessor models, the ‚Äúfifty‚Äù was more dynamic and maneuverable in battle due to its light weight and elimination of unnecessary ballast.  Higher was the engine power. </p><p>  At the beginning of the war, the most common German anti-tank guns were 37-millimeter guns.  The armor that the T-50 was equipped with, without any problems coped with this threat.  Its reliability indicators approached the values ‚Äã‚Äãof medium tanks due to additional cementing. </p>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  It was believed that the main drawback of the T-50 is its armament.  The 45-millimeter cannon was no longer effective against field fortifications and enemy equipment. </p><p>  The problem was the quality of the shells.  With proper production, they could cause significant damage, but the devastation of the first year of the war led to factories producing unsatisfactory products.  This happened partly due to a lack of equipment and components, and partly from the use of unprofessional personnel, including civilians. </p><p>  Only at the end of 1941 was a new shell developed, over the creation of which the Hartz design bureau worked.  After that, the problem was resolved.  But by that time, the release of the tanks themselves had practically stopped. </p><p>  Soviet industry failed to establish regular production of the T-50.  A niche has formed.  It was filled with tanks of the T-34 model, despite the high cost.  But the 50 model remained a guide for designers when creating new prototypes of technology. </p><h2>  Surviving instances </h2><p>  To date, only three T-50s have survived.  However, none of them are suitable for operation.  The Museum of Tanks in Kubinka has two copies. </p><p>  Another surviving car was in Finland.  The army of this country captured it during the war.  The Tank Museum in Password still shows this T-50. </p>
