  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the midbrain?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many people know that the brain is divided into the right and left hemispheres.  However, most do not even assume that we also have a midbrain.  What it is? </p><p>  The midbrain is the smallest part of our hypothalamus, however it is no less important than the hemispheres themselves.  Why?  The fact is that this particular part of the brain is responsible for the fact that we can walk and also stand.  <span>Muscle tone</span> also depends on how well our midbrain works. </p><p>  So what does it consist of?  The structure is quite straightforward - it's just 2 elements: a cover and legs.  By the way, covers are also subcortical visual centers.  The Latin term for the midbrain sounds like mesencephalon.  The department itself comes from the brain bladder, which is the third in a row.  By the way, the location of the midbrain is the base of the skull.  Consequently, the midbrain has a place to be in the middle cranial fossa, and more specifically, in the middle of it.  In simple words: the midbrain is located at the very back of our head, between the right and left hemispheres.  In the nuclei of the midbrain are nerves that are responsible for switching impulses of vision from one object to another. </p><p>  Naturally, all parts <span>of the brain,</span> which are much larger than we can imagine, work in interaction with each other.  Naturally, the midbrain is controlled by the cerebral cortex - this is the center.  However, any minor malfunctions in the work of this small department can lead to the fact that a person will lose motor function.  And this is a disability. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many are interested in the question of what are the age characteristics of the midbrain?  We will answer that they are not very different from the features of this kind of the whole brain as a whole.  However, it is worth considering the issue in particular.  The midbrain consists of legs, which, with strong shocks, concussions, can dysfunction.  With <span>age, the</span> midbrain can gradually lose contact with the head center, which can lead to the fact that the person‚Äôs movement will be difficult.  By the way, complete paralysis - this is the result of damage to the midbrain.  Another complication that can cause malfunctions in the midbrain is <span>Parkinson's disease.</span> </p><p>  In general, all departments are so interconnected with each other that they have almost the same <span>age characteristics.</span>  The midbrain in children, just born, has a wider wire than in adults.  By the way, all the ways that are otherwise called conducting, in newborns are covered with special shells.  But the pigmentation itself in the midbrain stops completely when a person turns 16 years old.  The midbrain is finally being formed at this point.  Naturally, these time frames are individual for each person, we have given only the average statistical age. </p><p>  What can be done to make the brain work well, or rather, all its departments functioned properly in their uninterrupted relationship?  Firstly, in the literal sense of the word, you need to take care of your head.  Try not to fall upside down, not to hit - a concussion of any kind cannot be completely cured and leaves its marks on the work and functions of the main organ of a person.  No bumps and falls - try to protect yourself from this.  Second precaution: ensure yourself regular rest.  Do not overwork the brain cells, let the body relax for at least a few minutes a day.  Ensure a healthy 8-hour sleep.  This is important if you want your midbrain to never let you down.  And the main precaution: limit yourself from stress and strong feelings.  All this can lead to hemorrhage in the brain, so try to control your emotions, especially in old age.  After all, even doctors say that the main thing for health is that the brain works well, and everything else is fixable. </p>
