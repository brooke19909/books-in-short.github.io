    <p>  Izmir is a living monument of architecture, a museum and just a very beautiful city.  Turkey has repeatedly come under the power of other powers that have left their mark on its lands.  The historical part of this city is a mountainous region in which the first buildings appeared more than 3,000 years ago.  According to legend, the first ruler in this territory was Queen Smyrna, in whose honor the city received its first name.  Since it was located on the coast of the <span>Aegean Sea, a</span> lot of locals connected with their Greek neighbors, who left their mark on its history.  Smyrna was repeatedly destroyed, but each time the city was rebuilt, and so it survived to this day, and began to be called Izmir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="izmir turkey reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/274275.jpg" width="600"></div>

Getting on the Aegean coast, they get silence, and picturesque nature, and a warm climate.  The main ‚Äúfeature‚Äù of the resort is the local port, where yachts, small boats and <span>jet skis</span> are rented at affordable prices <span>.</span>  Therefore, getting into such a paradise, do not forget to rent a boat you like for a day and take a ride on the sea.  If you cut through the sea at night, you will discover a new, mysterious and incredibly beautiful night Izmir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="resorts izmir turkey" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/274274.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Turkey is also a museum country, which has preserved many architectural monuments and other attractions.  You can inspect them endlessly.  In Izmir, the Velvet Castle deserves special attention, which, according to legend, was the first building on these lands.  It is located on the top of Pagos Hill, and from its balconies overlooks the entire bay and the buildings that have been erected here for centuries.  And on Konak Meydana Square, the very heart of the city is located, which, incidentally, is very young - it is a chapel tower that was built here in 1901, taking into account all the canons of the Ottoman style. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, every tourist is primarily interested in the resorts of Izmir.  Turkey, in particular that part of it that is washed by the Aegean Sea, is very different from the part that is adjacent to the Mediterranean.  There is always calm and quiet, fewer people, and the service and maintenance at the same time at a high level.  City beaches are equipped with sun loungers and awnings, and those that are away from the settlement are surrounded by green shrubs and tropical plants.  This region is characterized by white sandy beaches that stretch in a wide strip along a quiet and shallow sea.  That is why Izmir is an ideal city for families with children. </p><p>  <span>Turkey, reviews</span> of which I sometimes want to write in poetry, is undoubtedly an inexhaustible source of joy and pleasure.  Here an avid historian-archaeologist and a lover of loafing will find joy. </p>
