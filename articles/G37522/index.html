And if the islands of Greece are meant by uncharted islands, it is almost impossible to resist.  After all, the Greek land has long been fanned by myths and poetic legends that have been known to us since childhood and are real pearls in the treasury of world culture.  The nature of Greece is as unique as its history - the sea coast with sandy beaches, southern flora and fauna, replete with bright colors, annually attracting countless crowds of tourists. </p>

    <p>  The most famous islands of Greece are Crete, Corfu and Rhodes.  After the legendary Crete, considered the cradle of the god Zeus himself, the most interesting for tourists, the <span>island of Rhodes</span> is rightfully considered <span>.</span>  According to legend, Rhodes was donated by Zeus to the solar god Helios, in honor of which the famous statue of the Colossus of Rhodes was erected on the island.  The statue, which had an unprecedented height at that time of about 37 meters, served simultaneously as a beacon for ships sailing to the island.  Due to the imperfection of its design, the <span>Colossus of Rhodes</span> did not exist for long, just over half a century and was destroyed by a strong earthquake.  Despite this, the giant statue was included in the list of seven wonders of the world. </p><p>  Rhodes is an island with a turbulent history, which is captured in a variety of public and residential buildings.  Moreover, numerous architectural monuments of different eras, perfectly harmoniously flow into the modern, fashionable areas of Rhodes.  A striking example of such a combination is the capital of Rhodes, with the same name, located in the north of the island.  The city of Rhodes, as tourists see it now, consists of two, simultaneously existing worlds. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first world is a fabulous and mysterious city of the Middle Ages, surrounded by powerful fortress walls.  The huge gates leading to the fortress are distinguished by two symmetrically located watch towers.  The main street, bearing the name of the Knights of St. John, leads directly to the steps of the palace of the Grand <span>Masters of this</span> order.  The interiors of the palace are striking in their beauty and luxury of decoration, a large number of carvings, as well as <span>fortifications</span> and underground warehouses, typical of many buildings of that time. </p><p>  And the other world is a multifunctional resort city, providing tourists with the widest selection of places of cultural recreation and entertainment.  Like other <span>islands of Greece, the island of Rhodes</span> has an extensive network of tourist hotels of various levels, shops, a large number of restaurants, bars, night and day clubs, discos and casinos. </p>

    <p>  For those who prefer a noisy entertainment of calm relaxation and contemplation of the beauties of nature, Zakynthos Island located in the Ionian Sea is best suited.  This is one of the most beautiful places on earth, amazing the combination of white cliffs with numerous grottoes and caves, emerald greenery, sandy beaches and bright blue sea.  The beaches of Zakynthos deserve special attention.  The local administration has created all the conditions for a good rest on the water.  Those who prefer an active lifestyle can go in for water sports or devote their day to boating and swimming.  And for those who like to combine business with pleasure, there are various excursion routes.  These include a boat trip to the Blue Caves - the main attraction of Zakynthos.  Blue caves formed <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãwaves,</span> which year after year hit the coastal cliffs. </p>

    <p>  Of course, the islands of Greece can be described indefinitely, as long as you can visit them.  However, reading is unlikely to replace the real sensations from past events, because it is not for nothing that the famous proverb says that it is better to see once than hear a hundred times. </p>
