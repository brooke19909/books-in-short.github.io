They were woven into hair, made from them wreaths and brooches.  And although a lot of time has passed since the appearance of the first satin ribbon, crafts from it are being improved day by day.  What can be done from ribbons today?  About what to weave from this material and how, we will tell in our article. </p><h2>  Basket with flowers from ribbons </h2><p>  Tape is a special material that is often used by craftsmen from around the world.  It is used in creating a variety of crafts and decorative elements.  For example, from ribbons you can make an original basket with flowers, which will be a wonderful gift and will decorate any living room.  So how do you create it? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can be done from ribbons" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/854488.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In order to make a basket with bright colors from ribbons with your own hands, you need to prepare a wicker base and satin cuts (either plain or multi-colored).  You will also need the following tools: </p><ul><li>  toothpicks or skewers (the choice will depend on the size of the basket); </li><li>  floristic gun and glue; </li><li>  a small piece of foam; </li><li>  lighter or matches; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  additional floral decor (small artificial flowers, sparkles or beads). </li></ul><h2>  How to make a basket of tapes? </h2><p>  At the first stage, it is necessary to make skewers or toothpicks of the same length (i.e., trim according to the height of the basket).  Next, we make roses from ribbons with our own hands, carefully wrapping and gluing buds on skewers or toothpicks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself ribbon" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/854509.jpg" width="600"></div>

We process the edges and stray ‚Äúbroken‚Äù strings with a lighter or matches.  We glue future leaves on skewers and put a small piece of polystyrene on the bottom of the basket.  We insert skewers or toothpicks with roses and leaflets into the polystyrene foam, and cover the empty spaces with the remaining parts of the ribbons, creating a full-fledged composition. </p><p>  The final touch in a basket of flowers will be additional decor.  For example, our roses can be covered with sequins, glued beads, beads, etc. on their petals. The basket is ready.  Read more about what can be done from ribbons. </p><h2>  How can I embroider ribbons? </h2><p>  Another original way to use satin ribbons is through embroidery.  In this style, you can make many beautiful crafts and gifts for all occasions.  For example, you can make a beautiful picture.  To do this, take multi-colored ribbons, a white canvas, a finished frame, a photograph (you can take the image of the person to whom you want to present this craft, or just a colorful and neutral picture), matches, a needle and threads. </p><p>  Next, take a white base fabric, attach a photo to it and outline the borders of the picture with a white ribbon.  At the next stage, take any tape, needle and thread (in the tone of the tape), bend its edge with a triangle and grab it with a thread, make one revolution, fasten, then the second, third and so on.  The result should be a small rose.  Make a lot of such buds, and they must be of different sizes.  And most importantly, no schemes are needed here.  From the ribbons your imagination and suitable decor will help you to weave. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baubles made of ribbons" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/854512.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next step is to create some unopened buds.  To do this, take a new tape, cut a small piece from it (depending on the size of the intended tape), bend this section into a triangle and skip the line below.  Pull the thread and you get a bud.  Handle excess threads with matches. </p><p>  Then sew to the base or canvas all the individual elements (roses and buds).  In this case, choose to your liking.  Also, for a change, you can create roses and buds of a different color than the original.  What else can be done from ribbons? </p><h2>  Making crafts </h2><p>  Finish the composition with green ribbons from which you can make impromptu leaflets.  Everything is quite simple.  To do this, take a green ribbon, cut a small piece of it from it, draw a leaf from its wrong side, cut it and sew it to the craft.  At the last stage, take a photo, place it in a floral frame and put it on a <span>double-sided tape.</span>  After that, we put this element on top of the crafts and fix it with hot glue and a floral gun.  The composition is ready. </p><h2>  How to make a brooch from ribbons? </h2><p>  In addition to portraits and decorative baskets, brooches from ribbons look great.  How to make them?  For such jewelry work you will need: </p><ul><li>  satin ribbons of green and orange (if desired, you can use two other colors); </li><li>  needle and thread; </li><li>  a small piece of cardboard; </li><li>  floristic gun and glue; </li><li>  matches or a lighter; </li><li>  safety pin and scissors. </li></ul><p>  First, cut the ribbon of the same color into small strips with an approximate length of 9-10 cm. In total, you will need 19 pieces of ribbon: 6 for flower buds and 13 for flowers.  Treat sections and knocked-out threads with a lighter or matches.  Then twist a part of the rags in the shape of a triangle and pull them with a thread from the bottom.  Later we will also tell you <span>how to make baubles from ribbons.</span> </p>

    <p>  The next step is to create the middle of the flower.  To do this, twist one of the obtained petals into a small tube and sew.  The remaining 12 elements are glued with a gun.  At the same time, do everything in such a way that each subsequent petal patch is included in the previous one.  The finished rose turned out.  Next, we twist the remaining petals in a similar way and make buds.  We continue to do the same with the green ribbon.  Leaflets and roses are ready.  It remains to take a green ribbon and cut a small circle. </p><p>  Next, put a smaller circle made of cardboard in the resulting circle and cover it with the remaining green ribbon.  Fasten all the details of the brooch with a gun and sew a pin.  The product is ready. </p><h2>  Weaving baubles </h2><p>  <span>How to whip baubles from ribbons?</span>  Another way to use satin ribbons is to weave colorful bracelets out of them.  For beginners, lovers of beautiful things should prefer simple weaving from two ribbons of different colors.  For example, take the classic white and black colors.  We pin both ribbons on a soft cloth with a pin, take a white satin with one hand and make a loop from it.  Repeat the same with the black ribbon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ribbons" class="if" height="464" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/856027.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  At the next stage of weaving baubles from ribbons, we pass the white ribbon into black (loops) and tighten the last one.  Then we make another loop of black ribbon and stretch it into white, which we tighten a small knot. </p><p>  Next, fold the white loop, put it in black and tighten the knot.  We repeat the same sequence further.  The result is a beautiful <span>braided bauble.</span> </p><h2>  What to consider when weaving <span>baubles from ribbons?</span> </h2><p>  Before <span>whipping baubles</span> from ribbons, it is worth remembering the main points.  First, when choosing colors, consider their harmony.  For example, blue and beige ribbons are a great tandem.  What is it for?  On the one hand, it is beautiful, and on the other hand, the contrast will help you not to get lost in the loops at the initial stage of weaving baubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ribbon brooches" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/856036.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Secondly, when tightening the loops, use a knot ending in a kind of ‚Äútail‚Äù.  This will significantly strengthen the weaving.  However, do not tighten the loops too much.  Otherwise, the pattern will be deformed. </p><p>  Thirdly, do not rush while working. </p><h2>  How to facilitate the work with weaving ribbons for beginners? </h2><p>  Turn on your favorite music and focus.  With subsequent work, weaving bracelets will be much easier.  In the future, there will be no need to fix the tape with a pin or invisible.  All this can be done on hand and on weight.  But this will come only with experience.  In a word, be patient and stock up on inspiration.  Now you know what can be done from ribbons, and the rest will depend only on you! </p>
