    <h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  The hotel complex TT Hotels Pegasos Club 4 * was built in the early zero years.  Just five years later, it was renovated and now he is meeting his guests with an updated interior and perfect repair.  This is taken care of by the hotel administration, which annually in the low season orders for cosmetic repairs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚ÄãTT Hotels Pegasos Club 4 * is thirty-one square meters.  However, do not forget that the hotel is part of a well-known chain, and its guests can freely move around the territory of two more hotels located nearby.  Our compatriots claim that all three hotels are actually combined, which allows vacationers to use all infrastructure facilities, despite belonging to the hotel complex. </p><p>  Until 2011, this hotel was listed under a different name, so in some catalogs you may be advised as a Joy Pegasos Club.  Although in fact the hotel complex is called TT Hotels Pegasos Club 4 *. </p><p>  The hotel consists of three four-story buildings, in all there are four hundred and seventeen rooms.  They can simultaneously accommodate one thousand two hundred forty-nine tourists. </p><p>  Almost all the guests of TT Hotels Pegasos Club 4 * in the reviews note the magnificent and well-groomed territory of the hotel complex.  At first glance, it is noticeable that the hotel staff are reverent of their duties and take care of all the green spaces and cozy corners that delight vacationers with their appearance. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Located TT Hotels Pegasos Club 4 * (Turkey) in Alanya.  More precisely, in one of the resort villages located in the vicinity of the city.  To be completely accurate, it is worth saying that the hotel is separated from Alanya about twenty-eight kilometers.  In various tourist catalogs, its location is indicated differently.  In some it is written that TT Hotels Pegasos Club 4 * (Turkey) is located in the village of Incekum, while in others the resort village of Avsallar is noted.  In fact, the first option is correct, because it is necessary to overcome a distance of two kilometers from Avtallar from the hotel complex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel is located on the first line, so its guests do not have to go more than two hundred meters to the sea.  TT Hotels Pegasos Club 4 * (Alanya) has its own well-equipped beach, which cannot but delight tourists who come here on vacation. </p><p>  The airport is at a decent distance from the hotel complex.  They are separated by almost a hundred kilometers, usually to overcome them, it takes about an hour and a half.  If you use the transfer of the meeting party, then you will be the last to get to the hotel, because it is located away from other hotels.  If desired, tourists can order an individual transfer, then they will be in the room within forty minutes after arrival to the hospitable land of Turkey. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Coast </h2><p>  All guests in their reviews enthusiastically talk about the beach of the TT Hotels Pegasos Club 4 * hotel.  He is worthy of those epithets that tourists reward him.  First of all, everyone is pleasantly surprised by the fine sand that strewn the beach.  It is the pride of the hotel and is considered the best on the coast.  It is nice to relax with children who will be happy to occupy themselves with the construction of sand castles. </p><p>  The water on the coast is surprisingly clear, and the beach itself stretches for more than one thousand meters.  I would like to add that from the very early morning a bar begins its work here, where tourists can take drinks absolutely free and choose snacks from the menu.  Some vacationers do not even leave the beach for lunch, because here a snack can be tasty and healthy.  In addition, traditional Turkish snacks are often prepared in numerous bars, which are definitely worth trying at least once during your vacation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The beach is equipped with sunbeds, changing cabins and showers.  Vacationers note that there are enough sun loungers on the coast for all vacationers, so free places can be found in the afternoon. </p>
