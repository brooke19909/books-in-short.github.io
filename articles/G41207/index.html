We can say that the Norwegian krone as a currency was used at the end of the first millennium AD.  <span>Silver coins</span> began to be stamped here during the reign of King Olav Trygvasson.  Their coinage was exclusively the prerogative of the ruler of the country.  The first Norwegian <span>mint</span> appeared much later - in 1626 in Oslo, or Christiania, as the city was called then.  At the end of the seventeenth century it was moved closer to a large silver mine.  Around the same time, the Norwegian krone first appeared in the form of banknotes.  In 1736, Courantbank was founded.  It was a private establishment, which was under royal control.  It had the right to issue banknotes and coins that were in circulation both in Norway and in Denmark.

    <p>  In the mid-nineteenth century, a riksdaler, consisting of a hundred era, was considered legal tender.  In 1874, a transition to the gold standard was made.  It was canceled in 1914 due to the fact that military expenses, which were very numerous, had to be covered by the included <span>printing press.</span>  A return to the gold standard was carried out in 1920.  But not long Norwegian krone was tied to a precious metal.  The gold standard was finally abolished in 1931.  The Norwegian krone was officially put into circulation in 1875, which is associated with the country's entry into the Scandinavian monetary union.  Prior to this, silver speeders were used here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  I must say that the Norwegian krone is not the only currency that was used on the territory of this part of Scandinavia.  At different times, this state was ruled by the Danish or Swedish crown.  Coins and banknotes of these countries were used along with local crowns until 1917.  In addition, during the years of German occupation (1940-1945), the Reichsmarks also visited here.  After the liberation of the country, old money was exchanged for new. </p><p>  The kroon is still the country's national currency.  Consists of a hundred era.  Tourists who wish to visit the beautiful country of fjords, picturesque mountains and forests should take into account that in Norway, currency exchange is a troublesome and expensive business.  All banks charge a commission of up to 5 percent or a fixed amount of at least five dollars.  And at airports, local travel agencies or in seaports it is better not to buy crowns at all, it will cost even more.  Therefore, if possible, get this currency in your country.  The Norwegian krone currently refers to the ruble as 1: 5.3.  It is best to buy it in banks. </p>

    <p>  The Norwegian krone exchange rate is not constant, each year varies significantly.  This is explained by the fact that it depends on many reasons, including the level of oil prices.  Please note that when you are in the country of fjords, it is better to pay not with banknotes, but with a plastic card.  Non-cash forms of payment are very developed here, as in any modern civilized country.  Therefore, plastic cards are accepted almost everywhere in Norway, where you can buy anything.  If you could not get the crown before the trip - it does not matter.  You have the right to bring with you either 25 thousand units of Norwegian currency, or 2500 euros.  If you decide to bring along an amount of money that exceeds this limit, you will have to fill out a special form at customs.  But I must say that such restrictions do not apply to <span>travelers checks.</span> </p>
