  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tell us what caused the occurrence of manufactories: the answer to the ticket</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The question traditionally enters the framework of the school history course: "Tell us what caused the emergence of manufactories."  This question often causes difficulty, since it is closely related to such general problems as features of socio-economic development and the political system in a particular country.  Therefore, the answer on this topic involves understanding and knowledge by students of the historical background of the emergence of this new institution in various countries. </p><h2>  The concept </h2><p>  The answer to the question ‚Äútell us what caused the emergence of manufactories‚Äù should, of course, begin with a definition of this concept.  It reveals the essence of this phenomenon and helps to understand what its fundamental difference from previous forms and organizations of labor consisted of.  So, manufactory is an enterprise based on manual labor and characterized by the division of specialties.  The term emphasizes what the fundamental innovation of these institutions consisted of: they assumed a completely different organization based on the systematic use of the work of specialists in a particular industry.  Here it should perhaps be noted that it did not arise from scratch, but had deep historical background.  Therefore, when answering the question ‚Äútell us what caused the emergence of manufactories‚Äù, this circumstance must be immediately stipulated in order to logically proceed to the story of the ways of their formation. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tell us what caused the occurrence of manufactories" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1289935.jpg" width="345"></div></h2><h2>  Industries </h2><p>  The emergence of this new production type is associated with the development in a number of European countries of weaving.  This industry was one of the most developed in those states that embarked on the capitalist path of development.  It should be recalled that it was she who became the main premise of the English industrial revolution.  In second place are shipyards, as well as metal mining.  School or university ticket ‚ÄúTell us what caused the emergence of manufactories‚Äù implies a gradual and phased designation of all the prerequisites for their appearance.  And so the student must immediately identify those industries among which these new economic institutions have arisen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what caused the occurrence of manufactories reasons" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1289934.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  In Italy </h2><p>  Speaking about the ways of development of capitalism in European countries, it should be understood that they moved to this level largely due to the development of manufactory production, which, in turn, is rooted in the guild production system.  The first manufactories appeared in Italy.  This should also be explained.  The fact is that this country was economically developed in the Middle Ages.  There were many cities in it, the merchant class played a big role, the trade turnover of this state was huge, which caused the transformation of the old workshop system into a new, more advanced production organization system.  The rapid development of urban life, crafts, exchange, money circulation - this is what caused the emergence of manufactories.  The reasons, therefore, lay in the socio-economic structure itself.  Its natural transformation has brought to life new forms of organizing the labor activity of artisans. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the emergence of manufactories the history of Russia" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1289933.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  In other countries </h2><p>  Very soon, other European states embarked on the path of capitalist development.  This is the Netherlands, France, England.  In the latter, as mentioned above, weaving acquired a wide scope and quite quickly brought this country onto the path of capitalist development.  Therefore, the emergence of manufactories and their management in this country was associated with deep domestic economic reasons.  The history of Europe, naturally, went to the capitalist path of development and to the market.  Cities and trade developed on the continent - one of the important factors for the emergence of workshops, and on their basis - manufactories.  The above countries engaged in active trade not only with their neighbors, but also with more distant states.  They developed new lands and territories, which required the fast and high-quality production of not only goods, but also weapons, ships and the necessary equipment. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the emergence and management of manufactories" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1289932.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  In Russia </h2><p>  The economic path of development in our country was different from Western European.  The fact is that the <span>Moscow state</span> was originally agricultural: agriculture was the main branch of development.  The role of cities in economic life was not as high as on the continent.  Therefore, the emergence of manufactories was proceeding at a different pace here.  The history of Russia is inextricably linked with peasant production.  Therefore, the state, in fact, initiated the creation of manufactories.  The first of them appeared in the 17th century, but they received especially rapid development during the reign of Peter I. This emperor conducted a very active foreign policy, and almost all of his reign passed in the war with Sweden for access to the sea.  Therefore, he needed a model army and a strong fleet.  The king especially encouraged metallurgy, which again is explained by his desire to raise the army to the European level.  His activity was the impetus for the subsequent development of manufactory production in our country. </p>
