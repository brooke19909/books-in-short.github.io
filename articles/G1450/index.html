Tourism centers such as Egypt, India, China or Israel attract travelers not with their modern megalopolises, but with the sights that were created by great masters more than 2 thousand years ago.  The emergence of ancient kingdoms and their decline, the monuments of culture and architecture that they left behind are an interesting excursion.  Only countries with such a long history can offer it to guests.  But not in all states with a past tourism is sufficiently developed.  Iran, for example, occupies only 0.002% of the volume in this industry.  But the changes taking place in the country today allow us to hope that it will occupy an honorable place in the lists of world tour operators. </p><h2>  From nomads to empire </h2><p>  For a long time there was no tourism in Iran.  The power was closed to the public.  Only now she began to gradually open up to people and appeared before her guests as a proud, wise and hospitable host who honors her ancient traditions and loves to be respected.  The name of the country comes from the word "Ariana", which translates as "country of Aryans."  This large tribe inhabited this territory in the first millennium BC.  e.  Initially, these were nomads and herders, which spread from Central Asia to North India.  Only in the VI century BC.  e.  the political world recognized them as Persians - tall, strong and brave warriors.  In the records of Herodotus they are mentioned as people who are indifferent to gold, who abstained in food and do not drink alcohol. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An unknown country was able to conquer half the world in just a few decades.  Before them fell Egypt and Babylon, Medes and Sippar, and the power of the Achaemenid clan - the rulers of Persia - was established from the Aegean to India itself.  Thus, the great <span>Persian Empire</span> lasted more than two centuries, until it was conquered by Alexander the Great. </p>

    <p>  Today, a traveler, choosing a vacation in Iran, can get acquainted with the ancient monuments of Persian culture by visiting the archaeologists found in the capital of his great kings, the most ancient of which is Pasargada.  It was in this city that the famous Cyrus ruled over everything.  Persia had to endure both the ups (during Nebuchadnezzar and during the reign of the Sassanids) and the fall, after it was conquered by the Arabs who brought a new religion - Islam.  With their arrival, not only the ancient state, but also the centuries-old Iranian culture disappeared. </p><h2>  Iran today </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the long-term sanctions against this country and its positioning in the press as a terrorist center contributed little to tourism development here.  Iran was forced to re-establish relations with the civilized world.  In order to become a popular tourist attraction, the country has everything necessary - a rich cultural and historical past, a unique landscape and good climatic conditions.  At the government level, a decision was made and a concept for the formation of a new industry for the state was developed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Today, tours to Iran are organized to cities such as Qom, Isfahan, Shiraz and Mashhad.  The infrastructure necessary for a comfortable and interesting stay has been created here.  Opening of tourist routes is also planned in other regions of the country.  Implementation of the plans is expected in the near future, since this business is 70% owned by private capital, and he loves the quick return on investment.  Already, the world's leading tour operators have developed programs that include pilgrimage, visits to cultural and historical sites, beach and even ski tourism.  It‚Äôs important to remember that although Iran‚Äôs official language is Farsi, many young people speak English and the elderly speak French.  Therefore, you can find out the way or ask another question on one of them. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  This country is able to surprise even the most sophisticated traveler, as the climate is one of the attractions that Iran has.  Reviews about it directly depend on exactly when and where the tourists rested.  So, in the summer, guests of the northern part of the country will feel great.  Here they expect a mild climate and even night frosts in areas located closer to the mountains.  Whereas at the same time on the shores of the Persian Gulf, moist forty-degree heat makes tourists spend more time in places where there are air conditioners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In general, Iran has a dry and hot environment.  But the presence of several climatic zones allows travelers to navigate with the choice of a place of rest at a convenient time of the year for them.  The best are the spring and autumn months.  It is important to remember that Iranians do not welcome too bright and short clothes.  Therefore, in order to avoid unpleasant moments, those who like to go in shorts or turn around in a pair, should find another place to relax. </p><h2>  Traditions </h2><p>  When spending holidays in Iran, you should familiarize yourself with local traditions in advance.  This country is extremely religious.  The people here honor their rituals and demand the same from foreigners.  For example, during Ramadan, you should be prepared for the fact that many restaurants and shops change their schedule and open later in the evening.  The most emotionally powerful ritual among the Iranians is a ten-day mourning for <span>Imam Hussein,</span> who suffered martyrdom from the illegally seized power of the ruler Yazid.  These days, the whole country wears black clothes, and theatrical performances of tragic events are held on the streets. </p>

    <p>  Also, believing men pass in a mourning procession, torturing their flesh with chains, and women stand along the road and cry.  In this way, the people personifies the remorse of the inhabitants of the city of Kufa that they did not want to come to the aid of the imam, but bowed to the illegal ruler.  The presence of foreigners at these ceremonies is not welcome.  Therefore, you should know in advance exactly when this event will take place and look for tours to Iran at another time.  But it may be interesting to celebrate Novruz - the ancient Persian custom of New Year's Eve.  It lasts 13 days and is accompanied by festivities. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  To get acquainted with all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Persia, it will take a lot of time.  Today, the main tourism is concentrated in the cities of Hamadan, Urmia, Rams, Kish Island and some other resorts.  Iran is not yet ready to fully become a world-class tourist center, for too long it has been closed to travelers, but there are places worth visiting. </p><p>  For example, you can‚Äôt leave Tehran without looking at the famous Golestan Palace, which today houses an art museum.  Iranian mosques, the Majlis and the Senate are of the same interest.  For lovers of antiquities will be a real excursion into the past of Persia visiting the archaeological site around the capital.  Here are found the tombs of ancient kings from the dynasty of Achaemenids and Sephids. </p>

    <p>  In Hamadan, guests will find one of the oldest observatories in the world, as well as a university.  It is here that the Avicenna Museum and the mausoleum are located in which it is buried.  Near Urmia you can visit the mud health resort and restore health in its baths. </p><h2>  Iranian mountain resorts </h2><p>  The mountains of the country meet tourists who prefer ski slopes.  The camp sites open from November to April provide European-level service.  The most popular resort is Dizin, which has trails at an altitude of 900 to 3,550 meters.  Ski slopes here are quite difficult, and in some areas even aggressive.  In the resort of Toshal there are two ski areas - one at an altitude of 2950, ‚Äã‚Äãand the other - 3850 meters, which comprise 17 km of pistes of different difficulty levels. </p><h2>  Iran beaches </h2><p>  Travelers who prefer to bask on the beaches await <span>Kish Island.</span>  It is located in the Persian Gulf, although it is not entirely suitable for non-Muslims.  Here, the male beach is located in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, and the female beach in the other part of the island behind the fence.  Iranian entry prices for women are $ 1.  But they rarely enter the water, since the coast is very rocky.  The need to adhere to the ‚Äúform‚Äù of beachwear established in the country also does not favor swimming, therefore this place is in demand mainly by Muslims who are accustomed to such requirements.  In the <span>Caspian Sea</span> in Iran, fishing enthusiasts expect salmon, bream, sturgeon and mullet.  Active people will enjoy sea sports, skiing on various water vehicles and hang gliding. </p>

The basis of local dishes are rice, bread, lamb, poultry and vegetables.  Sour-milk products and world-famous oriental sweets are also popular.  Numerous cafes and restaurants provide a wide selection of dishes, and in some tourist centers there are even establishments with a vegetarian menu, which is completely unusual for the local population. </p>

    <h2>  Travel around the country </h2><p>  The most popular form of transport in Iran is public.  He always goes on schedule, comfortable and can deliver anywhere in the country.  Taxis are no less in demand both in the city and between different settlements.  It‚Äôs worth the trip quite inexpensively, since gas prices in the country are extremely low.  Foreigners can rent a car while traveling.  Iranians monitor the condition of their roads, so it will bring real pleasure.  Also in demand are air, rail and sea transport.  The ports of Iran successfully connect the country with neighboring states, and some of them, for example, Enzeli, are called the "gateway to Europe."  It is from it that ships can pass along the Caspian Sea to the <span>Volga-Don Canal,</span> which is connected to the ports of the Black Sea. </p>

    <h2>  Currency exchange </h2><p>  Even a sophisticated <span>tourist, the problems</span> with currency exchange in Iran can be confusing.  There are no special points in cities and towns.  Therefore, it is better to conduct a currency transaction immediately at the airport, where they are.  You can use the services of banks, but their work schedule is extremely incomprehensible to foreigners.  There are illegal "exchangers" in the markets.  True, for such actions can not only be fined, but also put in jail for three days.  In addition, you can just meet scammers and be left without money. </p><p>  Bank cards are accepted only at banks and hotels.  At the same time, only cash is taken in stores.  Since real tourism is just beginning to develop in the country, Iran has not yet provided comfortable exchange conditions for tourists.  Some stores and bazaars accept euros, pounds sterling, US dollars and even Chinese yuan.  And sellers know not only the language of Iran, but also English. </p><h2>  Memo to tourists </h2><p>  When choosing Iran for a vacation, one should take into account local traditions: from the selection of a wardrobe to the voluntary refusal of alcohol for the entire duration of the trip.  And you should think about it immediately after boarding the plane.  If tourists smell of alcohol, then customs clearance can drag on for many hours.  This country is also unsuitable for families with children, as the local infrastructure is not provided for toddlers. </p>
