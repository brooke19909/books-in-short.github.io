    <h2>  A few words about Nokia smartphones </h2><p>  As you know, the smartphones of this manufacturer are combined in a linear series of models with some general purpose and functionality.  So, the Nseries line is a family consisting solely of smartphones and Internet tablets.  Mobile devices included in this line are capable of providing digital multimedia services and have other additional features.  All the flagship products of the company are in this series, where most of the advanced technologies and innovations of the Nokia research center are used. </p><p>  The Eseries line (stands for Executive, i.e., executive) consists of business-oriented smartphones, with an emphasis on improving communication reliability and corporate email support.  These phones are for the corporate market.  This includes the E52 smartphone that interests us.  Nokia has created a device with extended battery life for corporate consumers looking for a well-built phone for their businesses that does not drain quickly.  It can also serve as a modem for data transfer using Bluetooth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The X-, C-, Z-, A-, L- and T-series of Nokia phones are also known. </p><h2>  General impression of the capabilities of E52 </h2><p>  "Nokia" on this phone tried to show itself.  He has everything here, in a form factor 10 mm thick with a volume of 54 cm <sup>3</sup> and a weight of 98 g. This is very surprising.  A tri-band 3G, four-port GSM, Wi-Fi, A-GPS plus magnetometer, Bluetooth, a 3.5 mm standard audio connector and a 3.2 megapixel EDoF camera are all quite impressive, but considering the fact that about half Since the E52-th is occupied by a BP-4L battery, which is usually equipped with the models E90, E61i and E71, the achieved miniaturization level for the <span>Nokia E52</span> seems even more stunning <span>.</span> </p><p>  The reviews confirm that the battery with a capacity of 5.5 Wh, a capacity of 1500 mAh and a voltage of 3.7 V can be practically used after charging up to 24-27 hours.  This is significantly higher than other phones in its class, released both by Nokia and other manufacturers.  If Wi-Fi, Bluetooth are used, and the built-in VOIP client is active, then according to <span>Nokia E52 the</span> instruction informs that the battery can power the phone for up to 24 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia firmware" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33051/956860.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance and sensations from the E52 phone </h2><p>  Nokia completed its design in the same way as on the E51 before it, although with a light aluminum and not a steel shell and a battery cover, and with a slightly larger case width to accommodate a much larger one (2.4 "versus 2 , 0 ") of the display.  As a result, it feels rather firm in the hand, even with the aforementioned subtlety, with an ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù texture on the battery cover and a uniquely textured D-Pad system.  Trying to twist the E52 does lead to little movement, but without serious consequences. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Case color and problems </h2><p>  Unlike the E55 and E51, the Nokia E52 phone is housed in a gray metal case.  White was the typical color scheme, both on E55 and E51, but the gray background creates some problems both in bright conditions (reflection from gray) and in low light conditions (where it is not too dark to highlight the keyboard). </p><p>  The photo below shows the models E51 (left) and E52 - pay attention to the difference in the perception of button markings on a black and gray background.  Obviously.  that this circumstance may affect the choice of mobile phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reliable phone" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33051/956861.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Controls on the E52 </h2><p>  ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù in this sense continues to remain at its best, providing its gadgets with a full range of management amenities.  There is a main camera shutter button on the right side, along with the Volume / Zoom / Voice control buttons.  There is also a power button (it‚Äôs nice to see it separately, but not built into the ‚Äúhang up‚Äù button) and a 3.5 mm audio jack at the top. </p><p>  There is also a micro USB port on the left, extremely neatly recessed (you may not even notice it at first!).  Like all the latest Nokia, charging via MicroUSB, and from the supplied charger. </p><p>  We did not forget about the micro-SD slot, but it is hidden under the battery cover - a good solution, as it prevents dust from entering or damaging the card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia E52 Specifications" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33051/956874.jpg" width="391"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Firmware "Nokia" E52 </h2><p>  As you know, Nokia E-series smartphones are <span>running Symbian OS.</span>  It is used by many large mobile phone brands such as Samsung, Motorola, Sony Erickson and, above all, Nokia.  This OS was the most popular smartphone OS in the world until the end of 2010, when the championship was captured by the Android OS.  In connection with the transition to Microsoft's Windows Phone OS in January 2014, Nokia stopped accepting new options or changing Symbian software from developers, planning to phase out its use. </p><p>  At one time, several software platforms were created for this OS, primarily the S60 platform for smartphones.  The S60 consists of a set of libraries, standard applications such as telephony and Personal Information Manager (PIM), and Helix-based multimedia players.  It is designed for full-featured modern phones with large color screens, which are usually known as smartphones. </p><p>  From a software point of view, the S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 2 is very recognizable in E52. The package is very similar to the one in the E75, although in the following months Nokia updated its version of the browser based on the Webkit engine: v7.1.  Here it is much faster and has a simpler interface (although there is still no way to copy text from a page or open a new window).  New PIM Eseries applications were optimized, Nokia Maps became Ovi Maps 3.0 (complete with unlimited pedestrian navigation), and support for UPnP functionality appeared in Home media. </p><p>  On the other hand, the absence of both Podcasting and Internet radio is striking.  Many users have already demanded their recovery, and the company is considering how the future Nokia E52 firmware will look with these in mind.  The latest firmware version v091.004 was released on June 2, 2012. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia e52 firmware" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33051/956887.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  What's new in photography with the E52? </h2><p>  Nokia in this model, like in the E55, relied on the use of EDoF (increase in depth of field) cameras.  This is a new idea, possible only in the digital age.  Instead of the bulky and expensive auto focus mechanism, the idea was used that a cheap camera with a fixed focal length can be significantly improved with a custom lens that was designed to focus the RGB light components in different ways.  When an image is captured (actually creating three ‚Äúphotos‚Äù, one for each of the RGB components), each part of the photo viewing area is analyzed with a clear definition of the details of the RGB images used for this part, and the corresponding color is formed for all three images.  Thus, the normal <span>depth of field</span> for a fixed focus camera expands, and close or very distant objects can be captured quite sharply, which would not be possible with a fixed focus of the camera. </p><p>  In good lighting conditions, the results can be amazing for such a small camera. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia e52 instruction" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33051/956891.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  What are the impressions of the buttons and display? </h2><p>  The keys on the front panel are elegantly sculpted, they are pleasant to use, while the 2.4 "display seems small for a modern smartphone, but well-formed in the context of such a small device, most importantly it is translucent. This means that the image is clear in sunlight - such , like the displays of the more expensive models E75 and E71, there are also no forbidden zones for lighting this screen (unlike many competitors). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone selection" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33051/956897.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  How is sound reproduced in E52? </h2><p>  The mono speaker on its back is, fortunately, crystal clear and loud - a great option for listening to podcasts throughout the house.  The music sounds clear, but without much quality from the supplied stereo headset.  Connecting more advanced headphones shows that the tin sound does not appear through the fault of the phone.  Nokia sells high-quality headphones with a microphone and a junction box, which you should have if you really want to listen to Hi-Fi music on the E52. </p><h2>  How the E-52 plays video </h2><p>  As numerous tests confirm, video playback in the S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 2 is pretty good, and almost any MP4, 3GP and FLV video that you drop on the E52 is processed without problems.  Playing WMVs turns out to be a bit more messy, but, as always, digital video codecs are complete ‚Äúpiggybacks,‚Äù and WMVs rarely manage to be processed properly. </p><h2>  What about email? </h2><p>  In terms of business software, the Nokia E52 is equipped with the new Nokia Messaging email system, including pseudo-delivery of correspondence from POP3 or IMAP accounts.  This is by far the easiest way to mobile email.  The full, edited version of Quickoffice v5 comes with firmware. </p><p>  Application shortcuts work well despite their tiny size. </p><h2>  Third-party applications on E52 </h2><p>  Interestingly, a number of third-party applications were fully licensed by Nokia for the E52 and E55.  WiPresenter (from Psiloc) allows you to use both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to control Powerpoint presentations on your computer, while Font Magnifier (also from Psiloc) does exactly what it is intended for, namely: it allows a system-wide font change ( between 50% and 140% of its original size) to make the text more readable (or fit into its large size on the screen) in any application.  Psiloc World Traveler (as in the original) is actually freely distributed, but it's nice to see it turned on and providing information about the weather, exchange rates and time.  Top Hits Solitaires (from Epocware) is a first-class set of hundreds of variations of card solitaire games.  The Advanced Communications Manager (from WebGate) is a call filtering application, and Block Cascade is a Flash-based Gamelion clone. </p><h2>  E52 Slim Form Factor </h2><p>  So, we have come to the moment of truth.  How good are the above parameters and the overall "Nokia" E52 characteristic?  On the one hand, it‚Äôs just a modest one with a traditional T-9 keyboard and a small screen (in relation to the N97 and iPhone and other ‚Äúchampions‚Äù of recent years).  But the E52 is (potentially) as good as this can be achieved within its form factor.  And, if you need a business-oriented reliable phone, which is still small enough and fits easily in any pocket so as not to spoil the line of your suit, then it makes sense to purchase it.  While the E52 is compact for a modern gadget, its owner has a complete email address, fully editable Office, full web access, and much more.  And all this in a device that will be guaranteed to work for several days on a single charge. </p>
