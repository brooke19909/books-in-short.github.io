You can list for a long time, because any natural and waste material is used. </p><p>  What kind of <span>crafts</span> can I <span>make</span> to decorate an apartment or a personal plot, take it to an exhibition in a school or kindergarten?  Many people think about this issue.  Our article will help you choose the option that will satisfy the demands of beginners handmade.  A detailed description of the work will help you do it with ease. </p><h2>  Paper Plate Fish </h2><p>  If you can‚Äôt decide what kind of crafts you can do to decorate the room, we offer you a light fish from a disposable paper plate.

Walking in the park with children, think about what crafts can be done for the autumn exhibition in kindergarten or school.  Consider the shape of the leaves with your child, imagine what they look like, what you can make of them.  You can use both leaves from one tree, and from different.  They differ in shape and color.

You can combine not only the shape of the leaves, but also the colors, because autumn gives a rich color gamut to the nature around us - from bright yellow to shades of red and brown.  Before you start making crafts from natural materials for kindergarten, you need to put the leaves in a thick unnecessary book and put on top the load.  You can do this in the evening and leave the blanks under pressure for the whole night.  In the morning you can already start work.  If there is still moisture on the leaves, you need to iron them through the newspaper.  After that, the leaves are well smoothed and glued onto PVA glue to the cardboard sheet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Crocus from the spoons </h2><p>  Crafts-flowers can be made from disposable plastic spoons.

The photo above shows how to arrange the spoons relative to each other.  A yellow thread is pre-inserted into the center.

Their children are called "eagles" and on the sea coast they arrange fights on their strength.  Small rounded shells serve as paws and beak.

We can offer kindergarten teachers to color the bottoms of the bottles to make snowflakes.  First, there is preparatory work to cut the bottoms with scissors.
