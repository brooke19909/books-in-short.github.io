  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Political system. Concept. The main hvida government system</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The political system - this concept is often used in <span>constitutional law,</span> giving it a wide meaning.  The definition covers the foundations of the structure of the state and society, the organization of power, characterizes <span>political relations,</span> personal status, the foundations of local self-government (if any), the system of state power bodies reflected in the Constitution. </p><p>  According to some authors, the concept of "state system" is identical to the constitutional system. </p><p>  The form of organization is a territorial organization, a country's structure with an appropriate distribution of powers among regional and central levels of government. </p><p>  A state may have a simple or complex structure.  For example, Bulgaria, Poland, and the Republic of Belarus can be classified as simple.  These countries do not have sovereignty and cannot be objects of foreign policy relations. </p><p>  Complex states should be called states united by separate entities that had all the signs of statehood, including sovereignty.  At the same time, part of their sovereign rights were transferred to the central higher authorities voluntarily by the elements of the country's structure. </p><p>  The main types of government: </p><p>  1. The unitary structure of the country.  The political system of this type is typical for Portugal, Denmark.  In these countries, the division of territory is carried out only into sectors that are not endowed with sovereignty.  In such a state, there is only one Constitution, the monetary system, the structure of government and legislation.  Unitary countries can have in their structure autonomous entities, separate elements of federalism (in some cases this form is called ‚Äúregionalist‚Äù).  As an example characterizing the latter definition, we can cite Italy.  In this country, there are twenty regions divided into provinces (in the regions there are councils that perform administrative, legislative and other tasks). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. A federal state system characterizes a country as a union in which its subjects (constituent elements) and entities have the <span>attributes of a state.</span>  These signs include the <span>constitution, the structure of</span> state power, and so on.  At the same time, the authorities in the subjects and entities, as well as the power structures of the country (police, armed forces) are subordinate to the federal bodies. </p><p>  The Federation may be territorial - in this case, a large country is divided into territories.  The United States has such a political system. </p><p>  The federation may be national - in this case, the division in the country occurred in accordance with the peoples living in certain territories.  Such a device has Yugoslavia. </p><p>  In addition, the federation may have a national-territorial (mixed) structure, such as that of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  3. The empire is a fairly large and complex state, uniting other nations or countries as a result of colonization, conquest, and other things.  Such a structure is based on coercion and violence.  The empire disintegrates upon their disappearance (as happened with the Roman and Russian empires). </p><p>  When considering the issue of state structures, the concept of ‚Äúconfederation‚Äù should also be clarified.  The specified device is characterized as a voluntary union of countries united to achieve common goals, for example, in the military, economic or <span>political sphere.</span>  Elements (subjects) included in the confederation reserve all their rights <span>(sovereign states).</span>  Countries do not have a common territory, citizenship, constitution, monetary <span>system, legislation,</span> tax <span>system</span> .  The existence of a confederation is supported by contributions from its constituent entities. </p>
