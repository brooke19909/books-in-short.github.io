Essay on hot resorts and sightseeing programs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When autumn comes to an end, and true winter begins, many of us want to leave our native land and go to where the sun warms and warm waves beat against the golden shores.  So the question naturally arises about where to fly in November to relax.  We offer to consider some of the most profitable options for tourism in this period, which are ideal for every average citizen of Russia in terms of money and other criteria. </p><h2>  Hurry to Africa without even having breakfast ... </h2><p>  One of those places <span>where it is better to relax</span> in November from the usual atmosphere and cold weather, is the African continent.  In those countries that are located close to the equator, <span>there are</span> practically no <span>seasons</span> ; therefore, in the summertime you can relax there at any time convenient for you, including at the end of autumn. </p><p>  Trendy among travelers are Kenya and Tanzania.  From a tourist point of view, these states are identical.  The service here offers at a price slightly higher than average, but if you are a budget tourist, you can agree with the locals who will provide you with an overnight stay. </p><p>  A feature of African countries are safari tours.  Be sure to go explore the local landscapes and get acquainted with the African fauna.  And, of course, if you are looking for a place to fly in November to relax directly on the sea, then again Tanzania with Kenya will provide you with first-class paradise vacation.  White beaches and bays washed by the Indian Ocean are the dream of every "passive" tourist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to fly in November to relax" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/558675.jpg" width="600"></div>

The fact is that just at the end of autumn the period of showers ends here, the weather stabilizes, the air humidity normalizes.  If you go to this hot country at the very beginning of the month, you can still keep up with the so-called summer prices, which are much lower than winter prices. </p><p>  We also note that such favorable weather in Thailand at the end of autumn is an excellent solution for families with children.  The sun warms up all day, the <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãwaves</span> are getting warmer and warmer, and most importantly, many water attractions open that will bring happiness not only to children but also to adults. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to relax in November" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/558677.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  In new Islamic traditions </h2><p>  Europeans believe that the very corner of the earth where it is better to relax in November is the country of the UAE.  At this time, the once deserted coast of the <span>Persian Gulf</span> leaves summer heat, and the coolness of the velvet season replaces it.  True, by our standards, this is not quite cool - 30-32 degrees, which is quite acceptable for bathing, sunbathing and other summer activities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The financial situation is comparable to Thailand.  If you hurry and arrive here early, you can hurry to book a room at a lower price.  Almost every day, prices for all services increase here, since Europeans visit Dubai and other Arab resorts in winter.  We also note that having arrived at one of these amazing megalopolises, do not limit yourself to just a beach holiday.  Visit the roofs of the tallest skyscrapers in the world, see the stunning beauty of the mosque, visit the parks that are filled with fountains and sculptures, and take a lot of unique pictures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="relax in November at sea" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/558679.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Islands of eternal spring </h2><p>  Still not sure where to go on vacation in November?  Then take a ticket to Tenerife and get ready for getting off the plane and breathing in the freshest air and smelling the ocean.  Climatic conditions that are characteristic of the Canary Islands are considered the most favorable for any type of vacation, and in some cases even healing for people with various ailments. </p><p>  This archipelago is famous for the fact that at any time of the year it is neither cold nor hot.  The air temperature is kept within 27 degrees, and the ocean warms up to 25. Canaries are one of the "greenest" islands in the world - there are millions of different types of tropical shrubs and trees.  Well, of course, if you want to have a good rest in November at sea, then various beaches will be provided for your attention.  With snow-white or black sand, wide and crowded and narrow, small and cozy.  It remains only to choose a resort and enjoy the summer and the sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="better to relax in November" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/558678.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where else can you relax in November abroad? </h2><p>  Not every resident of Russia, as it turned out, prefers warm and hot weather to winter evenings.  Many people would gladly go to see the sights of the most ancient states of our world in the cold season.  Therefore, Europe appears in our ranking as an excellent option for excursions in November.  The advantages in such a trip will be a whole mass.  Firstly, the reduction in prices for tours, accommodation and food in various restaurants in Europe.  Secondly, there is no heat, which often prevents the whole day from walking through the streets and visiting various monuments of architecture and art.  Well, if you still dream to still find warmth in this part of the world, then you should go to Italy or Spain.  In the southern cities in November it is still warm, the sea has not cooled, therefore many beaches are open for swimming. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="relax in November abroad" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/558676.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For those who are drawn to the North </h2><p>  If you are looking for a place to fly in November to relax, and at the same time consider only the so-called high-altitude zones, then pay attention to the numerous <span>ski resorts in Europe.</span>  Here they stretch from Lapland to Spain, from the Ukrainian Carpathians to the Pyrenees, because each tourist will find something to his taste and budget.  In November, the ski season officially opens at each of these resorts, so keep in mind that prices can be overpriced. </p>
