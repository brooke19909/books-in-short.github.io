    <p>  The relief of Phuket is variable, which makes walking difficult.  Therefore, most resort guests relax in the vicinity of their hotel.  Initially, experienced tourists try to buy a tour to the hotel complex, located near one of the most rated beaches.  For example, near the Karon Beach, famous for its ‚Äúsinging sand‚Äù, there is a two-star hotel complex Karon Living Room Hotel 2 *.  The hotel description of this is the subject of this article. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The favorable climate of Thailand, in the conditions of which three crops grow in a year, does not limit the holiday season.  Water in the coastal waters of the Andaman Sea is warm all year, like boiled milk.  The climate of Phuket is determined by the constant monsoon here.  The annual temperature difference here is minimal: from 35 <sup>0</sup> C in April to 25 <sup>0</sup> C in December. </p><p>  Accordingly, the Karon Living Room Hotel 2 * hotel under such weather conditions is available for vacationers year-round, in any of the seasons: dry (here it starts in November and lasts until April) and wet (from May to October). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is for the island of Phuket that seasonality is conditional due to the least rainfall for Thailand.  The rainy season here is characterized by their amazing transience: tourists, having waited for an abundant tropical rainfall, which rarely lasts more than an hour, as soon as a wave of a magic wand again sees the sun and the blue sky above them.  In such weather, beach vacations are not disturbed, and tourists who fly to the Land of Smiles are less exposed to heat. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  In Thailand, it is unlikely that you will be able to find a hotel by indicating the taxi driver his exact address.  After all, if a tourist flew to about.  Phuket, and he needs to come to Karon Living Room Hotel 2 *, the address with the street and home will lead any taxi driver to bewilderment.  Most likely, he will smile confusedly in response, and then he will take the guest to some other outskirts of the resort. </p><p>  It is no secret that in Phuket, local residents are guided in the location of the hotel solely by its belonging to a particular beach.  That is, instead of the street names and house numbers that are customary for us, it is correct to indicate to the taxi driver only the name of the hotel and Karon Beach, where it is located, and then there will be no mistake on his part.  Nothing more to say. </p>

    <p>  Transfer from the airport to the hotel complex takes forty minutes.  Right in the middle of the resort town is Karon Living Room Hotel 2 *, a description of its territory does not take up much space.  Simply, it is not, because it is a purely urban hotel complex, the infrastructure of which organically merges with the general resort.  Maybe that's why, due to the lack of an open beach (in fact, not to place it in the middle of city streets), the comfortable comfortable hotel in question is qualified by only two "stars".  However, many tourists, its guests, believe that the proximity of the unique Karen beach more than compensates for this fact.  In addition, within walking distance from the hotel complex is everything you need for a beach, and for outdoor activities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel design and service </h2><p>  Tours to this hotel fly like hot cakes.  If a tourist manages to purchase the appropriate one in 3-4 months, then only then this lucky man will be able to relax in the Karon Living Room Hotel 2 *.  A review of the hotel complexes of the famous Thai Karon Beach and the quality of the resort services of its hotels, constantly carried out by travel agency analysts, indicates the high competitiveness of the hotel complex we are considering. </p><p>  The hotel is located in the only urban four-story building where there is no possibility for equipping a terrace, lawns, etc. At the entrance, therefore, the design decision of its main entrance from the facade involves open architecture.  Restrained lines and regular shapes of tetrahedral columns contribute to the overall design style.  At the entrance to the hotel, architects intentionally replaced a bearing wall of the building with a small columned basilica, immediately visible behind which are the welcoming glass entrance doors.  The originally designed, noticeable and fairly large hotel sign looks organically, stylishly and defiantly. </p>

    <p>  The first floor of the hotel is fully occupied by the public area (reception, restaurant, various services).  Relatively low ceilings of this tier have less than one and a half height.  However, the impression of spaciousness and solemnity by the designers was nevertheless created due to the floor lined with artificial stone, thoughtful installation on the walls, restraint of the color gamut, and optimal brightness of the LED lighting modules.  The combination of wall materials and the use of mirrors visually increases the ground floor volumes of this relatively compact city hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It has a very comfortable mini-restaurant, there is a reception area with a desk, rentals, a hairdresser, a modern mini-laundry. </p><p>  The floors of the hotel from the second to the fourth are reserved for superior client rooms, which we will discuss below.  They have a pretty decent area and are quite comfortable.  It is the improved living conditions that make a particular attraction, the ‚Äúchip‚Äù of this hotel complex, which found its reflection even in its name. </p><p>  The excellent design and staff work are appreciated by tourists.  Rested there once try to fly in again. </p><p>  City infrastructure is adjacent to the hotel: dozens of cafes and restaurants, massage parlors, clubs.  On Tuesdays and Saturdays, a rich food market runs close enough to the hotel complex, where exotic mangoes, carambola, longan, guava, pineapple, lychee, lime, passion fruit, longkong, etc. are sold at reasonable prices (of course, with bargaining). . P. </p><h2>  Karon Living Room Hotel 2 *: services </h2><p>  The guests of the hotel complex warmly respond to staying in it.  They write that this sweet and calm Thai ‚Äúcouple‚Äù looks preferable to some Turkish and Egyptian ‚Äúfives‚Äù.  They subjectively rate the Thai Karon Living Room Hotel 2 * above a two-star level.  Guest reviews often end with a phrase testifying to their desire to purchase a tour with accommodation in this ‚Äúdeuce‚Äù for the next season. </p>

    <p>  It is not recommended in October to come to Karon for a beach holiday for families with small children and the elderly.  At this time, the waves are high, and swimming is unsafe for inexperienced swimmers.  For the rest of the time, the excitement of water in the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach is insignificant, and comfortable swimming is guaranteed to all categories of spa residents. </p><p>  Sunset in the sea here is comfortable and smooth.  Sun beds and umbrellas are paid, cost 100 baht.  The sand of the beach is unique, it contains a large amount of quartz; when it walks on it, it creaks like snow.  The infrastructure of the beach itself includes small kiosks located close to the road, which are used to rent beach equipment and sell soft drinks. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Tourists often leave Karon Living Room Hotel 2 * (Phuket) to explore Thailand.  At the same time, it is not recommended to use the services of numerous scooter and bike rentals.  The reason is banal street theft.  Therefore, it is safer for tourists to use the services of a motorcycle taxi, which is here quite peculiarly called ‚Äútuk-tuk‚Äù.  Numerous diving and surfing schools near Karon Beach are also popular. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Tour operators are actively working on the sale of excursions to guests of the Karon Living Room Hotel 2 * (Phuket).  However, in terms of price competition, they are outright losing to the city tour desk.  For comparison: a tour to the <span>Similan Islands,</span> included in the top 10 best places on the planet for diving and beach holidays, tour operators cost 3800 baht, and in the city - 1800. </p>
