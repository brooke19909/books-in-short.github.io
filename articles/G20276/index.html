The ideological platform and visual political steps of fascism in other countries interested certain social strata in Spain, where the aggravation of class confrontation occurred in 1931-1936.  Features of fascism in Germany, Italy and Spain were of a similar nature, but there were some differences. </p><p>  Sympathy for fascism was fueled by members of many right-wing parties.  These were reactionary circles of capital, aristocracy and clergy.  It also served as the cause of fascism in Spain.  They supported the ruling elite in an open form.  The ideology of Nazism was seen as a salvation for the bourgeoisie from the head of the proletariat and any internal opposition.  About the features of fascism in Spain (briefly) read the article. </p>

    <h2>  The ideology of fascism </h2><p>  What are the features of the establishment of fascism in Spain?  Its founder is Ernesto Caballero.  Like most Nazis in Europe, he came from a petty bourgeois.  As a socialist, he accepted the new trend with enthusiasm.  While in Italy, Ernesto joins the adherents of <span>Benito Mussolini</span> (Duce), also a former socialist.  From that time, Rome was revered by him as the cradle of religion and Nazism.  Returning to his homeland, he becomes an ardent propagandist of Nazi theory.  Thus began the establishment of fascism in Spain (briefly about the features read below). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He was hostile towards Germany at that time, more trusting Russia as an ally of the peoples of the Mediterranean.  When power passes to Hitler, he will dramatically change his views.  But then it was only 1928. </p><p>  In 1931, in the past, the poor student of the capital's university, Ledesma Ramos, an ordinary teacher’s son, published the first issue of The Conquest of the State, where he spoke admiringly of Nazi politics.  He even changed his hair - "under the Fuhrer." </p><p>  On the pages of his publication, Ramos prints a manifesto of a group of like-minded people he has put together.  The main postulates of this declaration were the basis of the remaining provisions and slogans of the program of Spanish fascism: </p><ul><li>  "The statement of Spanishism." </li><li>  “The eradication of Marxism is the command of the era.” </li><li>  "Application of action against the old regime." </li><li>  “The state is vested with all power ...” </li><li>  “We oppose communism with a national idea.” </li></ul><p>  This ideology of fascism in Spain appealed to another representative of the petty-bourgeois class, Onesimo Redondo.  Yesterday, a law student from Salamanca, delighted with the “discipline of the Nazis,” in the same year published the weekly newspaper Libertad, declaring the relevance of “disciplining the strengthening of the traditions of ancient Castile”.  It also announced the founding of the Spanish Castile Junta, calling for the struggle for a "Great and truly free homeland." </p><p>  Soon after the birth of fascism in Spain, Redondo and Ledesma unite, despite the difference in beliefs and social status.  They organize the National Syndicalist Offensive Junta (HONS), which has adopted the "16 points of Valladolid": </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  rejection of class confrontation and separatism; </li><li>  the Spanish annexation of Morocco, Gibraltar, Algeria and Tangier; </li><li>  "Merciless suppression of foreign influence in the country" and so on. </li></ul><p>  The Declaration propagandized repressions against all “speculators on ignorance and impoverishment of the masses” and the introduction of “control” over enrichment. </p><p>  Redondo and Ledesma gave priority to the Catholic religion.  The Spanish founders of Nazism justified such a step by the fact that their Catholicism was equated with "Aryan blood" in Hitler's theory.  However, such a statement did not in the least prevent them from criticizing their own clergy. </p><p>  HONS had political and syndicalist cells.  While the former consisted of 10 members and were created from representatives of one profession, the others gathered 100 people without distinction between social status and professional affiliation. </p>

    <h2>  Leader of Spanish Fascism </h2><p>  At the beginning of the junta’s activity, it did not differ much.  The bourgeois did not show interest in her and helped poorly with money.  But wealthy and determined youth began to recognize the leadership of Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera - the heir to the previous dictator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  José Antonio, a thirty-year-old successful lawyer, had an attractive appearance of a noble gentleman, which inspired respect even from his rivals.  With his charm and aristocratic manners, adventurism and contempt for wealth, he won many admirers.  Educated and endowed with oratorical talent, he at the same time retained respect for his elders and class instinct.  He loved to quote Kipling's comrades-in-arms on the eve of street clashes and solemn marches.  It always showed a willingness to fight anyone who dared to criticize his father. </p><p>  His father’s rejection of party diversity and the affirmation of practical actions before theory were passed on to him.  Primo de Rivera, the son, blamed the state apparatus for the doom of the working class to "economic bondage."  In his address to the working people at a rally in 1933, he called for a forced social partnership, with the iron logic inherent in Nazism. </p><p>  This truly epoch-making two thousandth meeting in the Moscow theater "Comedy" served as a powerful impetus for the formation of a new Nazi group, whose leader was Jose Antonio.  Right-wing parties not only favorably reacted to the newly made organization, but also provided financial support.  "Spanish Renewal" laid out 100 thousand pesetas to a promising movement. </p><p>  The party executive committee adopted the name "Spanish Phalanx", rejecting the leader option "Spanish Fascism", for reasons of republican ethics.  After meeting with Ledesma Ramos, HONS unites with the Phalanx.  Jose Antonio almost single-handedly made decisions on the leadership of the united organization, using his authority, strong-willed character and indispensable charm. </p><p>  The programmatic provisions numbered 26 paragraphs and were frankly Nazi, proclaiming a “unity of professions and classes” with the Catholic ideal of history.  The aspirations of the Spanish nation were reinforced by successful actions of similar Italian and German groups.  After losing the first election, they did not despair, and soon received the long-awaited financial injections from the bourgeois, when the labor movement began to gain weight in society. </p>

    <h2>  Features of Spanish fascism.  Spanish phalanx </h2><p>  The main principle of the ideological position of the Phalanx was recognized as the transformation of Spain into a non-partisan corporate state, under the control of the almighty Leader.  Nationalism of the Phalanx provided for a patriotic rather than ethnic direction (this affected the recognition of the culture of the Catalans and Basques, on the conditions of their loyalty to the imperial regime).  In contrast to the Italian fascists, the organization rejected party movements and was aggressive towards them.  Its leader, too, did not belong to the fascists. </p><p>  The phalanx was declared as a movement of street fights and became an active participant in the policy of violent intervention, which was widespread in those days in the country.  The uniforms of the participants in the Phalanx were blue shirts, by analogy with the overalls of the working class, whose rights, in principle, she should have defended. </p><p>  This color was predominant in the attributes and symbolism of the Phalanx.  An example of this is the mistakenly translated name of the compound of volunteers who fought against the Soviet Union <span>(Blue Division).</span>  In Spanish, “blue” and “blue” sounds the same. </p><ul><li>  The banner is a tricolor with a longitudinal alternation of scarlet, black and scarlet, with an emblem in the center. </li><li>  Anthem of the Phalangists - “Face to the Sun”. </li><li>  The emblem of the Phalanx - arrows and yoke, as a Catholic symbol of the royal initials. </li><li>  The greeting form for phalangists is raising your right hand with the slogan - “Rise, Spain!” </li><li>  Phalangists addressed each other - "comrade" and "you". </li></ul><p>  José Antonio, the executed leader of fascism in Spain, was succeeded by Manuel Edilla, who established an authoritarian regime in the Phalanx.  He was sentenced to be shot by Francisco Franco, but then changed his execution to prison and exile.  After which there was a merger of the Phalanx with the Carlists and HONS.  It later became apparent that such a union led to disagreements within the Phalanx. </p><p>  She also took patronage of the university student union, the "Women's Section" and the "Youth Front," which included the Strela and Pelayos children's societies. </p><h2>  F. Franco (fascism in Spain).  Ruler's General's Tunic </h2><p>  This man played a key role in the history of fascism in Spain.  <span>Franco Francisco</span> is the son of a hereditary military man.  At the end of the Infantry Academy, he served in the calm garrison of his native city.  At the first opportunity, volunteered to fight in Morocco.  Here there was a chance of a swift takeoff of an officer career.  Franco established himself as an excellent warrior.  The service of the legionnaire for 11 years brought him the title of the youngest major at 23.  Ten years later, younger than him in the Spanish generals.  In 1926 - the commander in chief of the military compound of Madrid, in 1928 he headed the Academy in Zaragoza. </p>

    <h2>  Power corridors </h2><p>  After the 1931 revolution, the monarchical system was abolished.  Republicans come to power, but Francisco Franco then does not interfere in political games and maintains neutrality. </p><p>  The population is sharply politicized.  Terror, sabotage and unrest in the province lead to a regime change.  Parties that have taken over the leadership of the country have suspended reforms.  Militarized groups, including the Spanish Phalanx, intensified.  In Asturias, the miners revolted, incited by the anarchists, the suppression of this unrest was entrusted to Franco.  Following this, he goes to Africa, but soon returns to the capital to command the General Staff. </p><p>  In 1936, the Popular Front triumphed in the election race.  The new authorities amnesty political prisoners and seize land from the clergy.  The country is in a deep economic crisis, which adherents of the left movement skillfully use. </p><h2>  Civil War </h2><p>  In July of that year, the Civil War broke out.  The army revolted almost throughout the country.  But in Madrid and Barcelona, ​​rebels were rebuffed.  Opposing forces declare total terror to political rivals. </p><p>  The rebellious military elect Francisco Franco as their Leader, conferring upon him the title of Generalissimo.  Their choice was determined by youth, education, military merits of the candidate.  Also in his favor was the lack of political preferences. </p><p>  The freshly baked caudillo (leader) vividly established contacts with German Nazis and Italian fascists.  The Führer and Duce, intending to use the environment of the new leader as a puppet regime, began to equip Franco with weapons. </p><p>  To support the rebels, the German Condor Legion squadrons and selected Italian volunteer force corps were sent. </p><p>  Portugal and Ireland sent volunteers, and former White Guard officers joined the rebel ranks.  Fighters of communist and socialist parties made their way to the Republicans from around the world. </p><p>  Fascist orders reigned in the country.  Only the Phalanx was not persecuted.  There was increased propaganda for the struggle against the "red horde."  The civil war ended in victory for the nationalists.  In 1939, Francisco Franco declared the country free from opponents.  At that time, he still maintained neutrality towards Western states. </p>

    <h2>  WWII </h2><p>  Mussolini and Hitler eventually acquired a reliable ally.  Having eliminated the “red threat” from Spain, dictators allowed their troops to gain experience in warfare.  But the Spanish allies still did not take an active part in the arena of World War II.  The only exception was the Blue Division.  Franco thus got rid of objectionable in the military environment.  Meeting with the Fuhrer in 1940, he expressed dissatisfaction with the conditions for the allied participation of Spain in the operation for the joint occupation of Gibraltar. </p><p>  In the midst of the war in Europe, in 1942, the Spanish leader meets with the American envoy.  To the ambassador’s question about Franco’s opinion about the likely Nazi rule in European territory, he noted that such a development of events did not bode well for him or his country.  But he expressed the hope that with Hitler it is quite possible to agree on leniency and establish a balance between sovereign influence on the European continent. </p><p>  In addition, Francisco Franco expressed concern that the threat to the European community might come not from Hitler Nazism and the “new order”, but from the East, from the communist regime of the Soviets.  Therefore, the Spaniards are more satisfied not with the victory of Germany, but with the crushing of the Soviet country. </p><p>  Spain continued to be neutral throughout the war.  The Spanish authorities were looking through the fingers at the open borders for Jewish refugees from German persecution, albeit for money.  Moreover, Franco did his best to lobby for the adoption of anti-Semitic laws in the country.  Shelter also received the military, who managed to get to the Spanish coast in order to (also for a fee) take advantage of <span>small boats</span> and cross over to the allies. </p><p>  Such a policy after the war brought the regime of the Spanish dictator rid of the overthrow.  Moreover, taking advantage of the Cold War period between the two great world leaders, Franco skillfully maneuvered in the political “troubled waters”. </p>

    <h2>  Post-war times </h2><p>  In the middle of the last century, at the height of the “cold” confrontation, there was a global diplomatic warming towards Spain.  Confessions followed one after another.  Even during the war, Franco laid the foundation for restricting the activities of phalangists.  In peacetime, most of them were charged with social responsibilities and, in fact, they turned into trade unionists.  Later, the phalanx was generally renamed the "National Movement". </p><p>  The persecution of opposition parties did not stop until the death of the dictator.  An example of this is the death penalty of five opposition leaders shortly before the death of Francisco Franco.  Although their pardons were demanded by 15 European countries, and even the Pope himself.  As a result, the requesting states recalled the embassy missions, a wave of protest rallies swept across the country.  But the execution still took place in 1975. </p><p>  The middle of the last century was marked for the Franco regime by the famous Spanish “economic miracle”, which allowed the backward European country to rise to a successful state in the national economy.  For a relatively long period of time, Spain firmly held the second position in the ranking of countries with a successful growth in economic progress after Japan. </p><h2>  Further activities of Franco </h2><p>  Following the economy, Franco reanimated reformist activity in political life.  Legislation on the press was revised, the ban on the strike movement, pursuing demands only in labor conflicts was lifted, the powers of local municipalities were expanded, new rights and freedoms of citizens were added to the Constitution of the country. </p><p>  Francisco Franco’s domestic and foreign policy was in line with the interests of Western countries, for the reason that the danger of communism to Europe was far worse than the Franco dictatorship. </p><p>  In 1973, the great dictator Franco terminated his powers and transferred the reins of government to Admiral Luis Blanco, but he was not destined to sit in the governor's chair for a long time.

    <h2>  Some more interesting facts </h2><p>  After the resignation, Franco devoted most of his remaining life to his own treatment.  But Parkinson's disease has made itself felt.  In 1975, he was interred in the cemetery of the Valley of the Fallen. </p><p>  Archival documents that retained information about political prisoners were to be destroyed, but they were miraculously saved thanks to the courage of the Spanish archivists. </p><p>  The leader of the phalangists preferred to spend time watching movies, and reading books annoyed him.  Therefore, in his chambers there were no library racks, but there was a well-equipped cinema hall.  In addition, he was fond of fishing and hunting. </p><p>  Since 1947, the Spanish state was in fact monarchical, with an empty royal throne.  Therefore, Franco unequivocally declared that Prince Juan Carlos, who was crowned in 1975, should be considered a monarch after his death.  Spanish Emperor <span>Juan Carlos I</span> put an end to dictatorship and proclaimed democracy. </p>
