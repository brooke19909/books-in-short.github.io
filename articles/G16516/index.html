It is a universal part of the costume and can be worn with both an evening dress and jeans.  So that for each type of clothing you had a suitable addition, you need to know how to sew a bolero from various fabrics.  We offer you some quick manufacturing options. </p><p>  How to sew a bolero from knitwear. </p><p>  We need a piece of knitted material measuring 50x150 centimeters.  It is advisable to choose a fabric that stretches in all directions.  The first thing we do is build a pattern.  We lay out a piece of material in front of us.  Fold it along.  On the side slices we measure from the bend 10 centimeters on each side and make notches.  Expand the fabric.  Now fold the cut across and measure on the upper and lower cut 25-30 centimeters from the bend.  We make notches and unfold the fabric. </p><p>  Now we connect the smooth lines of the notch with each other: lower with lower side and upper with upper lateral.  Cut off the excess material and get a cut bolero with long sleeves.  We hem the top and bottom of the product.  Now we fold the pattern in half with the front side inward and lay the lines, stitching the sleeves along the curved line.  Be sure to grab a few centimeters from the machined edges and set the braces.  Turn the bolero to the front side.  Hem the sleeves.  The top and bottom of the product can be processed with lace, fringe or fur. </p><p>  How to sew a bolero from an old knit t-shirt. </p><p>  It is very easy to do.  Only an unnecessary long-sleeved T-shirt and a satin ribbon of at least 1.5 meters long and 2 centimeters wide will be required.  Carefully cut the collar and cut the front panel in half.  Slightly round off the obtained corners at the neck.  We process the slices on the overlock.  Now we bend inward the sections of the shelves and the neck by 3 centimeters and stab with needles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We lay the finishing line, 2.5 cm away from the fold.  Pass the satin ribbon into the resulting drawstring and tighten the edges, forming a uniform assembly.  We put on a bolero and tie a bow from the ends of the ribbon.  We get a very comfortable model. </p><p>  How to sew lace bolero with detachable sleeves. </p><p>  Take any pattern blouse with sleeves from the fashion magazine.  Shorten it to the desired length and slightly round the corners at the neck and bottom.  We put the finished pattern on the lace fabric, placing it taking into account the picture, and cut out the bolero.  We sew the shoulder and side seams, and then iron them.  The neck, bottom and central sections of the front are cut out according to the pattern of the lace fabric or processed using a slanting inlay. </p><p>  Sew the side seam on the sleeves.  We sew them into the armhole, slightly fitting them in place.  We hem the sleeves.  We make a fastener from a decorative button and eyelet.  By the same principle, you can sew a bolero from fabric.  Only in this case, you will have to necessarily process all the seams with an overlock to protect the fabric from shedding. </p><p>  By any of the above methods, you can sew a bolero for children without any problems.  It will appeal to little fashionistas.  You can put on such a thing with both a dress and a suit.  It will become indispensable in the summer, because in the mornings it is still cool.  The daughter with great pleasure will put on a bolero with a dress and together with you will go to kindergarten.  To make a children's model more attractive, do not forget about decorative details. </p><p>  A lace shuttlecock, appliqu√©s and embroidery are perfect for decoration.  Use satin ribbons, rhinestone designs and fun buttons.  You can sew an exact copy of your bolero for your daughter.  In this case, your costumes will fit well, and the girl will be very glad that she looks like a mother. </p>
