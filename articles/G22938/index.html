However, many of them believe that spending a vacation in the city is an expensive pleasure.  In their opinion, cheap hotels either have outdated rooms or are too far from the historical center.  Of course, partly they are right, because many budget accommodation options really can not boast of a good location and high quality service.  However, even among them there are wonderful hotels; reviews of tourists about them are presented. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="50.08783340000001" data-lng="14.42104889999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/9/5/2/4952.png"></div><h2>  City Partner Hotel Gloria </h2><p>  In fact, finding a cheap <span>hotel in Prague in the city center is</span> not so difficult.
