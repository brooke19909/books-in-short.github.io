Here you can have a wonderful rest and sleep even with the window open.  In relation to the sea, the hotel is on the 2nd line, which must be taken into account by people who find it difficult to walk even a few hundred meters.  <span>Beach towels</span> are issued at the reception, but they are paid and cost 5 euros.  Safe is also paid.  But the Internet can be used freely. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Everyone is wonderful hotel Meropi 4 *.  Guest reviews are similar.  Many kind words are addressed to the staff and reception staff for a quick and clear solution to all issues, for the waiters for creating the mood during meals and for the excellent service, the maids for the perfectly clean rooms, the cook for the excellent quality of the dishes. </p><p>  Complaints are caused by paid air conditioning, but many tourists do without it.  Also in the reviews there is a lack of electric kettles in the rooms, although there is an electric stove on which you can boil any amount of water in a matter of minutes.  In general, this hotel is recommended for a relaxing family vacation. </p>
