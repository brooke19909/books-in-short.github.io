Snow-white sand, clean moist air, hot sun - all this is familiar to many people.  And of course, most travelers have favorite places to spend a great vacation.  These are the beaches of Macau, which are located on the territory of the Dominican Republic.  This <span>exotic country</span> is famous for its clean beaches, which are often compared to a paradise.  So, they will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The wild beach of Macau, the photo of which is presented in this article, is significantly removed from the stretch of coast that is constantly filled with tourists.  Therefore, here you can meet local residents.  At the same time, there are almost no annoying merchants on local beaches.  The beach is conditionally divided into two parts.  The left has long been chosen by surfers and lovers of high waves.  The right one is intended for a more relaxing holiday and family tourism. </p>

    <p>  The views that open from anywhere on the beach are fascinating.  Wild palm trees grow almost along the entire coast of Macau.  They form a kind of green shelf.  If desired, any tourist can take part in one of the many excursions.  They can be individual or group.  You can ride a quad or buggy.  Experienced guides will tell you about the most interesting places on the coast and, of course, show them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Surfing </h2><p>  One of the most popular entertainment on the beaches of the Dominican Republic is, of course, surfing.  Since there are no coral reefs here, people get the opportunity to conquer huge waves.  That is why all the necessary conditions are created here to make surfers comfortable.  If you are a beginner or just planning to get on the board, you can get advice from the best instructors.  One two-hour lesson will cost you $ 60, but this amount will include all the necessary equipment.  Such activities are safe: in the water you, in which case, the assistant will insure.  The most famous surf club in Macau is called Macao Surf Club.  There are even outbound surf lessons.  Of course, they cost more.  However, their price also includes a round-trip transfer. </p>

    <h2>  Bodyboard </h2><p>  Macau Beach (Dominican Republic), which has long been recognized by surfers, is popular because of such entertainment with a board like bodyboard.  This device is designed so that people ride on the waves in a prone position.  This technique is easy to learn.  You can rent such a board at any surf school.  On average, the cost is 600 rubles, but on weekdays you may be able to bargain, because there are almost no customers at this time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Food and drink </h2><p>  Of course, an important component of a good rest is delicious and, most importantly, hearty food.  Therefore, in Macau there is a huge number of cafes for every color and taste.  In them you can taste the national Dominican dishes. </p><p>  Since Macau is a resort on the ocean, seafood will be the most important ingredient in many dishes.  Local chefs are masters of their craft, they can cook anything from shrimp to lobsters and other ichthyofauna.  Especially popular are fresh fish dishes. </p>

    <p>  As for drinks, they are quite standard in Macau.  The most popular of these is beer.  It goes well with fish and seafood dishes. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The beaches of Macau are mostly wild, which means that they have retained their original state.  This is an indisputable advantage when choosing a vacation spot.  Bavaro is one of the main resort towns of the Dominican Republic, which means that the beaches of Macau can safely be called the pearl of the Republic.  But most of all, the local coast is valued for the fact that there are almost no coral reefs, which serve as a barrier to ocean waves.  So vacationers can splash around in the huge waves of the Atlantic Ocean.  They cascade to the ground, which looks unforgettable. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The resort area is located in the Dominican Republic, 20 kilometers from the city called Bavaro.  To get to the beaches of Macau, you can use a car or transfer service.  You will be delivered anywhere in the coast.  However, this will cost you a small amount.  You can reach the beach on foot from the city of Bavaro.  In order to get to the coast, you will have to spend a small amount of time following along the recently laid track.  A large number of pointers are placed here, according to which you can navigate which way to go and where to turn.  So you will not get lost.  The beaches of Punta Cana (Macau) are very famous, so you can get help from local residents at any time: they will tell you where to go. </p><h2>  Beaches Macau, China </h2><p>  Beaches with similar names are located <span>in the Dominican Republic</span> and China, respectively.  The unique Chinese city of Macau has become a place where both Asian and Portuguese culture are developing.  Local beaches are diverse.  They are divided into several categories: </p>
