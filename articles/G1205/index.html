Here you can not only relax, but also explore the picturesque surroundings.  Such a vacation will leave an unforgettable experience. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  <span>"Viking Castle" (Crimea)</span> is located near the small village of Znamenskoye of the Black Sea region, between Evpatoria and the Black Sea.  The hotel is located right at the base of the picturesque Spit Belyaus, which means "white mustache".  The braid got its name from the color of sand, which is really almost white here.  The hotel is a 3-storey building and an attic.  The dormitory building of the resort and entertainment complex "Viking" in architecture resembles a medieval castle.  The territory has full infrastructure for a good rest.  The hotel has its own beach area 120 meters wide with clean natural sand, with a gentle entry into the sea.  The beach is equipped with exotic umbrellas.  The beach also has a bar serving cool cocktails.  For those who want to move around, there are playgrounds for beach volleyball and beach soccer.  You can go diving and underwater fishing.  Children can have fun on swings, trampolines and water slides.  The hotel has its own restaurant.  The restaurant is unusual - it is a Viking ship.  In its upper part is equipped with an observation deck from which you can admire the magnificent panorama of the sea.  There is also a barbecue patio.  The hotel has its own cinema.  For those arriving by car, a parking space is provided in a guarded parking lot.  The hotel has 58 rooms.  The distance to Yevpatoriya is 60 kilometers, to the Black Sea - 16 kilometers.  A shuttle bus runs from Evpatoria to Znamenka. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
