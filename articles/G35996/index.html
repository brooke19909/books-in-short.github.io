It is located a few steps from the beach of the same name with crisp, like snow, sand.  Of course, the hotel, like many on Karon, is not located on the first line from the coast.  Moreover, this hotel has a "star" of all the "three rubles".  And even the "five" in Phuket are located across the road from the sea.  However, the hotel provides many services, excellent breakfasts, has a beautiful green area and is close to restaurants and the beach.  Tourists leave good reviews about her.  Why?  Let's figure it out. </p>

    <h2>  Karon: what is he famous for? </h2><p>  This resort area is located in the west of the island, south of its "capital of entertainment" - Patong.  It is a favorite place for people who value comfort, as well as travelers with children.  The hotels are all stretched in chains along the beach or are located on parallel streets.  All of them are separated from the coast by a road.  The Phuket resort area itself is a wide, beautiful, recently restored promenade.  Along it stretched shops, <span>cafes, restaurants,</span> stalls with different products.  There is also a small temple and a night market.  Here you can not only buy cheap things, but also eat.  Not far from this place is the hotel Old Phuket - Karon Beach Resort.  At the northern and southern extremities of this embankment, all kinds of entertainment in a myriad of concentration were concentrated.  Since there is a coral reef in the south of Karon, there is the opportunity to go diving or just diving with a mask.  Despite the fact that this place is far from the main attractions of the island, its beach and promenade are very lively.  A sense of solitude arises from the sandy embankment that closes the track in most places, and therefore it seems that you are alone with nature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there and what is nearby </h2><p>  It takes about forty-five minutes to an hour to get from The Old Phuket - Karon Beach Resort to the airport, but of course, it all depends on your transfer.  The fastest way is a taxi.  A hotel or tour operator often organizes its own transport.  Well, budget travelers who come here on their own use minibuses.  Moreover, the hotel is conveniently located in relation to transport.  Right behind the hotel entrance is a street that leads directly to the sea.  Along it are many restaurants, massage parlors, cafes and shops.  At the very end of the street are ATMs and an exchange office.  Then - the highway and the beach.  Near the sea there is a market.  On foot you can reach the "Dinosaur Park".  Patong will have to go by taxi, tuk-tuk or motobike if you do not have a rented scooter.  A local bus takes you to Phuket Town.  From there, minibuses go to Patong.  It's cheap, but for quite a while. </p>

    <h2>  Sea and pools </h2><p>  Before beach relaxation from The Old Phuket Resort Hotel (Karon Beach, Thailand), walk along the street directly for five to ten minutes.  You will find yellow crisp sand, an incredibly warm sea and full contact with nature.  After all, this, as we have already said, Karon Beach is the most beautiful and clean coast in Phuket.  It stretches for three kilometers, and there is always a place for a tourist.  Recently, all sunbeds have been removed from the beach.  But this may be for the better.  Now there is more space.  There are many different water activities on the beach.  You can ride a scooter or a "banana", go surfing.  There is a diving center.  <span>Beach towels</span> are <span>provided</span> at the hotel <span>.</span>  They can be changed several times a day.  In addition, there are two good clean pools on site.  One of them is with a baby pool.  It is located on the second floor of the old building.  Another pool is near the new building.  Sun loungers are new everywhere, the water does not smell bleach. </p><h2>  Excursions and shopping </h2><p>  There are no umbrellas on the beach, so tourists, in order not to suffer from the heat, can rent them right on the beach for two hundred butts or buy them at the market for 250. There, by the sea, there are a lot of sellers with different little things, food and beach accessories.  Points from the sun, if you bargain, get for 150-200 baht.  <span>Beach mats</span> for the same price.  You can go shopping in Patong, especially since the tuk-tuks on Karon are everywhere.  But tourists recommend "shopping" at the night market.  This is cheaper than in Patong, and no need to spend money on a trip.  For renting scooters at the hotel they take five hundred butts per day.  You just need to leave a passport as a deposit.  Tours can be bought both at The Old Phuket - Karon Beach Resort 3 * hotel (Karon Beach), and at agencies.  The price is two times lower last time.  A sightseeing trip to Phuket is sometimes included in the package of the tour operator.  At the same time you visit Cape Prantep, a show of snakes and crocodiles, a fruit market.  Of the two-day excursions, a trip to the island of Phi Phi, as well as to the Khao Sok reserve, is recommended. </p>
