To do this, you do not need to make special efforts or have stunning skills.  It‚Äôs enough to have a little hook to decorate your home with real masterpieces. </p><h2>  Working techniques </h2><p>  To make <span>crocheted oval napkins, the schemes</span> with the description of which we will consider later, you can have an initial level of skill.  Even the simplest napkin associated with love will be an exceptional gift for a loved one. </p><p>  Crocheting is easy to create a variety of shapes.  Oval is considered classic along with round and square.  But working with her is a little more difficult.  Therefore, it makes sense to use different techniques to achieve the desired decorative effect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oval napkins crochet patterns with description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/885663.jpg" width="422"></div>

    <p>  Most often, oval napkins, crochet patterns of which are very popular, are made by openwork patterns.  This is considered a classic.  Fillet products also look good.  This technique allows you to implement almost any pattern that the craftswoman likes. </p><p>  Recently, Tunisian knitting has become very popular.  With it, you can also create real masterpieces.  But this is exclusively for the amateur. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The easiest way </h2><p>  The easiest way is to start crocheting oval napkins, the schemes with the description of which are understandable even for beginners, if the base is not a vicious circle, but a small chain of air loops.  This beginning immediately determines the future shape of the product.  Having knitted a series of columns on one side, at the end of the chain you need to make several additional columns to make the edge a semicircle, and continue knitting on the opposite side, as if in a circle.  When reaching the second edge of the product, you need to make as many additional columns and use the lifting chain from the air loops to go to the next row. </p><p>  On this basis, it is already possible to form an oval napkin.  Her further knitting depends on the chosen pattern.  We offer some of the simplest.  You can continue by knitting each row with double crochet or without crochet.  This way you get a dense napkin, which is ideal as a stand in the kitchen or for the dining table. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet oval napkins" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/885662.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <p>  Or try knitting several rows with a fan or arches from air loops.  This will also give a beautiful, albeit rather simple, openwork pattern. </p><h2>  Extend a round napkin </h2><p>  Every craftswoman wants to try crocheting beautiful oval napkins.  Schemes of such products are much less common than round ones.  But there is always a way out: modify the existing scheme a bit so that the napkin becomes oval. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Consider this with pineapple jewelry as an example.  In the collection of each knitter there are products based on this famous pattern.  We knit a regular eight-pointed napkin.  When the product is ready, we will supplement it with a small segment of the same pattern, but not over the entire area, but only at its two diametrical ends.  In such a simple way, a round napkin turns into an oval one.  And the main thing here is that you do not need to invent anything.  One has only to take one of the motives and knit it according to the same pattern as the previous rows. </p><h2>  We complicate the task </h2><p>  According to the previous principle, we are trying to remake another product for crocheting.  Oval napkins are obtained if the round patterns are not just pulled out, but also combine all the elements with a common strapping. </p><p>  To do this, first insert a pattern element from the same napkin or from another into a round diagram, bring it to the desired size, and then braid it around in a circular pattern, as if completing the entire product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oval crochet pattern napkins" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/885664.jpg" width="340"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In this case, the main thing is to choose the most delicate and harmonious pattern that really will become the cement that will combine such diverse elements into a single whole.  But even a narrow bezel can transform the most ordinary napkin.  It becomes the highlight that the finished product lacked. </p><h2>  We <span>crochet</span> large oval <span>napkins</span> </h2><p>  A beautiful napkin will turn out if you add a round pattern and make a big oval out of it.  The product begins from volumetric motifs, which are knitted by connecting columns with a crochet.  Next is a row of a chain of air loops.  Knitting continues with columns with one, and then with two crochets, which alternate with air loops.  When the required diameter is reached, rows of columns and chains are knitted at the diametrical ends of the product in decreasing order. </p><p>  After knitting "extensions" is completed, we return to the circular principle.  First we braid everything with a dense row of double crochet, and then we begin to create an openwork pattern. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful oval crochet pattern napkins" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/885668.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Beginners can stay on this scheme.  The size of the wipes and so it turns out not too small.  If the knitter has little experience, she will easily add a few more rows to enlarge the product.  The main thing here is not to overdo it and not to forget that in each row you need to add a certain number of loops or columns so that the edges of the napkin do not wrap. </p><h2>  We combine technology </h2><p>  We have already examined oval crochet napkins, schemes with the description of which are read quite simply and clearly.  You can complicate the task a bit.  For this, we knit separately two square motifs.  In the presented napkin, they are not made in a circle.  But this does not make a fundamental difference.  The main thing is that the knitter likes the motive pattern. </p><p>  Next, we take the scheme of a round napkin, but we knit it not in a circle, but as if connecting two square motifs that are located in it at the diametrical ends.  Without a certain skill, this is not so easy.  But when the squares are connected, on either side of them we tie another round napkin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="large oval crochet napkins" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/885665.jpg" width="570"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  To give the product a finished look, we oblige it with a common border.  However, it is not necessary that its width be large.  A small edge will be sufficient, as can be seen in a specific example. </p><h2>  Sirloin napkins </h2><p>  And lastly, consider crocheted oval napkins, schemes with a description of which correspond to fillet knitting.  Recall that in fillet knitting, the pattern is built on the principle of <span>monochrome</span> cross-stitch, where alternated and unfilled cells are alternated. </p><p>  It is better to knit an oval fillet napkin from the center in both directions.  That is, first we knit the first half, and then return to the beginning and knit the second part.  This ensures a more accurate appearance and maximum symmetry, since in both cases the same methods of narrowing the canvas are used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted oval napkins" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/885666.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Oval napkins are not an ordinary classic in the interior.  This is a little hooliganism or a protest against the clear and concise forms of a circle and square, which quite quickly tire a person. </p>
