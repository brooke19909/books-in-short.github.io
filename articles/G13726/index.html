  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Water molecule - a wonderful gift of nature</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A water molecule is a combination of the simplest elements in nature, but its function is difficult to overestimate.  Water is the basis of the body of all living things, in man it is about seventy percent.  All chemical reactions in the body also occur due to water.  So what is this wonderful molecule made up of? </p><p>  <span>The structure of the</span> water <span>molecule</span> is extremely simple.  The molecule contains three atoms - one oxygen and two hydrogen.  Oxygen is designated O, and hydrogen N. The chemical formula is designated as H2O.  Like all other molecules, water has a <span>charge.</span>  <span>The charges are</span> distributed unevenly, so the water molecule has two poles - positive and negative.  The angle between the molecules can vary depending on the state of water, for example, in the state of ice, it expands.  The opinion that a water molecule has <span>hydrogen atoms</span> on the one hand was visited by scientists almost a hundred years ago.  The Englishman Bernal said that it is easiest to build a model of a water molecule along a chain in which there would be hydrogen on the sides and oxygen in the middle.  However, then the water molecule would become electrically neutral.  Such a conclusion made it possible to assert that a water molecule has hydrogen atoms on one side, which determines its electrical status. </p><p>  The size of the water molecule was also of interest to researchers.  It was found that its diameter is three tenths of a nanometer, and the prefix means minus the ninth degree.  That is, there are nine zeros after the decimal point.  This size of the molecule allows it to be mobile, change its <span>physical properties</span> and combine with various chemicals. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Research scientists indicate that life originated in water.  Using various energy sources in the laboratories, organic compounds were obtained - proteins, amino acids, nucleosides.  All experiments were set up so that there was no oxygen, but due to energy, synthesis took place.  As you know, water coped with this perfectly, which means that it is not for nothing called living. </p><p>  The properties of water are used in the treatment of various diseases.  An interesting story is Dr. Batmanghelidzh who saved his life with ... water.  For some time he had to stay in Iran, where at that time revolutionaries were eager for power.  Sweeping people in jail on their way, they knew little about who was doing what and how could harm their regime.  Dr. Batmanghelidzha fell under disgrace.  His property was confiscated, and Fereydun himself was imprisoned.  The time spent in prison did not go to the scientist for nothing - he was engaged in research and found out that water has healing properties and helps to heal some diseases, in particular, a stomach ulcer and duodenal ulcer.  The patient in this prison suffered from this disease, however, there were no drugs or other ways to help him.  Then the doctor prescribed the only available medicine - two glasses of water.  After a short time the pain disappeared, the patient became much better.  The rest of his time in prison, the scientist devoted to the study of the properties of water. </p><p>  On the day the verdict was announced, Batmanghelidzha finished writing an article on the healing properties of water.  He knew that he would be sentenced to death, so after the sentence he presented his article to the judge.  What a surprise it was when the judge pardoned the scientist and allowed him to continue his research.  Throughout his life, the doctor has been promoting watering as an effective method for many diseases.  So the water saved the scientist from death. </p><p>  Human life is continuously connected with water.  A fragile water molecule, which, nevertheless, has many useful properties, is given to us by nature and we are obliged to protect the planet‚Äôs <span>water resources</span> , because water is life. </p>
