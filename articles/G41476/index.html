A maximum of three guests can be accommodated here.  The rooms are located in three two-story buildings.  Many of our compatriots who have visited the Sea Breeze Village 3 * (India, Goa) advise, if possible, to settle in rooms whose windows do not open onto the pool.  The fact is that, according to them, sometimes other tourists make noise around the pool all night long, interfering with the rest of the other guests.  Therefore, in order to protect yourself from such trouble, it is better to immediately take care of the room in which loud sounds will not reach you. </p><p>  As for the hotel apartments, they are, according to tourists, clean, bright and pleasantly decorated.  It has everything you need for living: a TV with cable channels, comfortable furniture, a refrigerator (no minibar), air conditioning, <span>ceiling fan,</span> bathroom with shower, balcony or terrace.  Throughout the hotel guests are provided with free Wi-Fi access.  True, as our compatriots note, the Internet does not ‚Äúcatch‚Äù well in all rooms.  But in general, there were no particular complaints about this.  As for the storage of documents and valuables, there are no safes in the apartments.  However, you can use the special cells at the reception.  But you should keep in mind that for this you must have your padlock.  Many tourists also got out of the situation by hiding valuables in suitcases equipped with padlocks with keys. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Service, staff </h2><p>  Rooms were cleaned every day.
