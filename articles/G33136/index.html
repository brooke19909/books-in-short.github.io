Glass beads were known in ancient Egypt, later Venice became the capital of beadwork.  This city was famous for its high quality glass.  For many years this art was available only to noble houses, since the material was quite expensive.  Today, everyone can weave a <span>product from beads</span> , since the technique is not so complicated, and the cost of the material, although it depends on the quality and manufacturer, is, in general, not high. </p><p>  One of the most popular types of this work is considered to be the weaving of flowers.  Roses, irises, tulips, daffodils and daisies - the flowers are very beautiful, and with proper dexterity, they are practically indistinguishable from the living.  Particular love of needlewomen enjoy pansies.  To weave such flowers out of beads is quite easy, but at the same time they look very beautiful. </p><h2>  Materials </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.interweave.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pansy Beads" class="if uuid-2668071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2668071.jpg"></div><p>  Properly selected beads are the key to easy and beautiful weaving.  Therefore, you should not take very cheap material: the beads in it are of different sizes, in addition, marriage is often found.  It is also worth paying attention to the <span>size of the beads.</span>  In one weave, it must be of the same size, otherwise the part will be uneven, which will significantly spoil the appearance of the product.  Therefore, it is best that all beads are not only of the same size, but also of one firm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the classic version, pansies made of beads make three-color: purple - sadness, yellow - surprise and white - hope.  For greater resemblance to natural flowers, yellow and purple can be taken in two shades and combined in one detail.  The use of matte beads of dense color will also contribute to proximity to the original.  But the use of clear glass beads will make the composition look more fragile and airy. </p><p>  To connect, you can take fishing line or wire.  In the first version, it will not be so noticeable in weaving, and it will not break, and in the second, the product holds its shape better, and it is also easier to weave and connect parts.  In any case, than to weave pansies from beads, the master will determine by trying both materials on his own. </p><h2>  Parallel weaving </h2><p>  There are many ways to weave beads, one of the most popular is parallel.  Its essence lies in the fact that the required number of beads is put on one end of the base - wire or fishing line, and the second end is passed through the same beads, but in the opposite direction.  Thus, the beads are located on two wires and are limited on both sides.  The next row is done in the same way, therefore it lies parallel to the previous one.  This method is well suited for creating small flat parts.  A feature is a certain angularity and the absence of smooth lines along the contour. </p><h2>  Petals </h2><p>  To weave pansy flowers with beads, you will need to make 5 details: one large lower petal, 2 lateral and upper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For weaving you will need: </p><ul><li>  Beads: purple, lilac, white, pale yellow, yellow, green, light green. </li><li>  Yellow beads (a little more than beads) - 3 pcs.  on the flower. </li><li>  Wire (must pass through the beads in 4 additions). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Scheme of parallel weaving Pansies" class="if uuid-2668054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2668054.jpg"></div><p>  For a large petal, it is necessary to prepare 2 wires, in the figure they are indicated in green and red.  Collect 6 white, one violet and 4 more white on the first wire, and on the second - 6 white, then thread into a purple bead on the first wire, and 5 more white.  Arrange the resulting workpiece crosswise, then pass the wires through the beads of the second row towards each other, while capturing the purple.  Next weave in parallel rows. </p><h2>  Leaflets and stamens </h2><p>  To weave the leaves in the same way as the petals, for greater resemblance to a living flower, it is better to use beads of two shades, as shown in the diagram. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Leaves and stamens of pansies pattern beads" class="if uuid-2668116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2668116.jpg"></div><p>  It is better to make 3-4 leaves, as they favorably shade the flower itself.  After all the parts are ready, you can proceed with the assembly.  Twist together the wires from the stamens, and then attach the petals around them.  Bottom should be large yellow, on the sides - lilac, and on top - two purple.  Again, twist the wires together, while fixing the necessary position.  Then weave the leaves.  To decorate the stem, you can wrap it with green thread, wire or paper.  Pansy beads are ready! </p><h2>  French technique </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="French beadwork technique" class="if uuid-2668208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2668208.jpg"></div><p>  This technique variant differs from the previous one in that the weaving starts from the center of the part by increasing the volume.  In order to start weaving a petal, it is necessary to make a small loop at the end of the wire so that the beads do not slip, then collect 4-5 beads and, departing from the first loop 5-7 cm, make a second loop, the length of which should be 6 cm, and place twisting - about 1 cm. Place the beads near the twisting of a larger loop, and put on another 6-7 beads on the free end of the wire.  Fix the wire over the first batch of beads, wrapping the working end around the axial, then put on another 6-7 beads and return to the larger loop.  Thus, weaving should be continued in a circle, adding 2-3 beads in each row.  After the part reaches the required size, untwist the first loop, and fasten the remaining end and hide it inside the part. </p><p>  In order for the part to turn out to be pointed, you need to make not one but two turns from above, around the axial wire, in which case the last bead of the arc will be between the first and second bead of the next arc, and the product will get an elongated shape. </p><p>  But in order to get a heart shape, like the bottom petal of pansies, it is not necessary to put on beads on the axial wire.  It is necessary to collect, for example, 15 beads, fold the wire in half and wind it to the axial one near the beginning of the arc.  The remaining arcs do the same. </p><h2>  Embroidery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.antiquepeek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bead Bag with Pansies" class="if uuid-2668070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2668070.jpg"></div><p>  No less interesting than weaving pansies with beads, embroidery also looks.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter whether it is continuous or an application.  Such flowers look great not only in pictures embroidered with beads, but also in the role of decorating clothes or even handbags.  The embroidery scheme for these colors is quite simple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.facetjewelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beer embroidery pattern Pansies" class="if uuid-2668086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2668086.jpg"></div><h2>  Products with pansies from beads </h2><p>  Delicate flowers, which are one of the first to delight the eye every spring, are great not only as an element of decor in the interior, but also as a decoration of things or in jewelry.
