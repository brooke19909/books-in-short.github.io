  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Human foot structure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Everyone is familiar with this picture from life: a lady doing makeup or hairstyle.  In general, at first glance, nothing interesting.  Yes, if you watch an ordinary woman.  Well, what if a girl who does not have hands is engaged in these ordinary activities? </p><p>  The reader will grin: ‚ÄúNonsense, however!  What will she use to dye her eyelashes, wind her hair on curlers, if she has no hands? ‚Äù  The fact of the matter is that such a woman exists!  Not only that, in fact, she not only does a great job with makeup and hair styling, but also makes tea on her own, spills it, puts sugar in a cup and even drinks it, carefully bringing it to her mouth.  And she does all this with her feet! </p><p>  And this wonderful lady can write with a pen and print on a computer, draw and even work with scissors if necessary.  And all this she amazingly performs with her legs!  And some individuals can even play with their feet on musical instruments, no matter how absurd it may sound.  After all, the <span>structure of a</span> person‚Äôs <span>legs</span> is extremely similar to the structure of the upper limbs, which allows changing hands in extreme conditions with legs. </p><p>  Of course, the above functions are not basic for the entire population of the Earth, it is rather an exception to the rule.  Still, the main function for the lower extremities of a person is universally considered to be the function of holding the body in an upright position while standing or squatting, as well as the adoption of the lying position and the movement function, for example, running, swimming, climbing, jumping and crawling in a plast or on all fours. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, legs are used by people to press and hold various pedals for a long time.  This skill is used by many when driving cars, sewing on mechanical or electric machines, working on a honey extractor connected to an electric drive and playing the organ or ionic </p><p>  If we compare the structure of the human leg and the structure of his arm, then we can note such a difference as more developed muscle mass and stronger bones.  It is known that the lower limbs account for an average of a quarter of all muscle mass!  That is why many people shift their hard work to their feet. </p><p>  For example, in the past, legs were used in winemaking and the preparation of building material for adobe or adobe houses, clay for utensils, and toys.  And if necessary, moving a very heavy object is most convenient to rest against your back and push it with your feet. </p><p>  And how beautiful the heroes in movies ‚Äúaction films‚Äù kick the doors with their feet!  Yes, and in many types of wrestling legs occupy an exceptional paramount place, what can I say. </p><p>  Let's look at the structure of a person‚Äôs legs, paying attention to the bones that make up the lower limb.  Three main components are distinguished here: thigh, lower leg and foot. </p><p>  The most durable and massive human bone is considered the femur.  She, together with the patella, which protects the knee joint, forms the thigh. </p><p>  The next is the lower leg, consisting of the <span>tibia</span> and <span>tibia.</span>  The structure of the human foot is much more complicated, since this part of the leg includes a large number of small bones.  There are 26 of them. </p><p>  <span>The structure of a</span> person‚Äôs <span>foot</span> is so thoughtfully and skillfully adapted to the life of an individual person that it remains only to bow before Mother Nature or the Creator.  Every detail is important in it, even the smallest. </p><p>  For example, it should be noted that all bones of the lower extremities are connected by joints.  The joints, in turn, consist of a joint bag, which is filled with a special lubricant called synovial fluid, and seals the joint tightly.  At the ends of the bones at the junction they are hyaline cartilage, which reduces friction during movement. </p><p>  The structure of a person‚Äôs knee differs from other joints in that it includes a meniscus that absorbs shock during jumps and while running.  But since the meniscus cannot be attributed to bones, it is deprived of the ability to grow together.  And if, during various injuries, <span>the meniscus ruptures,</span> then the doctors have no choice but to remove the damaged fragments, which, of course, reduces the mobility of the joint and in some cases brings suffering to the person, causing pain. </p>
