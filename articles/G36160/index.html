It is famous for its unique monuments of architecture, history, culture, which thousands of tourists come to admire.  In addition, it is a large economic center with a steadily developing industry.  A new three-star hotel ‚ÄúLyubim‚Äù can provide a decent vacation to both tourists and businessmen who have arrived in the city to participate in business events at various levels.  Yaroslavl will undoubtedly be remembered from the very best side for foreign guests, as the hotel provides all services at the highest European level. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  On the right bank of <span>the Kotorosl River,</span> within walking distance from the embankment and the bridge, the Hotel Lyubim (Yaroslavl) opened in 2014.  Its address is: Second Melnichnaya street, building number 3. Nearby is Moskovsky Avenue, leading to anywhere in the city, including the historical center.  Walking to the main attractions takes about 20-25 minutes, and by bus - only one stop.  It is also possible to quickly reach the Moskovsky station by any means of transport along the avenue, which is why the Lyubim hotel is especially convenient.  Yaroslavl is located just 100 km from the small town of Lyubim, in whose honor the hotel is named.  The area in which the hotel is built is quiet, cozy, having a relaxing rest after a day full of events and impressions.  Of the objects of urban infrastructure, only the Church of St. Nicholas is nearby, now, unfortunately, not functioning.  A little further, but also within walking distance, are the well-known Tugova Gora and Korovnitskaya Sloboda with the famous temple ensemble.  The remaining facilities near the hotel are residential buildings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Lyubim Yaroslavl" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1049139.jpg" width="598"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The hotel was designed and built in such a way that the whole hotel complex ‚ÄúLyubim‚Äù turned out.

This is Dvoryankino, next to the more elite Barinovo, and a couple of tens of meters from it is Sloboda.  All buildings are four-story, individually designed.  Unfortunately, elevators are not provided for them.  Around the center of the complex is a chic and at the same time home-style cozy restaurant.  In the courtyard formed by the buildings "Barinovo" (the most spacious, located on the side of Tropinsky proezd) and "Sloboda" (somewhat smaller), flowerbeds are laid out, benches are installed, and a playground is equipped.  The Dvoryankino building is located closer to the entrance to the complex.  For those who come by car, there are two spacious and convenient parking lots located around the clock under the vigilant supervision of guards and video cameras. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The infrastructure focused on comfortable living has the Lyubim Hotel (Yaroslavl).
