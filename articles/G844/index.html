Young people do not fully understand what signing a loan agreement means. </li></ul>

    <p>  The youth card has many features.  Annual service costs about 750 rubles per year, which is less compared to other banks.  A loan is issued at 33.9%.  Clients can borrow money without interest if they take advantage of the grace period.  And since the card is connected to the popular Visa or MasterCard payment systems, discounts and bonuses will apply. </p><h2>  Recommendations for borrowers </h2><p>  How many years they give a loan at Sberbank depends on many factors.  Borrowers need to be responsible for this type of transaction.  Money should be borrowed only if necessary, since interest is accrued on it.  The amount must be real, since it will still need to be returned. </p><p>  Even if a young borrower has an employment history of more than 3 months, he may be denied a loan.  Usually in these cases, guarantors are required.  The bank must be sure that the borrowed money will be repaid.  Collateral, for example, real estate, is sometimes required. </p><p>  After receiving any loan, a credit history begins to take shape.  If the funds were returned on time, the bank will certainly cooperate with such a client.  Moreover, in the future more favorable conditions are provided. </p>
