After the National Socialist Party came to power under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, the Weimar Republic fell and was replaced by the Third Reich.  The secrets, mysteries and secrets of its rulers excite the minds of mankind so far.  Consider some features of this empire in the article. </p><h2>  Third Reich </h2><div class="photo" data-original="spherebowl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler with Hitler Boys" class="if uuid-2518341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14550/2518341.jpg"></div><p>  It was generally believed that the Third Reich is the Third Rome, and the Germans living in it are the descendants of the great Romans. </p><p>  The first Reich was called the state in Europe - the Holy Roman Empire, which included many of the European countries.  The basis of the empire was considered Germany.  This state lasted from 962 to 1806. </p><p>  From 1871 to 1918 the period came, which is called the Second Reich.  Its decline came after the surrender of Germany, the economic crisis and the subsequent abdication of Kaiser from the throne. </p><p>  Hitler planned that the empire of the Third Reich would stretch from the Urals to the Atlantic Ocean.  The Reich, which was prophesied for a thousand years, fell thirteen. </p><p>  The Fuhrer dreamed of the greatness of Germany and its revival as a world power.  However, the Nazi party was a product of bitterness and chaos. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Already initially all Hitler's speeches were filled with a spirit of violence and hatred.  Strength was the only power he recognized.  For the Germans, the new order primarily meant the return of national dignity, lost in 1918.  Hitler managed to combine humiliation and desire to exalt himself, giving these feelings a new monstrous meaning. </p><h2>  The birth of Nazi ideology.  Aryan race </h2><p>  For outsiders, one of the secrets of the Third Reich was such a thing as National Socialism.  Hundreds of rituals sprang from nowhere and fascinated millions of Germans. </p><p>  Darwin's theory led people into confusion.  The centuries-old faith in God has been undermined.  Occult sects and circles arose throughout the country.  Secret societies were created that tried to revive ancient German mythology. </p><p>  They drew knowledge from the writings of Guido von List, an Austrian esoteric who claimed that he had discovered the ancient knowledge of the German people. </p><p>  From the end of the 19th century, crowds of seekers of truth have flocked to ancient and mysterious Tibet.  Many do not want to believe that a person descended from a monkey, and come here to search for perfection and knowledge of the secrets of the world. </p><p>  One of their travelers was Elena Petrovna Blavatsky, who created the work The Secret Doctrine.  In this book, she writes about how in one of the Tibetan monasteries she was shown an ancient manuscript that tells about the secrets of the world and reveals the secrets of the past.  In the books of Blavatsky much is said about the seven root races, one of which, the Aryan, must save the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Liszt Society, together with German mythology, skillfully combines the works of Blavatsky.  In its charter, it prescribes the laws of the future Aryan people. </p><p>  Along with Liszt's theory, the science of eugenics arises based on Darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest.  She suggests weeding out the weak and sick, giving evolution a chance to create a healthy generation.  It is increasingly believed that heredity is the key to the well-being of a nation.  From Britain, eugenics falls into Germany, where it is called "purity of race" and deeply affects the German occultists. </p><p>  After the death of Liszt, J√∂rg Lanz took his place and, combining occultism and eugenics, created theosoology - the occult religion of the race. </p><p>  The history of the creation of the Third Reich is closely connected with the name of Lanz.  When Hitler comes to power, he, being his ardent admirer, divides the inhabitants of Germany into two parts, the first law, pure Aryans and those who will be their subjects. </p><h2>  Secret societies </h2><p>  In his visions of the ancient tribes of Guido von List, he saw the secret order of priests-rulers, the guardians of all the secret knowledge of the German people, and called it "Armanenshaft."  Liszt claimed that Christianity forced the guardians to go into the shadows, and their knowledge guarded such societies as Masons, Templars, and Rosicrucians.  In 1912, the Order was founded, which entered many of the leaders of the National Socialists.  They call themselves the "Armist Assembly." </p><p>  The renunciation of Kaiser's power was a terrible blow to the heads of secret societies, as it was believed that the aristocracy had the purest blood and the most powerful supernatural abilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Among the many groups organizing the counter-revolutionary nationalist opposition is the Tulle society, the bed of anti-Semites who preaches Liszt‚Äôs teachings.  This secret society was popular among high society and strictly respected the purity of Aryan blood.  The hairs of the true heirs of the race of the gods should have been blond or dark blond, their eyes light and their skin pale.  In the Berlin department, even the jaw and head size were measured.  In 1919, under the auspices of Tulle, a German workers' party was founded, Hitler became a member and then leader.  Later, Tulle was transformed into Anenerb, another of the secrets of the Third Reich.  The symbol of the party is the swastika, the exact form of which was chosen by Hitler himself. </p><h2>  The mystery of the swastika </h2><div class="photo" data-original="de.academic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soldiers with the flags of the Third Reich" class="if uuid-2518342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14550/2518342.jpg"></div><p>  The Nazi party chose the swastika as its emblem in 1920.  It spread everywhere - on buckles, sabers, orders, banners, being a symbol of occultism and esotericism. </p><p>  Hitler personally designed the sketch of the flag of the Third Reich.  The red color is a social thought in motion, the white represents nationalism, and the swastika is a symbol of the Aryan struggle and their victory, which will always be anti-Semitic. </p><p>  The swastika was a symbol of the basic Nazi dogma, which claimed that absolute will would triumph over the forces of darkness and chaos.  In the world of social nationalism, the Aryan race was the bearer and distributor of order.  Before the swastika became a symbol of the Nazi party, it began to be used in the form of amulets by the Austrians and Germans.  This was during the First World War and took its roots in the teachings of Blavatsky and Guido von List. </p><p>  Elena Petrovna showed seven characters, the most powerful of which was the swastika.  In Tibetan mythology, the swastika is a solar symbol, meaning the sun, as well as the god of fire Agni.  The swastika was a manifestation of light, order and fortitude. </p><p>  Guido von List, traveling in the past, reveals the secret meaning of the runes.  Ancient signs, according to Liszt, were a powerful energy weapon. </p><p>  The Nazis used runes everywhere.  For example, the ‚ÄúSig‚Äù rune - ‚Äúvictory‚Äù, was the emblem of the Hitler agent, the double ‚ÄúSig‚Äù - the SS brand name, and the death rune ‚ÄúMan‚Äù replaced the crosses from the monuments. </p><p>  The photo of the flag of the Third Reich in the hands of Nazi soldiers still inspire fear in thousands of people. </p><p>  Among all the strange characters, Liszt, like Blavatsky, placed the swastika above all.  He told a legend about how God created the world with the help of a fire broom, a swastika that symbolized the act of creation. </p><p>  About the swastika and other secrets of the Third Reich documentaries have been shot a lot.  They provide facts and evidence about the secret symbolism that Nazism was filled with. </p><div class="photo" data-original="davidtate.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flag of the Third Reich with swatik" class="if uuid-2515523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89825/2515523.jpg"></div><h2>  The Black Sun of the Third Reich </h2><p>  One of the secrets of the Third Reich was the elite troops of the SS, keeping many puzzles and secrets.  Even members of the Nazi party did not know what was going on inside this organization. </p><p>  Initially, they were the Fuhrer‚Äôs bodyguards, and then, led by Hitler‚Äôs personal guard, Henry Himler, they became a mystical elite.  It was from their ranks that a new super race was to appear. </p><p>  People were seen as ideal samples of pure Aryan blood.  Getting there was not so easy.  Even one seal blocked the path to this selected detachment of the Third Reich.  True Aryans had to prove the presence of German ancestors since 1750 and study the racial biology and esoteric destiny of the Aryans. </p><p>  SS turned into a secret occult order engaged in the creation of an empire.  Aryans had to subjugate all nations.  According to Nazi mythology, it was believed that in the solar system there are two suns - visible and black, that which can be seen only by knowing the truth.  It was precisely the symbol of this sun that the SS detachments should have become, the secret decoding of which translated as ‚ÄúBlack Sun‚Äù (German: Schwarze Sonne). </p><div class="photo" data-original="flipmeme.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slender ranks of soldiers from the SS detachments" class="if uuid-2515529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89825/2515529.jpg"></div><h2>  Anenerbe </h2><p>  In 1935, the historical Anenerbe Society, the ‚ÄúAncestral Heritage‚Äù, was created.  His official task was to study the historical roots of the German people and the spread of the Aryan race throughout the world.  This is the only organization that has officially engaged in magic and mysticism with the support of the state.  By 1937, she became the SS research department. </p><p>  The scientists at Anenerbe had to study history and rewrite it so that it was the Aryans, the blue-eyed and fair-haired Nordic race, who brought light to the rest of humanity, that became the ancestors of all mankind.  All discoveries were made by the Germans, and it was they who created the entire civilization.  The Nazis recruited philologists and folklorists, archaeologists and engineers.  Special Sonderkommands were sent to the occupied territories to search for ancient values. </p><p>  Experts gathered around the world were engaged in astronomy, mathematics, genetics, medicine, as well as psychotropic weapons and methods of influencing the human brain.  They studied magical rites, occult sciences, paranormal abilities of people and set experiments on them.  The goal was to contact the higher minds of ancient civilizations and alien races to gain new knowledge, including about high technology. </p><p>  But first of all, Anenerbe scientists were interested in Tibet. </p><h2>  SS Expeditions to Tibet </h2><p>  In the thirties of the XX century, Tibet was practically unstudied and inaccessible, and therefore full of mysteries.  Word of mouth passed on the legend that the mythical Shambhala, a country of good and truth, is hidden in the Himalayas.  There, in deep caves, the guardians of our world lived, who knew great secrets. </p><p>  Interested in the secrets of Tibet and the Third Reich.  The Nazis tried several times to get into the country. </p><p>  In 1938, the Austrian biologist Ernst Schaeffer, under the auspices of "Anenerbe" sent to Lhasa. </p><p>  In addition to the mythical Shambhala, Schaeffer was supposed to establish ties with the Dalai Lama and the Prince Regent.  Germany promised to help Tibet in the fight against the British.  Schaeffer intended to smuggle weapons for the Tibetans to attack English posts on the border with Nepal. </p><p>  After Schaeffer, the Nazis made many expeditions, taking out from there ancient texts written in Sanskrit.  There is a version according to which Anenerbe reached Shambhala and came into contact with powerful spirits.  The sages agreed to help Hitler and for a long time provided magical support. </p><p>  It is said that the gas chambers in the concentration camps and the people who were burned in them were sacrifices to the Nazi gods. </p><p>  However, the <span>dark gods</span> did not hear the pleas of the Nazis for world domination, and the bright ones turned away, not recognizing violence and bloody victims. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stateexpressindia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of Tibet is Lhasa" class="if uuid-2515520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89825/2515520.jpg"></div><h2>  Underground cities of the Third Reich </h2><p>  The secrets of the Third Reich are kept underground by the SS cities and military factories.  Some of these facilities are still classified by secret services. </p><p>  The underground plants of the Third Reich have become one of the largest projects of mankind.  When Allied aviation began to strike at military factories, Minister of Arms <span>Albert Speer</span> in 1943 proposed moving them underground. </p><p>  Thousands of prisoners were driven to concentration camps, which were forced to work in inhuman conditions. </p><p>  In the town of Nordhausen, in the rock, there are underground tunnels where they made one of the secret developments of the Luftwaffe - the FAU-2 rocket.  From here, missiles were delivered to the launch points via the underground railway. </p><p>  On the territory of Falkenhagen, in a dense forest, the Zeyverg object is hidden, which is still partially classified.  The Nazis planned to produce terrible weapons there - the nerve gas Zarin.  Death from him occurred within six minutes.  Fortunately, the plant was never completed.  He continues to keep the secrets of the Third Reich.  The underground cities of SS are not only in Germany, but also in Poland. </p><p>  Not far from Salzburg, an underground plant has been built with secret tunnel branches, code-named "Cement".  They were going to make intercontinental ballistic missiles there, but they did not manage to launch the project. </p><p>  Under F√ºrstenstein Castle near Waldenburg lies one of the greatest secrets of the Third Reich.  This is an underground complex in which a complex shelter system was created for Hitler and the top of the Wehrmacht.  In case of danger, the elevator lowered the Fuhrer to a depth of 50 meters.  There was a mine, the ceiling height of which reached 30 meters.  The construction was given the code name "Rize" - "Giant". </p><div class="photo" data-original="cbsn2.cbsistatic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Underground tunnels in Poland" class="if uuid-2517235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89825/2517235.jpg"></div><h2>  Treasures of the Third Reich </h2><p>  After Germany begins to lose, Hitler gives the order to hide the gold that the Nazis confiscated in the conquered territories.  Wagons loaded with treasures are sent to the untouched lands of Bavaria and Thuringia. </p><p>  In May 1945, the Allies seized a fascist train with innumerable wealth, and in the mine ‚ÄúMerkers‚Äù discovered boxes full of silver and gold coins.  After that, rumors spread about the new secret of the Third Reich.  Where are Hitler's treasures, many adventurers wanted to know. </p><p>  In total, the Nazis confiscated more than 8 billion gold from the occupied countries, but, as it turned out, this was not enough for them. </p><p>  In the concentration camps of the Sonderkommando, they collected gold from the crowns of the killed prisoners, as well as rings, earrings, chains and other jewelry confiscated during the searches.  According to some reports, by the end of the war, about 17 tons of gold had been collected.  Crowns were remelted at a factory in Frankfurt, making ingots of them, and then transported to a special account "Melmer" in the Reichsbank.  When Germany lost the war, gold still lay on deposits, but when the Russians entered Berlin, it was not there. </p><p>  From the underground residence of the F√ºhrer - "Rize", only a part of the drawings remained, so there were rumors that not all the tunnels were found.  They say that somewhere underground, a freight train filled with gold is hidden.  Dimensions of structures indicate that they are built, including for transport. </p><p>  The legend of the "golden train" says that in April 1945 the train left for the city of Wroclaw and disappeared.  Scientists argue that this is impossible, since the city at that time was surrounded by Soviet troops, and he could not get there.  However, this does not prevent treasure seekers from continuing to search, and some claim to have seen cars standing in the dungeons. </p><p>  It is well known that most of the gold was hidden in the Merkers mine.  In the last days of the Third Reich, the Nazis transported the remaining treasures throughout Germany.  They lowered gold into mines, drowned in rivers and lakes, buried them at battlefields, and even hid them in death camps.  The secret of the Third Reich, where Hitler‚Äôs treasure is located, has not been solved until now.  Perhaps he is lying and waiting for his master. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theeventchronicle.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.theeventchronicle.com/media/informational/hidden-underground-base-is-hitlers-nazi-empire-in-antarctica-claims-author/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Collage: Hitler, Flying Saucers and SS Troops" class="if uuid-2515588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89825/2515588.jpg"></div><h2>  Nazi bases in Antarctica </h2><p>  In the summer of 1945, two German submarines from the Fuhrer‚Äôs personal convoy moored on the shores of Argentina.  When the captains were interrogated, it turned out that both boats were repeatedly at the south pole.  It turned out that it hides many secrets of the Third Reich and Antarctica. </p><p> After the discovery of the mainland in 1820 by Bellingshausen and Lazarev, they forgot about it for a century.  However, Germany began to show active interest in Antarctica.  In the late thirties, Luftwaffe pilots flew there and staked out the territory, calling it New Swabia.  Submarines and the Swabia research vessel with equipment and engineers began to regularly go to the shores of Antarctica.  Perhaps there during the war began to transport important people and secret production.  Judging by the documents found, the Nazis created a military base in Antarctica, which had the code name "Base-211".  It was needed for the search for uranium, control over the countries of America and so that in case of defeat in the war the ruling elite could hide there. </p><p>  After the war, when the Americans began to recruit scientists working for the Wehrmacht, they found that most of them disappeared.  Missing and more than a hundred submarines.  It also remains the secret of the Third Reich. </p><p>  The fleet sent by the Americans to Antarctica to destroy the Nazi base returned with nothing, and the admiral spoke about obscure flying objects, like saucers that jumped out of the water and attacked ships. </p><p>  Later, drawings were found in the archives of Germany that indicated that scientists had indeed developed disc-shaped aircraft. </p><p>  A better understanding of the events in which Germany took part from 1939 to 1945 will help the documentary "The Third Reich in Color."  It contains unique shots from the lives of ordinary people, ordinary soldiers and the Nazi elite, the country's public life in the form of parades, rallies and military campaigns, as well as its "dark side" - a concentration camp with a monstrous number of victims. </p><p>  We are used to watching all the horrors, secrets, secrets and mysteries of the Third Reich from TV screens and book pages.  Let these stories about Nazism be remembered by people and, having remained in the past, will never be repeated. </p>
