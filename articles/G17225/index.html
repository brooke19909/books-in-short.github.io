The air harbor has a second name - Fiumicino, at the location of the air hub.  Russian flights arrive at terminal number three - the largest of four operating terminals.  For those who decide to arrange a Roman vacation, the next step after getting their luggage is to choose the route how to get from Fiumicino to Termini.  In fact, everything is quite simple.  And in this article it is considered what roads lead to Rome from Fiumicino. </p><h2>  International Airport  Leonardo da Vinci </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.airportconnection.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fiumicino Airport" class="if uuid-2568405" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92555/2568405.jpg"></div><p>  The most popular air gates of Rome, and along with the whole of Italy, are located 30 km from the Italian capital, in a southwest direction from it.  The airport is the busiest air hub in the country: annually about 40 million people use its services (by 2044 this figure is planned to be increased to 100 million due to infrastructure changes).  The spacious territory of the airport is equipped with the necessary signs, which are easy to navigate.  It is best to pre-select a convenient method for yourself how to get from Fiumicino to Termini in order to purposefully search for necessary signs upon arrival.  In an extreme case, you can always contact the station employees and they will certainly tell you the way.  The figure below shows the general map of the terminals of Fiumicino airport with the indication of objects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.fiumicinoairport.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General map of Fiumicino airport terminals with objects" class="if uuid-2568402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92555/2568402.jpg"></div><h2>  Rome main station </h2><p>  Sunny Rome is one of the most visited cities in the world, so it is not surprising that the Italian capital has all the conditions for comfortable movement of local residents and visitors.  The transport heart of Rome is the modern and spacious Termini Station, considered one of the best stations in Europe.  The infrastructure of the station is well developed: there is everything necessary for the traveler, and a convenient location allows you to drive (or even walk) from Termini to many city attractions. </p><p>  But our main question: "How to get to Rome to Termini from Fiumicino airport?"  There are several ways.  They vary in price and travel time, and each tourist will be able to choose the most suitable option for themselves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bedandbreakfastroma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Termini Station in Rome" class="if uuid-2568406" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92555/2568406.jpg"></div><h2>  Fiumicino - Termini: how to get there? </h2><p>  The most popular options are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  a train; </li><li>  bus; </li><li>  Taxi. </li></ul><p>  The most convenient and fastest way is a taxi, which is also the most expensive. </p><p>  The most budget option is a bus, but you will spend twice as much time on a trip. </p><p>  A high-speed train is a cross between a taxi and a bus: it gets to Termini quite quickly, has an average fare, but is not suitable for night trips. </p><p>  Let's take a closer look at how to get from Fiumicino to Termini. </p><h2>  Option number 1 (14 euros) </h2><p>  Here we answer the question of how to get from Fiumicino to Termini by train. </p><p>  A comfortable Leonardo Express high-speed train leaves the airport every half hour for Rome's main station. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alternatrip.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leonardo Express" class="if uuid-2568411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92555/2568411.jpg"></div><p>  To get to the railway platform, you must follow the signs with the inscription Train on the yellow billboards at the airport.  Tickets are sold in special machines, at many points with the press or at the box office located next to the platforms.  The fare is 14 euros.  For children under 4 years of age, free travel is provided, and for children from 4 to 12 years of age - free travel for each adult who has paid for his ticket. </p><p>  In front of the platforms are turnstiles, the passage through which is possible by tickets.  Composters are installed near the paths, since the composting procedure is mandatory in Italy, do not forget to carry it out after getting onto the platforms (there are instructions on the composters, so it will be easy to understand).  The validated ticket is valid for 90 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The express train leaves the second way and travels to Termini 32 minutes.  Remember that Leonardo Express is not suitable for night trips: it starts moving in the early morning (06:23) and finishes work closer to midnight (23:23).  On board the train, all conditions for a comfortable trip are created: comfortable seats, luggage places, a clean and spacious lounge, special places for people with disabilities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Hide1228, " data-source="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Leonardo_express_03.jpg"><img itemprop="image" alt="Salon Leonardo Express" class="if uuid-2568408" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92555/2568408.jpg"></div><h2>  Option number 2 (5-7 euros) </h2><p>  Consider how to get from Fiumicino to Termini by bus. </p><p>  The most affordable means of transportation to Termini is the bus.  Travel time is one hour.  Different carriers provide services, but the ticket price is approximately the same for everyone (5-6 euros): </p><ul><li>  Cotral; </li><li>  Terravision </li><li>  SIT Bus Shuttle; </li><li>  Tirreno Azienda Mobilita (T.A. M.); </li><li>  Rome Airport Bus. </li></ul><p>  The only company working around the clock is Cotral. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.autobusweb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cotral Buses" class="if uuid-2568429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92555/2568429.jpg"></div><p>  A bus stop is located near Terminal 1 and 2. The stop address at Termini Station is Piazza dei Cinquecento.  On the official website of the carrier, you can see the flight schedule.  It is better to do this shortly before the trip, because the schedule is updated from time to time.  Ticket price - 5 euros.  It can be purchased at newsstands, tobacco shops and other points of sale at the airport.  The shops are closed at night, so a ticket can be bought in the driver‚Äôs cabin at a price of 7 euros (cash only). </p><p>  Of the minuses, we note a small number of flights both day and night, as well as dependence on weekends and holidays (on such days the number of flights is limited). </p><p>  For other carriers, the work schedule is quite tight and is not tied to holidays and weekends. </p><p>  Terravision buses depart from Terminal 3 every 30 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rometoolkit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Terravision Buses" class="if uuid-2568421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92555/2568421.jpg"></div><p>  The final stop is Termini Station (via Giovanni Giolitti, 38).  Ticket price - 6 euros.  On the official website you can pre-buy a ticket for the trip (just remember to print it!).  The cost of an electronic ticket is 5 euros.  When buying, you will need to choose the time of the trip, but if suddenly your flight is delayed, then this is not scary: the ticket is valid for the whole day.  Baggage and children under 12 are free.  By the way, the sale of electronic tickets is practiced by all carriers, but you can buy tickets at the box office at the bus station or directly from the driver. </p><p>  SIT Bus Shuttle buses depart from the bus station adjacent to Terminal 3. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lavacanza.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SIT Bus Shuttle Buses" class="if uuid-2568426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92555/2568426.jpg"></div><p>  Flights depart every 20-30 minutes.  Tickets cost 6 euros.  For children under 4 years of age, travel is free.  Stop at Termini station - via Marsala, 5. Similar conditions with Tirreno Azienda Mobilita (T.A.M.): flights depart every half an hour, ticket price is 6 euros. </p><p>  Buses are located at the bus station at Terminal 3. The final stop is Termini Train Station (via Giovanni Giolitti, 10).  Another airport transfer company to Termini is called Rome Airport Bus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.romeairportbus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buses Rome Airport Bus" class="if uuid-2568438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92555/2568438.jpg"></div><p>  Tickets cost 6.90 euros.  The final stop is in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãTermini Station (via Giovanni Giolitti). </p><p>  As you can see, you can get to Termini by bus without any problems.  A sufficient number of flights allows you to quickly leave the airport, and comfortable conditions (comfortable lounges, air conditioning, Wi-Fi) will make the trip a pleasant one.  Tickets can be bought on the official websites of carriers or purchased on the spot.  Before the trip, take a look at the websites of companies to know the latest information about the departure times of the first and last bus. </p><h2>  Option number 3 (from 50 euros) </h2><p>  How to get from Fiumicino Airport to Termini by taxi? </p><p>  The most convenient way to travel is a taxi, which can be taken on the spot or booked in advance.  At the exits from terminals 1, 2 and 3, taxi stands are located: licensed white cars with the TAXI sign. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.065551.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Licensed cars" class="if uuid-2568441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92555/2568441.jpg"></div><p>  If you decide to order a taxi in advance, then you will have the opportunity to independently choose the class of the car and additional functionality (child seat, a more spacious trunk, etc.).  The company providing the transfer monitors all flights, so if the plane is delayed, you won‚Äôt have to worry about being late and you won‚Äôt need to pay extra for the wait.  The driver will meet you at the exit from the baggage claim area with a sign with your name. </p><h2>  Additional options </h2><p>  Although Termini is the transport hub of the city, from which it is easy to get to final destination, in some cases we advise you to keep in mind other options: </p><ul><li>  From Fiumicino you can reach Rome via the Sabina-Fiumicino (FM1) metro line.  At Ostiense, Tuscolana, Tiburtina stations, you can transfer on lines A or B and get to many significant points of the city.  Therefore, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the metro map before the trip, perhaps so you will quickly get to the right place. </li><li>  For a large company, a minibus (shuttle) is ideal, which can be pre-ordered.  Since the cabin accommodates several people, the cost of the trip will not be sky-high. </li><li>  If Rome is not the only city you plan to visit in Italy, then perhaps you should consider car rental services, especially since the prices are quite reasonable. </li></ul><h2>  How to get back to Fiumicino from Termini </h2><p>  Return to the airport can be reached in the same ways as to the station.  Leonardo Express flights depart from platforms 23 and 24 from 05:35 to 22:35.  Buses depart from the terminus of each of the carriers, and the schedule is best checked on the official sites before the trip.  Taxis can be taken at the station itself or ordered in advance on Russian-language sites, for example, KiwiTaxi. </p><h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  As you can see, the question of how to get from Fiumicino airport to Termini station should not really worry, because the Italians approached its decision very responsibly, providing various options for every taste and budget.  Of course, the most convenient way is a taxi, but a high-speed train or bus for unpretentious travelers is more than a worthy alternative. </p>
