    <p>  <span>The concept of "state form"</span> is considered one of the most important characteristics.  It is inextricably linked with the content (the unity of all components).  Today, the form of the state is the organization and organization of power in the country.  The content allows you to establish the ownership of the government and its actors. </p><p>  The form of the state reflects the system of organization of power in the country, explains the procedure for the formation of administrative bodies.  In addition, <span>this concept</span> determines the duration of authority, methods for their implementation, and so on.  Simply put, the form of state is an external expression of internal content. </p><p>  The way power is formed in a country is based on three main elements.  Specialists call the form of the device, board and mode as these components. </p><p>  It should be noted <span>that such an understanding was</span> far from immediate.  For a long period, it was believed that the form of the state includes only the concept of government and structure.  However, later the definition of "political regime and dynamics" joined.  In the course of lengthy discussions, a concept was adopted consisting of a combination of the three elements mentioned above. </p><p>  Correlation of type and form of state </p><p>  There is no clear proportion between the two concepts.  Features of each particular <span>type of state</span> can be established based on an analysis of the organizational structure in it.  The methods of exercising power are also taken into account. </p><p>  Specialists note that within the same state type different forms can occur.  In other cases, the opposite is true.  States of different types may have the same shape. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Organization of organization and government in each specific situation in any historical period is determined mainly by the level of maturity of political and public life.  Of great importance are the tasks and goals.  Thus, the category used to determine the form of the state has a direct dependence on the content of the state and is determined by it (content). </p><p>  The cultural level of the population, the nature of its religious beliefs, historical traditions, and national characteristics have a serious impact on the organization and structure of power in the country.  Climate conditions also have an effect. </p><p>  The specificity of the form is determined in accordance with the nature of the relationship between the state and non-governmental entities (trade unions, parties, public organizations, the church and others). </p><p>  Of course, in different countries, the organization and structure of power has its own specifics, features.  The signs of this or that state form in the course of social development can be filled with new content, and at the same time enriched in interaction and interconnection.  Moreover, as experts say, the organization and structure of power in all existing countries has some common characteristics.  This allows you to find a definition for each component of the state form. </p><p>  The most important practical and theoretical value is the scientific approach in the study of different aspects of the organization and structure of power.  <span>Scientific research</span> contributes to the identification of random and regular phenomena in the development of the country, the synthesis of information and the application of best practices in the construction of the state. </p><p>  At the same time, analysts note that even minor errors and the smallest mistakes in the implementation of solutions to vital problems can provoke acute <span>political conflicts,</span> which, in turn, can entail severe material and moral losses, and in some cases lead to loss of life. </p>
