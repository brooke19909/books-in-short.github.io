    <p>  By Sicilian standards, the hotel service is quite economical and competitive, based on the combination of "price / quality".  The cost of the current weekly tour, including the price of tickets, is 78,281 rubles. In return, the vacationer feels himself to be a welcome guest, and receives a full-fledged healing vacation. </p><p>  Many tourists, taking advantage of the island's excellent traffic, spend most of their vacation in Sicily, caressing the eyes with citrus orchards and grape valleys, palm trees and mountain landscapes.  The island is known worldwide for its balneocenters. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Usually, Russian tourists who have purchased a tour to the mentioned Letojanni hotel, first fly to the airport of Catania (the provincial capital), from where they get to the hotel in an hour by transfer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A calm family hotel is considered Antares Hotel Letojanni 4 * (island of Sicily).  It is located on the dominant hill above the village of Letojanni.  The latter is tiny, but very neat: the embankment and a couple of streets parallel to it. </p><p>  However, despite the rocky terrain, tourists do not have to wipe the sweat up the stairs up and down.  In a modern hotel complex, this inconvenience was initially eliminated by architects.  Elevator and funicular transport works perfectly here. </p><p>  The hotel complex is a very romantic place.  So nine out of ten couples in love who rested at Antares Hotel 4 * consider it. </p><h2>  Building, territory </h2><p>  The complex of the Antares Le Terrazze 4 * hotel in Sicily is three buildings located on a slope.  The lower building is called "Antares", the upper is called "Olympo".  Between them, the terrace is the middle building - Antares Le Terrazze.  Tourists are transported between the residential buildings by a funicular providing a panoramic view of the area.  From the hotel complex "Antares" with the help of an elevator they can go down to the beach and the resort town of Letojanni. </p>

    <p>  The territory of the hotel complex is neat, tastefully landscaped.  On balconies and terraces of residential buildings there are many hanging flowerpots with lushly flowering plants matched in color.  Alleys of royal palms, geometrically trimmed topiary trees, fresh greenery of neat lawns ... Gardeners plant plants so that strollers constantly see blooming buds on the flower beds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Beautifully, like a hall with columns, the reception area is decorated.  It has a stylish semicircular reception desk.  The public areas of the hotel are cozy, furnished with solid wooden furniture, air conditioning. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Developed infrastructure has a modern hotel Antares 4 * in Sicily.  It has a separate air-conditioned lounge for relaxation, panoramic terraces.  Convenience of movement of guests is provided by 9 elevators.  Near the hotel there is the A18 highway, buses to the city regularly run. </p><p>  The hotel has conference rooms equipped with video, audio, computer equipment.  There is a modern business center. </p><p>  The infrastructure of the village of Letojanni is interesting for a shop with economists, located to the left of the road to the sea, local residents shop there.  If you go another 400 meters in the same direction, then there is a ‚Äúminute‚Äù cafe in the form of a stall where you can have an inexpensive and tasty snack.  By the way, the cappuccino is not packaged there, but natural, as it should be. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The staff of the Antares Olimpo 4 * hotel (Sicily) is helpful and attentive.  However, there is a language problem: the Sicilians (which is natural) do not know not only Russian, but also English.  Therefore, to communicate with them, it is desirable to have at least initial communication skills in Italian plus a phrasebook.  A tablet with a Russian-Italian phrasebook will also help communication (at the level of notes). </p><p>  However, before you go on a Sicilian tour, it is useful to acquire some knowledge in communicating in Italian.  Fortunately, there are no complex sounds inherent in the English language.  Moreover, the Italian language is concise and compact. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  278 rooms make up the housing stock of the Antares Le Terrazze 4 * hotel (Sicily).
