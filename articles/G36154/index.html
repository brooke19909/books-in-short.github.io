More than two thousand kilometers separate it from the capital of our country.  To get into it, you need to spend several days on the train or several hours on the plane.  This is the first Russian city in Siberia.  The population of Tyumen has been constantly growing for over five years, and therefore the city is attractive to developers of the residential real estate sector.  A striking example is the "European" LCD.  Tyumen allocated a place in its heart for its development, that is, in the center of the city. </p>

    <h2>  Tyumen city </h2><p>  The southwest of Siberia, the bank of the Tura River, became the home for Tyumen.  Over three centuries, the population of the city grew from four thousand to more than seven hundred thousand people.  This is due to both natural growth and the migration flow of people. </p><p>  As for industry, these are mainly large and medium-sized enterprises engaged in oil refining, the production of machinery and equipment, and electronic and optical equipment.  The Trans-Siberian Railway passes through the city, which makes it the country's most important transportation hub.  In such conditions, the developers of Tyumen only prosper, erecting more and more residential complexes, one of which is the "European" LCD (Tyumen) under construction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The developer of the LCD "European" (Tyumen) is a construction company with a berry name - "Lingonberry".  It was founded thirteen years ago in order to carry out design and trade.  Over time, a construction network is developing in Tyumen, which is constantly expanding.  Since 2015, Brusniki, as a large construction organization, has belonged to one of the leading leadership places in this network.  The developer is moving on to the construction of residential buildings, entire neighborhoods, and the implementation of projects to improve the city.  Until now, the company has been actively working and continues to delight Tyumen with well-executed projects, both already built and under construction, like the Evropeisky LCD (Tyumen). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  <span>The residential complex is</span> designed as a whole residential quarter, consisting of twenty-six residential buildings.  All houses have the same number of storeys - seventeen floors each.  "European" LCD (Tyumen) is being built in accordance with the priority of construction.  In total, five queues are provided.

    <p>  The residential complex has several advantages.  This, for example, is the horizontal wiring of the heating system that is carried out in apartments, which allows controlling the heat consumption.  For sound insulation, multilayer wall laying with mineral wool is provided.  This is also the arrangement of warm loggias, which make it possible to use them in the form of an office. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  The "European" residential complex (Tyumen), although located within the city itself, is located at a considerable distance from industrial enterprises, on the shores of the huge lake Alebashevo.  There are also a lot of green spaces around, which as a whole creates a favorable ecological situation.  From the other two sides of the complex, the Tura River flows, the park of the 65th anniversary of Victory is located. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews: positive and negative </h2><p>  LCD "European" (Tyumen) already has feedback from real estate investors, as some residential buildings were commissioned and settled.  Mostly in the above three blocks.  You can already hear both positive and negative reviews. </p><p>  Most positive are related to the location of the residential complex, its location near the largest reservoirs of the city and the possibility of taking walks to them.  Residents are also pleased with the convenient transport accessibility of the complex and the variety of public transport on which you can reach it. </p><p>  LCD "European" (Tyumen) also has negative reviews of residents.  As it happens in almost all new buildings, not only in Tyumen, but throughout the country, immediately after putting the houses into operation, some time still has to be eliminated minor flaws in utilities, minor breakdowns of elevators, power outages and other troubles.  In the case of the ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù, it is precisely because of such minor misunderstandings that negative opinions of tenants are formed.  But the developer and the management company are trying to quickly solve problems and repair broken items. </p><h2>  Infrastructure: internal and external </h2><p>  As for infrastructure, the developer offers a fully developed one so that the residents of the complex are not forced to go shopping or take a walk outside the complex.  The complex is managed by its own management company, which is designed to quickly and efficiently solve the problems of residents.  The courtyard is designed closed, which will provide the greatest security for children playing in the yard or for adults walking.  Owners of their own vehicles will appreciate the underground parking. </p><p>  Interroom walls and ceilings are additionally laid with soundproof materials.  The loggias are insulated so that later the tenants have the opportunity to attach them to the apartments and equip them, for example, an office.  On the facades of buildings are special baskets for air conditioners.  The windows are glazed with five-chamber double-glazed windows. </p>

    <p>  In order to ensure the safety of residents, each house and staircase are equipped with video surveillance cameras.  It is planned to conduct wires directly to the apartment in order to facilitate the future connection of television and the Internet. </p><p>  As for the external infrastructure, there is no shortage of schools, kindergartens, shops and hypermarkets, banks, catering establishments and sports centers in the immediate surroundings and walking distance. </p><p>  Thus, those who already had the good fortune of settling in the Evropeisky residential complex do not regret it, even despite some minor flaws in the builder.  Fresh air, well-developed infrastructure, excellent transport accessibility - all this makes life in the complex attractive both for young single people, and for couples or large families. </p>
