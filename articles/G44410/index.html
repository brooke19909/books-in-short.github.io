This island, unlike Crete, is small.  But the choice of housing here is very wide.  There are chic five-star boutique hotels, and modest ‚Äútriples‚Äù and even ‚Äúdeuces‚Äù.  Let's choose the golden middle - 4 * hotel.  The Greek Quartet are not much inferior to their high-status brothers.  And for the price they are more democratic.  Consider the level of service of Greek, in particular, Rhodes hotels with the example of Blue Bay Watersplash 4 *.  At "Tophotels" she has a good rating - 3.8 out of five possible.  What do travelers write about her?  Their reviews and photos have become the main informative material for writing this article.  What kind of contingent of vacationers is this hotel designed for?  Judging by the reviews, the hotel is bypassed by noisy tourist groups from Russia.  This is a great place to take a break from compatriots.  It is worth coming here with children - the hotel has its own water park, which will appeal to adults as well.  Tourists often call the Blue Bay Watersplash a spa hotel because it has a thermal zone.  But the youth who want to hang out, it is better to look for another place.  After all, the hotel we are describing is located in the small but charming Rhodes village of Ialyssos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue Bay Watersplash 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1557082.jpg" width="600"></div>

How to get there </h2><p>  Just seven kilometers from <span>Rhodes</span> International <span>Airport</span> is the Blue Bay Hotel Watersplash 4 *.  How to get about it, the question is not worth it, because for such a short distance, even a taxi ride will not breach the budget.  But an even cheaper option would be a bus that connects the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Rhodes</span> with its airport.  On the way, he enters Ialysos.  Reviews write that planes often hover overhead.  But this circumstance did not bother anyone to relax, because the Rhodes airport does not accept flights at night.  The village of Ialysos is located on the western tip of the island.  Despite the fact that the booming resort of Ixia has already included it in its borders, it retained the patriarchal charm and Greek flavor.  The Blue Bay Watersplash Hotel is located on the first line of the Aegean Sea and has a private beach.  The place where the hotel is located is quiet.  For noisy fun, reviews are advised to go to neighboring hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue Bay Watersplash 4 hotel description" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1557077.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Enclosures and territory </h2><p>  Blue Bay Watersplash 4 is part of the Blue Bay Group.  Therefore, tourists can count on a certain level of service, because this chain has its representative offices both in Crete and in mainland Greece.

Among the lawns are palm trees, exotic shrubs and flowers.  On the territory there is a large swimming pool "relaxation" and a separate water park.  The hotel consists of one main building and several bungalows.  These latter offer superior rooms.  Some even have a private pool.  For budget tourists, there is another building, which is believed to be on the second line, because you need to go to the sea through the "main building" (the main building with the reception). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  In the large hotel Blue Bay Watersplash 4 * there are three hundred and thirty guest rooms.  They belong to different price categories.  The room‚Äôs price is affected not only by the ‚Äústandard‚Äù, the ‚Äúsuite‚Äù, ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù or ‚Äúfamily room‚Äù, but also where the room is located.

    <h2>  What tourists say about the rooms </h2><p>  The ‚ÄúStandards‚Äù at the Blue Bay Watersplash 4 hotel are characterized by bright and comfortable bedrooms.  That building, which is located on the "second line", is older, and this is reflected in the decoration of the rooms.  But there it is more quiet and calm, in the evenings you can not hear music pouring from the bar and the noise from the restaurant.  The main building offers beautiful sea views.  However, you need to pay extra for ‚Äúsea view‚Äù (ten euros per day).  The main building is too crowded, but there is newer equipment and furniture.  In the "suites" there is a living room, a bedroom, a small dining area.  Each room has air conditioning with individual remote control, TV with satellite channels (two of them are Russian), telephone.  The bathrooms have showers, hairdryers, cosmetics and hygiene products.  Superior rooms include a fridge and safety deposit box.  Maids are cleaned every day.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As in many resort hotels in Rhodes, in the Blue Bay Watersplash 4 * introduced the program "All inclusive".  It includes three main meals, a snack from ten to fourteen hours and a late dinner.  Drinks in bars are also free, but only locally produced.  And from ten in the morning until eleven in the evening you can drink tea, coffee and ice cream unlimited.  But there is the Blue Bay Watersplash hotel and the Ultra All Inclusive program.  It includes additional bonuses: a minibar (to be filled only upon arrival), slippers and bathrobes, an electric kettle.  On the beach for such guests, sunbeds are free.  But these and other power-up bonuses no longer apply, and we will mention them later.  The gastronomic facilities of the hotel are in the main restaurant ‚ÄúDionissos‚Äù, the diner ‚ÄúArtemis‚Äù and three bars: by the pool, on the beach and in the lobby of the main building.  There is one more bonus available for owners of the usual All Inclusive.  This is the Blue Restaurant, which serves a la carte service.  He is on the shore, and his team of chefs specializes in preparing fish dishes. </p><h2>  What the food reviews at Blue Bay Watersplash 4 * say </h2><p>  Hotel description for every tourist always contains this item.  The food here is not even good, but simply divine.  Everything is very tasty, varied, and at breakfast too.  Even if you relax in the spring, you can enjoy the first fruits.  In addition to the main line of the buffet, there are baby and diet food.  The bars always have croissants, hot sandwiches.  Beer and wine are normal in Greece.  Some tourists have also appreciated ouzo anise vodka.  The bartender in the main building speaks Russian.  Good, non-powdered ice cream was pleasant to children.  Everyone is advised to visit <span>the √† la carte restaurant.</span>  It is open only for lunch and dinner.  A restaurant √† la carte visit for a simple ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù is limited.  And this is another reason to buy "Ultra all inclusive." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Blue Bay Watersplash 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1557091.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea, beach, pools </h2><p>  Usually at the western end of Rhodes the coast is pebble.  But on the beach of the hotel Blue Bay Watersplash 4 * mostly sand.  Pebbles are found only at the very entrance to the sea.  For those for whom this obstacle course is a problem, tourists recommend purchasing water jets (they are sold in local shops for eight to nine euros).  <span>The Aegean Sea</span> is always troubled, so you need to swim with the kids carefully.  The depth is already felt five meters from the coast.  But the water is clean, and there are almost no jellyfish.  On the equipped beach of the hotel, sunbeds are paid, three euros per day.  An exception is made only to owners of Ultra All Inclusive bracelets.  Beach towels are also provided free of charge.  The hotel has two outdoor pools, one children's ‚Äúpaddling pool‚Äù.  Reviews mention that this last one is under an awning, which protects kids from overheating and sunburn.  There is also a heated indoor pool - in the spa area.  Outdoor tanks have a sun terrace.  On it in the morning place sunbeds, which are free for all vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue bay watersplash 4 rhodes reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1557085.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Aquapark </h2><p>  Blue Bay Watersplash 4 * (Rhodes) positions itself as a family hotel.  To attract tourists with children here, the hotel built a large water park in its territory.

Basically this entertainment facility is designed for children.  For younger visitors, the water park has a lot of slides.  And also a pirate ship, mushrooms and other completely fearless entertainment.  But adults will not be bored.  Four serious water slides function for them in the water park.

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The bus stop is located just two hundred meters from the Blue Bay Hotel Watersplash 4 * (Rhodes).  Reviews call for more active use of ideal transport links and excellent roads on the island.  It‚Äôs just a sin not to go to the capital, the city of Rhodes.  After all, to go to him for a quarter of an hour, and it costs one and a half euros.  But first, you should definitely visit Ialyssos and climb the ‚ÄúPath to Calvary‚Äù to Mount Filerimos.  There, in addition to the enchanting views of the Aegean Sea, you can see the ancient Acropolis of Achaia, the temples of Zeus and Athens.  In a <span>modern village</span> , Byzantine churches were preserved in wonderful condition.  In the church of St. Nicholas you can admire the frescoes of the fifteenth century.  Many tourists rented a car and traveled the whole island along ideal roads.  Cheaper tours should not be booked at the hotel, but at the bureau, which is located to the right of the hotel exit. </p><h2>  Vacation Feedback </h2><p>  Travelers were mostly satisfied with their vacation at Blue Bay Watersplash 4 *.  Reviews of tourists claim that the hotel is located in a quiet place, but not far from the resort resort infrastructure - the Spar supermarket and the fish tavern, where you can cook your chosen products.

The pools are clean, the beach is carefully cleaned.  Many tourists said they would be happy to come to this hotel again. </p>
