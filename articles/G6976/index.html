Guests note that each room is always comfortable, regardless of the weather on the street.  Assessing the interior, tourists often pay attention to its simplicity and lordship.  The view from the windows also leaves many in awe. </p><p>  As for the level of services provided, guests like literally everything from a room service that is provided three times a week to cooking in a restaurant.  Often, travelers focus on the successful embodiment of the imagination of cooks in seafood dishes - according to them, every fish or shellfish served here is a unique work of art. </p><p>  Fans of nightlife say that there are none at the hotel, there is also no animation team.  However, they recommend that if you want to visit entertainment places go to nightlife establishments, which are located almost in the vicinity of Ambassador Hotel Kemer 4 *.  According to them, in such places you can meet a considerable number of Russian-speaking tourists and guests from Europe. </p><p>  Most hotel guests in their reviews say that they do not mind returning here to relax again, recommending that their relatives visit this place.
