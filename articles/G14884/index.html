  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sociology of the city or what danger is life in a megalopolis fraught with?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From the point of view of sociology, the city is a completely new quality form of social unification based on relations between people.  The sociology of cities and villages, of course, differ from each other in those changes that occur primarily in production and have their own content.  They are based on industrial types of labor that are otherwise associated with the <span>natural environment</span> and differ from agriculture. <br>  The sociology of the city is based on the fact that here nature is not a direct subject of labor activity, while industrial production is concentrated around large markets.  The sociology of the city and the village, built on their division, the final result of which is the distribution of labor into industrial and agricultural. In addition, the sociology of the city provides more opportunities for mental work, such as high urbanization requires products of intellectual activity, which someone also needs to produce . </p><p>  The city is an autonomous entity with the possibility of self-determination, which relates to its place of origin.  This is due to the fact that natural factors affect it to a lesser extent than the village.  The sociology of the city is due to the intensive development of territories, which is associated with urban production, creating the prerequisites for this.  <span>The production process</span> focuses on limited areas of urban and suburban areas. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The growth of large cities is associated with potential shifts in the technical field and the restructuring of the <span>economic model.</span>  Moving to ever newer technologies, cities are turning into megacities, where it is much more profitable to create production associations, retail outlets, cultural complexes, and educational institutions.  Here, labor productivity is an order of magnitude higher and growth will continue until it is economically viable. </p><p>  Living in a metropolis irreversibly can change a person himself, as well as his perception of nature, a big city will forever change the psyche of personality.  This carries a hidden threat, since the sociology of the city conflicts with the <span>nature of man</span> at the genetic level. <br>  To try to avoid this, it is necessary to understand what is the sociology of everyday life and create conditions for the rationalization of nature and man in a metropolis.  This will be possible if two important factors are observed: <br>  1. Development of a promising megalopolis scheme, which will be based on the principle of rationality of nature.  BUT compliance with this principle will conflict with the personal interests of individual individuals or groups organizing production and doing business.  They will do everything in order to prevent its implementation. <br>  2. The management of the city should be carried out through competent and strong leadership, which will guide the city, overcoming corruption and selfishness. </p><p>  The sociology of the city is determined by methods and ways that solve socio-economic problems, housing, domestic, and communal problems.  The solution of these issues is aimed at creating an enabling environment for citizens. <br>  The starting point for creating an enabling environment for life is rational, <br>  thoughtful implementation of transformations in the field of planning, architecture, improvement of domestic and cultural objects.  Architects should carefully develop building complexes for their successful combination, in order to avoid spontaneous development, which will disfigure the face of the city, or interfere with the normal functioning of other services aimed at fulfilling public needs. </p><p>  The city serves as a venue for the unification of many people from different regions, countries, as well as visitors from other countries, whose competent life support lies on the shoulders of the governing bodies, whose competent actions, in turn, determine not only the functioning of the metropolis, but also the mental state of its inhabitants . </p>
