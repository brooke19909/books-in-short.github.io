Kostroma, whose photo is simply mesmerizing, opens in a new light if you look at it from the window of a luxury hotel.  It dominates the classic design with luxurious decor.  Nevertheless, some rooms (especially standard ones) have many shortcomings - breakdowns, poor ventilation and more.  In general, guests are satisfied with the living conditions, as well as their value for money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Golden ring of Kostroma St. Lower Debris d 104" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/1261938.jpg" width="600"></div>  As for the work of the staff, there is a dual impression.  On the one hand, everyone is very polite, smiles warmly and listens attentively to every request.  Nevertheless, almost no response occurs.  True, few people pay attention to this, because here practically no one stops for a long time.  As for the restaurant, it would not hurt to lower prices a bit and expand the menu.  Nevertheless, the beautiful landscapes around the hotel and the incredible view from the window cover all of its shortcomings.
