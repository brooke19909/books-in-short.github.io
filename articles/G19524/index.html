    <h2>  The choice is yours </h2><p>  Naturally, choosing the best <span>phone is not</span> so easy, however, it is possible.  Many try first to choose a manufacturer, and only then - a specific model from all the proposed options.  Which smartphone is better?  Everyone decides for himself.  But there are some parameters that are leading in a number of manufacturers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, for example, if you need a strong and durable phone, then you should pay your attention to Nokia.  Any model is suitable, depending on your needs and requests.  If you want an older smartphone, then select the Nokia 5800 Express Music.  Pretty stylish and durable phone based on the "Symbian", which is perfect for both music lovers and ordinary customers.  Want something new?  In this case, just stop at the Nokia Lumiya.  Let's figure out which smartphone is better than the rest.  After all, there are many manufacturers, and almost everyone assures that it is his products that deserve attention. </p><h2>  HTC </h2><p>  Sometimes I want to choose smartphones for 2 sim.  Which company is better to take?  As already mentioned, the decision is only yours.  But if you need an option that works great with 2 numbers from different mobile operators, then take a look at the products of HPC. </p><p>  This concerns not only models for several SIM-cards, but also the usual options.  After all, HTC, according to many buyers, is an inexpensive, but at the same time high-quality solution.  Especially if you need a gadget to work, because there are very few gaming options for HTC. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which company smartphones are better reviews" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/994433.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Which company‚Äôs smartphones are better in quality?  Reviews say that in this sense, the leaders are Nokia, Samsung and HTC.  Nevertheless, when the question is acute regarding the budget for the purchase, it is HCT that will help get rid of the problems.  Any model will please the buyer.  It all depends on your needs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Opportunities </h2><p>  Which company smartphones are better?  The reviews that kindly leave the owners of gadgets are usually distinguished by several manufacturers.  We have already mentioned them.  But if you take into account such a factor as the capabilities of the phone, then Samsung will suit you. </p><p>  It's no secret that this particular manufacturer is famous for its various additions and functions of its gadgets.  In truth, many phone models are not so cheap.  As buyers assure, the price tag is usually really worthy. </p><p>  For example, with the help of Samsung, you can satisfy any needs - from gaming to business.  Do you want a powerful and high-quality, as well as a universal smartphone?  Take a look at the Samsung Galaxy series.  Pay special attention to the <span>Samsung Galaxy S6.</span>  This is a new, high-quality gaming phone that will not let you get bored.  In addition, reviews about him are only encouraging. </p><p>  Why do not most owners think which smartphone company is the best, but simply stop at Samsung?  For example, you can take into account the fact that it is this manufacturer that creates gadgets with large and high-quality touch screens.  They are made with the latest technology and are protected as much as possible.  This means that a smartphone of this production will really last a long time.  After all, most buyers eventually complain about problems with touch screens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphones for 2 sim which company is better" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/994432.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lenovo </h2><p>  But this is not worth stopping at.  Not only HTC, Samsung and Nokia are worthy of attention.  There are other manufacturers who can offer quality phones.  Which company is better to take a smartphone, of course, you need to decide purely individually.  But as practice shows, many are confused and cannot make the right decision. </p><p>  Sometimes you should turn to Lenovo.  Are you a fan of this company?  Then smartphones will appeal to you.  For the price of Lenovo phones are very different.  Among them there are options and budget, and no.  The main thing is that the power of such models is quite high.  But the quality, as buyers say, is stupid. </p><p>  The thing is that Lenovo's touch screens are a weak point.  Smartphones of this company are quite easy to break.  But for many, this is not a hindrance at all: covers, protective films and so on are bought.  In addition, replacing the touch screen here is not so expensive.  And if you follow the rules of operation, then in general you can be sure that Lenovo will serve faithfully for at least 6-8 years. </p><p>  Why is this manufacturer worthy of attention?  Price and power are a matter of course.  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that Lenovo offers customers a wide selection of models, as well as stylish and modern designs.  Characteristics, by the way, are also kept at their best.  From budget options it is worth taking a look at the model for two SIM cards Lenovo A319, and if you need a gaming gadget, then Lenovo Vibe is quite suitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which company is better to take a smartphone" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/994431.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  iPhone </h2><p>  Some buyers do not even think about which company is better to take a smartphone.  Instead, they simply succumb to the stereotypes that are so prevalent in modern society - the more expensive, the better.  Of course, the choice usually falls on products called iPhones. </p><p>  Yes, these are really quality gadgets.  But recently, buying an iPhone is not only expensive, but also a dubious pleasure.  Indeed, in many respects this product is inferior to the same ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù or ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù.  But at a price - superior. </p><p>  IPhones have a lot of features, good protection of the touch screen and the case.  Therefore, many do not even think which smartphone company is better to choose.  But if you evaluate the general situation, then the iPhone is a product that is more suitable for lovers of the iOS operating system, as well as a great choice for buyers who need to have the ‚Äúcoolest smartphone.‚Äù  Otherwise, it is better to choose some better and more versatile, as well as cheaper option. </p><p>  In addition, iPhones very often require repair.  And after updating the operating system, you may experience equipment malfunctions.  So do not succumb to stereotypes.  Want iOS?  Then the iPhone is the perfect solution.  Not?  Stop at another company.  After all, price is not a guarantee of quality. </p><h2>  Yota </h2><p>  Recently, Iota products have become very popular.  If you are interested in which smartphone is better in quality, reviews about the models will help you.  But you will surely find that Yota buyers are agitating everyone to purchase this particular product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Which company smartphone is better to choose" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/994430.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Firstly, the Iota smartphones are from the latest generation, which means that they have everything that a modern user can use.  Secondly, it is in these models that there is support for 4G networks.  You will be able to access high-speed Internet, and the connection will not be interrupted during a conversation.  Thirdly, Yota is a completely new product.  And so it attracts attention. </p><p>  As practice shows, it is these factors that convince you to buy ‚ÄúIota‚Äù.  In addition, numerous reviews emphasize the quality of the equipment.  Many companies call the smartphones of this company ‚Äúsimply unkillable‚Äù.  They are resistant to moisture, sun, frost, and also to falls and other damage.  If you need a really high-quality smartphone of a new generation, then Yota is ideal.  However, at a cost, some models are not far from iPhones.  Keep this in mind if your purchase budget is quite limited. </p><h2>  Asus </h2><p>  Which company smartphones are better?  Reviews, as you see, cannot give a definite answer.  So, you shouldn‚Äôt rely only on them.  But sometimes your own instinct can be very useful.  For example, when you used to use the products of a particular company (any gadgets) that pleased you.  Asus, as a rule, belongs to such.  This company pleases many.  It's no secret that Asus computers are considered one of the best.  The same goes for phones. </p><p>  Which company smartphones are better?  Photos and specifications are unlikely to help you.  Only my own experience and some reviews.  But we can say that Asus is really worthy of attention.  This is not only powerful, but also high-quality products.  It is almost resistant to damage, has high characteristics (all models), as well as a decent price tag.  Despite the power of the devices, the price of all <span>Asus smartphones</span> is quite acceptable.  So the main thing is to make a decision.  Choose the model that suits you the most and buy it.  Doubt it?  In this case, you can find specialized smartphone rental services.  Rent an Asus model for a few days and see how much it suits you.  In this case, you don‚Äôt have to rack your brains on which smartphone is better.  You will know everything in comparison, and in real. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which smartphone company is the best" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/994429.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fly </h2><p>  ‚ÄúFly‚Äù is another worthy version of smartphones.  True, few buyers decide on it.  After all, these gadgets are mainly budget models.  And their quality is not very good.  In any case, the majority says so. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Fly is still present in the market of goods and services.  The smartphones of this manufacturer are perfect for children, or rather schoolchildren who have just stepped on a new stage in their lives.  After all, ‚ÄúFly‚Äù has not so high characteristics that children can play a variety of modern games.  So, you can be calm for the education of your child.  And the small price of the models will allow, if necessary, to replace the gadget with a new one. </p><h2>  Sony </h2><p>  Gaming and powerful smartphones also have Sony.  Perhaps this is one of the few worthy competitors for the Samsung.  And some buyers prefer this particular company. </p><p>  Recently, the series of Sony Experia has become the most popular line of the manufacturer.  This is a gaming smartphone, which is perfect for both work and study in parallel.  The quality of the devices is only pleasing.  Especially shock resistance and screen color reproduction.  Prices for Sony are different - there are budget models and expensive ones.  But you should not be afraid of this company.  After all, it is Sony that conquers the hearts of modern youth by taking all laurels from Samsung.  And that means a lot. </p><h2>  LG </h2><p>  You can also take a look at LG products.  If you are wondering which smartphone is better, customer reviews did not help, and you yourself cannot come to a conclusion, then try the phones of this manufacturer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which company smartphones are better in quality reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/994428.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The main advantages are long battery life, high performance and affordable prices.  You can notice the stylish design of all LG devices.  In addition, these phones are available to everyone.  Reviews also emphasize that the repair of these devices is almost not required.  And ‚ÄúAlGi‚Äù allows you to run many useful applications and games, and this is a huge plus. </p><h2>  Huawei </h2><p>  You can choose smartphones Huawei.  They began to win the hearts of customers recently.  Average cost and good performance are what the user may need.  And all this is with the Huawei. </p><p>  True, a number of minuses in these smartphones also have.  For example, some question the quality of products.  After all, the owners quite often turn to specialized gadget repair services for help.  In addition, Huawei's battery life is not very good - all models are actively discharged when used actively.  But if you follow the operating rules and always monitor the remaining battery charge, then there will be no problems. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  As you can see, deciding which company is better is difficult, nevertheless it is possible.  The main thing is to determine for yourself the main evaluation criteria.  Try not to listen to sales consultants in stores, because their task is to sell the model more expensive and not better.  Study reviews, test different phones - only in this way you can make the right choice. </p>
