Reviews contain information about such shortcomings: </p><ul><li>  unscrupulous cleaning of rooms (do not wipe the floors in the bathroom, do not vacuum clean the furniture); </li><li>  there are practically no fruits on the buffet menu (and all because they are sold in a stall located on the territory); </li><li>  air conditioners are not powerful enough to cool a room in a 40-degree heat; </li><li>  from the meat in the buffet menu there is only chicken, which lovers will not like to eat heartily; </li><li>  in the exchange office of the hotel there is a very unfavorable exchange rate, therefore it is better to change money in some bank; </li><li>  the spa is not clean enough, as well as a narrow list of services; </li><li>  in the “low season”, when the hotel is not fully populated, the declared gozleme cakes are not prepared; </li><li>  the design of the hotel is rustic and does not correspond to modern interior trends; </li><li>  shabby and not quite clean carpet in the rooms, which is unpleasant to walk barefoot (and slippers are not provided); </li><li>  cramped and stuffy elevators (it is better to go upstairs to the room on foot); </li><li>  not the best quality local alcohol is served in bars; </li><li>  almost no entertainment for children; </li><li>  too few waiters in the restaurant (they do not have time to promptly serve guests); </li><li>  the hotel has not been renovated for a long time, because of which it looks somehow "shabby"; </li><li>  in many rooms, broken locks that constantly jam; </li><li>  elevators work very slowly and often break; </li><li>  outside the hotel the area is neglected and very dirty; </li><li>  old and not very comfortable furniture in the rooms; </li><li>  during breakfast they serve tasteless undercooked porridge; </li><li>  hotel staff clean the beach not early in the morning, but just at the moment when guests are resting there; </li><li>  there are no bins or garbage bins on the beach, which is why many guests throw garbage directly onto the sand (although the absence of bins is no excuse for this behavior); </li><li>  breakfast menu is very monotonous and annoying for a few days; </li><li>  if there is some kind of malfunction in the room, employees are in no hurry to fix it; </li><li>  old bedding, which is covered with small holes and unwashed stains; </li><li>  without additional request, guests are not replenished with hygiene supplies in the bathroom. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this hotel has a five-star status, due to old age and the lack of repair, it can hardly be called such.  Nevertheless, there are quite good conditions for recreation, if we take into account budget prices. </p>
