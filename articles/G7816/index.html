This development is amazing, and the value of the invention of the microscope is extremely great, because without it some directions of modern science would not exist.  And from here in more detail. </p><p>  A microscope is a device related to a telescope that is used for completely different purposes.  Using it, it is possible to consider the structure of objects that are invisible to the eye.  It allows you to determine the morphological parameters of micro-formations, as well as to evaluate their volumetric location.  Therefore, it is even difficult to imagine how important the invention of the microscope was, and how its appearance influenced the development of science. </p>

    <h2>  History of microscope and optics </h2><p>  Today it‚Äôs hard to answer who first invented the microscope.  Probably, this issue will also be widely discussed, as well as the creation of a crossbow.  However, unlike weapons, the invention of the microscope did happen in Europe.  And who exactly is still unknown.  The likelihood that the discoverer of the device was Hans Jansen, the Dutch master in the production of glasses, is quite high.  His son, Zachary Jansen, made a statement in 1590 that he and his father constructed a microscope. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But already in 1609, another mechanism appeared that created Galileo Galilei.  He called it occhiolino and presented it to the public of the National Academy dei Linchei.  The proof that a microscope could already be used at that time is the sign on the seal of Pope Urban III.  It is believed that it is a modification of the image obtained by microscopy.  The light microscope (composite) Galileo Galilei consisted of one convex and one concave lens. </p><h2>  Improvement and implementation </h2><p>  10 years after the invention of Galileo, Cornelius Drebbel creates a composite microscope with two convex lenses.  And later, that is, by the end of the <span>1600s,</span> Christian Huygens developed a two-lens eyepiece system.  They are produced now, although they lack the breadth of view.  But, more importantly, with the help of such a microscope, in 1665, <span>Robert Hook</span> conducted a study of a slice of cork oak, where the scientist saw the so-called honeycombs.  The result of the experiment was the introduction of the concept of "cell". </p>

    <p>  Another father of the microscope - Anthony van Levenguk - only re-invented it, but managed to attract the attention of biologists to the device.  And after that it became clear what significance the invention of the microscope had for science, because it allowed the development of microbiology.  Probably, the aforementioned device significantly accelerated the development of the natural sciences, because until a person saw microbes, he believed that diseases originate from uncleanliness.  And in science, the concepts of alchemy and vitalistic theories of the existence of living and spontaneous generation reigned supreme. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Levenguk Microscope </h2><p>  The invention of the microscope is a unique event in the science of the Middle Ages, because thanks to the device it was possible to find many new subjects for scientific discussion.  Moreover, many theories have collapsed due to microscopy.  And this is the great merit of Anthony van Levenguk.  He was able to improve the microscope so that he could see in detail the cells.  And if we consider the issue in this context, then Levenguk really is the father of a microscope of this type. </p><h2>  Instrument structure </h2><p>  The <span>Levenguk</span> light <span>microscope</span> itself was a plate with a lens capable of multiplying the magnification of the objects in question.  This plate with a lens had a tripod.  Through it, it was mounted on a horizontal table.  By directing the lens into the light and placing the material under study between it and the candle flame, <span>bacterial cells</span> could be seen <span>.</span>  Moreover, the first material that Anthony van Levenguk investigated was plaque.  In it, the scientist saw many creatures, which I could not name yet. </p><p>  The uniqueness of the Levenguk microscope is amazing.  Composite models available then did not provide high image quality.  Moreover, the presence of two lenses only exacerbated defects.  Therefore, it took more than 150 years before the composite microscopes, originally developed by Galileo and Drebbel, began to give the same image quality as the Levenguk device.  Anthony van Levenguk himself is still not considered the father of a microscope, but he is rightfully a recognized master of microscopy of native materials and cells. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Invention and improvement of lenses </h2><p>  The very concept of a lens already existed in ancient Rome and Greece.  For example, in Greece, using convex glasses, it was possible to kindle a fire.  And in Rome, the properties of glass vessels filled with water have long been noticed.  They made it possible to enlarge images, although not by many times.  The further development of the lenses is unknown, although it is obvious that progress could not stand still. </p><p>  It is known that in the 16th century the use of glasses came into practice in Venice.  This is confirmed by the facts about the presence of glass grinding machines, which made it possible to obtain lenses.  Also there were drawings of optical instruments, which are mirrors and lenses.  The authorship of these works belongs to Leonardo da Vinci.  But even earlier people worked with magnifying glasses: back in 1268, Roger Bacon put forward the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a telescope.  It was later implemented. </p><p>  Obviously, the authorship of the lens did not belong to anyone.  But this was observed until the moment when Carl Friedrich Zeiss did not engage in optics.  In 1847, he began manufacturing microscopes.  Then his company became a leader in the development of optical glasses.  It exists to this day, remaining the main in the industry.  All companies that manufacture photo and video cameras, optical sights, rangefinders, telescopes and other devices collaborate with her. </p>

    <h2>  Advanced Microscopy </h2><p>  The history of the invention of the microscope is striking in its detailed study.  But no less interesting is the history of the further improvement of microscopy.  New <span>types of microscopes</span> began to appear <span>,</span> and the scientific thought that generated them sank deeper and deeper.  Now the goal of the scientist was not only the study of microbes, but also the consideration of smaller components.  They are molecules and atoms.  Already in the 19th century, they were able to investigate through x-ray diffraction analysis.  But science required more. </p><p>  So, already in 1863, a polarizing microscope was developed by researcher Henry Clifton Sorby to study meteorites.  And in 1863, Ernst Abbe developed the theory of a microscope.  She was successfully adopted at the production of Carl Zeiss.  Due to this, his company has developed into a recognized leader in the optical instrument industry. </p><p>  But 1931 soon came - the time of the creation of an electron microscope.  It has become a new type of apparatus, allowing you to see much more than light.  In it, not photons and not polarized light were used for transmission, but electrons - particles are much smaller than the simplest ions.  It was the invention of the electron microscope that allowed the development of histology.  Now scientists have gained full confidence that their judgments about the cell and its organelles are indeed correct.  However, only in 1986, the creator of the electron microscope Ernst Ruska was awarded the Nobel Prize.  Moreover, already in 1938, James Hiller was building a transmission electron microscope. </p>

    <h2>  The latest types of microscopes </h2><p>  Science after the successes of many scientists has evolved faster.  Therefore, the goal dictated by the new realities was the need to develop a highly sensitive microscope.  And already in 1936, Erwin Muller produced a field emission device.  And in 1951, another device was manufactured - a field ion microscope.  Its importance is extreme because it was the first time that it allowed scientists to see atoms.  In addition to this, in 1955, Jerzy Nomarski developed the theoretical foundations of differential interference contrast microscopy. </p>

    <h2>  Improving the latest microscopes </h2><p>  The invention of the microscope is not yet successful, because it is not difficult, in principle, to make the ions or photons pass through biological media, and then consider the resulting image.  That's just the question of improving the quality of microscopy was really important.  And after these conclusions, scientists created a transit mass analyzer, which was called a scanning ion microscope. </p>

    <p>  This device made it possible to scan a single atom and obtain data on the three-dimensional structure of the molecule.  Together with <span>X-ray analysis,</span> this method has significantly accelerated the identification process of many substances found in nature.  And already in 1981, a scanning tunneling microscope was introduced, and in 1986 - an atomic force microscope.  1988 is the year of the invention of the scanning electrochemical tunnel type microscope.  And the latest and most useful is the Kelvin power probe.  It was developed in 1991. </p><h2>  Assessing the global significance of the invention of the microscope </h2><p>  Beginning in 1665, when Levenguk was engaged in the processing of glass and the production of microscopes, the industry developed and became more complicated.  And wondering about the importance of the invention of the microscope, it is worth considering the main achievements of microscopy.  So, this method allowed us to consider the cell, which served as the next impetus for the development of biology.  Then the device allowed to make out the organelles of the cell, which made it possible to form patterns of the cellular structure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Year of invention of the microscope" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29185/814189.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  Then the microscope allowed to see the molecule and atom, and later scientists were able to scan their surface.  Moreover, even electron clouds of atoms can be seen through a microscope.  Since electrons move with the speed of light around the nucleus, it is absolutely impossible to consider this particle.  Despite this, it should be understood how important the invention of the microscope was.  He made it possible to see something new that cannot be seen with the eye.  This is an amazing world, the study of which brought people closer to the modern achievements of physics, chemistry and medicine.  And it is worth all the trouble. </p>
