Of course, there are even more positive aspects.  So far there are only four Vodafone packages, and they are available throughout Ukraine, except for Donbass.  How to switch from MTS to Vodafon?  There are two ways available.  But for this, you first need to find out everything about what kind of connection it is - Vodafone. </p><h2>  The real and alleged advantages of Vodafone </h2><p>  Significantly cheaper operator "Vodafon", unlike MTS, will be in roaming.  Today it is more profitable to call Ukraine with Vodafone from 26 countries of the world.  If MTS roaming cost, for example, 10 hryvnias per minute, then Vodafon is much more economical.  Internet traffic and calls from Ukraine to other countries do not belong to the advantages of a mobile operator. </p>

    <p>  It is estimated that the Vodafon operator will have much less problems with 3G Internet in the future.  This conclusion can be made because decommissioned European equipment, which has long been configured for 3G, is likely to be installed in Ukraine.  It can be assumed that in connection with this the cost of the Internet in 3G will be lower than on MTS.  But it‚Äôs still impossible to say for sure. </p><h2>  Why does Vodafon need the Ukrainian market? </h2><p>  This cellular communication of British origin literally absorbs the Ukrainian MTS.  Of course, the advantages of the European operator are obvious - better quality than before, the introduction of advanced technologies.  But no matter how it happens that the total cost of Vodafone tariffs will eventually become truly European, that most of the population may simply not be affordable, although many are now thinking about how to switch from MTS to Vodafon.  And, of course, it‚Äôs sad that MTS has become the most ‚Äúbackward‚Äù among Ukrainian operators.  That is, this relationship cannot compete, and it would be logical to either invest a lot of money and time in its development, or sell it to a more successful company.  The latter decision probably seemed to MTS management more acceptable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Will MTS tariffs change now? </h2><p>  Yes, tariffs for MTS will change, and it is not clear which way.  However, while the official website of the company claims that everything will be fine not only with the quality of services, but also with prices, which, as promised, should be lower. </p>

    <p>  Over time, Ukraine will completely have Vodafone instead of MTS.  This is also evidenced by the information on the MTS official website.  And first of all, Vodafone will be the brand of 3G Internet. </p><h2>  Ways to switch from MTS to Vodafon </h2><p>  Strange as it may seem, to switch to the new Vodafone connection it is easiest to buy a new number with a new service package and tariff plan.  In this transition from MTS to Vodafon, you can be content only with the RED S tariff, but this is at first glance.  It‚Äôs just that with RED S, switching to other tariff plans is already available by replenishing the account for a large amount and introducing the USSD-team that carries out the transfer request. </p><p>  But in general, in order to become a subscriber of Vodafon, it is not necessary to buy a new number.  Those who wish to stay with the usual number for a number of reasons can access the Vodafone through a request.  To do this, to become the owner of the RED S package, you need to dial * 730 #, to switch to RED M - * 750 # and to switch to RED L - * 790 #.  The cost of the transition will be 60, 90 and 180 hryvnia, respectively.  The monthly subscription fee for each of the given tariff plans is the same. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Return from Vodafon to MTS </h2><p>  How to switch from MTS to Vodafon is understandable.  But how to return from Vodaforn to MTS?  It will be impossible to return back to any tariff.  Even if you have a MTS SIM card.  Moreover, the most likely outcome of all is a gradual transition to Vodafone of all MTS users and the replacement of the company itself with the British Vodafone. </p><h2>  When do you need to replace MTS with Vodafon, and when doesn‚Äôt it? </h2><p>  Is it possible to switch from MTS to Vodafon if the subscription fee for the current tariff plan is about the same?  You even need to do this.  And it‚Äôs probably worth switching to a new connection if you need to make frequent calls abroad and you need a good, high-quality Internet.  Vodafon has a preferential access to the Network. </p>

    <p>  On the other hand, if the MTS number is without a monthly fee, then you should not rush to replace it.  Indeed, while the proposed tariffs for Vodafone are entirely with a monthly fee.  So, numbers without one will be appreciated in the near future.  So, is it worth switching from MTS to Vodafon in this case?  Definitely not. </p><p>  Also, you should not change the MTS in the event that the number is intended only for calls within the network, well, and if the monthly fee is below 30 hryvnia.  After all, Vodafon offers tariffs with a monthly fee of only 30 hryvnias and above, which means that you will have to pay more for the transition.  Thus, when choosing MTS or Vodafon, tariffs play a very large role. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  About Vodafone tariffs in detail </h2><p>  When switching to Vodafone with MTS, it is necessary to study all tariffs in detail in order to choose the most suitable for yourself.  You must also know that in addition to RED S, M and L, there is also a RED XS tariff.  You need to learn to understand these packages.  It is important to understand how to switch from MTS to Vodafon. </p><p>  Regardless of which of these 4 tariffs the subscriber chooses, calls within Ukraine to Vodafon numbers will be unlimited free.  The ‚ÄúEther‚Äù package, which opens the Vodafone TV service, is available only for RED L. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="waterphone operator" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1878615.jpg" width="425"></div>

    <p>  Social networks allowed in Ukraine, and WhatsApp and Viber messengers are unlimited in all packages except RED XS.  In RED XS, social networks and instant messengers are not separated from the other Internet at all, which is given in this case for a month of 1 GB.  Other packages will be able to please subscribers with the Internet in the amount of 4, 8 and 12 GB, respectively, according to an increase in the monthly fee.  Internet operator Vodafon supports both 3G and 2G.  Vodafon will give subscribers a free 2 GB Internet, regardless of the connected tariff, and if the limit is reached, then for each subsequent 500 MB you will have to pay 500 hryvnias. </p><p>  It is possible to call numbers of other Ukrainian operators for free from any tariff, but the number of minutes per month is limited.  For RED XS, it takes 60 minutes, for RED S - 75, for RED M - 105, and for RED L - 300 minutes.  If the limit is exceeded, the cost of 1 minute of conversation with a subscriber of another operator will be 0.25 hryvnia. </p><p>  There are no free calls abroad on the RED XS tariff, and therefore the cost of such a call will be 3 hryvnia per minute.  On other tariffs, calls abroad can be made free of charge - 25, 35 and 75 minutes in ascending order (S, M and L).  If free minutes are spent, the cost of 1 minute of conversation at these three tariffs will be 0.50 hryvnia. </p>

    <p>  SMS and MMS messages can be sent for free at S, M and L. tariffs. The limit on the number of sent messages is 25, 70 and 150, respectively.  And on XS, 50 messages are given per month if you pay for this service.  The cost here is 1.50 hryvnia per day.  If you exceed the limit of SMS and MMS, you will need to pay an extra 0.50 hryvnia for each message. </p><p>  With all this, the new Vodafon connection provides its users with small gifts in the form of free Internet, as a promotion for new RED XS and RED S subscribers. At the same time, they give a certain amount of free Internet not only for the first time, but for the whole six months.  Another plus of this connection is the ability to connect an additional package if the monthly has already been used up.  As a new connection, Vodafone (at least for now) spoils many of its subscribers. </p><h2>  Vodafone Customer Reviews </h2><p>  Not one operator will ever be able to please everyone, without exception.  But in general, negative and positive reviews from Ukrainian citizens agree.  Subscribers believe that there is more advertising - both outdoor, TV and radio, and advertising messages from the operator.  Naturally, this annoys users, but the company is trying by all means to make its services more popular among the population. </p>

    <p>  However, people noted the huge plus of Vodafon - it is a very fast uninterrupted, literally ‚Äúflying‚Äù 3G Internet.  But 2G, of course, lags behind in speed.  The Ukrainians liked the improved service of the call center in Vodafone offices.  The British company probably trained its employees. </p><p>  Also, users of Vodafon consider it a pleasant surprise to replace the old SIM card with a new one (the same number) in case of damage or loss.  Simka is issued quickly and for free.  The main thing is not to throw away or lose the package in which the number was purchased.  Many people think that in some ways Vodafone is the same as other operators.  For example, this refers to the quality of communication during a conversation.  Like all other cellular companies, in some places the connection is perfect, and in others it is interrupted endlessly, and overall the sound quality suffers. </p><h2>  Different opinion </h2><p>  There are subscribers who believe that, unlike MTS, Vodafon tariffs are much more expensive, and therefore do not think to switch to this operator.  Among the users there are people who succumbed to persuasion, imposing unnecessary services on them.  They consider this imposition a negative Vodafone link quality. </p>

    <p>  In general, despite the fact that Vodafon is new European technologies and quality, the old MTS tariffs still win in something.  Someone changing the number will only be an extra waste of money, for example, this is true for senior citizens.  That's why you need to think about changing the number to Vodafon instead of MTS better, and not follow fashion trends. </p>
