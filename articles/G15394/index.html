Spain in all its ancient glory</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the atypical resorts, but very interesting and exciting is Gerona (Spain).  This town is located in the north-east of the country, in the autonomous region of Catalonia, near the famous and noisy Barcelona.  There are countless museums, ancient architectural monuments, narrow streets and wide spacious areas.  If you want to plunge into ancient Europe with all its typical features, then it is best to visit a city like Gerona.  Spain will become for you a country that must not be forgotten. </p><h2>  We fly to the museum city </h2><p>  It is important to know that there are no direct flights from Moscow to this historic little paradise.  You can get there only through one of the major cities in Spain, using the services of domestic airlines.  At a distance from our main destination is the Gerona Airport.  Spain is a country in which everything has been done wisely, and therefore you can fly to the Gerona Costa Brava literally in an hour and a half from anywhere in the country.  You can get to the city from the airport by taxi or bus in half an hour.  By the way, you can get to this amazing city by train.  Comfortable high-speed trains regularly leave Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwhich will take you to the address in a couple of hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gerona Spain" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/475579.jpg" width="600"></div>

Due to the fact that it is located at some distance from the sea, there is not very much rain here, clouds obscure the sky and the sun is rare.  Therefore, you can see all the sights in the golden rays that will make every house and temple even brighter.  In winter, the air temperature drops to 15-20 degrees, in the summer it is hot, often the thermometer reaches 30 degrees and above.  By the way, if you suddenly want to swim in the Mediterranean Sea, you can easily go to one of the nearest resort towns, which Gerona is surrounded by.  Spain is famous all over the world for its clean beaches, because the rest here will be pleasant and comfortable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="girona spain airport" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/475580.jpg" width="404"></div>

    <h2>  Features of this cultural center </h2><p>  The old and very beautiful town of Gerona consists of two parts - the old and the new.  They are conditionally divided by the Onyar River, which flows through the center.  The eastern part of Gerona is a concentration of architectural monuments that have been standing here since the time of the conquest of land by the Roman Empire.  The western city is full of new neighborhoods, houses where locals live, and business centers.  However, they are not too tall and futuristic, so it seems that all Gerona is a solid ancient paradise.  The main feature of the city is also considered the Salvador Dali Museum-Theater, which, regardless of the time of year or weather, attracts tourists from all over the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sights of the city of Gerona </h2><p>  Spain is a country of narrow streets with picturesque colored houses in the old style.  Gerona in this regard exceeds all expectations and pleases tourists with a whole bunch of such colorful neighborhoods located along the main river of the city.  It is best to admire them from the Pont de San Agusti bridge or Pont de Pedra.  Not far from the last bridge is the main attraction of the entire administrative district - Plaza Catalunya.  This is the center of the city, where locals often gather to organize a small market.  Here you can buy stunning handmade items and present them as gifts to loved ones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain city of girona" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/475582.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Temples and Cathedrals of Gerona </h2><p>  The main asset of the city is the Cathedral, located in the center.  Its construction was laid in the 14th century, and since then lasted more than 400 years.  For all this time, the architects of the temple changed, which brought something new to its appearance.  Today, the Cathedral is a synthesis of <span>Romanesque architecture,</span> Gothic, Baroque and romanticism.  Not far from it, another church was built in a purely Gothic style - the church of St. Philip.  The date of construction is also equal to the 14th century, but in its appearance this church is very gloomy, but at the same time majestic and beautiful.  Near it flaunts a sculpture of a lion - a symbol of the city.  According to legend, if you kiss her, you will certainly once again return to Gerona. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="girona spain weather" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/475584.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Legacy left by Arabs and Romans </h2><p>  When Spain was still a deserted territory, inhabited only by tribes, the Romans posted it.  It was they who erected here beautiful fortresses, which served as the main defensive strip of the city.  Climbing into one of these fortresses, you can contemplate a beautiful view of the old city.  And in the Middle Ages, the Arabs left their legacy here.  They built their famous baths on the outskirts of Gerona.  Today, to look at this Islamic miracle of architecture, people come here from all over the Earth. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know that another city that is definitely worth a visit is Gerona (Spain).  The weather here is always good, and even if it is a bit cool outside, you can always put on a jacket and go around all the notable places of this museum city. </p>
