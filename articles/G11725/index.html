    <h2>  <span>South Goa:</span> resort features </h2><p>  Hotel Majorda Beach Resort Goa 5 * is located in the Indian state, the very name of which has become a symbol of noisy parties, hippie gatherings and fun parties.  But do not be afraid to get lost in a crowd of young people.  South Goa is no match for the North.  Immediately beyond the Zuari River begins the cloister of wealthy and respectable holidaymakers.  Of course, there are cheap guesthouses here.  But it‚Äôs South Goa that is ready to offer our tourists wonderful five-star complexes, impeccable service and staff consisting of very high-level professionals.  Believe me, here you will even forget that this is India - a country of contrasts, with many poor and even poor people.  Here you will get acquainted with a completely different world and understand why travelers are so eager here.  Right under your nose, that is, a stone's throw from the Majorda Beach Resort 5 * (South Goa) hotel, you will find first-class centers of fashionable Ayurvedic medicine and cosmetics, and beautiful wildlife, and real historical rarities.  South Goa is world famous for its stunning beaches.  Almost all of the "five" have their own coast.  No exception and Majorda Beach Resort 5 * (Goa).  Reviews claim that his beach is the best in the state.  But if you want to make sure of this from your own experience, other places are at your service.  This is Aguada near the tourist village, and Don Paula, near which there is the residence of the governor of the state, and a small piece of paradise called Dogmala with a huge selection of souvenirs, and Colva with good restaurants.  The cleanest beaches and luxury hotels are located in Varca and Cavelloosima, and the most beautiful place in the state (with snow-white dunes and water lilies) is, by all accounts, Mobor.

    <h2>  Majorda </h2><p>  This is the area where the Majorda Beach Resort 5 * hotel is located (Majorda, South Goa).  On one side of it is the luxurious Mobor, and on the other, the town of Velsao.  There is a fabulous atmosphere of relaxation and exoticism.  No wonder most of the tourists who visited Majord fall in love with her, and from then on they want to go exclusively to Goa.  An endless beach stretching for almost thirty kilometers, where eleven resort villages pass one into another - and all this is for you.  The sea is bordered by palm groves and fruit trees that descend directly to the sea.  All this is indescribably beautiful.  On the beach you will find all kinds of living creatures, which are found here in unimaginable numbers - and gulls, and starfish, and crabs.  There are practically no people here, and finding a secluded place is not a problem.  The sand is clean and very shallow.  At the same time, there are a lot of water entertainments for the most varied tastes.  This area is famous for cafes and restaurants.  Many of them are focused on Russian tourists and even have corresponding names.  For example, one of the cafes near the hotel vacationers nicknamed "At Kolya."  The village of Majorda itself once belonged to the Portuguese, and here at one time there were a lot of Jesuits.  They left a mark in local architecture.  Therefore, Hindus even included the Virgin Mary in their host of saints.  Baroque chapels and churches are common in Majorda.  And if you want to go from the Majorda Beach Resort 5 * hotel (India, Majorda) along the coast in any direction - Velsao or Betalbatima, then you can use a taxi (drivers will serve you and guides) or a bus.  The message is very good, and the condition of the transport is quite sane.  Buses can also reach the state capital - this will take you an hour and a half.  If you want to look at North Goa, then get ready to give up two hours of your time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

In any shack, you can feed the children - they will specially make mashed potatoes, meatballs, chicken, and broth.

    <h2>  Best goan beach </h2><p>  This is the most delightful place of the Majorda Beach Resort 5 * hotel (Goa).  Reviews call it chic.  The hotel is built in such a way that from almost any room to the beach is within easy reach.  Many vacationers spend all their time there.  Just imagine: white, clean, creaking, like snow, sand.  The water is very warm, like in a bath.  Therefore, you can spend hours at sea.  But it is very salty, so after bathing you need to take a shower.  The entrance is gentle, sometimes there are big waves.  The sand at the bottom is hard, smooth, without small pebbles, smooth and velvety.  Kids love to frolic and jump on the waves.  The fun rises such that no water park is needed.  You can safely go here with children, even small ones.  The shore itself is spacious, wide, sparsely populated. </p><p>  The beach has a huge selection of water sports.  Surfing and parasailing are especially popular.  You can simply have fun - ride a banana, water skiing, scooter.  Sun loungers belong to local cafes - shek.  It can be located even if you do not order anything.  They are free.  In the evenings, there are fireworks and discos on the beach.  There are no beggars.  To get to the sea, you need to go through an arch of intertwined trees. </p><p>  On the territory of Majorda Beach 5 * there are two pools.  One of them is closed.  There, children tired of the sun love to splash around.  But mostly vacationers prefer an outdoor warm pool, among the greenery and beauty.  There is a place where daily <span>beach towels</span> are changed <span>.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p> Very rarely, people come to Goa with the intention of staying in a hotel all the time.  This country is too colorful, with indescribably beautiful landscapes, and not to see it is simply a sin.  But what to choose and how best to buy?  Although the Majorda Beach 5 * hotel has a travel agency, vacationers are advised to buy trips near the hotel.  Prices there are three times lower than at the hotel.  In addition, usually such guides carry a small number of people in small minivans, and not on huge buses, and it is more comfortable to ride with them.  For excursions in the surroundings, waterfalls, an elephant ride and a spice plantation are recommended.  It is also advised to visit Colva - it is a fifteen minute journey by car from Majorda.  You can buy good Ayurvedic products in this town.  Those who are for the first time in Goa will be interested in a sightseeing tour of the state.  Some were surprised to see Catholic churches in the old town - st.  Catherine and Francis Xavier.  It‚Äôs even cheaper than buying guided tours, negotiating with taxi drivers who will show you all the local attractions, and they will also wait for you while you are walking.  Many of those who left reviews visited in this way the capital of the state of Panaji and the main city of Margao - the real old Goa.  Hotel Majorda Beach Resort 5 * is a good starting point for this.  You might be interested in an excursion to the north of the state, as well as to markets.  If you have already been to Goa, then you will probably be attracted to a two-day trip to Hampi.  Here you will see twenty-eight square kilometers of antiquities that appeared on Earth earlier than ancient Rome.  These are the ruins of temples and existing shrines, gardens, mountains and parks.  You can plunge into the religious life of India, take part in rituals.  Such a trip can be bought from guides, or can be ordered from taxi drivers - it will cost about three hundred and fifty dollars per car. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Majorda Beach Resort 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists highly value this hotel, calling it amazing, pretty, cozy, comfortable and simply incredible.  Similar resorts are really rare for Goa.  The place is just heavenly.  No wonder tourists from Russia are very fond of the Majorda Beach Resort 5 * hotel.  Booking.com does not provide the opportunity to reserve this amazing complex, but it is easy to do it on Agoda or on the website of the hotel itself.  Vacationers are attracted by the beautiful green and shady territory, developed infrastructure nearby, proximity to the airport and tourist places.  Good solid breakfasts.  It is calm, clean and well maintained.  The hotel is very homely, has its own bewitching rhythm of life.  Any problems are solved instantly - you just need to call the reception.  Many tourists return to this hotel more than once.  Some even call it his favorite family hotel.  It has a relaxing and friendly atmosphere.  No matter what they say about Goa (supposedly no one ever sleeps there, and everyone just has noisy fun), these are all stereotypes - the Majorda Beach Resort 5 * hotel is designed for a relaxing beach holiday.  There is a lot of sea and beach, gorgeous vegetation and few people.  Sometimes it is considered as the last stroke to a rich excursion program in India.  And about the good human relations established with the locals, then they remember the whole year. </p>
