And all because such things look very fashionable, stylish and spectacular, but those that are tied with their own hands are fully consistent with personal wishes.  However, mastery comes with experience, so this article will help beginners.  It will tell you how to crochet for women, present the most fashionable models and explain the technology for their implementation. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  If you say that absolutely any thing can be connected, this will not be a big exaggeration.  Therefore, before buying a hook and a yarn you like, it is important to clearly understand which product you want to get.  You can knit hats, outerwear, sweaters and vests, dresses and skirts, shorts, swimwear and even slippers.  For this reason, it is impossible to learn crocheting for women overnight.  Different products require their own instructions for implementation.  That is why the first thing to decide is what we will knit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="artesanatoluguimaraes.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet female models" class="if uuid-2946543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2946543.jpg"></div><h2>  Required Parameters </h2><p>  Having dealt with the main issue, you should consider the style of the model.  Then take measurements, with which in the future you will work.  Depending on the type of product, the required parameters vary.  You will need: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  for hats - head circumference and product height; </li><li>  pullovers and outerwear - product length, armhole height, chest circumference, sleeve length, neck width (if a collar is assumed); </li><li>  skirts and shorts - the length of the product, the circumference of the hips; </li><li>  dresses - parameters specified for sweaters and skirts; </li><li>  slippers - the length and width of the foot, lifting height, girth of the base of the lower leg. </li></ul><p>  It will be difficult for a novice master to make a swimsuit for a woman.  Crocheting this product requires complex measurements.  Therefore, experts recommend taking underwear as a template and measuring it. </p><h2>  The technology for calculating the parameters necessary for knitting </h2><p>  In order not to make a mistake with the size of the finished product, everything should be calculated in advance: </p><ol><li>  To do this, choose a pattern, tool and yarn.  And then tie a square sample with a side of ten centimeters. </li><li>  Count the number of loops and rows in it. </li><li>  Then choose which product you plan to do yourself. </li><li>  Divide all parameters by ten centimeters (length and width of the prepared sample).  And multiply the new number of horizontal measurements by the number of loops in the sample, and vertical - by the number of rows in it. </li></ol><p>  Having finished with mathematical calculations, we turn to the study of crochet technology for women. </p><h2>  Red pullover </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet sweater" class="if uuid-2946518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2946518.jpg"></div><p>  To tie a spectacular openwork T-shaped blouse, you do not need to perform complex manipulations: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  First of all, we knit a chain of the number of loops equal to half the circumference of the chest. </li><li>  Then add three lifting loops. </li><li>  We knit with a pattern that can be studied in the presented photo. </li><li>  Having reached the level of the armhole, add a number of loops on both sides.  In the depicted model - 34. </li><li>  We knit 1/2 the width of the sleeves and add a new chain in the place where the collar is planned.  We make sure that the number of loops matches. </li><li>  After that, we repeat the described manipulations, but in the reverse order. </li><li>  Then we finish crocheting a fashionable model for a woman.  We sew the product along the side seams and try on. </li></ul><h2>  Coat with belt </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet coat" class="if uuid-2946521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2946521.jpg"></div><p>  Another spectacular product does not have to be made long; if you wish, you can finish the job earlier. </p><ol><li>  To do it, you need to dial the number of loops equal to the circumference of the chest.  And also add three hoists. </li><li>  Knit to the level of the armhole. </li><li>  Then divide the canvas into two parts, given that the front will consist of two shelves. </li><li>  Raise each separately, thereby making a hole for the hands. </li><li>  Then reconnect the canvas together and tie to the desired height.  In this case, it is required to supplement the product with a collar. </li><li>  When the coat is ready, we tie the first armhole.  We begin to form a sleeve.  Then we tie the part to the desired length. </li><li>  By analogy, we carry out the second. </li><li>  We tie the belt. </li><li>  If desired, we decorate the finished coat with decorative elements. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, it is not difficult to complete the presented model for a woman.  Crochet in this case is not necessary to carry out according to the presented scheme.  The pattern can be replaced with any other, even ordinary columns. </p><h2>  Stylish hat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet hat" class="if uuid-2946529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2946529.jpg"></div><p>  Recently, a huge number of people prefer to wear the hat shown in the photo at different times of the year.  Tie it yourself with your own hands is not difficult.  You just need to start right. </p><p>  To do this, take the prepared knitting thread and wrap it twice around the fingers.  Then we tie the resulting loop, making ten single crochet.  Gently pull the free end and close the chain into a ring.  We continue knitting, focusing on the pattern.  When it is possible to form a circle, move along it without adding or decreasing anything.  Then we go on to fill in the fields, also guided by the scheme. </p><h2>  Spectacular shorts and swimsuit </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet swimsuit" class="if uuid-2946534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2946534.jpg"></div><p>  The following fashionable product looks very beautiful and original.  Its technology also does not require a long description.  Crochet for women in this case can be done with any pattern you like.  The main thing is to correctly tie the middle part of the shorts.  Its length and width can be adjusted based on your own parameters.  Decorate the finished product or leave it like that. </p><p>  In addition, it is worth noting that, by analogy, the lower part of the swimsuit is also performed.  If you want to connect the whole option, you need to climb the right number of rows to the bodice.  Tie the next part, focusing on the second scheme. </p><p>  Running a split swimsuit is even easier.  We knit shorts according to the first scheme, and a bra - according to the second, adding straps. </p><h2>  Comfortable slippers </h2><p>  Slippers are another popular item.  It is very simple to execute them, you just need to prepare a felt insole.  Or cut it out of the old palace.  If you want to make street shoes, you should use the sole left over from purchased slippers, sneakers, moccasins and other things.  Having dealt with the preparatory phase, we begin to study the instructions.  We present it in video format. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="E3_oG9gu4vc" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3_oG9gu4vc" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/1/2/5/6/11256.jpg"></div><p>  The article presented the most fashionable models for women.  The description of crochet does not imply complex actions.  Therefore, even beginners will cope with the work. </p>
