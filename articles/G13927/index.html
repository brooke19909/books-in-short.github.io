The hotel area is very well maintained and beautiful.

Indeed, a calm, but at the same time stylish and vibrant atmosphere, as well as a variety of entertainment, will satisfy the needs of representatives of all generations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  River Garden Holiday Village Hotel Policies </h2><p>  In accordance with the rules of accommodation adopted by River Garden Holiday Village HV1, check-in for arriving guests takes place after two in the afternoon.  However, if you arrived at the hotel earlier, then, provided that the previous guests have already vacated the room, and the housekeeping staff has managed to clean, you will be checked into the booked room immediately.  If the room is not ready yet, then you can leave your luggage in the luggage room and go for a walk around the territory and lunch or take a swim in one of the pools of the hotel complex. </p><p>  Check out from the hotel on the day of departure until noon.  Then it is also necessary to make payment for accommodation, as well as the use of additional services (if you have resorted to them).  If you have already paid for the hotel to a travel agency, then you will only have to pay for the additional service.  Payment can be made both in cash and with a plastic card of the Visa and Mastercard systems. </p>

However, some tourists believe that the River Garden Holiday Village is a 4-star hotel that does not stretch for five stars.  Mostly their dissatisfaction is due to the distance from the beach.
