We also summarize the reviews about it in this short review.  "Chimeros Life" - its new name, and before it was called "Majik".  The hotel is somewhat unusual for Russian tourists.  This is not a palace from The Thousand and One Nights, but a city hotel.  On the beach, he is also not worth it, so you should not count on sea views.  But this does not mean at all that if you come across a ticket to this hotel, your vacation will be hopelessly ruined.  Adequate tourists perfectly understood what the benefits of this hotel are and what exactly it is good for.  Let‚Äôs try and we will reveal his secrets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Himeros life hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1005252.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Kemer </h2><p>  This beautiful place is the best suited for the hotel - as people who wrote reviews about Himeros Life Hotel 4 * are sure.  Turkey is famous for its beautiful views, but Kemer, sandwiched between the sea and the mountains, is probably one of the most picturesque resorts in this country.  No wonder the entire coastline is built up with huge palaces for vacationers, and hotels more modestly huddle closer to the center.  We can say that Kemer is one of the most beloved Turkish resorts among Russian tourists.  Maybe because the views here are very reminiscent of the Caucasus, but the service is much better.  There is practically no hotel that does not adhere to the all inclusive system, and most of the resorts are hired by Russian-speaking personnel.  Stunning pine forests, air filled with healing scents, a port with yachts where you can admire the beautiful ships - large and small, and meditate on the meaning of life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about hotel Himeros life hotel 4 Turkey Kemer" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1005261.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Pastime on the water </h2><p>  Three very good pools - this is what the Himeros Life Hotel 4 * boasts.  The reviews of guests who visited there make it clear that in a situation where the beach is quite far from the hotel and you want to freshen up when you leave your room, artificial ponds are the best way out.  One of the pools is in the air, the second is closed, and the third is a ‚Äúpaddling pool‚Äù for kids.  Around are sun loungers and a water slide, which is included on request.  The water in the pool is clean, the reservoir is available until the evening.  Although the sea is also very good.  You can walk by walking along Kemer, and if you are too lazy, then welcome to the hotel transfer.  You will be taken quite comfortably.  The beach itself is urban, free, but here are all the accessories - flooring, deck chairs and umbrellas - for the money.  But the city coast is not the closest to the hotel.  If you want to walk to the sea, then choose a beach closer to the port.  Then the whole trip, coupled with a visit to various shops and the park, will take you no more than a quarter of an hour.  There is no sand on the Kemer beaches, pebbles are everywhere, sometimes large, sometimes small.  But the water in the sea is a beautiful azure color. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Where can I go from the hotel Himeros Life <span>Hotel 4 * (Kemer)?</span>  Reviews are advised to use the location of the hotel.
