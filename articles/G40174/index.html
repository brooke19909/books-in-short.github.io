    <h2>  Benefits of obtaining loans through the Elephant Finance service </h2><p>  In the <span>microfinance organization</span> in question, it is convenient to <span>arrange</span> loans.  In any place and at any time convenient for you, you can fill out an application on the official website and send it for consideration.  The response from the company comes pretty quickly.  The decision is made within 5-20 minutes.  In rare cases, applications are considered during the day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When sending a positive decision, the company instantly transfers money to the customer‚Äôs card.  This method of obtaining a loan in "Elephant Finance" is the only one, but at the same time it is the most modern and convenient.  The borrower can withdraw funds from the card in any place convenient for him. </p><h2>  MFI loan terms </h2><p>  Elephant Finance accepts applications for loans from Russian citizens aged 18 to 75 years: </p><ul><li>  having a job; </li><li>  retired; </li><li>  being self-employed people. </li></ul><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidence is not taken into account by Slon Finance.  A resident of any city has the opportunity to get money in debt.  To do this, you just need to fill out a short form on the official website of the microfinance organization.  No other methods will be accepted from customers. </p><p>  And now about the available amounts and interest rates.  At the first application, people can send an application for a loan in the amount of 1 thousand to 8 thousand rubles for a period of 7 to 30 days.  The interest rate is high.  People are convinced of this when using the online calculator on the website of a microfinance organization.  For example, you need to take 8 thousand rubles for 30 days.  The commission of the service with this amount is 5 thousand 160 rubles.  The total amount payable is 13 thousand 160 rubles. </p><p>  From the second loan, up to 20 thousand rubles are available to customers.  The period for which funds are issued in debt does not increase.  It also is 7-30 days.  The interest rate decreases only with the third loan. </p>

They are transferred to a card, the number of which is indicated in your account.  Sometimes customers find a lack of money in the account.

    <h2>  Negative user reviews </h2><p>  Negative reviews about "Elephant Finance" are also available.  In them, customers, first of all, write about huge percentages.  <span>The microfinance organization</span> does not indicate them on its website.  Customers can only find out the total amount to return.  Naturally, it is perceived by people easier.  They somehow do not notice a large overpayment. </p><p>  In negative reviews of Elephant Finance, people compare the company's past work with current activities.  Some say that the lender has deteriorated.  Previously, the microfinance organization sought to collaborate with regular customers.  Now she sometimes refuses them, claiming that they are insolvent even if they have a job. </p><p>  Before applying for a loan at the microfinance company Elephant Finance, you should think carefully, because of the high interest rates, very often people find themselves in a debt hole.  If you have work and confidence in the future, then you can contact a microfinance organization.  At the same time, customers recommend that beginners do not take out loans for a long period.  The longer the period, the higher the total amount to return.  In an unstable financial situation, the services of a microfinance organization should not be used. </p>
