    <h2>  The main program of the device and their features </h2><p>  The simplest multicooker models can be programmed for six tasks.  Conventionally, they are divided into two categories.  The first of these includes programs that work fully automatically.  These are various cereals.  To prepare them, just press one button.  In order for the dish to turn out tasty and high-quality, the dosage of the ingredients should be strictly observed.  This is not very difficult, because the measuring capacities are included in the package of any multicooker. </p><p>  The second category of tasks includes stewing, baking and cooking.  Moreover, the cooking mode of such dishes differs only in time. </p><p>  Using a slow cooker, it is worth bearing in mind one nuance.  Cooking time when stewing or baking begins immediately after starting the device.  In cooking mode, the timer counts down only after boiling water. </p><p>  After buying a slow cooker, it should first be washed with water and wiped.  First use should be preliminary.  In a slow cooker, you just need to bring the water to which the vinegar is added to a boil.  It is also necessary to thoroughly flush the valve designed to let off steam.  Only after all these procedures you can be quite sure that the dishes cooked in the new appliance will not have any odors of rubber or plastic. </p>
