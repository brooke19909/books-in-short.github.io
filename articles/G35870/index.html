But the resorts of the Aegean, with the exception of large cities, remain a kind of terra incognita for travelers from the Russian Federation.  In this article we will consider the hotel Cactus Charme Hotel Aquapark 4 *.  It is located in the resort village of Yalikavak.  The name is unfamiliar, right?  In this article, we will also pay attention to all the tourist "chips" of Yalikavak.  The Cactus Hotels &amp; Resorts chain of hotels is very popular.  The rating of their representative offices is always at the level of 4.5 points out of five possible.  And what will Russian tourists say about the Cactus Sharm Hotel Waterpark Hotel in Yalikavak?  Now we find out about it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cactus Charme Hotel Aquapark 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2125093.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel and how to get to it </h2><p>  The Cactus Charme Hotel Aquapark is located just eighteen kilometers from the major city of Bodrum.  The nearest international airport (Milas) is located sixty kilometers from Yalikavak.  Some tourists also land in Dalaman's air harbor.  It is located 180 kilometers from the coast of the Aegean Sea, where Yalikavak is located.  Packaged tourists, for whom the transfer price is included in the ticket price, can not puzzle how to get to the resort and the hotel.  But for others it will not be a big problem.  The main thing is to get to Bodrum.  From Dalaman there are intercity buses.  From Bodrum to Yalikavak, you can take a taxi or get on "dolmush".  The journey takes twenty minutes, and the journey in a minibus costs five lire.  In Yalikavak, you should transfer to another dolmush.  After all, Cactus Sharm Hotel Waterpark is a country hotel.  The bus stop is located right next to the hotel gate, which is very convenient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cactus charme hotel aquapark" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2125094.jpg"></div>

And not only because it is full of shops, cafes and restaurants.  This old town conquers narrow streets, a beautiful promenade.  The Turks themselves consider the beach of Yalikavak the best on the entire Aegean coast.  Tangerine gardens and olive groves densely approach the city.  There is no special fun at this resort - for discos and other ‚Äúparties‚Äù you need to go to Bodrum.  But Yalikavak is able to surprise even sophisticated tourists.  Indeed, in his bay sea lions live!  Due to the special wind rose, this resort is popular among sailors and lovers of gliding along the crest of waves on the board.  The coast due to the gentleness is also ideal for bathing babies.  The beaches here are sandy, only occasionally small pebbles can be found when entering the sea.  The hallmark of Yalikavak are windmills, visible on the tops of the surrounding hills. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Cactus Charme Hotel Aquapark (Bodrum) was built in 1998.  Tourists from Russia report that her territory is quite vast.  And most of it is occupied by a spacious lagoon-shaped swimming pool.  The hotel itself consists of one building.  Due to the peculiarities of the architectural structure, tourists find it difficult to answer how many floors are in it: in places four, and sometimes one.  The hull looks like a cluster of white, with blue roofs, houses on a hill.  Reviews also mention the flat terrain of the hotel.  There are no steep climbs and long stairs in it.  But there are no elevators in the building, so people with sore feet should order rooms on the first level.  The hotel also has a tennis court, mini-golf course and water park.  But the hotel‚Äôs own beach is across the road.  To get to it, you need to cross the territory of the adjacent hotel "Cactus Beach." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cactus Charme Hotel Aquapark Bodrum" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2125095.jpg"></div>

It has a total of 54 rooms.  They are divided into two categories - standard and family suites.  Ordinary rooms can be of different capacities - for one, two or even three people.  Accordingly, their areas are different.  In general, due to the architectural features of the building, the hotel rooms on the ground floor are larger than on the upper levels.  But what pleased the guests was that all the rooms have a direct or side view of the sea.  The standards have everything you need for a quality stay: a TV with cable channels, a minibar, a telephone, and a split system.  The rooms on the ground floor are adjoined by small terraces, on the upper levels are balconies.  The combined bathrooms have both a bathtub and a shower.  Standard amenities include a hairdryer.  Suites are larger rooms.  They are designed to accommodate four people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cactus Charme Hotel Aquapark Turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2125098.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Dining at Cactus Charme Hotel Aquapark </h2><p>  It should be said that the hotel‚Äôs infrastructure is common with the neighboring Cactus Fleur Beach Club, located on the front page, and Cactus Mirage.  In the latter there is an a la carte fish restaurant.  But his visit is paid ($ 25 for a dinner for two).  In the Cactus Sharm Hotel itself there is a main restaurant, which serves buffet meals.  Russian tourists claim that the all-inclusive concept in Turkish four-star hotels satisfies the biggest appetites and desires of even sophisticated gourmets.  Three times a week there is a gala dinner with traditional dishes of any national cuisine.  Guests from the Russian Federation remembered ‚ÄúTurkish Evening‚Äù with a lamb baked whole on a spit.  For dinner, they give delicious ice cream.  Local alcohol is poured into the bars, which Russian tourists found very high quality.  You can also try crayfish, beer, delicious cocktails, liqueurs.  Family tourists report that you could always find something to feed the children with.  The restaurant often serves mashed potatoes, cereals, mashed soups. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cactus Charme Hotel Aquapark 4 * (Turkey)" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2125099.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews about hotel Cactus Charme Hotel Aquapark 4 * (Turkey) </h2><p>  Tourists praised the water park.  Many people chose this hotel because of the presence of such entertainment in it.  There are only two extreme slides in it, most of the attractions are suitable for children of primary school age.  The disadvantage of the water park is that on weekends it becomes paid.  The beach (it belongs to the Cactus Fleur Beach Club Hotel) is sandy, only a little pebble off the coast.  For a convenient descent to the sea, a pier is installed.  There are plenty of loungers and they are free for guests of all Cactus hotels.  Cactus Charme Hotel Aquapark (Turkey) offers free Wi-Fi in the lounge, adult animation, a mini club, a children's pool and a playground.  The hotel has friendly staff, but only one girl speaks Russian at the reception. </p>
