Let us take a closer look at what is hidden behind this toponym. </p><h2>  From the history of the region </h2><p>  Fortunately, the Altai region is one of the most environmentally sound territories of the Russian Federation today.  Plans for the development of hydropower, the construction of power plants and reservoirs on the Katun existed throughout the entire period of Soviet history, but it never came to their concrete implementation.  Turquoise Katun remained clean and uncluttered by industrial waste.  In addition to a happy combination of circumstances, public opinion should be thanked for this purity, which has always opposed plans for any construction on Katun.  And over time, the realization came of the fact that in addition to the hydropower potential, there is also a recreational one.  After all, the nature of the Altai Mountains is not only not inferior in its expressiveness to the Swiss, but also surpasses it.  Only a reasonable and correct approach to its use is required. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turquoise katun" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/444866.jpg" width="496"></div>

By a special decree of the Government of the Russian Federation dated February 3, 2007, the Turquoise Katun special economic zone was established in the Altai Territory.  The status of a special zone with a low level of taxation is important for attracting investment in construction and improving the technical infrastructure of the tourism industry.  The aim of the project is the development of environmental, health, sports and water tourism in the region.  But not only tourist camps should be built in the <span>Altai Territory</span> .  Turquoise Katun as an investment project involves an integrated approach to the development of tourism, which includes many significant components - from the construction of a modern road network to information and advertising support for the Altai tourism industry in the media.  Turquoise Katun will have the status of a special economic zone until 2055.  Preferential taxation has already yielded more than a tangible economic effect.  It is expressed in the figure of 9 billion rubles - this amount was able to attract investment in the project. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turquoise katun rest" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/444868.jpg" width="495"></div>

Its total territory covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã3326 hectares.  Turquoise Katun camp sites are located in one of the most beautiful places in the Altai Mountains.  Katun in its lower reaches breaks its channel among massive mountain ranges with snow-capped peaks.  Mountain slopes, covered with dense relict forests, wide steep ledges, descend to the river and form a picturesque valley.  Forests in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãTurquoise Katun are mixed in nature with a predominance of conifers.  This place, among other things, is also known for the fact that the famous Tavdinsky caves are located here.  In the framework of the infrastructure project to equip the <span>recreational area</span> on the banks of the Katun River, an artificial bay was created.  A significant part of tourist sites are located on its shore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on turquoise katuni" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/444869.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Mountain river rafting and extreme rides </h2><p>  A calm and measured rest on the "Turquoise Katun" is not for everyone.  But the thrill seekers were not mistaken in their address when they chose the direction to Gorny Altai.  There are many opportunities to get a dose of adrenaline.  The most popular of them - the glory of the river on kayaks or inflatable rafts, called "rafts".  Katun in the lower reaches gradually loses its rapid pressure and becomes accessible to mid-level rafts.  Nevertheless, the Manzherok rapids are a very serious obstacle requiring respect for themselves.  Attempts should not be made to rafting along the Katun River on their own in the absence of an adequate level of sports training.  Rafting, or rafting, is carried out under the guidance of qualified instructors.  Among other extreme entertainments in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe tourist complex, bungee jumping and overcoming an <span>obstacle course</span> in the so-called rope park on the banks of the Katun River are practiced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turquoise katuni camp sites" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/444867.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Speleological tourism </h2><p>  Turquoise Katun, a vacation on which involves acquaintance with many interesting natural sights of Altai Mountains, among other things, provides a rare opportunity to dive into the geological bowels of the earth.  Unique karst <span>Tavdinsky caves</span> attract lovers of speleological tourism not only from Russia, but also from many countries of the world.  An array of a large number of caves stretched for several kilometers along the coast of Katun among steep cliffs and cliffs.  Most of them have horizontal entrances and are easily accessible to non-trained public.  Some cave entrances are equipped with wooden stairs and turnstiles.  You can get inside only according to the tickets purchased.  However, no one bothers to enter the cave for free at any of several entrances located nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="base turquoise katun" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/444865.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Ski direction </h2><p>  Some camp sites "Turquoise Katun" operate year-round.  <span>Alpine skiing is</span> widely popular throughout the civilized world.  But beyond the Urals and in Siberia, it is in its infancy.  In the Altai Mountains, the natural conditions for its development are close to ideal.  By the number of mountain slopes that are potentially suitable for equipping downhill routes, and the expressiveness of the surrounding landscape, Turquoise Katun competes on equal terms with Switzerland.  Currently, only two full-fledged ski slopes are equipped in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe tourist complex.  Work is planned in the direction of their improvement and equipment with special ski lifts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turquoise Katun mountain Altai" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/444870.jpg" width="496"></div>
