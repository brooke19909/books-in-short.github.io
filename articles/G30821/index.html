When using the services of a particular operator, sometimes the thought arises of moving to another provider.  But I don‚Äôt want to change my number, because many people already know it.  Very popular operator "Megaphone".  That is why most often the question arises of how to make the transition with your number to "Megaphone". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer with your number to a megaphone" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46192/1847300.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Who needs to switch to Megafon? </h2><p>  It is worth saying that there are a lot of arguments for choosing "Megaphone" instead of another operator.  But this does not mean that other providers <span>provide low-quality</span> communication <span>services</span> . </p><p>  Among the most common causes are: </p><ol><li>  In the subscriber‚Äôs area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidence, other operators are not able to provide high quality communications.  This applies to the outback. </li><li>  It is not always advantageous to use a specific telecom operator, since in the line of tariffs it offers there is not exactly one that would satisfy all the requirements of the subscriber. </li><li>  All the close people of the subscriber, with whom you most often have to get in touch, have long switched to Megafon. </li></ol><p>  How to switch to Megafon with your number?  It should be noted that the process of transition from one operator to another is regulated by law.  In 2012, the Law on Communications was adopted, which states that the subscriber can switch as many times as he wants while taking the subscriber‚Äôs number with him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  According to the rules of the current legislation, during the transition, the operator must provide the minimum time for organizing the process itself.  In order for everything to go officially, the subscriber must fill out the relevant documents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to switch from beeline to megaphone" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46192/1847297.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Upon transition, Megafon should issue a new SIM card to the subscriber, which will work on the old number.  At the same time, the subscriber may be refused to transfer the number, especially if there is a debt on his card. </p><h2>  What does the transition procedure involve? </h2><p>  The procedure itself involves the following conditions and actions: </p><ol><li>  You must go to the site of the operator "Megaphone" and go to the section that involves the transfer of numbers. </li><li>  It is imperative that in order to switch to another operator, it is necessary to fill out an application in electronic form stating (and thus confirming) that it is the applicant who owns the number to be transferred.  It should also be confirmed that the applicant did not change his surname and passport and that all available data in the contract concluded with the previous provider is relevant.  But the most important condition for switching to Megafon is the absence of debt on the current account. </li><li>  The application should enter information about the place where the delivery of the SIM card will be made.  At the same time, the card is delivered free of charge to the capital and the MKAD.  In other regions, you will have to pay for delivery. </li><li>  If there has already been a transition from one provider to another more than 2 months ago, you need to inform the operator about this. </li></ol><p>  After the documents are completed and also signed, the transition with your number to Megafon will be carried out within the strictly specified time.  The provider will notify the subscriber with a message. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transition to a megaphone" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46192/1847299.jpg" width="600"></div>

The minimum transition period is 8 days, the maximum is 6 months.  Moreover, this company does not matter where the subscriber comes from.  Even if the number was used earlier on different providers, Megafon does not care about this moment at all.  The operator will be happy if those users who previously went to competitors return to it. </p><p>  For new subscribers, the transition to Megafon means that it is possible to use and choose any tariff from the line.  The process itself means that a new SIM card will be activated, but only after the relevant documents are signed between the operator and the subscriber. </p><h2>  The procedure for the provision of services </h2><p>  To make it more clear how the transition process takes place, you need to familiarize yourself with the procedure for providing this service.  The whole process can be divided into several stages: </p><ol><li>  Initially, the user must conclude a contract.  For this, as mentioned earlier, it is necessary to visit a communication salon or fill out documents on the site.  Be sure to pay the debt on the card, otherwise the transfer may be refused. </li><li>  Next, the operator will offer to choose a package of services, and it will need to be paid.  The process of changing the supplier will cost 100 rubles. </li><li>  In order to monitor the status of the transition, you can use the services of your Personal Account.  When the process is completed, an SMS message should come, after which you can get a new card. </li><li>  At the moment when the transition is made out, no alternative or temporary card is issued to the subscriber.  He uses the old one and pays for communication in accordance with current tariffs. </li><li>  Next comes the SMS that it is time for the subscriber to change the card and insert a new one into the phone.  From this moment it can be considered that the transition with your number to Megafon is complete. </li></ol><p>  As can be seen from the presented manual, the procedure for changing the operator, provided that you save your number, is quite simple, so everyone can implement it, while spending a minimal amount of time and effort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Change "Beeline" to "Megaphone" </h2><p>  How to switch from Beeline to Megafon?  There is also nothing complicated in resolving this issue.  Switching to Megafon without changing the number from the Beeline operator can be made from any tariff plan.  But!  The transition itself can be carried out not from the time that is convenient for the subscriber, but only at the end of the month when the tariff plan expires. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="go to the megaphone" class="if" height="478" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1866289.jpg" width="600"></div>  Switching with your number to Megafon from Beeline can take from 8 days to six months.  Until that time, until the selected operator activates a new SIM card, the subscriber can use the old one.

    <h2>  Transition from Iota </h2><p>  The transition from Yota is carried out according to a similar algorithm.  When choosing a new operator for the transition with saving the number, we recommend that you study the tariffs.
