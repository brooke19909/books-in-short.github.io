    <h2>  History of Belgorod region </h2><p>  A settlement in this region arose in the first millennium.  In these places, the <span>Eastern Slavs were</span> founded <span>.</span>  As a fortified city, Belgorod was founded in the 10th century by Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavovich to protect residents from the Pechenegs.  In 1596, a fortress was built next to the main Tatar roads.  The fate of the outpost was not simple: it was attacked by Crimean khans, Tatars and Polish-Lithuanian magnates.  After one of the raids, the city was completely destroyed.  In 1662, the fortress was rebuilt anew. </p><p>  Belgorod and the surrounding settlements were badly damaged during World War II.  There were almost no buildings left; everything had to be restored again.  Nowadays, the city is considered one of the most comfortable and clean cities in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alekseevka Belgorod region attractions" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/397769.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Alekseevka </h2><p>  180 km east of Belgorod is the district center Alekseevka.  The village is located on the picturesque <span>river Silent Pine.</span>  Rumor has it that the ancestors of Dmitry Medvedev lived here - in the city of Alekseyevka, Belgorod Region.  The sights of this place are the museum of local lore and beautiful natural landscapes. </p><h2>  Grayvoronsky district </h2><p>  In these places, thanks to the enthusiasm of craftsmen and collectors of cultural objects, excellent soil was created for the development of the now popular ‚Äúrural tourism‚Äù.  On the basis of their own households, the residents of the region organized guest estates and workshops of traditional crafts.  Here you can live like a real peasant - sleep on the stove, enjoy freshly baked bread, milk livestock, take part in field work and just enjoy the picturesque local nature.  Such entertainment is especially popular with foreign guests. </p><h2>  "Khmelnitsky Oak" </h2><p>  This is not all that the Belgorod region is famous for.  Sights of the region are also an old oak, which is more than 300 years old.  According to legend, it was planted by <span>Bogdan Khmelnitsky</span> himself as a sign of the reunification of Ukraine and Russia.  Near this powerful tree is the temple of Our Lady of Sorrows.  On the wedding day, many newlyweds come to hang the lock on a chain and tie a ribbon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belgorod temples" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/397771.jpg" width="562"></div>
