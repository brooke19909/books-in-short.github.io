Modern parts are of high quality, but all the same, extraneous knocks and vibration begin to appear during the operation of the machine.  It is these factors that should cause concern for the owner, because without a good depreciation system damage to the drum and tank of the washing machine can occur.  The appearance of such malfunctions inevitably leads to costly repairs of the main units of the home assistant. </p><p>  To maintain the operability of the entire washing unit, you need to know the device and the basics of repairing shock absorbers for washing machines.  It will also be useful to make the replacement of this element with your own hands. </p><h2>  Assignment of shock absorbers </h2><p>  During washing, the drum rotates at high speed, especially in the spin mode, which leads to vibration of the entire unit.  Shock absorbers for washing machines, along with dampers, are designed to eliminate this drawback. </p><p>  Usually, all these parts are located at the bottom of the washing machine tank and smooth out its vibrations.  Like many other units of the unit, shock absorbers for washing machines are exposed to significant mechanical loads during operation, therefore, they are damaged. </p><p>  In the event of a defect in the part, it will be necessary to completely or partially replace the defective element.  But in some situations, it is possible to carry out minor repairs of the shock absorbers of the washing machine. </p><h2>  Shock absorber </h2><p>  The shock absorbers located at the bottom resemble a cylinder.  In principle, shock absorbers for Samsung washing machines are almost no different from models from other manufacturers (Bosch, Lg and others). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="picclick.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shock Absorber for Samsung Washing Machine" class="if uuid-2890940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2890940.jpg"></div><p>  Shock absorbers consist of the following parts: </p><ul><li>  piston; </li><li>  cylinder; </li><li>  sealing cuff; </li><li>  spring, which returns the mechanism to its original state; </li><li>  special sleeve with which the part is mounted. </li></ul><p>  As a result of the movement of the piston, which is smoothly recessed into the inside of the cylinder, there is a decrease in tank oscillations, which reduces vibration of the entire unit.  A spring located inside the cylinder returns the piston to its original state. </p><h2>  The reasons for the failure of shock absorbers </h2><p>  During operation, any household appliances are subject to increased load, which leads to malfunctions.  This also applies to shock absorbers for washing machines.  Regardless of the fact that the constructive device of this element is considered reliable enough, still long-term operation affects the performance of the elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.electronic-discount.be" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shock absorber for washer Bosch" class="if uuid-2890910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2890910.jpg"></div><p>  The main causes of shock absorber failure are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  machine overload of more than the established norm, which leads to a bend or breakdown of the body; </li><li>  a long operating time leads to physical wear of rubbing parts; </li><li>  violation of the rules of transportation of the washing machine; </li><li>  wear of holding sleeves and bolts; </li><li>  mechanical malfunctions. </li></ul><p>  In case of improper operation of the washing machine during the washing process, especially in the spin mode, it is necessary to check the operation of the shock-absorbing system in order to avoid more complex breakdown of the main components of the unit. </p><h2>  Checking the shock absorber </h2><p>  If there is a creak or knock during operation, as well as a drop in the drive belt of the electric motor, it can be concluded that there may be problems in the operation of the shock-absorbing system. </p><p>  You can check the shock absorber for the washing machine without dismantling it.  For these purposes, disconnect the unit from the mains and shut off the water supply, and then inspect the parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shock Absorber for LG Washing Machine" class="if uuid-2890904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2890904.jpg"></div><p>  The procedure is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Dismantle the top cover of the machine.  To do this, unscrew the mounting bolts on the back wall. </li><li>  Gently press the unit tank so that it drops five centimeters down. </li><li>  Then abruptly release it. </li><li>  If the tank returns to its original position, then the shock absorber is in good condition. </li></ol><p>  If the tank does not return to its original position or sways, it will be necessary to repair or replace the defective part. </p><h2>  Shock Absorber Repair </h2><p>  If you wish, minor repairs to the shock absorbers of the washing machine can be done with your own hands.  Such actions relate mainly to the replacement of gaskets between the cylinder and the piston.  You can make such a gasket yourself from high-quality material and on the model of the original. </p><p>  Repairing the mechanical components of the shock absorber is very problematic.  However, experts do not recommend repair work, as further trouble-free operation cannot be guaranteed. </p><p>  It is recommended that when a defect occurs, a complete replacement of the shock absorbers. </p><h2>  Replacing the shock absorbers of a Bosch machine </h2><p>  To replace a defective part, you must first prepare the unit for work.  For these purposes, you must turn off the electrical power, shut off the water supply and position the machine so that it is convenient to operate.  You can access the shock absorbers for the Bosch washing machine by first removing the front wall of the unit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.searspartsdirect.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Front wall removal" class="if uuid-2891009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2891009.jpg"></div><p>  The procedure for the replacement of the shock absorber is as follows: </p><ol><li>  First of all, the top cover of the unit is dismantled.  This operation is carried out by unscrewing the mounting bolts located on the rear wall.  Then the cover is removed by moving forward. </li><li>  Next, remove the control panel, after removing the washing powder receiver. </li><li>  After removing the control panel, you need to carefully lay it on top of the machine so as not to damage the connecting wires. </li><li>  Next, unscrew the screws that secure the front wall. </li><li>  Then remove the door clamp that holds the cuff.  We remove these parts inside the machine so as not to interfere with further work. </li><li>  Remove the front wall of the unit. </li></ol><p>  After we removed the front wall, we will see shock absorbers.  Having removed the fastening of the elements, it is necessary to diagnose the health of the shock absorbers.  To do this, try to compress the part.  If at least one shock absorber is compressed easily, then replacement of all devices will be required.  Replacing one defective shock absorber will not guarantee system uptime. </p><p>  Shock absorbers for the LG washing machine are replaced by a similar method.  Only in cars of this brand may a pump be dismantled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestbuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Access to the shock absorber through the front wall of the machine" class="if uuid-2890955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2890955.jpg"></div><p>  When buying new units of the unit, it is advisable to present to the seller the necessary part previously removed from the machine.  Spare parts for washing machines Samsung, Bosch, LG, it is advisable to purchase in specialized centers, as there are warranty obligations for the goods sold. </p><h2>  Features of replacing the device on Samsung machines </h2><p>  The shock absorbers of the manufacturers of this company are characterized by high reliability and quality.  The washing machine of this company can work for a long time without any damage to the shock absorbers. </p><p>  Features of replacing shock absorbers are dictated by their location.  To access the defective part, just lay the machine on its side.  But for the convenience of carrying out the replacement, you can remove the back wall, which is not particularly difficult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diyinsanity.blogspot.com" data-author=": Gene Anderson, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Access to the shock absorber through the rear wall" class="if uuid-2890982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2890982.jpg"></div><p>  Spare parts for Samsung washing machines can be bought at any specialized store. </p><p>  Remember that when an abnormal noise or knock occurs in the washing machine, it is urgent to diagnose the shock absorbers.  This procedure cannot be postponed, since further operation of the unit can lead to damage to expensive components. </p>
