    <h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Mark comes from the mountain village of Ust-Nera in Yakutia, known for extremely low temperatures.  His father Alexander, a former Soviet dissident, was exiled there. </p><p>  The boy was born in 1979.  His parents recall that at that time it was terribly cold: -63 degrees Celsius.  Already becoming an adult, Mark often jokes on this subject: they say, before leaving Yakutia, thick fur covered his body.  And he believes that the "small homeland" has left a noticeable imprint on the development of personality.  However, given the conditions of the area, it is impossible not to agree with him. </p><h2>  Relocation </h2><p>  This event took place in 1991.  At the age of 12, Mark Podrabinek left for Moscow, where he graduated from high school.  Then the young man entered Moscow State University to study as a journalist, but never received a diploma: he simply stopped attending classes, heading to the North Caucasus. </p><p>  But this was not a particularly surprising event, because even after a year of business trips, in 2001, student performance dropped significantly.  And it was already impossible to forget the taste of travel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Passion for photography </h2><p>  The first large-scale trip made by Mark Podrabinek brought him to Chechnya.  The gloomy atmosphere of the country forced the young man to take his first pictures on a 2-megapixel soap dish.  He really wanted to capture what was happening for himself personally, so the quality of the photos was of little importance. </p><p>  However, without the professional activities of a television journalist, this hobby might not have appeared.  Actually, after a failure with higher education, Mark did not give up.  The lack of a document did not prevent him from developing in his chosen field. </p><h2>  Work for the soul </h2><p>  Mark Podrabinek, whose biography is full of entertaining facts, began with a news correspondent and eventually grew to the lead.  In addition, at the moment, the journalist independently makes documentaries for the channel "My Planet".  For 17 years now, the man has been exclusively engaged in television and photography. </p>

    <p>  Now he fully confirms <span>Confucius</span> ' famous <span>dictum</span> about choosing work for everyone.  He managed to combine earnings and enjoyment from his own activities.  This was again helped by the My Planet channel, which organized the Behind the Scenes project, which was led by Mark Podrabinek.  It contains both hobbies of a journalist: photography and exploring the world around him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He also released a television show in which shooting was carried out on the longest motor rally in Russia, with a total complexity of 11 thousand kilometers. </p><h2>  Travels </h2><p>  As Mark himself says, he does not count on principle the number of countries he has visited, so he never lists them in an interview.  Passion for travel does not fade in him, despite the difficulties and phobias that he has to face in the process.  Moreover, a man tries to fight his fears, overcoming everything that scares him.  Not very helpful so far, but the photographer does not despair. </p>

    <p>  He believes that the atmosphere that reigns in the air rivets the country.  It is for her that Podrabinek loves the Himalayas, Southeast Asia and Tel Aviv.  And, of course, she dreams of traveling around another half of the world, since there are much more visited places in which the photographer has not been. </p><h2>  A family </h2><p>  Mark Podrabinek with his wife and daughter Sonya rents a living space, which is absolutely satisfied, and so far he does not intend to change it.  His long trips are perceived by beloved women calmly, although they make him miss the head of the family.  However, the second half of Mark fully shares his hobbies and is not against traveling at all, however, while the daughter is still not old enough, not all plans are feasible. </p><p>  Just a year ago, Mark, together with his wife and daughter, visited Africa, as part of the courses of his photo school.  Sophia was satisfied and showed herself to be the best on this trip: she was not capricious, she did not interfere with adult students and participated with pleasure in the search for scenes for shooting.  This inspired Podrabinek to take his daughter with him more often, and at the same time organize trial family courses. </p>

    <h2>  Hobby </h2><p>  The man considers the photograph to be just a hobby, but this did not stop him from starting a school called the Human Resources Department.  It enjoys considerable success, despite the abundance of competition in this area.  In addition, within its framework, the television journalist organizes trips to the former locations of the filming of his program, helping people learn in practice, which is much more fun. </p><p>  Podrabinek Mark, whose photo is often flashed on the Web, plans to organize his exhibition in the future.  True, in one fell swoop it‚Äôs not possible to show everything - too many frames were made to him.  But to see at least something of what was not previously shown in the public domain is worth a lot. </p>
