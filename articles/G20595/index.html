    <p>  On December 31, after ten in the evening in Paris, one more traditional phenomenon can be observed.  People begin to move towards the Champs Elysees and settle down in the areas adjacent to them.  It seems that the boulevard, famous all over the world, is filled on New Year's Eve by tourists from all over the world.  You can see among them our compatriots who decided to celebrate the New Year in Paris.  The main attraction on this night is an unforgettable walk, the beginning of the route of which is located on <span>Charles de Gaulle Square,</span> and the final point is Concorde Square.  Shops located on the Champs Elysees are open until midnight that day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New year </h2><p>  Towards midnight, revival begins to be seen around the famous Eiffel Tower.  There are no chimes near this building.  The crowd mentally counts the blows on their watch.  The New Year in Paris begins with the inclusion of hundreds of small flickering lights on the Eiffel Tower.  Everyone who gathered near her pours champagne into plastic cups.  Loving couples celebrate the arrival of the New Year with kisses.  Parisians believe that if at the time of the New Year's arrival near the Eiffel Tower make a wish, then it must certainly come true. </p><p>  The festive performance ends there.  Around the tower, mass festivities and round dances are not held.  Most of the restaurants are closed, and people disperse in nightclubs and entertainment cabarets.  Some choose walks along empty streets. </p>

    <h2>  Night clubs </h2><p>  New Year in Paris will certainly leave a lasting impression.  Festive mood, no doubt, will give you clubs.  The best institutions have everything that is necessary for such a case.  The downside of nightclubs is only a large crowd of people.  In this regard, there is a possibility that you simply will not get there.  Finding another place in New Year's Paris is problematic due to a transportation problem.  It is difficult to find a taxi, and the police cordon, which is exhibited in most fashionable places, as well as on the Champs Elysees and the surrounding streets, will not allow you to travel by your car. </p>
