In this regard, they have a minimum amount of opportunities.  The most important advantage that the “Momentum” card (Sberbank) has is the ability to draw up and receive it already ready in no more than 15 minutes in any department.  Such cards belong to the Visa Electron or Maestro payment system.  Currency can be any.  But if a credit card is issued in dollars or euros, then this is possible only if the owner receives a loan in the appropriate currency.  Instant means of payment can be used not only in your own country, but also abroad. </p><h2>  How can I get an instant card? </h2>

    <p>  How is the Instantum card activated?  Sberbank describes the conditions for using credit cards in detail, and they should be carefully studied.  Then you need to open the sealed envelope, which contains the card itself and the pin code.  If you don’t know the secret code, you won’t be able to receive funds or pay for something in the store.  Also, you should not trust him and the card to third parties or simply tell someone your secret information. </p><p>  Now you should carefully examine the card itself.  Make sure that everything is correct, its number is clearly visible and there is a logo of the payment system. </p><p>  Next, on the back of the card in a white field, put your signature.  The bank itself promises that the very next day, the Momentum card (Sberbank) will be activated automatically. </p><p>  To independently verify its operability, you can insert it into an ATM and, for example, check the balance. </p><h2>  Making instant card online </h2>

    <p>  Unfortunately, when answering the question of how to get the Sberbank “Momentum” card, it cannot be said that it can be issued via the Internet.  Today it is no longer necessary to specifically submit an application and wait for the bank to approve it.  Simply contact any branch, and the card will be in your hands for 15 minutes.  Among other things, you can register a card in the “Thank you from Sberbank” bonus program, make money transfers, pay for purchases directly in the store or via the Internet, remotely manage your funds, receive discounts, connect auto payments and so on. </p><h2>  Is it safe to use the card? </h2><p>  The Instantum card (Sberbank) has reliable protection.  As a rule, the reasons why fraudsters gain access to the account are simple facts of neglect of the rules by the clients themselves.  First of all, do not store the card and pin code side by side.  When you receive an envelope with a card inside, it is best to just remember the pin code and get rid of the envelope.  When making payments, you should not allow sellers to take the card out of your sight.  If you receive an email or SMS message asking you to provide a PIN code, then be aware that it is strictly forbidden to do this!  Bank representatives do not need a PIN code to complete operations with your permission or simply to clarify information.  Try to avoid ATMs in crowded public places, as they are often put on the lining with which attackers get your card information. </p><h2>  How to recharge a card? </h2>

    <p>  So, how is the Momentum card (Sberbank) replenished?  The instructions are pretty simple.  There are several methods for performing an operation. </p><p>  1. You can deposit cash through the bank cash desk.  To do this, it is enough to provide a passport, card number (if any) or account number.  Next, you need to name the transfer amount, check the correctness of the details - and that’s all, after a while the funds will go to your account. </p><p>  2. Through the terminal.  This method is the simplest of all, with the help of which the Momentum card (Sberbank) is replenished.  Customer reviews speak for themselves.  There is nothing complicated here.  It is enough to insert a card into the ATM, enter the pin code and enter the required amount.  Funds will be credited to the account instantly. </p><p>  3. At the cash desk of another bank.  But when making such a transfer, you should remember that you are expected by a commission that is charged by the bank.  In addition, money can go more than one day.  And basically it is a very long time, while debt should be paid off quickly. </p><p>  4. From an electronic wallet.  WebMoney and Yandex.Money systems also allow you to make transfers to cards.  Here you just need to enter either the details of the account, which is long enough, or indicate the card number.  As a rule, money comes in very quickly. </p><p>  It should be said that to replenish the card is not necessary the personal presence of its holder.  The transfer may be performed by a third party.  Although he will need to provide his passport and write a statement in which all details will be indicated. </p><h2>  What could be the unpleasant consequences? </h2><p>  Surely, each of us knows that in the event of failure to fulfill our obligations on time, certain consequences arise.  Speaking specifically about credit cards, then a bank may be fined when paying off a payment later than the due date. </p><p>  Typically, credit organizations levy a certain percentage for each overdue day.  As for Sberbank, it has 38%, while other banks have only 24%. </p>
