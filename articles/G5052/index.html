  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The largest student campus in Russia - Universiade Village in Kazan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 2013, Kazan hosted a worldwide large-scale sporting event - the XXVII Summer Universiade.  The city was preparing for it for a long time and thoroughly - many large sports facilities appeared, a tremendous development of the transport infrastructure and the service sector took place.  Kazan is a hospitable capital, so it‚Äôs well prepared for the meeting of athletes.  One of the most important complexes built for the Universiade, namely for the residence of athletes participating in different countries, is the Universiade Village (Kazan).  It is about it that will be discussed in our article. </p><h2>  general information </h2><div class="photo" data-original="prokazan.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Universiade Village in Kazan" class="if uuid-2238629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54078/2238629.jpg"></div><p>  The Universiade Village in Kazan is a whole residential complex consisting of 28 multi-storey buildings with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 300,000 m <sup>2</sup> , designed for athletes, their accompanying people and members of the delegation of this large-scale sports event.  The microdistrict was built in 2010, the first settlement was carried out on August 30.  About 5,500 rooms accommodate more than 10,000 people. </p><h2>  Media center </h2><p>  In addition to residential buildings, various facilities are located on the territory of the Universiade Village.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  Post Office of Russia; </li><li>  several cafes; </li><li>  sports equipment rental salon; </li><li>  studio; </li><li>  laundry; </li><li>  copy center; </li><li>  ATMs </li><li>  beauty saloon; </li><li>  grocery stores; </li><li>  driving school. </li></ul><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.7435071" data-lng="49.18441770000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/4/6/346.png"></div><p>  All this makes living in the complex as comfortable as possible.  Convenient location of the Universiade Village - close to the metro station "Victory Avenue" and public transport stops - allows you to get to almost any corner of the city.  During the sports competitions in the Village there was also a media center from which the broadcast of the main events was conducted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Universiade Village in Kazan today </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kpfu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel Universiade Village in Kazan" class="if uuid-2238626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54078/2238626.jpg"></div><p>  Before and after the Universiade, the facility is used as a student hostel, namely, as the largest campus in the Russian Federation, owned by the <span>Kazan Federal University.</span> </p><p>  The rules of living in the hostel of the Universiade Village in Kazan are quite simple, although a little strict - but all this is done to maintain order and deliver the most comfortable conditions for each resident.  During your stay it is forbidden to: </p><ul><li>  break the silence at night (after 22.00); </li><li>  keep animals in rooms; </li><li>  drink alcohol and drugs; </li><li>  soiling and breaking furniture in the room; </li><li>  glue posters, thereby damaging the wallpaper; </li><li>  leave electrical appliances on; </li><li>  fight. </li></ul><p>  The administrative unit is responsible for the order and solution of the main issues.  The cost of living on the student campus of the Universiade Village in Kazan is no more than five hundred rubles a month.  For settlement, a standard set of documents is required, consisting of the original and a copy of the passport, TIN, medical and pension policies, three 3 * 4 cm photographs, a medical certificate containing information on fluorography, a blood test for RW, the conclusion of a dermatovenerologist, and also the application for population. </p><h2>  Medical Center </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sdelanounas.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Student Clinic in the Universiade Village in Kazan" class="if uuid-2238625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54078/2238625.jpg"></div><p>  Equally important is the availability of a medical care center in the microdistrict - a student polyclinic in the Universiade Village in Kazan.  From the moment of construction to this day, it serves more than twenty-five universities of the city, the total number of students in which exceeds seventy thousand people.  About two hundred specialists monitor the health of the young generation of the city.  The latest equipment and comfortable conditions allow for the prevention and timely treatment at a high level.  The presence of a day hospital, an infectious unit, a physiotherapy unit and the ability to provide emergency care makes the student polyclinic a universal medical institution. </p>
