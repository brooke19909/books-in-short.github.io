  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to find out the registration number in the FIU for reporting. Acquaintance with the tax calendar for the simplified tax system for 2012</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You are registered as an individual entrepreneur or use another organizational form (for example, LLC).  Due to the need to submit reports to the funds (social insurance and pension), you just need to know the registration number in the FIU.  In order to do this with minimal time and money, it is optimal to use the so-called "electronic extracts" from KGRIP and Unified State Register of Legal Entities, which are now offered at every step for nothing.  It is just that a company providing such services has a subscription to the corresponding information service.  For 2012, the cost of an extract of the above type is only 100 rubles. </p><p>  The low cost of an extract in comparison with an official document from a tax authority is due to the fact that an electronic extract is not a legal document at all.  As a rule, the deadline for obtaining such a certificate is up to half an hour.  In addition, there are free services where you can find out the number of FIU by TIN.  But there is a high probability that the information there will be, to put it mildly, inaccurate.  So it‚Äôs better to still act through "electronic statements". </p><p>  And the sites where you can order an extract, in which you can find the registration number in the FIU (as well as the FSS), grow in RuNet, like mushrooms after the rain.  Thus, for those who wish to file reports without problems, you just need to use one of the many services.  After receiving the extract, you calmly fill out the reports and send it via the Internet or by mail, avoiding administrative sanctions. </p><p>  <strong>For reference</strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The registration number of the PFR or the FSS is the number assigned to your company (or IP) in the relevant organizations.  This individual number is assigned to the organization or individual entrepreneur when registering with the tax authority. </p><p>  After the organization is created, the Federal Tax Service informs about this procedure one or another territorial branch of the funds that register the organization.  But it also happens that a notice from the Federal Tax Service does not come to the funds for a long time. </p><p>  <strong>Reporting deadlines in the FIU</strong> </p><p>  First of all, these reporting deadlines depend on the form of taxation used.  The most common <span>STS (simplified tax system)</span> and DOS.  In addition, for certain types of activities the Tax Code of the Russian Federation provides for special types of taxation, for example, UTII, <span>imputed income</span> tax <span>.</span>  We will consider only the simplified tax system, since this is the most convenient taxation system for small businesses, and freelance is a small business. </p><p>  According to the simplified tax system, the following reporting deadlines are provided for in the tax calendar for 2012: </p><p>  - quarterly submit reports to the FSS.  The deadline is the 15th day of the month for the reporting period; </p><p>  - report quarterly to the FIU, until the 15th day of the next calendar month for the reporting period; </p><p>  - quarterly tax return for the simplified tax system.  The deadline is until the 25th day of the next month for the reporting period; </p><p>  - annually a declaration on the Simplified Taxation System (STS) until March 31 for legal entities and until April 30 for individual entrepreneurs; </p><p>  - annually until January 20th to provide information on the number of employees in the enterprise. </p><p>  If an individual entrepreneur does not use the work of hired employees in his activity, then it is necessary to submit a declaration on the simplified tax system once a year, annually information about the absence of employees, and provide information to the FIU before March 1.  This is the necessary minimum of information that you need to know in order to legally freelance, paying all taxes.  And how to quickly find out the registration number in the FIU has already been described in detail above. </p><p>  Thus, in the article, we touched on issues related to simplifying the reporting of legal entities, including how to quickly find out the registration number in the FIU, naturally with emphasis on IP on the tax system of the simplified tax system.  After all, the topic of the article is the legalization of freelancers.  Simplification (STS) significantly reduces reporting requirements compared to the same DOS and allows the entrepreneur to almost completely concentrate on solving business issues. </p>
