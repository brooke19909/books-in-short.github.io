In today's mobile world, it is considered a necessity.  But the cost of maintaining a car is not only insurance, gas stations and spare parts.  The state also takes a transport tax.  Of course, among motorists a negative opinion about him.  But we will not enter into discussions about whether he is needed or not.  We will talk about the tax itself.  And also about the problems associated with it.  One of the main questions asked by motorists: "Why doesn‚Äôt the car tax come?"  We‚Äôll try to figure it out. </p><h2>  Transport tax: when and how it comes </h2><p>  Before you figure out why the car transport tax does not come, you need to find out when you need to pay it.  And how does he come? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car tax doesn't come" class="if" height="238" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1433551.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <span>Transport tax</span> is paid until October 1 of next year.  We give an example.  For 2016, you will have to pay the car owner until October 1, 2017. </p><p>  A notification about it comes by mail.  The tax service sends a receipt in late summer - early fall.  Many people know from their own experience how the ‚ÄúRussian Post‚Äù service works ‚Äúharmoniously‚Äù. </p><p>  Therefore, the <span>reason why the</span> car <span>tax does not come</span> may be: </p><ol><li>  Too early.  For 2016, it will come only in the summer-autumn of 2017. </li><li>  Lost correspondence with payment receipt. </li><li>  Automated failure in the Federal Tax Service program. </li><li>  The car was bought in the middle or end of the year.  The tax authorities have no information in the automated service yet. </li></ol><h2>  No receipt - no tax? </h2><p>  Many are mistakenly mistaken that if no notifications for payment come, then you can ignore the tax.  Like "no paper - no problem."  The tax on the car does not come, the receipt has not been handed over, which means ‚ÄúI did not know‚Äù or ‚Äúthey did not tell me‚Äù.  Such a short-sighted position leads to fines and penalties for late payments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car tax does not come what to do" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1433553.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Why do I need a personal taxpayer account </h2><p>  The personal account of the taxpayer allows you to: </p><ul><li>  Learn in advance about all taxes, fines, penalties, etc. </li><li>  Pay online remotely. </li><li>  Print a payment receipt. </li></ul><p>  If the car tax does not come, go to your personal account (nalog.ru).  Next, we find the necessary information. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to register a personal account? </h2><p>  To register a personal account, you need to visit the Federal Tax Service once to obtain a password.  Before that, you will have to write a statement.  You can pre-fill all the data on the service.  In this case, the system will automatically generate a statement, which will only need to be printed and attributed to the tax. </p><p>  But this is optional.  All data can be entered by tax officials on a personal visit.  After that, give out the password from your personal account. </p><p>  What data must be entered during registration: </p><ul><li>  Personal data. </li><li>  Phone numbers, email. </li><li>  Passport data. </li><li>  INN </li></ul><p>  After receiving the password, you must change it within one month.  Otherwise, the personal account of the taxpayer will be closed.  This is for the safety of citizens. </p><p>  The first three days after registration and receipt of the password, data about the taxpayer is generated.  No need to be surprised if at first you do not find the necessary information on the site. </p><h2>  When is it better not to attend the tax office? </h2><p>  In the last week of the month, as well as in all the ‚Äúreporting‚Äù months (January, April, July, October), it is better not to plan a tax visit.  The lines these days can be huge.  Citizens file tax returns. </p><p>  Of course, if you also need to "sleep soundly," it is better to combine the "two in one" and get the password from your personal account along with submitting an income report.  If not, it‚Äôs better to schedule another time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car sales tax came" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1433549.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  We calculate the tax yourself </h2><p>  If the car tax does not come, what should I do? </p><p>  The first is to calculate it yourself in order to know how much you need.  But the peculiarities of the transport tax are that there is no definite formula.  Many people mistakenly believe that driving experience affects the amount.  But no.  The insurance depends on how experienced the driver is and how old the car is.  The tax does not take these parameters into account.  It is considered independently depending on: </p><ul><li>  Region of registration of the owner. </li><li>  Engine power. </li></ul><p>  Perhaps even more depends on the registration of the vehicle owner than on ‚Äúhorses under the hood‚Äù.  This is due to the fact that each region has its own coefficients in determining the amount.  But more on that later.  Many people wonder why registration of the owner, and not the car, is necessary. </p><p>  Everything is very simple.  The government finally recognized that Russia was not a feudal fragmented principality, and unified all registration issues.  Previously, car numbers were a priori considered transit.  If the owner bought a car in Moscow and lives in Irkutsk, then he is obliged to register it in his city.  Now this is not. </p><p>  So that all cars are not ‚Äúborn,‚Äù say, from the Crimea (now there are some of the lowest ratios), it is envisaged to consider tax at the place of registration of the owner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car tax does not come receipt" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1433550.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Of course, laws also allow citizens to live in any territory with any residence permit (this was not the case before either).  But life's difficulties will force a person to register at their actual place of residence. </p><p>  To calculate the tax yourself, you need to know two things: </p><ol><li>  Regional rate. </li><li>  Engine power. </li></ol><p>  As for their "horses", there are no special problems.  Just look at the TCP.  As for the coefficients, it is necessary to specify it either on the Internet or in the tax. </p><p>  For example, engine power is 90 hp.  We find the vehicle table up to 100 hp, look at the regional coefficient and consider the future tax.  For a resident of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, he will not be at all, since the local authorities in 2015-2016.  canceled it on cars with power up to 200 hp </p><p>  It would be legally correct to say ‚Äúthey applied a coefficient equal to zero‚Äù.  After all, the region cannot repeal federal laws, but this does not play a special role for citizens.  The main thing is that they do not pay for cars. </p><p>  The second action to the question: "Car tax does not come, what should I do?"  - independently appear in the Federal Tax Service before October 1 of the year following the report with a request to issue a receipt for payment.  At the same time, you can take the password from your personal account, so that next time you do not visit this service, in order to find out and pay. </p><p>  Third, pay tax to avoid fines and penalties. </p><h2>  Sales Tax: Accruals and Benefits </h2><p>  Tax on the sale of cars is not included in the category of transport.  It is taxed according to completely different formulas.  Therefore, if a car sales tax has come, you must carefully check everything.  As a rule, a resident independently submits a declaration.  The following should be considered here: </p><ul><li>  The life of the car. </li><li>  Selling price. </li></ul>

    <p>  If you have been an owner of a car for more than three years, then no declarations are required.  This is not taxed.  If the owner is less than three years (according to MREO), then the amount depends on it.  Any sale of less than 250 thousand is also not subject to personal income tax.  As for the large amounts, here the resident can choose the tax base: </p><ul><li>  Revenue minus expense.  For example, I bought for 500 thousand rubles, sold for 400 thousand rubles.  Therefore, there are no taxes. </li><li>  Revenue minus deduction.  For example, a car was bought for 160 thousand and sold for 260 thousand. It will be beneficial for a resident to apply the formula: (260-250) x13. </li></ul><p>  To apply the first formula, it is necessary to confirm all the data with sales contracts, checks, receipts, etc. In the second case, 250 thousand is a tax deduction. </p><h2>  Transport tax: accrual problems </h2><p>  Vehicle owners often face problems related to the transport tax: </p><ul><li>  A tax on a stolen car comes. </li><li>  Obligatory to pay for someone else's car. </li></ul><p>  The last item is most common. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car tax when notification arrives" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1433552.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The tax on the sold car came: what to do? </h2><p>  Such a situation is far from uncommon.  There are times when the owner sold the car a few years ago, and the tax still comes.  The reason for this is that the former owner did not remove the car from the traffic police register, limiting itself only to the contract of sale.  This causes a number of problems. </p><p>  On the one hand, a person is not the owner of the car, and on the other, all the data in the traffic police is for him.  But the new owner of the vehicle has long sold it to another, and that third and so on. There is no end and edge in this situation.  The way out is to file a wanted number (not to be confused with theft), and then deregister the car. </p><p>  You can provide a sales contract in tax, but they rely on the database of the traffic police.  This document may simply not be taken into account.  Thus, you must first pay all taxes, and then prove through the court that the car is not yours. </p><p>  If the car is stolen, then you need to find an investigator conducting this case.  Take the necessary documents from him and come to the tax office with them. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So to summarize.  We examined the question: ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt car tax come?‚Äù  This may be a system error or loss of receipt.  In addition, we examined what a <span>car tax is when a</span> notification <span>arrives</span> and much more.  We hope that it became a little clearer in this matter.  After all, forewarned means armed. </p>
