The main period of the formation of the magnificent ensemble is the XV-XVI century. </p><h2>  How it all started </h2><p>  Strengthening the economic position of the <span>Principality of Moscow</span> led to the beginning of the construction of magnificent churches and cathedrals.  Princes Dmitry Donskoy and Ivan Kalita ordered the construction of temples, which later determined the layout structure and spatial composition of the square.  Unfortunately, the original structures were not preserved.  During the reign of Ivan the Third, new temples were erected in the same places, worthy of the capital of the great Russian state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral Square of the Moscow Kremlin" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/452541.jpg" width="418"></div>

    <h2>  Object Assignment </h2><p>  From the very beginning of its appearance, the Cathedral Square of the Moscow Kremlin was used for various ceremonies and processions.  At weddings for the reign, coronations, and on the days of great church holidays, crowded events were organized on its territory.  The seat on the porch of the Faceted Chamber was intended for the solemn meeting of foreign ambassadors.  The square was crossed by mourning processions to the place of the last refuge of the patriarchs, metropolitans, kings and grand dukes. </p><p>  Cathedral Square in Moscow in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was repeatedly paved with stone slabs made of sandstone.  For several decades of the twentieth century, it was asphalted.  During the reconstruction of 1955, the area regained its stone surface. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Objects that have not survived to the present day </h2><p>  The ensemble of Cathedral Square of the Moscow Kremlin has repeatedly transformed.  Initially, wooden structures were erected around the perimeter.  One of them did not manage to survive during the constant fires of the capital, while the others simply deteriorated, after which new ones were erected in their place.  Almost all the churches that now stand on Cathedral Square had predecessors.  The most famous of the currently non-existent objects are the Church of the Deposition of the Robe, the church of the Solovetsky miracle workers, the cathedrals of Arkhangelsk, the Annunciation and the Assumption, the old Patriarchal chambers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral Square of the Moscow Kremlin photo" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/452553.jpg" width="330"></div>

    <p>  There were buildings that destroyed or seriously damaged enemies.  So it was during the Great Time of Troubles <span>(year 1612)</span> and the invasion of Bonaparte (year 1812).  For example, when the French troops retreated from the capital, the unique Filaret annex to the bell tower of Ivan the Great was destroyed.  The three-span belfry nearby was waiting for the same fate.  The church of John Climacus was not preserved.  It was erected by decree of Ivan Kalita in 1329.  The structure was in the form of an octahedron with arches for bells, located on the second tier.  It was simply dismantled in the fifteenth century in order to free up the territory for the construction of the bell tower in honor of Ivan the Great. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The architectural appearance of the erected temples changed as time required.  Some buildings were supplemented with new chapters, covered galleries and other elements. </p><h2>  Features of the architectural style </h2><p>  Cathedral Square of the Moscow Kremlin (photos are presented in the article) has some features that are characteristic of the architectural schools of the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality and Pskov.  The masters invited from the two indicated centers of Russian stone architecture, during the construction of churches and cathedrals, not only adhered to classical techniques, but also introduced new ones.  For example, during the construction of the Church of the Deposition of the Robe, they first made a high basement.  The Pskov school had a significant impact on the decoration of facades.  So, in many temples you can see curbs, ornamental belts on the drums of domes, runners, a three-blade version of the completion of the facades.  As for the Vladimir-Suzdal school, its influence was maximally manifested in the design of the Assumption Cathedral (narrow windows and an arched belt on the apse). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral Square of the Moscow Kremlin" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/452555.jpg" width="274"></div>

    <h2>  New style </h2><p>  On the basis of a synthesis of the prominent features of two architectural schools of regional significance in the fifteenth century, the early Moscow style arose, typical of stone architecture, which later became all-Russian.  It was distinguished by keeled kokoshniks on the facades, elevated central sections and supporting arches.  At the same time, the central drum of the dome more and more clearly shifted to the eastern zone of the volume of the structure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Overseas trends </h2><p>  For some time, the Cathedral Square of the Moscow Kremlin was formed under the serious influence of Italian Renaissance architecture.  Despite the fact that invited foreign architects tried to adhere to the traditional options for erecting stone structures in Russia, the decoration of the facades of some buildings (Arkhangelsk Cathedral, the Faceted Chamber and others) stands out for elements typical of Florentine buildings.  Among them are the design of window openings and tympans, as well as ornaments.  For example, Bon Fryazin for the first time in Russia used metal screed in the construction process.  Subsequently, this seemingly insignificant element prevented the collapse of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower while trying to blow it up in 1812. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral Square of the Moscow Kremlin map" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/452557.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A bit about architects </h2><p>  Unfortunately, in the documents of the fifteenth century there are not many names of those who thanks to whom the Cathedral Square of the Moscow Kremlin appeared.  The annals mention Krivtsov and Myshkin - the leaders of the artisans of masons from Pskov who were involved in the construction of the Annunciation Church and the Church of the Deposition of the Robe. </p><p>  Due to the lack of their own experienced architects, foreigners began to be invited to Moscow.  One of the first Italian specialists to arrive was Aristotle Fioravanti.  He led the construction process of the Assumption Cathedral.  The construction of the famous Faceted Chamber was done by Marco Fryazin and Pierre Antonio Solari.  At the beginning of the sixteenth century, the construction of the Assumption Cathedral was headed by Aleviz Novy. </p><p>  The most mysterious of the Italian masters is called Bon Fryazina.  There is practically no information about his life and work.  He controlled the construction process of the first two tiers in the bell tower of Ivan the Great.  It happened in the years 1505-1508.  His work was continued by Petroc Maly, also Italian.  He worked at the Kremlin construction sites for seventeen years (since 1522), his high skill and status confirms the title of architecton.  Only two Italians could boast such recognition - Solari and Aleviz Novy. </p><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  What does the Cathedral Square of the Moscow <span>Kremlin</span> look like today <span>?</span>  <span>The layout of the</span> ensemble, of course, has changed over time.  It is important to note that historians, restorers and other specialists have worked for several decades to restore the unique appearance of many cultural and historical monuments.  Currently, an outstanding project of the XV-XVI centuries appears before admiring visitors in all its glory.  Let's consider some of its elements in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Blagoveshchensky cathedral </h2><p>  The Cathedral Square of the Moscow Kremlin (the plan of the southwestern part reflects this) is known for the cathedral built by Pskov craftsmen in 1484-1489.  From the reign of Ivan the Third to the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Annunciation Cathedral was the home church of the tsars of Russia.  The temple, which is crowned by five gilded domes, is a harmonious composition in the style of the early Moscow architectural school.  Inside it you can admire the rarest examples of sixteenth-century religious painting.  The ideas about the mission of the Orthodox Church in Russia as the direct heiress of Byzantium are expressed in complex pictorial form. </p><h2>  Cathedral of the Archangel </h2><p>  Currently, this building acts as the tomb of many Russian rulers.  It is located in the southeastern part of the central square.  The decorative appearance of the temple was largely influenced by the principles of the Italian Renaissance architectural school.  The renewed cathedral was erected on the site of the <span>temple of the Archangel Michael, who was</span> seriously affected by the storm (the fourteenth century).  The construction successfully fit into the ensemble of the Kremlin. </p><h2>  Faceted Chamber </h2><p>  This building was intended for holding court feasts and ceremonies.  It was erected in the period from 1487 to 1491. Italian architects Ruffo and Solari supervised the construction.  The decoration of the eastern facade of the building with faceted rust and the arrangement of lancet windows are the result of the influence of Italian architecture.  In the seventeenth century, the walls of the Chamber were painted by Ushakov himself. </p><h2>  Ivan the Great belltower </h2><p>  The exterior of the building is intended to symbolize the full power of Russia.  For a long time, the bell tower was the tallest building in the capital and played an important role in the main watchtower of the Kremlin.  She became the standard in the construction of such pillar-like temples throughout the state. </p><h2>  Assumption Cathedral </h2><p>  This is the main Orthodox church in Russia.  It was erected on the model of the cathedral in Vladimir.  Years of construction - 1475-1479.  On the central dome at a height of forty-five meters there is a gilded cross.  Within the walls of this temple, Russian rulers were crowned reigning and Orthodox hierarchs were elevated to the rank of.  Today, many patriarchs and metropolitans of the country rest there.  The bright central hall was painted by one hundred craftsmen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ensemble of the cathedral square of the Moscow Kremlin" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/452559.jpg" width="600"></div>
