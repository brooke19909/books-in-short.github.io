These have specific symptoms.  These funds require a special attitude towards themselves, which is expressed in a special account of three points: their admission to the organization, internal movements, and also retirement.  In this article, we consider the concept and characteristics of fixed assets, and also analyze the classification of the category. </p><h2>  general information </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.paychex.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="signs of classification of fixed assets" class="if uuid-3109998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3109998.jpg"></div><p>  The means of labor that the company uses for its own activities are called fixed assets.  And by fixed assets should be understood their value expression.  In addition, in the process of describing the production assets that a company needs to generate income, it is customary to operate with the following concepts: </p><ul><li>  Working capital is nothing more than fixed assets withdrawn from the production cycle, after which they are converted into financial assets to cover the needs of the company. </li><li>  Inventories.  Unlike fixed assets, they are used for further processing (in other words, they are used as raw materials) or sent to solve managerial problems. </li><li>  Intangible assets are considered the equivalent of fixed assets in the field of intellectual property. </li></ul><h2>  Regulatory Category </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog.bufferapp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="property attribute of fixed assets" class="if uuid-3110004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3110004.jpg"></div><p>  Before considering the signs of fixed assets, it is advisable to touch on their regulatory regulation.  So, the special requirements for their accounting are determined by special regulatory documentation.  It is important to highlight the following papers: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  402 Federal Laws with fundamental principles that are related to OS accounting. </li><li>  Instructions 157n and 162n on the use of accounting rules. </li><li>  Accounting documents PBU 6/01, as well as PBU 9/99, which establish the classification of fixed assets in accordance with the groups, the procedure for registration, and the disposal of equipment. </li><li>  Methodical instructions of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation. </li></ul><h2>  The economic nature and characteristics of the classification of fixed assets </h2><p>  It is important to note that, in economic terms, the category in question is a means of production and non-production type.  They consist of the following components: </p><ul><li>  The active part, in other words, funds that directly work on generating income. </li><li>  The passive part, that is, finance, belonging to which allows the company to carry out economic activities. </li></ul><p>  Further, it is advisable to consider the signs of classification of fixed assets.  So, among the fundamental criteria for classifying equipment as OS, it is important to note the following: </p><ul><li>  Its use to generate income during the entire period of operation. </li><li>  Equipment should not be resold.  This is the so-called property sign of fixed assets. </li><li>  Rating.  It must be borne in mind that the cost of fixed assets should be one hundred thousand rubles in tax accounting and forty thousand rubles in accounting. </li><li>  Period of use.  The useful life of the equipment should be more than a year. </li></ul><h2>  Other criteria </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mexperience.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="signs of fixed assets" class="if uuid-3110003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3110003.jpg"></div><p>  The category is also classified on the basis of fixed assets.  These include the following: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Functional signs: non-production and production. </li><li>  Industry signs: construction, budgetary organizations, industry, commerce, agriculture. </li><li>  Affiliation: rented (attracted) and own. </li><li>  Use: on conservation or operated. </li><li>  Real expression. </li></ul><p>  Among the main features of an item of fixed assets, it is worth stopping at the last point. </p><h2>  Real expression </h2><p>  Such a feature of fixed assets, as a material expression, includes a number of components.  First of all, we are talking about equipment: </p><ul><li>  Production lines, machine tools and more. </li><li>  Power plants, cars and other mechanisms. </li><li>  Laboratory and measuring equipment. </li><li>  Computers and other electronics. </li><li>  Vehicles. </li><li>  Inventory, for example, a working tool. </li></ul><p>  When considering this feature of fixed assets, it is advisable to parse the category of real estate: </p><ul><li>  Buildings and houses. </li><li>  Engineering structures (roads, bridges and other communications). </li><li>  Systems designed for energy supply (water and gas pipelines, heating mains, power lines). </li></ul><p>  The presented feature of fixed assets of enterprises includes the non-production sector: </p><ul><li>  Service apartments. </li><li>  Sports and cultural buildings. </li><li>  Children's institutions. </li></ul><h2>  Characteristics of fixed assets </h2><p>  It characterizes the object as an OS primarily the possibility of its repeated use in the economic activity of the company.  In this case, the economic characteristics of fixed assets should be taken into account: </p><ul><li>  They retain their original physical form, while there is not a single external change. </li><li>  Their depreciation over the allotted period of operation, associated primarily with direct operation in the production process, is written off from the initial cost to production costs in the form of depreciation. </li></ul><h2>  Sources of financing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sganda.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="concept and features of fixed assets" class="if uuid-3110012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3110012.jpg"></div><p>  You need to know that the formation of the OS of the company is carried out from various sources, which are determined by their features.  This is mainly about two areas.  It is advisable to parse them: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Inner.  In other words, depreciation, registered capital or profit.  Among their advantages it should be noted the possibility of an operational decision on the application, as well as the lack of costs of an additional plan. </li><li>  External.  That is, attracted targeted investments or loans.  Here the question relates to time limits on the timing of the return, as well as the need to pay certain percentage amounts. </li></ul><h2>  Fixed asset life cycle </h2><p>  One of the specific features of fixed assets is their life cycle.  In the implementation of practical activities, you must know that it consists of three stages: the receipt of fixed assets in the company, the period of their operation and the disposal of equipment or other units of the operating system.  It is worth noting that the sources of receipt of certain objects in the organization can vary significantly.  It can go: </p><ul><li>  About the purchase, which, as a rule, is accompanied by the signing of the acceptance certificate of the OS. </li><li>  On rent, in other words, the use of equipment without obtaining ownership of it. </li><li>  On the gratuitous transfer in accordance with a gift agreement or as a donation. </li><li>  About OS leasing. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="myktis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="4 signs of fixed assets" class="if uuid-3110006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3110006.jpg"></div><p>  One way or another, the primary documentation for the accounting of operating systems, which are special unified forms, is drawn up on the equipment.  The final stage of the receipt of the OS is their commissioning.  This operation is mandatory confirmed through an act that is signed by the commission created including for this purpose.  The procedure for the receipt of the object ends precisely with its assessment, including: </p><ul><li>  The price of the property. </li><li>  Traffic. </li><li>  Fare. </li><li>  Cost of commissioning. </li></ul><p>  After commissioning, the equipment is put on balance.  To do this, a special inventory card (OS-6) is started on the object.  So, each of the pieces of equipment is accepted for tax and accounting.  In the process of operation, fixed assets often undergo various kinds of changes.  As a rule, they are expressed in: </p><ul><li>  Revaluation is usually in the direction of increasing the cost of the OS, which is associated with their modernization or re-equipment. </li><li>  Depreciation of the OS and, accordingly, in their depreciation. </li><li>  The decrease in value, which is associated with a change in market conditions. </li><li>  Preservation, which is possible during the decommissioning of the OS for a long time. </li><li>  Audit objects that are needed to verify the effectiveness of their application. </li><li>  An analysis of their key indicators, including the update rate or the shelf life of the OS. </li><li>  Inventories, as a rule, with the inclusion of changes identified in the state of the object in a special inventory card. </li></ul><h2>  Depreciation of OS </h2><p>  So, we examined the defining features of fixed assets, their classification and the life cycle.  Next, it is advisable to consider the issue of depreciation.  The initial cost of equipment during its operation is somehow reduced and transferred to the cost of the main product of the company.  This process is called depreciation.  There are two methods for calculating it: </p><ul><li>  Linear: uniform accrual over the entire service life. </li><li>  Method of reduced balance: depreciation is calculated on the residual value of the property complex at the beginning of the year. </li></ul><p>  The useful life is selected from the classifier, according to special groups, of which there are ten.  Let's consider them separately. </p><h2>  Classifier groups </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.theconstructionindex.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="economic characteristics of fixed assets" class="if uuid-3110010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3110010.jpg"></div><p>  We examined 4 signs of fixed assets and the issue of depreciation.  It is advisable to determine the classifier groups according to which the useful life is determined: </p><ul><li>  Construction and installation tools (both mechanized and manual), as well as pneumatic units - from one to two years. </li><li>  Computers, sports facilities, lifts - from two to three years. </li><li>  Copying equipment, mini-buses, wells - from three to five years. </li><li>  Buildings made of metal and plastic, large animals, trucks - from 5 to 7 years. </li><li>  Industrial sites, cars, gas turbines - from 7 to 10 years. </li><li>  Gas pipelines, ships - from 10 to 15 years. </li><li>  Buildings are wooden, frame, panel;  perennial plantings, transport networks - from 15 to 20 years. </li><li>  Safes, river vessels, railways - from 20 to 25 years. </li><li>  Moorings, wagons, vegetable stores - from 25 to 30 years. </li><li>  Reinforced concrete buildings, forest stands, cruise ships - more than 30 years. </li></ul><h2>  Retirement </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pexels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="defining characteristic of fixed assets" class="if uuid-3110011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3110011.jpg"></div><p>  As it turned out, the last step in the life of an OS in an organization is retirement.  Options are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Implementation. </li><li>  Write-off, often partial, with its documentary registration without fail. </li><li>  Elimination in case of impossibility of further use. </li><li>  Transfer, including gratuitous. </li><li>  Exchange. </li><li>  Accounting and tax accounting. </li></ul><h2>  Maintaining and accounting objectives </h2><p>  Among the goals of accounting and tax accounting, the following should be noted: </p><ul><li>  The formation and subsequent determination of costs that are associated with the receipt and operation of fixed assets, in fact. </li><li>  Correct and timely execution of documentation accompanying the receipt and movement of equipment in the company. </li><li>  Monitoring the safety of pieces of equipment throughout their life. </li><li>  Analysis of the effectiveness of their use. </li></ul><p>  Tax accounting has a difference from accounting, which is the property price limit: </p><ul><li>  In tax accounting - 100,000 rubles. </li><li>  In accounting - 40,000 rubles. </li></ul><p>  Maintaining this type of accounting is relevant both in budget and in commercial structures.  Only the mechanism for acquiring an object is different.  So, it is mandatory for state employees to coordinate purchases with representatives of higher authorities, as well as monetary allocations for solving planned tasks from budget funds. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the concept, definition, as well as signs of fixed assets.  In addition, they touched on the issue of their regulatory regulation and classification.  We analyzed the categories of introduction, operation and disposal of fixed assets, and also identified the main signs of working capital. </p><p>  It is worth noting that today 1C: Accounting managed to automate all accounting operations, which includes accounting for fixed assets.  Their cycle of motion is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Receipt - acceptance for accounting - depreciation - subsequent deregistration. </li></ul><p>  All equipment receipts in any case are reflected in the organization‚Äôs accounts: </p><ul><li>  01 - data at the time of commissioning (on sub-accounts corresponding to their type). </li><li>  10 - data regarding the presence of the operating system and their movement are entered into the subaccount. </li></ul><p>  In postings, it looks like this: </p><ul><li>  Dt08 / Kt60 - acquisition of fixed assets. </li><li>  Dt08 / Kt75.1 is another source of OS revenue. </li><li>  Dt01 / Kt08 - putting fixed assets into operation and putting them on the balance sheet of the organization. </li></ul><p>  So, it is important to remember: among the signs of the OS there are six most important: </p><ul><li>  the cost of more than forty thousand rubles; </li><li>  a period of use exceeding twelve months; </li><li>  whether the organization has rights to an item of fixed assets (state registration); </li><li>  the purpose of use is considered the commercial activity of the structure; </li><li>  fixed assets entail economic benefits in future periods; </li><li>  the object is not considered a product (in other words, it is not intended for resale). </li></ul><p>  Fixed assets and fixed assets - this is actually one and the same concept.  To correctly identify the group of fixed assets, it is advisable to use the All-Russian Classifier of Fixed Assets (OKOF).  For tax and accounting purposes, the Classification of Fixed Assets, which are included in depreciation groups, approved.  PP of the Russian Federation of 01. 01. 2002 G. No. 1 (as amended on 10.12.2010).  You should be aware that assets are subject to depreciation.  This is necessarily reflected in the accounting in accordance with the standards of depreciation for each object. </p>
