After all, the city of Side is considered one of the largest centers of antiquity in the country. </p><p>  To begin with, you will probably be offered to visit the large Museum of Ancient Art, which contains a huge collection of ancient relics, including many exhibits of the Hellenistic period.  In the southern part of the city, almost on the seashore, two sights are located at once - these are the remains of ancient temples dedicated to Artemis, the goddess of the hunt and the moon, and her brother Apollo, which symbolized the sun.  Even the ruins of these once powerful sanctuaries are a spectacular sight, especially in night-time lighting. </p><p>  Another ancient monument is the Great monumental fountain Nymphaeum, which was allegedly erected in the second century of our era.  Of course, being in the city, it is worth visiting one more interesting place - the Port Bathhouse, which was built in the third century and today is turned into a museum. </p><h2>  How much does the Laphetos Beach Resort (Side) cost? </h2><p>  Naturally, the cost of living is an extremely important issue for any traveler.  That is why the Laphetos Beach Resort hotel is becoming so popular today.  Reviews of tourists indicate that the ratio of price and quality is suitable here.  Naturally, the cost depends on the room you choose, the period of rest and, of course, the price policy of the travel agency.  On average, a day at the hotel will cost about 2700 - 4000 rubles, which, you see, is not bad for a five-star hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel Laphetos Beach Resort (Side): reviews of Russian tourists </h2><p>  Until recently, most of the residents of Turkey stayed at this hotel complex.  But today, the number of Russian tourists is constantly increasing, as our compatriots also appreciated the comfort of the Laphetos Beach Resort.  The reviews confirm that you can really have a great time here. </p><p>  To begin with, it is worth noting that the rooms here are really spacious, and the window offers a beautiful view.  In addition, all the equipment is in good working order, and the rooms themselves are cleaned every day, so you are unlikely to have to complain about dirt and mess.  Separately, it is worth mentioning the nutrition, which is also at a decent level.  The menu is really varied, every day dishes of meat and fish, delicious desserts and ice cream, which the children like so much and, of course, fresh pastries and fruits, are served at the table.  By the way, cooks cook something from traditional Turkish cuisine every day.  <span>A la carte</span> restaurants also offer excellent menus <span>,</span> but they only open if there are enough visitors. </p><p>  Parents traveling with children are also satisfied, because their children have a great time in the company of fun animators who work with them constantly.  The undoubted advantage of the Laphetos Beach Resort Spa is its proximity to the beach.  By the way, it is covered with pebbles here, so it is better to bring along suitable beach shoes for walking along the coast. </p><p>  And, of course, do not forget about the work of the team of animators who perfectly cope with their main task - to entertain and amuse hotel guests.  Here you will find live music, comedy shows, oriental dances, shows and other, no less interesting events.  Hotel Laphetos Beach Resort 5 * is a great place for both family and youth recreation, and even for business trips. </p>
