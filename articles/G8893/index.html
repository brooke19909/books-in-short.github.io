Photos and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Uglich reservoir is unique in its own way.  One of the longest on the Volga, one of the most fishy, ​​one of the most beautiful.  Many residents of nearby cities and towns come here to relax every weekend.  Catch fish, admire the fabulous scenery, breathe clean air, in short, recharge your batteries for the entire working week.  On the Uglich Reservoir, it is wonderful to spend not only Saturday-Sunday, but also the whole vacation, since there are enough recreation centers here.  Let us take a walk along the shores of this natural and man-made miracle and see how you can spend time here. </p><h2>  A few words about the "birth" of the reservoir </h2><p>  The Uglich reservoir began to be designed before the war in connection with the construction of the eponymous hydroelectric station.  The design water mark of the Volga reached in 1943.  At the same time, they forever hid more than a hundred settlements, about a dozen historical monuments, and unfinished archaeological excavations.  This fact is undoubtedly interesting for scuba diving enthusiasts, treasure hunters and adventurers associated with them.  Despite the <span>inconvenience, the</span> created reservoir became a gift of fate for this region of the Volga region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Uglich Reservoir" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/878879.jpg" width="459"></div>  On the Uglich reservoir, there are ancient Uglich, Kimry, Kalyazin, whose inhabitants enjoy all its benefits.  Thanks to the reservoir, navigation along this section of the Volga became possible all year round, and not only during floods, as before.  On its shores, modern tourist bases and pensions have grown, and fishing enterprises have been created.  The reservoir is the pride and favorite vacation spot of Russians.

A little lower than the village of Priluki it flows into the Tver region, passes many small and medium-sized villages, the cities of Kalyazin, Bely Gorodok, Kimry, and through locks and other <span>hydraulic structures</span> near the city of Dubna (Moscow region) passes into the Ivankovo ​​reservoir.  Thus, the Uglich Reservoir has the form of a strongly elongated (146 km) river channel.  Therefore, it is difficult to say unequivocally how many kilometers are to it.  So, from Moscow to the nearest city on the Uglich Reservoir - Kimry - 149 km.  From Tver to it is 101 km, from Yaroslavl the closest to Uglich is 113 km.  Between Uglich and Kimry - 137 km.  Kalyazin is located approximately in the middle (54 km from Uglich). </p>

    <h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  Get here by car, train and bus.  You can also take a trip on the boat.  The nearest airports are in Yaroslavl and Moscow, so it’s not very convenient to fly by plane.  Travel time, track number, names of the required railway stations depend on the final destination.  So, you can get to Uglich by electric trains from Yaroslavl.  From Moscow, the same route lies through the Savelovo station in Kimry (electric and some passenger trains stop) to Kalyazin, and then to Uglich. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Motorists intending to organize a holiday on the Uglich Reservoir should follow the P104 highway, which will lead from the capital of Russia to Kalyazin and Uglich via Sergiev Posad.  From Tver to Kalyazin there is a P86 highway.  If you get to rest in Sknyatino, where there is a hunting farm and a boat station, you can take the bus from the railway station in Kalyazin twice a day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing at the Uglich reservoir" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/878876.jpg" width="362"></div>

    <h2>  Geographic features </h2><p>  Locals call the Uglich Reservoir the Volga, because in any weather (except for thick fog), one can see the other from one of its banks.  The width of the reservoir at only some points is 5 km, and in many places it is much narrower.  But its length, equal to 146 km, is impressive.  The depths of the Uglich reservoir are different.  So, along the Volga-river channel, they are up to 25 meters, and in some bays they do not exceed one.  The average depth is 5-5.5 meters.  Other interesting numbers: </p><p>  - the area of ​​the mirror is 249 square meters.  km; </p><p>  - the total volume of water masses is approximately 1250 cubic meters.  km; </p><p>  - The water level can fluctuate within 7 meters. </p><p>  Several dozen rivers and rivulets carry their waters to the Uglich Reservoir.  The largest - Ursa Major, Nerl, Toad, Dubna, Volnushka, Kashinka, Puksha.  The banks of the reservoir are completely indented with various shapes and sizes by bays.  There are several islands on the Uglich reservoir.  The entire reservoir is conventionally divided into three parts.  The deepest, lower, is located at the dam of the Uglich hydroelectric station.  The upper part (if you look at the stream) originates from the dam of the <span>Ivankovo ​​reservoir</span> to Medveditsa, and the middle part - from this river to the village of Priluki. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  The nature of the coastal zone of the Uglich Reservoir is changing throughout.  So, to Kimr, the right bank is almost not inhabited.  There are no recreation facilities, but you can meet a wild boar or moose.  Opposite these deserted places on the left bank runs a highway.  Further to the White Town, the territory of both banks is unusually picturesque.  On the left (lower) meadows and flower meadows replaced by pine forests and deciduous groves, which makes the Uglich Reservoir especially beautiful.  Photos of tourists captured a corner of nature in the fall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="depths of the Uglich reservoir" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/878872.jpg" width="456"></div>  The right bank is more abrupt, steep, but you can also find comfortable beaches here.  Further, the “White Town” begins “possession” of birch groves, pine forests, low-lying swampy shores.

They are pleased to offer shelter and service to the huntsman any specialized base.  The Uglich Reservoir has many bays overgrown with reeds.  According to reviews, it is here that it is best to catch ducks that nest in such thickets with pleasure.  There is a lot of goose, which is hunted "in the summer."  The only drawback that vacationers note is that it is difficult to get there without a car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on the Uglich reservoir" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/878875.jpg" width="403"></div>

    <p>  Further from the coast, in pine and mixed forests, black grouse, capercaillie, and hazel grouse are mined.  Every year, at the beginning of December, a festival is held at the Breeze base among individual hunters and teams.  The themes of the festival are driven <span>hunting for moose,</span> wild boars, foxes, hares and birds. </p><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  Every year, up to 200 tons of different fish are caught by fishing farms in the Uglich Reservoir.  About the same amount of amateur fishermen generally catch.  Reviews say that before there were even more fish.  But now it’s a sin to complain.  According to eyewitnesses, there are many predatory fish in the pond: perch, pike, burbot, pike perch, asp, ruff, catfish, and bersh.  They prey on their peaceful brethren: bream, bleak, common carp, silver bream, tit, chub, ide, dace, roach, sabrefish, crucian carp, tench, gudgeon and others.  Together, and those and others - 30 species.  Fishing at the Uglich Reservoir is conducted year-round.  Given the huge length of the reservoir, as well as the fact that all types of fish are constantly moving in search of clean, rich in oxygen and feed water, you need to take an echo sounder and a navigator for fishing.  Dredgers work at the reservoir to maintain the design depth, digging large holes in the ground.  The first couple of years there you can find a lot of fodder fish and predatory.  Then the water in these pits is soaked and the fish are moved to new ones.  The navigator is needed to enter the coordinates of the fresh pits found there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Uglich Reservoir Resorts" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/878874.jpg" width="500"></div>

Many experts on the issue advise sailing over to the islands, which are rich in the Uglich Reservoir.  Camping there is especially romantic.  No one bothers, around - not a soul, know, admire nature and catch a fish. </p><p>  Other experienced take perches (weighing 2 kg or more) near the channels of the rivers flowing into the reservoir, and medium in size - in the lower part of the reservoir.  In the bays you can hunt perch all day.  Sudakov try to locate near fresh pits and in shallow waters near Kalyazin and the White Town.  Although there are fishermen catching this predator where the depth is about 12 meters.  Each has its own baits - vibro-tails, jigs, foam rubber, artificial flies.
