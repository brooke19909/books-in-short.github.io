  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History of Russia, 20 Century - The Main Event through the Eyes of Our Contemporaries</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How often recently our so-called ‚Äúhistorians‚Äù, ‚Äúacademics‚Äù of fictitious academies, ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù in various fields (most often, far from the real story) write books, make films and programs, start disputes, where they have amazing obsession , with foam at the mouth, tell us about how badly and incorrectly our ancestors lived.  It seems that the history of Russia of the 20th century for these ‚ÄúClio ministers‚Äù is nothing more than another PR campaign aimed only at getting money for their fantasies. </p><p>  However, it was the 20th century that was perhaps the most populated period for Russia.  The revolution of 1905, then the <span>October Revolution,</span> which brought about a cardinal turn of the entire <span>historical process.</span>  The monarch was replaced by the Soviets, power passed into the hands of ordinary people.  Today there is a loud debate on the topic of who was interested in making this revolution, whether it was needed, and what it brought more - good or bad. </p><p>  The attitude of contemporaries to the personality of the last Russian Tsar is ambiguous.  Historians were divided into two opposite camps.  On the one hand, our contemporaries blame him for the collapse of the monarchy and Russia.  It is Nicholas II who is accused of all sins: inability to master the situation in the state, in his inability to understand the spirit and needs of the times, to carry out those transformations in the country that could prevent the growth of tension.  That is, according to these common beliefs, we can conclude that at a difficult, critical moment in the history of our country, the throne was an incapacitated emperor, a man subject to reactionary influences, weak-willed, reflective. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another part of historians, on the contrary, admires the last monarch, extolling his qualities in excellent forms.  <span>Russian historians</span> A. Bokhanov and M. Gorinov examine all these issues in great detail in their book.  They give the most diverse opinions of researchers of all stripes. </p><p>  And of course, the most controversial person in the period of socialism, causing the greatest number of disputes and the most formidable cries from the newly-minted "academics", is the person of Joseph Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili (Stalin).  And indeed, the whole history of Russia, the 20th century, was built with the active participation of this person.  It was he who ‚Äúaccepted the country with a plow, left with a nuclear bomb‚Äù, it was he who ruled the longest of all rules in this historical period, it was under him and under his leadership that the Great Patriotic War was won. </p><p>  What this ruler wasn‚Äôt accused of: tens of millions of executed, genocide, loss of life due to <span>industrialization and collectivization, the</span> outbreak of war.  One of these myths, fiercely supported by opponents of Stalin, is the story that it was he who brought Adolf Hitler to power in Germany.  We will try to understand this question a little, because here not only the history of Russia, the twentieth century, but also the course of world history in general is involved. </p><p>  Let's start with a small question: ‚ÄúDo you know exactly what will happen in 10 years?‚Äù  Or the question can be formulated in a slightly different way: ‚ÄúWho can accurately predict how a person will behave after 5 years?‚Äù.  I have one hundred percent confidence that no participants in the Battle of Psychics, analysts of the best world institutions, will be able to give you an exact answer.  And only one person, in the entire centuries-old <span>history of mankind,</span> according to the statements of "historians", could do this - Joseph Stalin.  He, the great and powerful, was predicted the history of Russia, the 20th century. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It was he who, knowing for sure that in the 39-40s of the 20th century, Adolf Hitler would unleash a world war, arrange the genocide of the Slavs and Jews, lead the army to the Soviet Union, and allowed (well or not prevented) to come to power in Germany in 1933.  Do you believe in such magic?  Perhaps, at this point, one could stop in debunking the myth of the mystical insight of the Leader of the Peoples.  But you can add a few facts, though the history of Russia, the 20th century, will remain a little aloof, and only a small page from the history of Germany in the 20th century will be revealed. </p><p>  The main thesis in defense of their truth, modern "historians" put forward the postulate that if Stalin allowed the Communist Party of Germany to vote together with the <span>Social Democratic</span> Party of Germany, they would have won more than 50% of the vote and Hitler would not have come to power. </p><p>  At the same time, our ‚Äúacademics‚Äù are not interested in the opinions of the Germans themselves, and after all, in the 1932 elections, the SPD did not even attempt to nominate their candidate!  Why?  Why did this party also not enter into an alliance with the KKE, which according to various sources had from 13 to 15% of the vote?  On the contrary, she even supported the only person who could compete with Hitler - Hindenburg, allowing him to gain 53% of the vote.  It was President Hindenburg, even before the March parliamentary elections in January 1933, that allowed Hitler to form a government and become the head of the German national front.  Thanks to this, in the <span>1933</span> elections <span>, the</span> NSDAP (led by Hitler) won 44% of the vote, the KKE - 12.3%, the SPD - 18.3%.  Anyone familiar with arithmetic and unfamiliar with the stories of our ‚Äúhistorians‚Äù will say that 31 is less than 44. </p><p>  You cannot turn back the time.  You can‚Äôt change the past.  But also the history of Russia, the 20th century, should not be misinterpreted by some figures today only in order to make a name for themselves on it. </p>
