    <h2>  Pros of 5 Star Resorts in Lara (Turkey) </h2><p>  Most likely, you have already heard about this popular beach town.  If not, we will be happy to help you <span>catch up.</span>  Lara, one of the most beautiful areas of Antalya, is truly a paradise for a vacation.  Having come here for the first time, no one can hold back a sigh of admiration at the sight of high, inaccessible cliffs, the azure surface of the Mediterranean Sea and greenery, framing this whole picturesque picture.  By the way, Lara is also known as ‚ÄúAltinkum‚Äù, which is translated into Russian as ‚Äúgolden sand‚Äù.  In fairness, let‚Äôs say that the town was named so for good reason, because the finely sandy coast casting gold made it famous all over the world. </p><p>  In Lara, everyone can find something to their liking.  Here you will find nightly dancing discos in various clubs, and performances by famous artists from different countries, and, of course, a variety of water sports, including diving, surfing, kayaking and pair water skiing, as well as much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Are there any downsides to 5 star hotels in Lara (Turkey)? </h2><p>  We‚Äôll probably lie if we say that this resort has no drawbacks.  Unless, of course, a somewhat remote location can be considered a minus.  Indeed, for all its splendor, Lara remains only a small beach town, and some of this fact can add inconvenience.  Especially for those who can not imagine a holiday at the resort without shopping.  But this will not be a problem if you are ready to limit yourself to local shops or, best of all, spend forty minutes on the road to the center of Antalya.  And there will certainly be inveterate shopaholics where to roam.  And not just for shopaholics! </p>

    <h2>  What to see in Antalya? </h2><p>  Everyone who booked a hotel with 5 stars in Lara (Turkey) must visit the main attractions of Antalya, for example, the Hƒ±dƒ±rƒ±lƒ±k Tower, which has preserved the memory of the architecture of the Roman Empire, the ruins of the ancient city of Aspendos and the Gate of Hadrian - a magnificent two-story building, well preserved to our time. </p><p>  It is also definitely worth taking the time to sit on a warm evening in one of the Turkish cuisine restaurants.  Have a hearty dinner with such delicious meat dishes as adana-kebab (popular in the country rolls with spicy minced meat) or koeft (the same meatballs, but with the addition of special spices that make them unique in their kind), and for dessert try baklava and rakhat- Turkish delight - sweets, popular all over the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Who should choose an all inclusive system for relaxation? </h2><p>  Traveling for the first time and wondering if you need to use the all-inclusive system at a 5 star hotel in Lara (Turkey)?  How is it different from other systems and is it suitable for you personally?  Let's first understand what it is.  The standard set of free <span>all inclusive</span> services usually includes: </p><ul><li>  accommodation in a paid room; </li><li>  varied nutrition throughout the day; </li><li>  drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic); </li><li>  number of additional services. </li></ul><p>  Of course, there is no exact list of services applicable to all 5-star hotels in Turkey in Lara, because each institution is individual and varies from hotel to hotel, depending on class, rating and traditions. </p><p>  One of the main advantages of all inclusive is convenience.  If you want to have fun in full, without looking into your wallet every five minutes and without bothering with counting the remaining money, then the all-inclusive system will cost you less. </p><h2>  Who should not choose an all inclusive system? </h2><p>  But there are times when all inclusive is a waste of money.  For example, you may not need lunches and dinners in a hotel restaurant if there are many cafes and restaurants with lower prices nearby your complex, or if you intend to devote most of your vacation to excursions outside the hotel. </p><p>  So before deciding whether to pay for "all inclusive" or not, carefully plan your vacation and find out from the tour operator what exactly the system of free services includes.  Then you can decide and choose the most profitable option. </p>
