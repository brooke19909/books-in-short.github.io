    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  There is a wonderful resort village on the island of Crete, known as Kokkini Hani.  It stretched along the sea for 15 kilometers east of Heraklion.  Which, incidentally, can be reached by bus number 1, which leaves from the stop (it is located next to the hotel) every 15 minutes starting from six in the morning and up to one in the morning.  By the way, in the same place, in Heraklion, is the nearest international airport.  And you can take a taxi, but it will cost about 20-25 euros. </p><p>  All the most famous sights also need to go.  But they are located at a distance of 8-10 kilometers from the hotel.  These include the Knossos Palace, the Heraklion City Garden, the port, the Municipal Art Gallery, the Museum of the History of Crete, the Kules Sea Fortress, the Venetian walls and many other interesting places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most important thing is that directly Arina Sand Resort 4 * hotel is located among picturesque tropical vegetation, at arm's length from the sea.  This is the main highlight of the hotel. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Being in Arina Sand Resort 4 *, you can brighten up your leisure time in different ways.

Naturally, the hotel has free Wi-Fi and private parking (a place is provided to guests upon arrival, no need to book in advance). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is a left-luggage office, a photocopy and fax machine, car rental, currency exchange and laundry facilities.  In addition, there is a large conference room and a 24-hour reception, which you can contact to resolve any issues. </p><p>  Guests can also order room service and babysitting services.

But as people who have been here assure, workers still speak Russian quite well.  Such a nice nuance cannot but rejoice.  Just recently, the influx of tourists from Russia has greatly increased, so many began to study the Russian language. </p>

    <h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  Maximum occupancy for this room is two adults and one child (under the age of twelve).  The standard price for a weekly stay in such apartments with the all-inclusive service is approximately 67 thousand rubles.  But the fact is that prices very often vary.  In autumn and winter, for example, here the rooms are much cheaper than in summer.  You can also save by filling out a reservation request long before the trip.  Also, much depends on the tour operator and on whether the hotel provides discounts.  And their hotel offers quite often.  Sometimes you can pay for a room 70 percent less than the basic cost!  In this case, this will be not 67,000, but about 22,000 rubles.  Significant savings.  So it‚Äôs worth taking all of the above into account. </p><h2>  Apartment for three </h2><p>  In Arina Sand Resort 4 * (Greece) there are still rooms that can accommodate three adults.  Their area is 30 square meters.  The apartment has one double bed and a sofa.  Of the features - a panoramic view of the sea.  Otherwise, the conditions are the same as those of the above number. </p><p>  If you believe the stated price, then a week in these apartments for three people will cost about 200,000 rubles.  However, for these numbers there are almost always discounts of 70-85 percent.  So many manage to book these same apartments for 30,000 rubles.  It turns out only 10 t.  per person per week.  The difference, to put it mildly, is palpable. </p>

    <h2>  Guests staying at the hotel </h2><p>  This is the last thing to talk about.  Many people came to Arina Sand Resort 4 * <span>(Crete).</span>  They leave a variety of <span>reviews</span> .  But fresh comments are encouraging.  The reviews left by tourists who rested here in 2015-2016, contain only the positive characteristics of the hotel. </p><p>  Guests say that even if it didn‚Äôt work out to fly on a flight that would arrive in the afternoon, and the hotel managed to be much earlier than the arrival, it's okay.  If there are free apartments ready for living, then the guests will draw up immediately.  But even in the absence of such an opportunity, guests will not be bored.  They will be able to leave their stuff in a locker room and go for breakfast, and then change clothes and go to the beach.  Or lie down by the pool.  In general, guests have the right to use all the services of the hotel while they are preparing an apartment. </p><p>  The staff is nice.  Russian-speaking receptionists at the reception are always ready to help with advice.  Maids clean every day, also replacing linen and towels with clean ones. </p><p>  Animation at the hotel.  Entertaining staff arranges interesting and varied shows.  Every night is something new.  Who does not want to participate, can simply be an outside observer, no one will be imposed, which is also pleasing.  By the way, the soundproofing in the rooms is excellent, so in the case of interfering sounds coming from the street, you can just close the balcony door.  If it's hot, there is a powerful air conditioner that can easily fix the situation. </p><p>  Some complaints are caused by the beach.  It is forbidden to take sun loungers there in the evening - towels thrown from above are taken away by a hotel employee.  But in principle, this is only a small nuance, since the beach is sandy.  And you can just lay out a few towels and sit on them. </p><p>  If we draw conclusions, we can say: this is a good hotel, suitable for a comfortable stay.  The hotel has excellent rooms, excellent restaurants and a decent level of service.  What else do tourists need on vacation? </p>
