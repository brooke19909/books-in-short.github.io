    <p>  Defining what hypnosis is is quite difficult.  There is a great many explanations for this phenomenon.  However, due to the fact that the mechanism of this effect on the human body is still not fully defined, each description is directly dependent on an individual understanding of this condition.  The definition of hypnosis can be this: this is a specific state of <span>consciousness of a person</span> in which various thoughts inspired by him produce a much greater effect than in a normal situation.  Under the influence of hypnotic powers, attention is focused within very narrow boundaries.  But the level of susceptibility is high.  In this regard, inspired thoughts are sent directly to the realm of the subconscious.  This process can cause emotional and psychological, as well as physical and chemical changes in the state.  Studies that have been conducted using hypnosis have proven the ability to control those functions of the human body that do not respond to consciousness. </p><p>  However, it is not always possible to meet a person who possesses hypnotic abilities.  And not everyone can be trusted.  In this situation, you can use self-hypnosis.  This process is similar to meditation.  In both cases, similar principles are used.  However, self-hypnosis, the technique of which is different from meditation, is mainly used for medicinal purposes.  It has beneficial effects on both the spiritual and physical areas of human life.  Compared to meditation, self-hypnosis is much deeper. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to begin the process of managing the subconscious, you need to focus on your thoughts in a quiet, calm environment.  Self-hypnosis, the technique of which involves solitude, is impossible in crowded places.  Another indispensable condition when immersing in yourself is properly set breathing.  Inhalation should be through the nose, and exhalation through the mouth.  The breath itself should be deep and slow.  It is it that will allow you to relax and get as close as possible to entering a trance state.  Self-hypnosis, the technique of which involves the use of fantasy, should give rise to thoughts about filling the body with energy of enormous power, which spreads throughout the body.  During the exhalation process with the ‚Äúsix‚Äù score, it is important to imagine that fatigue and sadness, as well as stress and anxiety accumulated over a long period, leave the body.  They are replaced by the joy and harmony of life. </p><p>  The next step in the technique of self-hypnosis is <span>suggestion.</span>  <span>This</span> process will enhance the relaxation effect.  The body will be completely in your power after repeating installation phrases indicating successful achievement of the result.  The relaxation process will be fully completed if: </p><ul><li>  no muscle tension; </li><li>  the heartbeat process slows down; </li><li>  breathing becomes measured and deep. </li></ul><p>  Self-hypnosis, the technique of which involves setting a goal, should serve to create mental comfort or to raise one‚Äôs mood, get rid of ailments or establish mutual understanding with people around.  Why is immersion in the depths of consciousness, a person must determine in advance. </p><p>  The most important and crucial stage of self-hypnosis is entering into a trance state.  At this stage of immersion, a change in attitudes takes place, with the help of which the surrounding world is perceived. </p><p>  In practice, you can use various techniques for self-hypnosis.  The most commonly used are: </p><ul><li>  eye rotation; </li><li>  visualization; </li><li>  equipment called the "safe place". </li></ul><p>  The final stage of self-hypnosis is the exit from a trance state.  This process is carried out by means of consciousness or upon awakening.  With either of the two options, a person feels cheerfulness and lack of fatigue, both spiritual and physical. </p>
