This is one of the most popular tourist destinations. </p><p>  The Czech Republic has always bordered on strong and warlike states since ancient times, therefore, to protect themselves from the invasion of neighbors, they were forced to erect various structures in the form of fortresses and castles.  The first of them began to appear in the XIII century, and the construction of defense facilities reached their peak in the middle of the XIV century. </p><p>  Nowadays in the Czech Republic there are more than 2000 castles left, connected by their history with the rich aristocratic families of those times.  The descendants of many of them still live in their family estates.  Pernštejn Castle is one of the most famous in the <span>Czech Republic.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="traveltoczechrepublic.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="castle in the forest" class="if uuid-2992474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2992474.jpg"></div><h2>  About sights </h2><p>  The castle stands on one of the rocky hills above the Svratka River in South Moravia.  It is surrounded by virgin <span>impassable forests.</span>  This is a powerful, fairly well-preserved fortification, located 40 kilometers from the city of Brno.  Pernstein Castle is built in the style of the Gothic Renaissance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fortress complex includes a large tower, where there are two halls: the knight’s and the “conspirators”.  The complex also has a tower with the funny name “Cheesecake”, a triangle-shaped palace with a small chapel, as well as a courtyard. </p><p>  Four well-fortified gates lead outward from the castle; it is surrounded on all sides by a deep moat.  Of the entire complex, the “Horned” tower is particularly impressive, which can only be reached through the narrow passage from the central building at the top floor level.  It is from her side that the photos of Pernstein Castle are the most recognizable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.radio.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="horned tower" class="if uuid-2992476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2992476.jpg"></div><h2>  From the history </h2><p>  Pernštejn castle belonged to the old Czech family of Pernštejnov.  This Gothic-style building was built over seven centuries ago.  It was first mentioned in writing in 1285. </p><p>  Like all fortification-type buildings of that time, it was rebuilt more than once, and by the beginning of the 15th century additional towers were erected in the fortress, bastions and walls were strengthened.  Since then, enemies have never been able to conquer Pernstein Castle.  In the Czech Republic in the Middle Ages, it was considered among other objects to be one of the most impregnable, since its defense was thought out to the last detail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Castle owners </h2><p>  The name of the Pernshtein clan comes from the original name of the building itself, which was called Barenstein, which in German means “bear stone”.  The history of this ancient aristocratic family can be traced back to the 13th century, when one of the branches of the Medlov in South Moravia built for itself Pernstein Castle, which became their ancestral nest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tribal coat of arms" class="if uuid-2992499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2992499.jpg"></div><p>  They owned it until 1596.  Under the owner Jan IV the Rich, work was done in the castle to give it the features of the Renaissance.  And the next owner, who inherited the family of Pernshteyn’s nests, was forced to sell it because of huge accumulated debts. </p><p>  Subsequently, the castle changed its owners several times.  In 1818, he became the property of the wealthy aristocratic Mitrovsky family, who owned it until 1945.  This castle is also famous for the fact that here in 1809 the Czech composer and conductor Anton-Emil Titl was born. </p><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Pernstein Castle, according to travelers, the torture chamber attracts the greatest attention of all visitors.  It is equipped with all the necessary tools of the time for the inquiry.  The story is silent about whether they were ever used, but their very appearance makes anyone who sees them shudder, even "seasoned" tourists visiting this sinister room during a tour of the castle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The first thing that impresses all visitors to the structure is the residential view of all its premises, as if its owners had gone away for a while about their business and should be back soon.  Fireplaces are stacked in fireplaces, in all vases there are always fresh flowers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.melindabrasher.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="castle halls" class="if uuid-2992516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2992516.jpg"></div><p>  The gloomy appearance of the castle does not correspond at all to its interior decoration.  It is dominated by wealth and luxury.  On the walls are paintings of famous artists of those eras, their frames are covered with gold.  All decorative stucco molding is painted with gilding. </p><p>  Another attraction here can rightfully be attributed to a small chapel, whose altar is also covered with gilding, and the walls abound with biblical plots and figures of angels. </p><h2>  Castle legends </h2><p>  It is known that many legends are associated with each medieval castle.  Pernshtein is no exception, and one of the most famous is the story of the wild bison and how the genus of the hosts came about. </p><p>  Once a huge bison lived in the forest surrounding the building.  He was so terrible and fierce that everyone who lived in the district was afraid of him.  No one dared to go into the forest for firewood, for berries and mushrooms.  And without it in those days it was impossible to live. </p><p>  And only a coal miner named Venava was not afraid and decided to kill the beast.  How he did this, information about this has not reached our days, but it is known that he succeeded.  The king, who ruled in those days, out of gratitude for the perfect feat gave him the land on which the castle was built.  According to legend, the Pernshtein clan originates from a brave coal miner. </p><p>  There is another, no less popular, judging by the reviews, story related to this place.  This is the legend of the mighty yew that grows near the castle in the forest.  According to the legends, this tree grew from the staff of Methodius, who in these places taught the population to read and write.  Legend has it that the castle will stand as long as the yew grows. </p><p>  To this day, impregnable Pernstein stands, a mighty yew continues to grow in the forest ... </p><div class="photo" data-original="steemit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="castle and yew" class="if uuid-2992523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2992523.jpg"></div><p>  The next legend is most liked by children - this is the legend of the White Lady, who was called Elishka.  They say that her ghost is still wandering around the castle, finding no peace. </p><p>  The legend tells of a girl from a peasant family who was hired by a maid.  But instead of working diligently and fulfilling her duties, she only did the whole day that she admired herself in the numerous mirrors of the castle.  It got to the point that she stopped going to church masses, so the local priest decided to admonish her. </p><p>  But Elishka did not listen to him, but only laughed.  In the hearts of the priest cursed her and left, and the girl soon died.  Since then, all local residents believe that if a woman sees her reflection in the mirror of the castle, then she can lose her beauty, as the White Lady will take her. </p><h2>  Moravian Kras </h2><p>  Speaking about the sights of the Czech Republic, one cannot but mention one of the most beautiful zones with karst caves in Europe - <span>Moravian Beauty.</span>  And Pernstein Castle is located in this protected area.  There are more than 1,110 caves in the karst region, although only four of them are open to tourists today. </p><p>  The word karst is translated as soluble.  That is, for the appearance of such a miracle of nature, it is necessary that the rocks that make up the massif succumb to moisture.  Therefore, the landscape of this region differs from similar ones in its many labyrinths, underground rivers and lakes, as well as deep canyons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.guidingprague.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moravian beauty" class="if uuid-2992535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2992535.jpg"></div><p>  The most beautiful cave of this protected area is Punkva.  There is the famous abyss of Matsokh.  Its depth is about 140 meters.  In the cave, a river with the same name flows deep underground.  Tourists are invited to take a walk through the underground labyrinths, which, judging by their reviews, leave an indelible impression on their lives. </p><h2>  Pernstein Castle in the cinema </h2><p>  Taking a tour of the castle, you will surely hear that it has been used more than once as a film set for films with fairy-tale or medieval plots. </p><p>  The atmosphere of this place, full of secrets, has always attracted scriptwriters and directors.  Many films were shot here by Czech film studios.  The famous fairy tale of the Soviet director Boris Ritsarev “The Princess and the Pea” was created here. </p><p>  It is impossible not to mention that the castle also shot scenes from such films as The Phantom of the Night, Especially Dangerous, Luther, and others. </p><h2>  Where to stay near the castle </h2><p>  It is not always possible to see all the attractions that offer tourists excursion programs in one day.  And how I want to have a good rest, so that with fresh strength you can continue to get acquainted with this wonderful country.  But this problem is easily solved, travelers write about this in reviews of Pernstein Castle.  There are several convenient and affordable hotels near the castle. </p><p>  In the village of Nedec there is a country house Ubytování na náměstí, where you can stay for a vacation in fairly cheap rooms.  It offers Wi-Fi, a TV, an equipped kitchen with stove and fridge.  This hotel has the best value for money. </p><p>  Just three kilometers from Pernstein Castle, near the Svratka River itself, is the Zubr guest house.  Here, guests can comfortably stay in comfortable and well-equipped rooms, where they are offered free Wi-Fi, cable TV, a bathroom with a shower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Bison" class="if uuid-2992552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2992552.jpg"></div><p>  The price includes daily breakfast.  The hotel has an outdoor pool and a restaurant where you can enjoy traditional Czech dishes. </p><h2>  How to get to the castle </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="49.45106000000001" data-lng="16.318122000000017" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/5/1/9/12519.png"></div><p>  Naturally, if you are not an organized traveler with a ticket from a travel agency, you will be primarily interested in the question of how to get to Pernstein Castle.  The easiest way to do this is by rail.  By train you need to get to the city of Nedvědici (Nedvedichi), from where you need to go only 2 kilometers along the trail with detailed signs.  The station Nedvědici is equally convenient to get from both Prague and Brno. </p><p>  You can get into the castle, also using public transport, making several transfers.  Bus timetables are well connected.  And of course, by car. </p>
