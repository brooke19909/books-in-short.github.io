Booking characterizes it as a great place on Karon, where you can spend a very good vacation.  And although it takes about ten to fifteen minutes to get to the famous beach from the hotel, many tourists prefer it to untwisted hotels, which are almost on the shore (more precisely, across the road) from the sea.  In this article, we will comprehensively examine the pros and cons of the "Tuan My Friend House Resort 3 *".  We gathered information not only on the Buking website, but mainly from the reviews of those tourists who had already had time to relax there.  We must immediately inform you that recently the hotel changed its name.  Now it is called Asena Karon Resort.  But three stars remained on the facade, and the recent renovation did not affect the price of the rooms.  According to reviews, this is a budget hotel for those who do not like hustle and bustle, and appreciate a family friendly atmosphere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tuana My Friend House Resort 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1514238.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  What is the address of the hotel Tuana My Friend House Resort 3 *?  Phuket, Karon, Patak Road, 353. This tells little to the average tourist.  Reviews will help us determine the location.  The famous Karon Beach is about a kilometer away.  To the even more famous coast of Kata Noi - two.  But not far away is the entire infrastructure of the village of Karon: its temple, a statue of the Big Buddha, a night market, a Starbucks cafe.  Reviews warn that the hotel does not provide a free shuttle service to the beach.  But for most tourists this was not a problem.  After all, you can rent a motorbike in Phuket at every step.  Of course, on foot, and even with a stroller and a small child, the path to the beach will be hard.  From the international airport of Phuket to the hotel to go for about half an hour.  The area in which the hotel is located is quite quiet.  But Thai exoticism is present.  And if you do not want your room overlooking a tightly wired street, reserve a room in the bungalow or in the building, but the Garden View. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tuana My Friend House Resort 3 Phuket" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1514244.jpg" width="600"></div>

The hotel has two three- and five-story buildings, one Pool access building and four two-level villas.  Reviews warn that upon arrival at the hotel you need to have a sufficient amount of local currency.  For a room (regardless of the period of residence) a deposit of two thousand butts is charged.  An exchange office nearby has too low an exchange rate, so tourists are advised to call in a bank along the way.  The hotel has parking, which is very important in Phuket, and even in a hotel located a kilometer from the beach.  Here you can safely leave a rented motorcycle.  The hotel has its own restaurant.  Of course, a three star hotel should have a pool.  And he is, and some of the rooms open to him direct and individual access. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tuana My Friend House Resort 3 Phuket" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1514242.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where guests are accommodated </h2><p>  In total, the former Tuana My Friend House Resort 3 * hotel (now Asena Karon Resort) has fifty-three guest rooms.  The cheapest accommodation option is the Superior category.  But you have to be careful with them.  There are rooms located in the building, which faces the street.  It is better to book a Superior with a view of the pool and garden.  A feature of such rooms is that the entire wall is a continuous window.  It seems like living right in the garden.  But it is worth pushing the curtains - and you are guaranteed privacy.  By the way, the windows of the rooms facing the street absorb noise well.  Above is the Deluxe category.  These rooms are interesting in that you can dive directly into the pool from them.  Their bathrooms include a hairdryer and toiletries.  And for budget tourists who do not want to spend money on public catering in Phuket, there are villas.  They are two-level, and next to the bedroom and bathroom they have a small kitchenette. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Tuana My Friend House Resort 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1514241.jpg" width="600"></div>

Each room has a TV, air conditioning with individual remote control, a small refrigerator and a safe for storing valuables (the laptop does not fit there).  The beds are comfortable, the floor is tiled.  The TV shows even one Russian channel (NTN).  They clean the rooms normally, towels are changed every day.  With the same frequency put drinking water.  Tourists really liked the Wi-Fi at the Tuana My Friend House Resort 3 * hotel.  He is very fast, you can chat on Skype, and is completely free.  For large companies, the hotel has a villa consisting of three bedrooms and designed for six people.  Of course, bathrobes and slippers in a hotel in Thailand for three stars do not give, but the service provided in the rooms, the reviews were called sufficient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tuana My Friend House Resort 3 booking" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1514240.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The price of accommodation at the Tuana My Friend House Resort 3 * hotel includes breakfast.  They are of the same type.  That is, every morning the same list of dishes is offered.  This is a <span>continental breakfast:</span> coffee, bread, orange jam, juice, butter, vegetable and cheese-meat slices.  Interestingly, there are toasters in the breakfast room.  You can toast bread.  Breakfast is buffet style - take and eat as much as you want.  Enough time is allocated for such a meal - from seven to ten.  No need to get up <span>no light or dawn,</span> so as not to skip breakfast.  The hotel has a poolside bar.  Drinks and snacks there - for a fee.  Tourists recommend checking out the hotel restaurant at least once or twice.  The local chef has become proficient not only in making Thai dishes, but also in European, and even Russian.  Tourists liked fried rice and tom yum.  Having a bike, it will be easy to go to the Karon evening market, where you can eat very cheaply.  Near the hotel there is a grocery store. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tuana My Friend House Resort 3 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1514243.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and pools of the hotel Tuana My Friend House Resort 3 * </h2><p>  Phuket is famous for its two coasts - Karon and Kata Noi.  And both of these beaches are not far from the Asen Hotel.  They come here for this - crisp, like starch, underfoot snow-white sand, turquoise water, a rich world of coral reefs ... True, reviews warn that Karon is changing during the rainy season.  Strong winds, dangerous currents and huge waves make lifeguards often raise a red flag over the beach.  But instead of ordinary vacationers, Karon is filled with professional surfers.  And they also settle in the TuanMay Friend House Resort hotel, as this is a very budget accommodation with excellent service.  If you prefer a freshwater pond, there is a fairly spacious swimming pool with a children's section.  On one side is a sun terrace.  On the other hand, Pool Access rooms come right up to the pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tuana My Friend House Resort 3 pics" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1514239.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Services </h2><p>  The Tuana My Friend House Resort 3 * hotel (photos completely correspond to reality) has a very beautiful territory.  After chaotic traffic on the street, the hotel seems like a garden of paradise.  Wi-Fi is free throughout.  Parking is also intended for the free placement of cars and guests' bikes.  The hotel has a sauna and gym.  But their visit is paid.  The hotel has a 24-hour front desk and its staff speak English.  The hotel restaurant has highchairs for babies.  If necessary, you can hire a nanny or baby sitter.  Bicycle rental is available at the reception.  The hotel has a barbecue corner, where you can cook your own grill. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Tuana Friend House Resort 3 * hotel is located in such a way that almost all of its guests acquire motorbikes.  And since you already have transport, do not use it only for trips to the beach and to the evening market in Karon.  Reviews call for active travel in Phuket.  There is something to see on this largest island of Thailand.  It is worth at least once to go to Patong in the evening and plunge into its hectic nightlife.  In Phuket, as in Pattaya, there is also a transvestite show.  Of the one-day excursions, tourists recommend the Phang Nga Nature Reserve, with a Muslim village on stilts, mangroves and James Bond rock.  During such a trip, you can inexpensively buy real pearls.  It is better to get to the Phi Phi islands for a few days - the round trip is too long.  And of course, the usual entertainment in Thailand - shows of monkeys and elephants, a crocodile farm, temples and Chinatowns. </p><h2>  Tuana My Friend House Resort 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who have repeatedly traveled to the country and are familiar with Thai realities, the hotel pleased.  It is designed for active travelers who only spend the night and have breakfast at the hotel, and then go on excursions or to the beach.  There is no animation at the hotel, but there is a wonderful atmosphere of a quiet harbor, where it is so nice to relax after an eventful day.  Many tourists wrote that they would come back here if this opportunity presented itself.  In any case, they will recommend the Asen Karon Resort Hotel to their friends and acquaintances.  The hotel staff is Thai friendly, the rooms are spacious, the pool is clean.  What more could you want for that kind of money? </p>
