  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Affordable holidays in Spain</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you choose the most welcoming and warm of all European countries, then this, of course, will be Spain - a favorite vacation spot for families with children, honeymooners, history buffs and <span>beach</span> lovers <span>.</span>  Its gentle sun and the purest Mediterranean Sea with adjacent sandy beaches has become an excellent alternative to a vacation in Turkey and Egypt.  Each time you come here, you can rediscover Spain. </p><p>  In the spring, the honeymoon season begins, and the country turns for several weeks into the abode of bright and tender feelings of the newly made spouses.  They choose holidays <span>in Spain,</span> because here you can spend time at the sea and still visit various <span>architectural monuments</span> and attend purely Spanish events, for example, bullfighting.  In Madrid, you must visit the Gothic <span>Cathedral of Sagrada Familia,</span> built by the architect Antonio Gaudi in the 15th century.  In this city you can not get past its port, the Gothic quarter, the Del Prado Museum, the Palacio Real and the city square.  Although Madrid is filled with historically important objects, and it carries a huge centuries-old history, nevertheless, it is a developed city with its own infrastructure.  Since rest in Spain is still European, here in all hotels and public places European standards of service quality are observed. </p><p>  Connoisseurs of club life will prefer to settle on the <span>island of Ibiza.</span>  It is he who is considered the birthplace of all electronic musical culture.  What is played in the <span>clubs of Ibiza</span> is considered the highest quality music.  This island sets the benchmark for partying around the world.  There is a huge number of night clubs, hotels, the main emphasis is on young people and related entertainment.  Such a holiday in Spain will appeal to lovers to lie in the sun.  The island is located in the Mediterranean Sea and is rich in various types of beaches. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another important city in this sunny and hospitable country is Barcelona.  This is a big metropolis where, in spite of its development, the truly Spanish culture with its architectural monuments is carefully preserved.  While in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãyou should definitely visit La Rambla, as well as in the Park Guell and on the beach of Barceloneta.  The architecture of the city was greatly influenced by the work of Gaudi, who built many of the most beautiful streets in Spain. </p><p>  Unfortunately, vacation in Spain in all its splendor is not open to every traveler, because of the rather high prices for permits.  This is due to the standard of living, as well as the income of the Spaniards themselves.  Thanks to a favorable financial environment, developed tourist services, care for each guest of the country, the cost of trips will be affordable only for people with average incomes.  But what about the rest?  So forget about this country?  The answer is no! </p><p>  Last minute trips to Spain are suitable for this case, the cost of which can be several times lower than the usual vacation booking.  This is due to the fact that during the recruitment of a group of tourists to a certain destination, there are empty seats that ‚Äúburn out‚Äù if the agency does not sell them, at least for a minimal cost.  Such last-minute <span>tours to Spain</span> appear in the company's offers instantly and disappear with the same speed.  The main thing here is to have time to acquire.  Sometimes tour operators go on a trick and, under the guise of such tours, they sell completely ordinary trips at the usual price, artificially inflating its cost on time.  In this case, the tourist will definitely not get any benefit.  Last minute trips will be an excellent solution to the problem of holidays for easy-going people who cannot afford to pay the full cost of the trip, but do not want to give up their desire to see the world. </p>
