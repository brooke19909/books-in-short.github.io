    <p>  The city of Maloyaroslavets is located 122 kilometers from Moscow and 61 kilometers from Kaluga, geographically it belongs to the Kaluga region.  The first mentions in chronicles about this settlement date back to the beginning of the 15th century; presumably then it was a Vyatichi settlement.  Maloyaroslavets received the status of the city only in 1776, today its total area is about 18 square kilometers. </p><p>  About 28 thousand people live in the city, its number is gradually declining.  A settlement appeared thanks to Prince Vladimir Serpukhov, who named him in honor of one of his sons.  In October 1812, it was here that one of the greatest battles in the Russo-French War took place.  During the 17 hours of the battle, the settlement changed its owner 8 times, after the battle was over, there was practically nothing left of it.  In 2010, the city lost the status of a historical monument; in 2012, it entered a number of <span>cities of military glory.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Moscow </h2>

    <p>  The direction Moscow - Maloyaroslavets remains very popular, despite the fact that the second settlement is officially under the jurisdiction of the Kaluga region.  In 1485, it got its current name when it was annexed to the Principality of Moscow, before that it was called Yaroslavts.  Residents of the city daily go to Moscow to work and back, using trains, buses and personal transport. </p><p>  Moscow and Maloyaroslavets are quite closely connected, a small city very often acted as the defender of the capital and detained enemy troops.  That is why when visiting Moscow and its military monuments, tourists are advised to definitely visit a small village located 3 hours from the capital.  Please note that in Moscow and Maloyaroslavets there are a large number of other interesting places, and various military events are often held, for example, reconstruction of military battles of the XIX-XX centuries. </p><h2>  Moscow - Maloyaroslavets: how many km? </h2>

There are alternative options, for example, a few kilometers from Maloyaroslavets passes the federal highway M-3, leading to Ukraine, it is necessary to travel about 130 kilometers to Moscow.  Despite the greater mileage, drivers prefer to use the <span>federal highway</span> because of its increased comfort. </p><p>  If you travel by rail, then the distance here will be about 121 kilometers, you can overcome it both in the long-distance train and in ordinary trains.  There is a fairly large station in Maloyaroslavets, so some trains have a small stop there within 15 minutes.  For this reason, you can get to Moscow and back with great comfort. </p><h2>  We go by bus </h2><p>  There is no direct route Moscow - Maloyaroslavets, the only thing you can use is passing buses.  But there is a very serious drawback: they pass through Maloyaroslavets very rarely, only twice a day.  One bus leaves in the morning from the <span>Novoyasenevskaya</span> bus station <span>(Moscow)</span> and goes to Roslavl, it can be reached in two hours. </p><p>  The second bus connects the capital <span>bus station Shchelkovsky</span> and Roslavl, the trip on it to Maloyaroslavets will take about 4 hours, because it goes through Obninsk and makes a big detour.  This route leaves in the evenings.  It is impossible to leave by bus in direct direction.  You will have to change trains in Roslavl, Obninsk or other nearby cities.  The exact route and fare are best clarified at the box office of any bus station: the capital or Maloyaroslavetsky. </p><h2>  Electric train </h2>

    <p>  There is a much more reliable means on which you can travel along the route Moscow - Maloyaroslavets - an electric train that runs more often than a bus.  Four electric trains run along the route, two of which leave in the morning to take people to work, and two in the evening to deliver them home.  The average travel time is 1 hour 45 minutes, while the electric train often stops at small stations. </p><p>  Recently, only one long-distance train stops at the station - No. 085/086 Klimov - Moscow.  From Maloyaroslavets, he leaves at 4:07 Moscow time, and arrives in Moscow at exactly 6 in the morning.  The <span>train</span> leaves <span>Moscow</span> at 20:22, and arrives in Maloyaroslavets at 22:19.  On special dates, train number 139/140 Bryansk - St. Petersburg stops here, but unfortunately it will not work to get to Moscow by it. </p><h2>  And if you need it urgently? </h2>

    <p>  If neither the train nor the bus suits you, then you can only get to one of these settlements by car.  Do not be afraid of the distance, Moscow - Maloyaroslavets - the route is short enough, it can be overcome in 2.5-3 hours.  On the way you will meet a large number of different campsites and places for recreation, you can visit Naro-Fominsk and other settlements of the Moscow Region. </p><p>  Please note that the distance between gas stations in the region is relatively small, so you can replenish the fuel supply as soon as necessary.  In the area there are technical inspection services and tow trucks that can be called in case of emergency or a car breakdown.  Try to prepare your vehicle in advance so that you don't have any problems on the road. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the direction Moscow - Maloyaroslavets is served by a small amount of transport, it is quite enough here.  Many locals have their own cars, so they can independently get to Moscow and back.  For tourists and guests of the city there are several hotels where the room can be purchased at affordable prices. </p><p>  Muscovites rarely travel to Maloyaroslavets, so the existing transport routes are designed only for the residents of this small village.  Various films have been shot repeatedly in the city, and local residents will be happy to tell you about the shootings and other interesting facts. </p>
