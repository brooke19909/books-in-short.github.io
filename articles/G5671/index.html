One of them is named after the Russian emperor Alexander 3. The bridge in Paris, built according to the plan of Russian architects, is rightfully considered the most elegant in the French capital.  Looking at him, you are mentally transported to past centuries, in those distant times when France and Russia were monarchies, and their peoples highly esteemed their emperors.  Those who know the history of this architectural creation recognize that Alexander 3 bridge is a small piece of Russian land in elegant France.  It was built by Nicholas II as a symbol of the Franco-Russian Union and named after the father of this emperor. </p>

    <h2>  Bridge of Alexander III: the story of creation </h2><p>  In 1891, during the reign of the Russian Emperor <span>Alexander the Third</span> , a Franco-Russian alliance was concluded between France and Russia.  By order of Nicholas II, in the very heart of Paris, 9 years after this momentous event, a bridge was erected over the River Seine.  It was named after the crowned father of the current Russian emperor.  The construction of the bridge began in 1896.  It was at this time that the first stone was laid in the foundation of this structure.  At its grand opening was attended by the Ambassador of the Russian Empire in France L.P. Urusova, as well as the current president of the French Republic, Felix Faure and other political and public figures of this European country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander III bridge" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/421236.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is 160 meters long, while the height of its arch is six meters.  For the end of the century before last, a bridge raised to such a height was a complete innovation, and many considered this to be more than a risky idea for the architect.  However, the authors of the project took this step and raised the bridge to a height of 6 meters for a reason.  This was done so that the construction of the structure does not obscure the beautiful panorama of the <span>Champs Elysees</span> from the observers.  After all, the Alexander 3 bridge is thrown over the Seine and is located on a stretch of river in the area between the Invalides and the Champs Elysees.  Therefore, it is one of the most visited places in the French capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bridge in paris" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/421246.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Decoration and style </h2><p>  Thanks to its beautiful Boz-ar decorative decoration, this bridge in Paris is recognized as the most elegant and elegant.  However, according to architecture experts, this building is made in several styles at once.  In addition to the ‚ÄúBoz-ar‚Äù, here you can notice the elegant elements of the Empire and the strict lines of the Gothic Revival.  The decoration details that adorn the bridge over the entire length of 160 meters are mythical and biblical characters: angels and pegasuses frozen in flight, tender nymphs emerging from the abyss of water, as well as a huge number of lanterns.  At the entrance to the bridge from both ends, the first thing you can see is huge seventeen-meter columns with giant lanterns that give this building a special solemnity.  Above them hover bronze figures, which are symbols of agriculture.  In addition, the bridge named after Alexander 3 in Paris is crowned with symbols of science and industry, art and battles - all that unites the two great nations.  In the center of the arches there are coats of arms of friendly powers - Russia and France.  They are supported by the nymphs of the Seine and Neva.  All these architectural compositions are cast from copper alloy by the French sculptor Jean Recipo and are a symbol of friendship between the two peoples.  By the way, there is a similar bridge in St. Petersburg.  Its architecture and decor is very similar to that of Paris.  From the very first day of its foundation, it is still called the <span>Trinity Bridge.</span>  It was built by the French almost at the same time as Aleksandrovsky, again as a symbol of friendship and cooperation between the two states. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander bridge 3" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/421239.jpg" width="600"></div>
