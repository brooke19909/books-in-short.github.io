    <h2>  Michaela is a professional player </h2><p>  Such an interest of the world community in Michael Tabb was shown not in vain.  Born in England on December 11, 1967, at the age of 23 she already appeared in the professional arena of billiards, taking part in the eight tournament.  The following year, 1992, Michaela Tabb appeared in the women's national team of her native Scotland in billiards and played in her composition as a captain until 2003.  Later in 1996, her sister Juliet Tabb joined her in the national team.  In addition to playing for the national team, singles also brought Tabb success.  Michaela won first place in the UK Championship in 1997 and the European Women's Tournament in 1998.  It is believed that Michaela Tabb was the best female referee in snooker and pool competitions and was one of the best in the general refereeing environment. </p>

    <h2>  Career and personal life </h2><p>  Michaela herself claims that one of her boyfriends attracted her to billiards, and the pool entered her life so much that she decided to associate her future career with him.  At that time, she studied natural sciences and sociology at the University of Glasgow, but did not finish her studies, preferring to devote all her energy to playing the pool.  It is no wonder that Mikael‚Äôs husband also plays billiards professionally and is known among the world pool.  It was with his support that she began her career as a judge of tournaments, shone on television and even fought for her rights in court.  The family plays an important role in the life of the billiard star, she has two sons: Morgan and Preston, born in 1997 and 2007, respectively. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First Steps in Judging </h2><p>  As a referee, Michaela began appearing at her own tournaments, organized together with her husband to popularize billiards in the 90s.  These were amateur tournaments of eight and nine (varieties of pool) under the auspices of the World Billiards Association.  In 1997, Michaela began to judge professional matches at the tournament of St. Andrew the First-Called, and in 1998 she first appeared on television during the broadcast.  Thanks to the professionalism and good knowledge of the game, she won the respect of the players, she began to be invited to judge world tournaments by pool among professionals. </p>
