Recently, it has been developing dynamically and is considered the main tourist center of the Baltic state.  The popular resort offers a luxurious vacation on a pristine beach, marked by a special award - the blue flag. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The port of Ventspils (Latvia), whose territory is approximately 55 thousand square kilometers, was first mentioned in 1290, when the Knights of the Teutonic Order founded a small settlement on the seashore.  In the Middle Ages, it was a major shopping center due to its convenient location. </p><p>  Ventspils, in which the ships were built, was completely destroyed by the Swedes and lost a large number of inhabitants during the plague epidemic.  Literally from the ruins, the village was slowly recovering, but it suffered the heaviest financial damage after the First World War. </p><p>  In 1991, there were changes in the political and cultural life of the resort, and now its economic development is observed.  Currently, Ventspils (Latvia) is actively investing its oil transit revenues in tourism infrastructure. </p><h2>  Quiet resort </h2><p>  A large commercial and industrial center surprises with silence and tranquility.  It does not at all resemble the resort towns of Latvia, where fuss reigns around the clock.  Surprisingly, even in the high tourist season, from May to September, the streets of the Latvian capital of flowers are not very crowded.  The colorful Ventspils will appeal to history buffs as well as lovers of splashing in the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Ventspils Latvia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1571421.jpg" width="600"></div>

The highest summer temperature does not exceed 20 ° C, and in winter it ranges from - 2 to +7 ° C. The beach season opens in June and lasts until the end of August. </p><h2>  Castle of the livonian order </h2><p>  Charming Ventspils (Latvia), whose sights tell a story of rich history, is famous for the most famous ancient monument - the ancient fortress of the Livonian Order. </p><p>  The business card of the city, which has retained its original appearance with almost no changes, appeared in the XIII century.  The knights and their servants lived in a stone castle with narrow loophole windows.  When the <span>Livonian Order</span> ceased to exist, the judicial administration was located in the citadel.  In the XVII century, the Swedes, who attacked the city of Ventspils, burned the fortress, but the inhabitants reinstated their former appearance by stone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ventspils city" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1571398.jpg" width="600"></div>
