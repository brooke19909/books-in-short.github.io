An information desk can provide his address, and local residents will be happy to tell you how to get to your destination.  But will that be enough?  Would such data not seem too meager, because there really is something to see here? </p><p>  This article will introduce you in more detail to such an amazing and unique point on the map as Odessa.  The railway station, for example, will open to readers from a new, at first glance, invisible side. </p><p>  Among other things, it will be possible to get valuable information about what list of services this municipal infrastructure provides, to which destinations you can get from the sunny southern city of Ukraine, and where you can comfortably, and most importantly, stay relatively cheap at night. </p><h2>  General information and technical features </h2>

Why?  - The fact is that some trains, as a rule, freight goods go directly to the port or to the emergency station located in the village of Kotovsky. </p><p>  The building of the central passenger station is rightfully considered a kind of architectural monument. </p><p>  Geographically, the premises are located in the Primorsky district on Railway Station Square.  Today, there are six platforms, ten passenger routes, a cargo fleet. </p><p>  From a technical point of view, the platforms are straight, their length is just over 500 m. </p><p>  From the station building you can exit to the Railway Station and Starosennaya squares, as well as to <span>Kulikov Field.</span>  Transport interchange in these places is very convenient for moving to any part of the regional center. </p><p>  There is also its own official website of the railway <span>station.</span>  <span>Odessa is</span> doing everything possible to make life easier for its travelers.

    <p>  The history of the appearance of the railway station in Odessa is closely connected with the decision to build in 1863 a railway connecting the port of the Black Sea with central Ukraine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Emperor Alexander II gave his permission to build a station complex in Odessa.  In the summer of 1880, the Society of Southwestern Railways laid the foundation for the building of the railway station. </p><p>  It was officially opened in 1884.  The construction project was created by St. Petersburg architect V. A. Schr√∂ter, and the work was supervised by the famous architect Alexander Bernardazzi. </p><p>  The building is made in the neoclassical style, with elements of the Renaissance Baroque.  During the Great Patriotic War, during the occupation of Odessa in 1944, the station building was destroyed.  Later, the project of A. M. Chuprin on the restoration of the structure was adopted.  And already in 1952 the building was rebuilt.  The last reconstruction was made in 2006. </p><h2>  Service provided </h2>

It is profitable, convenient and safe. </p><p>  The apartment bureau of the Odessa railway station provides hotels, houses, sanatoriums, as well as apartments for rent for a day or for a long time. </p><p>  Usually, as practice shows, living in <span>Odessa hotels</span> is several times more expensive than renting a house or apartment in this city.  All houses and apartments are very clean and tidy, there are all conditions that provide comfort and good rest to Odessa tourists.  Most of the apartments are located near the railway station, and cottages and houses are located near the sea in the resort area.  The apartment bureau is located directly opposite the fourth platform and is open from eight in the morning until ten in the evening. </p><h2>  The characteristic features of the station hotels </h2><p>  There are a large number of hotels near the Odessa railway station, which is very convenient for thousands of travelers who come here on vacation. </p><p>  They are varied both in cost and in terms of comfort.

    <p>  We are considering the possibility of launching Hyundai trains delivered to Ukraine by a Korean company this year on the Odessa-Kiev route. </p><p>  At Odessa-Main station, a special room for the disabled has been opened. </p><p>  Odessa Railway is engaged in the issue of improving the conditions of movement on trains through the purchase of air conditioners and new bedding. </p><h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  Transportation of goods by rail is the cheapest, and electric trains are considered the most convenient form of railway transport.  Why?  The thing is that, unlike trains, they stop at almost all, even at very small stations within the region. </p><p>  Odessa residents use commuter trains to travel long distances, as they are affordable and safe.  By commuter trains, people get to the country cottages, and to the place of study in the regional center. </p><p>  Railway station (Odessa), tickets in the building of which can be purchased with almost no problems, is quite easy to find on a city map. </p>
