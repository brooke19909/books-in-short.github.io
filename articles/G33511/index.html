Today it is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. </p><h2>  City on the Neva </h2><p>  The great emperor spared neither strength nor funds for the construction of the city.  Architects known all over the world worked here.  According to the project, the city was supposed to resemble Amsterdam, but the Northern capital became an original city, and its architectural masterpieces - temples, palaces, mansions built in the XVIII-XIX centuries - have no analogues in the world.  It will take a long time to get acquainted with the historical, cultural and architectural sights of the city, since their number is difficult to even list.  All tourists who arrived <span>in St. Petersburg</span> visit the <span>galleries of</span> Russian and contemporary artists with great pleasure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg galleries" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/992770.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Oddly enough, but the name of this giant museum complex means "secluded corner."  The history of the museum began with the private collection of Empress Catherine II.  Over its long history (more than 250 years), the museum has grown and become one of the largest in the world.  It will take several weeks to study its exhibits. </p>

    <p>  The museum complex consists of several buildings that are located next door on the Palace Embankment.  Its center is the <span>Winter Palace.</span>  In the Small Hermitage, among many priceless exhibits, a unique ‚ÄúPeacock‚Äù watch by the London master Cox is stored - at a given time, a gilded rooster, owl and peacock not only sing, but also move.  The New Hermitage is known for sculptures of Atlantes holding a stone portico on their powerful shoulders. </p><h2>  Hermitage: how to get there? </h2><p>  The museum is located in the city center.  Admiralteyskaya is the nearest metro station.  From the station, turn left and walk a few meters to Malaya Morskaya Street.  Then you should turn right again and go to Nevsky Prospect.  Follow it to the left, after which you will get to the <span>Palace Square.</span>  Here you will see the entrance to the Hermitage. </p><h2>  Museum and Galleries of Contemporary Art "Erarta" (Vasilievsky Island, 2) </h2><p>  Everyone who visits the galleries located in a city such as St. Petersburg, Erartu must see.  This is part of a large-scale international project in contemporary Russian art.  The project is represented by a network of galleries located in five cities around the world.  Erarta is the first museum in the Northern capital representing contemporary art and the largest private collection in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Erarta Museum" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/992772.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Erarta is a museum whose program is aimed at supporting art and creating its own projects.  The full name of the complex is the Erarta Museum and Galleries of Contemporary Art.  It occupies a large room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã10 thousand square meters.  Before the entrance to the building are installed statues of the sculptor <span>D. Zhukov</span> Era and Arta.  These goddesses gave the name to the complex - Erarta, which means "era of art." </p><h2>  DiDi (Bolshoi Prospect, 62) </h2><p>  The exhibition of contemporary art, which has a rather unusual name ‚ÄúDidi‚Äù, opened <span>in St. Petersburg in October</span> 2003. <br><br>  Without exception, visitors always ask gallery owners the question: "What does the name mean:" DiDi Gallery? "  Translated from Georgian, ‚ÄúDidi‚Äù sounds like ‚Äúbig‚Äù, and it is located on Bolshoi Prospekt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Didi Gallery" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/992769.jpg" width="600"></div>
