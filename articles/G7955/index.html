The castle was built in the 18th century in just 3 years according to the project of the hostess herself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ramon Voronezh region attractions" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/471658.jpg" width="443"></div>  The building has a lot of unusual things: the brick itself, which is still not collapsing, and a huge bog oak staircase made without a single nail, and twisted gates, and fences of balconies.
