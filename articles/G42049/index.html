Those who prefer to bask under the hot rays of the sun have never heard of him.  This is a favorite resting place for locals located in the highlands of Sochi, in dense forests.  We are talking about mountain lakes with crystal clear water, among which Kalinovy ​​Lake stands out - the pearl of the rich Krasnodar Territory. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.6162601" data-lng="39.88464150000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/4/5/7/13457.png"></div><p>  Kalinov Lake in Sochi is located in the Khostinsky district about an hour and a half away by car.  The distance is small, only 35 kilometers from Sochi.  From Hosta and even less - 15, but the path runs along a mountain serpentine with very sharp turns.  Drivers should soberly assess their car driving skills in difficult conditions so as not to get into an emergency. </p><p>  The lake is located in a forest, not far from the village of the same name.  Hosta Highlands are famous for the fact that tea plantations are located there. </p><p>  Kalinovy, like several other lakes, was created by human hands.  They were dug to irrigate tea plantations, but were abandoned over time.  The shores of the lakes were wild, overgrown with lush vegetation and turned these places into marvelous paradises. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An amazing fact is that this lake is named after the village built near, and the village adopted the name of the reservoir. </p><div class="photo" data-original="selfllery.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunset on Kalinovy ​​Lake" class="if uuid-3032269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3032269.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Difficulties with the question of how to get to Kalinovy ​​Lake in Sochi will not arise.  You can get, for example, a regular regular bus. </p><p>  To make it easier, first get to Hosta on any inter-district route.  Bus number 127 goes from Hosta to Kalinovoe Lake. Work on the line starts at 6 a.m., then transport leaves every hour and a half.  The last flight to Kalinovoe Lake leaves at 18.30, back to Khosta at 19.30.  You must plan your trip in advance so you don’t have to stay in the forest for the night. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nunataka.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bus Schedule 127" class="if uuid-3032240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3032240.jpg"></div><p>  From Lazarevsky or Krasnaya Polyana it is best to get to Khosta by train, and from there take the already famous 127th bus. </p><p>  If you are traveling by car, be prepared for poor quality road surface.  Also, do not drive if you feel tired.  The road is a mountain serpentine that requires maximum concentration of attention. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="zabivan.livejournal.com" data-author=": Zabivan, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hosta station" class="if uuid-3032228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3032228.jpg"></div><h2>  What to bring </h2><p>  Viburnum lake in Sochi is a surprisingly comfortable picnic area, so take everything you need with you.  This applies to food, water and drinks.  There are no shops there. </p><p>  Wear only comfortable, athletic shoes with hard soles.  The land in the forests is rather insidious, due to the increased humidity it is very loose and soft, it is easy to stumble or slide off a small bump, which can lead to sprains or dislocations. </p><p>  Pay attention to the choice of clothes - you are going to the forest.  No matter how hot the weather in Sochi, Kalinovoe Lake is located in the forest, where, as you know, it darkens faster and noticeably colder by the evening.  Put warm, cooked items in your bag.  Do not forget mosquito and tick protective creams. </p><p>  Viburnum lake is not a resort area.  Swimming in the lake is prohibited, so do not even think of putting a swimsuit and bathing accessories in your bag. </p><div class="photo" data-original="privetsochi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Road to Kalinovoe Lake" class="if uuid-3032277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3032277.jpg"></div><h2>  Paid services </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the recreation area is located in the forest, there are also elements of civilization here.  On the territory there are about 15 tables and four pavilions.  The cost of one table is 150 rubles per person with a total capacity of 8 to 15. The arbor can be removed for 1000 rubles.  The price includes barbecue, sports grounds for volleyball and badminton. </p><p>  If you have pets, you can take them for a walk.  The rules are not prohibited.  Fishing enthusiasts can try their luck at fishing.  Fans of the bath will not refuse to steam. </p><p>  If you know how to steer a boat and have always dreamed of being a pioneer, you can rent it and ride with your family and friends on the lake.  Children will be delighted with the floating ducks that can be fed. </p><p>  If you plan to hold a large event, it is better to book seats in advance.  The site is open all year. </p><h2>  Kalinovoe Lake Village </h2><p>  In Sochi, there is the village of Kalinovoe Lake, located several tens of kilometers from the vacation spots and practically no different from standard resort settlements. </p><p>  Kalinovoe Lake is located in the Krasnodar Territory twenty kilometers from Greater Sochi and the open sea.  The settlement has only twelve streets and about 700 inhabitants.  The weather in the village Kalinovoye Lake in Sochi is consistently warm, without sharp fluctuations in temperature.  In Soviet times, large tea plantations were planted along the shores of Kalinovy ​​Lake, and agronomists lived in the village, caring for plants and harvesting crops.  Today, tea picking has stopped, the village lives off tourism.  It borders on the Sochi National Park, so the flow of tourists does not dry out. </p><h2>  Fishing on the lake </h2><p>  Fans of fishing will also have something to do on Kalinovy ​​Lake in Sochi.  There are a large number of fish: perch, common carp, chub, asp, perch, roach, catfish, pike.  Fishing is both summer and winter.  For those who wish, there is a fish biting forecast service for each type of fish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.turysochi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing on the lake" class="if uuid-3032260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3032260.jpg"></div><p>  Those who are overtaken by the desire to try their luck during the holidays, can rent the necessary gear on site. </p><p>  If you are lucky and your knowledge and skills have borne fruit, or rather, the catch, do not pull.  You can cook fish right on the spot - treat yourself and friends with rich fish soup or fragrant tender fish on the grill.  Believe me, you will not regret it! </p>
