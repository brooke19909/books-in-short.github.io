  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a replenished contribution to VTB?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those who do not want to save money at home, under the mattress, usually choose a reliable bank and open an account.  One of the largest financial lending institutions - VTB Bank offers favorable conditions for opening a deposit with a replenishment function.  It is worth noting that one of the pressing issues today is the availability of guarantees for the safety of invested funds.  At VTB, deposits of individuals participate in the insurance program, according to which amounts up to 1,400,000 rubles are insured. </p><h2>  Conditions for making a deposit </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mybanktracker.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="deposit capitalization" class="if uuid-2591828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81847/2591828.jpg"></div><p>  First you need to determine the conditions that will be taken into account when opening a replenished deposit in VTB.  There are two ways to open a deposit account in a bank: by contacting a branch or through the Internet bank.  The difference between these methods is the value of the minimum amount for opening an account.  To access remote services, you must have a bank card opened with VTB or VTB Bank of Moscow. </p><p>  There are two replenished deposits at VTB: “Replenished” and “Comfortable”.  The first one offers only to deposit funds, the second plus to this function is also the possibility of repeated withdrawals.  Three types of currencies are available in which an account can be opened: rubles, US dollars or euros. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The “Comfortable” deposit can be opened for a period of 6 to 61 months.  However, this does not mean that the maximum percentage will be set for the maximum period.  It is necessary to be guided by the term, the best conditions fall on the period from 6 to 18 months (3.82%, taking into account capitalization). </p><p>  It is proposed to issue a “replenished” contribution to VTB for a period of 3 to 61 months.  The best option for obtaining high interest is to open an account from 3 to 6 months (5.82% with capitalization on deposit). </p><h2>  Terms of replenishment and prolongation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ndtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="deposit with replenishment" class="if uuid-2591826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81847/2591826.jpg"></div><p>  A distinctive feature of the opening by individuals of VTB of a deposit with a replenishment function is the ability to make a final deposit no later than 30 days before its expiration date.  According to the established tariffs, the availability of automatic renewal of the contract is present in both deposit lines, but with a reservation, no more than two times.  The interest rate will be set similar to that which will be valid at the time of renewal. </p><h2>  Dates, Contributions and Withdrawals </h2><p>  If we talk about the terms, then the client can choose a convenient end date for the deposit, up to the number of days or a specific day.  If you want to withdraw funds from the “Comfortable” account, the client must know that at the bank’s cash desk he will be able to indicate the amount of 15 thousand rubles or more.  This operation through the Internet bank will allow you to transfer funds from a deposit to a card without restrictions, regardless of the currency of the account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The minimum amount for opening a replenishable deposit in VTB depends on the chosen method of servicing.  In the department, it will be from 100 thousand rubles, remotely, through the Internet bank, - 30 thousand rubles.  It is also worth noting that when working through an online resource, the client gets the opportunity to make additional contributions for a minimum amount of 1 ruble, 1 dollar or 1 euro.  If an operator <span>opened a deposit</span> in a bank branch, this will also affect the amount that can be deposited into the account.  In particular, when it comes to rubles, starting from 15 thousand rubles, or $ 500, 500 €. </p><p>  Recently, many investors have left recommendatory reviews on the replenished contribution to VTB.  It concerns the choice of its duration.  Since the market situation is constantly changing, it is advisable to choose a short period for storing funds, for example 3 or 6 months.  This allows you to respond on time to a change in the tariff conditions of the bank and transfer funds at more favorable interest rates. </p><h2>  Interest and capitalization </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.goodreturns.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interest on the account" class="if uuid-2591831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81847/2591831.jpg"></div><p>  Both deposits provide for a single system of monthly interest calculation.  There is also a condition for capitalization of funds.  Figuratively speaking, when the accrued interest is summed up with the balance of the deposit and the next month, interest is accrued on the balance with the accrued interest. </p><h2>  Savings account </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sapling.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="online discovery" class="if uuid-2591827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81847/2591827.jpg"></div><p>  The best option for those who constantly use the card and non-cash method of payment for goods and services, while wanting to receive the maximum income to the account, is a replenished funded contribution to VTB.  This account is used without any time limit, the amount of the contribution can be any.  There is one condition that requires opening a multicard with a savings function.  A savings account can be opened with a specialist in the department or through the Internet bank.  The more funds are in the account, the higher the percentage.  For example, if you spend 15 thousand rubles per card per month, then starting from the first month 5.5% per annum will be accrued on the balance of the account, and 8% starting from the 12th month. </p><p>  In this case, you can withdraw funds from the account and replenish it an unlimited number of times.  For the convenience of users, the option of automatic replenishment from the card to the savings account is configured.  Thanks to convenient conditions, many users managed to appreciate the advantage of free use of funds and the possibility of obtaining additional income in the form of interest. </p>
