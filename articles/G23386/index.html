  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mortgage Loan: Shorter And More Expensive</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mortgage loan is one of the forms of real estate acquisition in the housing construction market.  This method for buying an apartment today is choosing an increasing number of people. <br><br>  Just like <noindex>  <span>IP registration in Moscow</span> </noindex>  and in other Russian cities, mortgage lending takes place in a certain order, with the execution of a number of documents, and requires specific knowledge and decisions.  In many ways, the advantages and disadvantages of mortgages can be assessed by analysis of this sector of a market economy. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the financial and economic crisis has particularly affected the fields of construction and real estate.  Changes in some conditions of mortgage lending in recent years are a consequence of this process. <br><br>  The first is a change in rates.  As a rule, all of them are dependent on the state refinancing rate.  The lower it is, the cheaper the loan.  As a result of the 2009 crisis, a sharp increase in refinancing rates was observed throughout Russia.  Since 01/01/09, the rate has increased by 13%.  The result was a sharp rise in the cost of a mortgage loan.  And even the subsequent decrease in the state refinancing rate did not improve this situation.  The reason is that, as a result of the crisis, banking institutions had to take unpopular measures such as reducing the risk of non-payments by increasing interest rates on new credit loans.  In many respects, the situation was corrected thanks to government subsidies that supported mortgage programs, as well as the introduction of a deferred payment system. <br><br>  Thus, it is expected that the mortgage market will gradually come out of the crisis, and, as a result, interest rates on mortgage loans will decrease. <br><br>  The second important point is the terms of the mortgage.  Within certain time limits <noindex>  <span>LLC registration</span> </noindex>  , drawn up certain documents.  Mortgage lending has the longest terms for repayment of loans of the population.  However, in crisis conditions, the risk of non-repayment of a loan or a delay in payments increases significantly.  As a result, banks are trying to normalize this situation by reducing repayment periods, which is completely disadvantageous for citizens with low or medium income levels. </p></div></article>
