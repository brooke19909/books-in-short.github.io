The history of the city is connected with the chronicler Rurik.  It was this settlement that was the first independent republic within Russia, that is, the birth of statehood began in this city.  Locals were able to resist the Mongol invasion, but for this they had to pay tribute to the Horde.  In the period from the eleventh to the twelfth century, when a wave of fragmentation swept over Russia and economic decline began, Veliky Novgorod resisted. </p><p>  In this city is located the Novgorod Detinets, dated 1044, Yaroslavovo Dvorishche and Torg, an architectural complex, the first mention of which exists in the chronicles of 1271, and many more interesting buildings. </p><h2>  Lord of the chamber </h2><p>  This architectural monument of the 15th century is also called the Faceted Chamber.  The building was erected in the Gothic style and is located on the territory of the Novgorod detinets.  Detinets is located on the left bank of the Volkhov River, is assigned to the historical center of the city and is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The Faceted Chamber (Veliky Novgorod) is a three-story building.  The ground floor of the building is covered with an architectural layer, so from the outside it seems that the building is two-story.  Previously, food and wine were stored on the ground floor, and there was also a dungeon. </p><p>  According to visitors, the second floor is not very noticeable, and it is quite dark here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The third floor is the highlight of the chamber.  This is a huge bright room, called the "Cross Chamber".  There are many niches on the floor with fresco paintings.  At the very entrance to the chamber, the Image of the Savior is striking.  It was on this floor that a spiritual and boyar court took place.  Deacons and priests were chosen here, services, morning and evening prayers were held.  In 1570, the famous "Blood Feast" of Ivan the Terrible took place in the chamber. </p><p>  The leading place of the Chamber of Lords is the collection of arts and crafts.  The exposition presents samples of silver and gold craftsmen of antiquity.  Most of the exhibits come from the monastery and church vestries brought from St. Sophia Cathedral.  A unique temple utensils dating from the 11th-12th centuries, artifacts that have been preserved since the pre-Mongol period are also presented. </p><h2>  Zion </h2><p>  The great Zion, also referred to as the Greater Jerusalem, resembles the small in form and style of execution.  He was brought to the Faceted Chamber of Veliky Novgorod in 1929.  He completely repeats the main relic of Christians - the canopy that was built over the place of burial and further resurrection of Christ.  Previously, the relic was used as a vessel for transferring Eucharistic bread during the liturgy. </p><p>  Large zion is somewhat different from small even in proportions.  It contains glassy inserts and blacks that effectively set off the gilded silver, giving Jerusalem solemnity and grandeur. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is a version that the work is a princely order.  Most likely, the Novgorod prince Mstislav ordered it for Novgorod Sofia. </p><p>  Lesser Zion is one of the oldest relics of the chamber, dating from the 11th century.  To date, the relic has no enamel additions and doors. </p>

    <h2>  Kratira </h2><p>  The unique exhibits of the Lords of the Chamber include kratirs, which are bowls for communion with two handles that look like ritual vessels that were used in the pre-Christian period.  These utensils were used in worship until the XVII century.  Some legends say that it is the chalice for the Last Supper that has the shape of the kratira presented in the Faceted Chamber.  The vessels are quite voluminous, which gives reason to believe that there were a huge number of participants in St. Sophia Cathedral. </p><p>  On the surfaces of the cups are depicted the images of Christian saints: </p><ul><li>  Christ; </li><li>  Mother of God; </li><li>  Apostle Peter </li><li>  the great martyr Anastasia, and on the other side - Barbara. </li></ul><p>  On the crowns of the bowls of the kratir there are blackened inscriptions. </p>

    <h2>  Miter </h2><p>  The Faceted Chamber of Veliky Novgorod is famous for its monastery mitras.  These headdresses of the bishops mean the crown of thorns of the Savior, and also mean the special authority given to the clergy by the Lord. </p><p>  The chamber contains the miter of the Antoniev Monastery, which came here in 1934.  The artifact is in its original form. </p><p>  The exposition contains a panagiar dated to 1435, a water-sanctuary cup (1593), an Apracos gospel from 1654 encrusted with sapphires, garnets, rubies and emeralds, and other historical relics. </p>

    <h2>  Location, how to get there </h2><p>  The chamber is located at 14. Novgorod Kremlin Street. If we talk about the route Moscow - Veliky Novgorod, then the road by car will take about 7 hours, and you will have to cover 540 km. </p><p>  You can get to Veliky Novgorod from Moscow from the Leningradsky railway station, daily at 22:05 the train No. 042A leaves.  Travel time is 8:19. </p><p>  From Moscow metro station "Pushkinskaya" daily departs at 21:00 bus "Moscow - Novgorod."  The place of arrival is the McDonald's stop, at Bolshaya St. Petersburgskaya, 57. The bus arrives at 6 in the morning.  The approximate fare is 900 rubles. </p><p>  Excursions to museums are held from Monday to Friday, beginning at 12:00.  On Saturday and Sunday - 2 excursions at 12:00 and 14:00.  The cost of visiting for adults is 200.00 rubles, for preschool children - 50% of the total cost.  Benefits also for pensioners and students - the price is 150.00 rubles. </p><p>  Despite the small size of the city, there is a fairly developed transport infrastructure.

Therefore, there will be no problems with how to get to the Faceted Chamber in Veliky Novgorod.

    <h2>  Other historical monuments of the city </h2><p>  Naturally, being on the territory of the Novgorod detinets, to see only the Vladyka‚Äôs Chamber is unacceptable. </p><p>  The Novgorod Kremlin is a military defensive complex, the first mention of which dates back to 1044.  In the old days, it served as the religious and social center of the entire Novgorod land.  It was in this place that the veche was held, and from here the squad of Alexander Nevsky came out to fight the Swedes. </p><p>  The walls of the castle were defended by St. Sophia Cathedral - another historical monument that should be visited.  The cathedral was built by the son of Yaroslav the Wise - Prince Vladimir, in the period from 1045 to 1050.  Already in the XII century it ceased to be listed as a princely temple and became the main cathedral of the Novgorod Republic. </p><p>  Through the whole territory runs a road that leads to the bridge.  As in past times, it connects the Trade and Sofia sides of the complex. </p><p>  On the territory there is also a small church of Andrei Stratilat, the exact date of its construction has not been established, but approximately this is the XVII century.  It is known that it was built from the ruins of the ancient Borisoglebskaya church (1167 building). </p><p>  Chasozvonya is located in the north-west of the territory, on the one hand it adjoins the building of the Judicial Order, and on the other hand to the church of Sergei Radonezh.  From the northern part of the 19th century, a small two-story building was added to the clock. </p><p>  And of course - the building of the Government Places, the administrative building of the province, erected in the period from the XVII to the XIX century according to the project of the architect Polivanov V.  Previously, there was a treasury, a state chamber and courts (civil and criminal).  In the cellars of the building there were wine shops. </p>

    <h2>  Modern monuments </h2><p>  Description of the attractions of Veliky Novgorod can be continued indefinitely.  One cannot ignore the monument ‚ÄúMillennium of Russia‚Äù, which was erected in 1862, as part of the celebration of the millennium of Russian statehood.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe monument is the assertion of the principle of Orthodoxy, autocracy and nationality. </p><p>  A monument to Sergey Rakhmaninov and a <span>Victory Monument were</span> erected in the Kremlin Park <span>,</span> and on the embankment of A. Nevsky there is a monument to a drawing boy, a bear on a bench. </p><p>  Today, the Kremlin and Veliky Novgorod itself is a tourist and cultural center, with many interesting and picturesque places. </p>
