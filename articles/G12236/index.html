How to get there</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Moscow is probably not the greenest metropolis in the world, but still it managed to preserve many charming corners of nature.  It is worth paying tribute to the efforts of many experts who carefully look after the living corners of nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="supersnimki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Suvorov Park in the fall" class="if uuid-2517660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2517660.jpg"></div><p>  The western direction has always been considered the cleanest in Moscow.  Along Mozhayskoye and <span>Rublevskoye Shosse</span> , many cozy places have been preserved where you can relax and socialize with nature. </p><h2>  Suvorov Park on a map of Moscow </h2><p>  The path of government motorcades lies from the Kremlin and the White House along Novy Arbat, Kutuzovsky Prospekt, Mozhayskoye Shosse and leads to Rublevka.  On the right side of the famous highway are comfortable high-rises for wealthy people, and further, along the Moscow River, there stretches a green zone, which was once simply called Filevsky Park. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-zoom="14" data-type="hybrid" data-lng="37.463445699999966" data-lat="55.7382859"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/8/7/7/3877.png"></div><p>  Today, in addition to Filevsky, it includes Voroshilovsky, Soldatenkovsky and Suvorovsky parks.  The very place where the Suvorov Park in Moscow is located allows you to keep intact corners of wildlife and the charm of the forest.  In the east it is located the green zone of Filey, in the west - Krylatsky hills, in the north - the Moscow River, beyond which Terekhovo with its undeveloped open spaces, and in the south stretches a narrow strip of prestigious residential complexes.  All this is protected as a fortress wall, Rublevsky highway.  Without good knowledge of the capital, it is difficult to immediately determine where the Suvorov Park in Moscow is located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Times gone by </h2><p>  People from ancient times settled on the southern slopes of the Moscow River.  Archaeologists discovered cultural layers dating back to the 5th century BC.  Long before Yuri Dolgoruky, the Vyatichi lived in these places and built their settlements.  Where the Suvorov Park in Moscow is located, there was once a manor owned by the famous Russian commander Alexander Vasilievich Suvorov.  In memory of him, the park got its name.  Nearby was the Naryshkin estate, which later passed into the possession of a large manufacturer Soldatenkov.  From the old owners in the park remained apple orchards and centuries-old pine trees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotokto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park playground" class="if uuid-2515589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2515589.jpg"></div><p>  Today, in the place where the Suvorov Park in Moscow is located, families with small children like to relax. </p><h2>  Present day </h2><p>  The recreation area is quiet and cozy, a large number of children's towns are equipped here, several beautiful ponds, cozy alleys.  A beautiful embankment stretched along the Moskva River for almost 4 km.  If you do not look closely at the skyscrapers on the horizon, you might think that you are outside the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moscowparks.narod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View from Krylatsky hills" class="if uuid-2515583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2515583.jpg"></div><p>  You can stroll along the promenade to the Rowing Canal.  In the <span>green zone</span> there is a good cycle track with decent elevations (150 m).  The river in the place where Suvorovsky Park in Moscow is located makes a steep loop, so it was straightened to improve shipping.  So, next to the recreation area, it flows quietly and calmly, no noise of floating ships and boats is heard. </p><p>  If desired, the place where the Suvorov Park in Moscow is located can be reached by metro.  The nearest stations are Krylatskoye or Molodezhnaya.  Further, taking a walk from the Krylatsky hills through the Suvorov Park to the center, you can have a bite to eat in a more equipped part of the Filevskaya recreation area.  And return again by subway (stations "Pionerskaya", "Filevsky park", "Bagrationovskaya").  If desired, you can walk to Victory Park. </p>
