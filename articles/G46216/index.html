Antalya with sandy beaches, the "stone belt" of Kemer, a respectable Side, known for its beautiful nature of Marmaris.  This is not a complete list of places that our travelers love.  Turkey is washed by three seas (Black, Mediterranean and Aegean) and one inland (Marble), so there are great opportunities for vacationers to choose what they like. </p><p>  Marmaris is located on the Aegean Sea, which is considered to be part of the Mediterranean.  The resort is famous for its clean beaches, lush subtropical vegetation and cheerful nightlife.  This is a favorite vacation spot for young people who prefer to combine beaches with parties in clubs.  Couples with children or those who want to enjoy a calm and peaceful atmosphere choose the Marmaris-Icmeler area, which is 7-8 km from it.  Dolmushi (Turkish fixed-route taxis) regularly go between the settlements, so you can combine outdoor activities with a quiet and measured one. </p><p>  The hotel base of Icmeler is represented by different categories: you can choose a modest hotel at affordable prices or stay in an elite apart-hotel, book a villa.  Most choose the golden mean - 4 * hotels that combine comfortable accommodation and quality food at an affordable cost, excellent service and interesting entertainment.  For example, you can stay at Club Hotel Munamar 4 * (Marmaris, Icmeler) - an excellent hotel for a family vacation, which will be discussed in our article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of Marmaris: nature, climate </h2><p>  The resort is located in the subtropical zone and is surrounded by mountains that close a small bay from strong winds.  Snow-white sandy beaches do not know the storms, but away from the coast strong winds can raise big waves.  In general, the climate can be described as mild and dry.  The sea warms up already in early May, just at this time the beach season begins here, which lasts until October.  Keep in mind that the Aegean is a little cooler than the Mediterranean.  The maximum water temperature is +26 <sup>o</sup> C.  The hottest and driest months occur in the middle of summer (July and August).  At this time, you need to use creams with the maximum protection factor.  People who suffer from high blood pressure are advised to come on holiday in Marmaris in other months. </p>

    <p>  Three wonderful islands are located in the bay, on which spreading pine trees grow.  The nature of the resort fascinates with its beauty: these are mountain landscapes, forest groves, flowering shrubs, exotic trees and palm trees.

Along the quiet coast you can take a yacht ride and see from the sea a beautiful bay with clean beaches, mountains covered with bright green vegetation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Icmeler: features, hotels, beaches </h2><p>  The distance from the international airport in Dalaman to the village is about 100 km.  It is calm and comfortable here.  The resort is associated primarily with family vacations.  There are nightclubs and bars in Icmeler, but not in such numbers as in Marmaris.

The road to the beach can take up to 30 minutes.  It does not tire: along the way beautiful pine trees and palm trees grow, there are numerous cafes and restaurants, shops, and between them there are lovely water channels.

    <p>  Walking tours can be done independently on Icmeler (Marmaris).  Two channels that are laid in the town and end in the Mediterranean Sea are very impressive.  The shores are lined with stone, and yachts run along one of them.  Along the canals there are beautiful boardwalks that are illuminated in the dark.  Lanterns have an arcuate curved shape, the water flickers beautifully.  In such a romantic setting it‚Äôs nice to walk hand in hand with your loved one. </p><p>  The main tourist attractions of Icmeler can be found on Kayabal street.  It goes directly to the bay, and in the city along it are shops, cafes and bars with live music, karaoke. </p><p>  It is definitely worth taking a minibus to Marmaris.  There are interesting, chic and lively beaches (for example, Cleopatra), Barov street with clubs and other entertainment venues.  Among the architectural structures, one can note the Old Fortress, the Ataturk monument, and the Pearl sculpture.  From the pier of Marmaris, a boat goes to the island of Paradise, Hare, where you can see the pirate caves.  Children will love the <span>Atlantis waterpark,</span> incredible emotions are caused by watching the "singing" fountain. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Club Munamar 4 * service receives the highest ratings.  Positive epithets have earned the work of the animation team.  The condition of the rooms is rated as quite good.  People note that cleaning was carried out every day, often changed linens and towels.  The territory seemed to some guests of the hotel small, but they found many interesting walking spots for themselves near Club Munamar 4 *. </p><p>  Characteristics regarding nutrition are positive ("beyond praise", "fiction", "fed for slaughter").  Not in vain for some tour operators (for example, Pegasus) this hotel is positioned as 4 + *.  Most vacationers are ready to return to this tourist complex yet.  Moreover, they advise and recommend Club Munamar 4 * (Marmaris, Icmeler) to their relatives and friends. </p>
