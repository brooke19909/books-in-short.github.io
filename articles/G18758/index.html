    <p>  Many couples dream of a <span>talisman of love.</span>  Why not make a <span>charm with your own hands</span> for your feelings?  So that affection grows every day, let it be protected by a tree of love.  This article will describe the principle of making such a gift.  We will make a tree of love from beads.  We are sure that your soulmate will be very pleased to receive such a present. </p><p>  Various types of needlework are very popular among the female population.  A special place is occupied by <span>bead weaving.</span>  A tree of love, baubles, various accessories - all this can be made from these decorative beads. </p><h2>  Preparation for work </h2><p>  Before starting work, it is required to prepare all the materials that will be involved so as not to be distracted by searches.  Since the process will be divided into many operations, the manufacturing time will pass unnoticed. </p><p>  Below will be described how to weave a tree of love from beads.  Schemes are quite diverse.  Your desire and mastery of beadwork technology will allow you to make a unique creation according to well-known patterns. </p><h2>  Outline of a tree of love from beads resembling a heart </h2><p>  1. The basis for the trunk. </p><p>  We take a thick wire and bend it into the desired shape.  For this tree is more suitable if you make two halves of a big heart.  We connect one end of each part to a common trunk, and the second bend to the place of crossing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. Twigs of a tree. </p><p>  You will need wire and beads, the color of which can be chosen at will.  If you make a heart, pink and blue are the best options.  The wire for twigs should be easily deformed.  We take a piece and string the beads on it, filling it to half. </p><p>  To form the leaves, disconnect 9 beads and twist the wire - the first one is ready.  We do the following in the same way, slightly departing from the previous one.  In total, a leaf should have 7 leaves.  When they are done, form a branch.  To do this, we twist the two parts of the wire together.  For a tree, we need to weave 30 branches of each color, which will be interconnected in the form of bunches of 5 pieces each. </p><p>  3. The formation of the trunk. </p><p>  Now form the trunk.  To do this, we attach the bundles to the workpiece.  When the branches are fixed, we cover them with thick threads from above, thereby sealing the trunk.  We take the bowl prepared for the tree, and, having fixed the product, fill it with gypsum, wait until it hardens.  And only after we put alabaster on the trunk.  Let dry and cover with the desired paint. </p><p>  4. Level the branches. </p><p>  Now your bead tree of love is ready.  Hand it over and enjoy your love, which is now protected by such a powerful talisman. </p><h2>  The scheme resembles a <span>globe that</span> has bloomed from love. </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bead weaving tree of love" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/378280.jpg?1398010075183" width="249"></div></h2><p>  1. The frame. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__g2l"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__g2l"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__g2l"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__g2l"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__g2l"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We take 4 pieces of wire, each length is 23 cm, and one with a length of 32 cm. We make the same rings from them.  A long wire will become the basis.  The rings should be inserted into each other, forming a ball.  Insert the last circle horizontally.  The joints are connected by <span>aluminum wire.</span>  The barrel is made of a more dense material.  You can twist it, it will give it an unusual appearance. </p><p>  2. The soil. </p><p>  The soil will be gypsum, after drying, covered with green paint and decorated with stones and shells. </p><p>  3. Decoration. </p><p>  We seal the trunk, apply alabaster and paint in the selected color.  The ball can be painted with the barrel, but there is the possibility of an experiment, everything is in your hands.  After we take the threads, preferably similar in color to the ball, and after wetting them, we wrap them around the workpiece.  To align the colors, they can also be painted.  Everything, the product is ready for decoration.  You can attach anything you want to it.  The main thing is that it brings you pleasure.  You can also decorate the trunk by adding feathers and other decorative elements. </p><p>  4. The final stage. </p><p>  Varnishing the entire product and applying any sparkles. </p>

    <h2>  Outline of two trees that intertwined with each other </h2><p>  To make this option, beads of two colors are taken. </p><p>  1. Twigs. </p><p>  We make branches with leaves, as in scheme No. 1. Only in this embodiment, the first and last elements should be green.  Each branch connects to a larger branch.  Their number depends on the total result that you want to get. </p><p>  2. The trunk. </p><p>  Twigs are attached to the trunks, as in 1 scheme.  At the same time, we leave it most of the time empty.  Now we seal the trunks and weave together.  About the ways of strengthening was described in detail in previous schemes.  We paint the trunks in the color of the beads, which is typed on the branches. </p><p>  3. Decoration. </p><p>  Trunks can be decorated with hearts or large beads.  Everything will depend on your imagination and desire to surprise your loved one. </p><h2>  Possible options for the above schemes </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="love tree bead photo" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/378281.jpg?1398068633049" width="331"></div></h2><ol><li>  Combine the idea with a heart shape and plexus trunks. </li><li>  Make two hearts - small against the background of the big. </li><li>  Instead of leaves, make hearts. </li></ol><p>  A tree of love from beads, the photo of which you will see in this article, will be a great gift for close friends and relatives, as well as for your colleagues.  In any case, this gift will be very original and will be remembered by everyone for a long time. </p>
