If you want to expand your creative abilities and learn how to knit naturalistic fruits, this article is for you.  In it, we will consider the crochet technique of vegetables and fruits.  Schemes and descriptions for them will be clear and simple, even novice masters will be able to master them.  Let's knit "food" together! </p><div class="photo" data-original="weddbook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet fruit" class="if uuid-3028099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3028099.jpg"></div><h2>  We create a realistic apple with our own hands </h2><p>  We offer to start your acquaintance with the crocheting technique of fruits and vegetables from making a delicious apple.  To work, you will need to prepare some tools, namely: </p><ul><li>  hook number 3,5; </li><li>  a small amount of red and brown yarn (thread density - 250 g per 100 m); </li><li>  knitting markers; </li><li>  a needle with a big eye; </li><li>  any filler (for example, syntepuh). </li></ul><p>  In the description of the apple knitting process, we will use some abbreviations: RLS (single crochet), SP (connecting loop), VP (air loop), decrease (2 single crochet, with a common top, knitted for the front half loops of the previous row). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another important point: at the end of each row, knitting loops are not used when knitting amigurumi products.  Rows fit in a spiral.  Therefore, to facilitate calculations, we recommend that beginners use knitting markers at the beginning of each row. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetjune.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet vegetables and fruits patterns" class="if uuid-3018911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3018911.jpg"></div><h2>  Step by step description of the process of creating an apple </h2><p>  We take the red thread and perform the magic ring.  In row number 1 we knit 6 sc.  In a row number 2 we make increases.  In all the loops of the base we knit 2 sc, we get 12 loops.  In row number 3, we make 1 sc in each vertex.  In row number 4, we use the pattern (2 sc in the loop, 1 sc in the next) 6 times.  We get 18 loops. </p><p>  In row number 5, we use the scheme (2 sc in a loop, in the next two - 1 sc in each loop) 6 times.  We get 24 columns.  In row number 6, repeat 6 times (2 sc in the loop, in the next 3 - 1 sc).  With increments, we count 30 columns.  In row number 7, we knit 1 sc in each vertex.  In row number 8, we repeat the pattern 6 times (2 sc in the loop, in the next 4 - 1 sc).  Checking yourself - you should get 36 columns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet vegetables and fruits patterns" class="if uuid-3034731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3034731.jpg"></div><p>  Rows from 9 to 12 are made with single crochet, one in each loop of the base.  In row number 13, we begin to make decreases.  We repeat the pattern six times (decrease, 1 sc in the next 4 loops).  We get 30 columns.  In row number 14, we knit 1 sc in all peaks.  In row number 15, repeat 6 times (decrease, 1 sc in the next 3 loops).  We count 24 columns.  In row number 16, we make one column at each vertex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In row number 17, we use the scheme 6 times (decrease, 1 sc in the next 2 loops).  Reduce the number of columns in the row to 18. In rows No. 18 and No. 19, we perform 1 sc in each loop.  In row number 20, repeat 6 times (decrease, 1 RLS in the next loop. We get 12 columns. Fill the apple with syntepuhe through the hole. In row number 21, we decrease 6 times. Cut the thread, leaving a long end (30 cm). Our apple is almost ready Now you know that crocheting vegetables and fruits with patterns and a good description turns into a simple and fairly quick process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetjune.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet vegetables and fruits" class="if uuid-3025609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3025609.jpg"></div><h2>  Finishing work on an apple </h2><p>  For the manufacture of cuttings we use knitting threads of a brown shade.  We carry out 7 VP and SP in the second loop from the tool.  We make 5 more joint ventures.  Cut the thread, leaving a long end.  We fix by threading the thread through the last loop. </p><p>  We take a needle with a big eye and insert a piece of thread remaining after knitting an apple into it.  Sew a hole on the top of the fruit.  We give the apple the correct shape: press the top with your finger, pass the needle down, stretch the thread into the initial ring and return to the top.  Repeat the procedure one or two times until a realistic shape is obtained.  We fix the thread. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It remains only to sew the stalk, also passing the thread down into the magic ring, and returning the needle to the top.  Repeating the procedure, you will get a neatly sewn stalk and "sepals" at the bottom.  This is how easy it is to crochet vegetables and fruits.  The apple scheme is convenient and understandable; use it in your work.  Good luck </p><h2>  Crochet vegetables and fruits.  Scheme and description of carrots </h2><p>  To create a bright carrot, you will need to prepare cotton yarn (with a density of 125 m per 50 g) of two colors - orange and green, hook No. 1.75 or No. 2, filler, needle, knitting markers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="engsidrun.spire.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet fruits and vegetables" class="if uuid-3028083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3028083.jpg"></div><p>  When describing the knitting process, the following abbreviations will be used: </p><ul><li>  RLS - SC; </li><li>  SP - connecting loop; </li><li>  increase - 2 sc in 1 loop of the base; </li><li>  decrease - 2 sc with a common top, knitted for the front half-loop. </li></ul><h2>  Step-by-step process description </h2><p>  Having prepared the necessary, proceed to crochet vegetables and fruits.  The scheme of carrots is as follows.  We execute a magic ring and 6 sc in orange thread.  In row number 2, we knit increases in all the loops of the base.  In row number 3, we use the scheme (1 sc, increase) 6 times.  We get 18 columns.  In row number 4, we knit 6 times, repeating the pattern (increase, 1 sc in 2 next loops).  We count 24 columns. </p><p>  Put the workpiece aside.  We take the green thread and draw up 10 VP.  Starting from the second loop, we knit 9 sc.  We fix the thread, cut it off, leaving a long tip.  Sew the leaf to the orange billet in the center, passing the threads down and tying them into a knot.  By analogy, we make several more such leaves (6-8) and return to the creation of carrots. </p><p>  In rows No. 5 - No. 9, in each loop of the base we perform 1 sc.  In row number 9, we knit 1 decrease and 22 sc.  We get 23 columns.  In row number 10, we perform 1 sc in each loop.  In a row number 11 we knit 12 RLS, 1 decrease and another 9 RLS.  In rows No. 12 and No. 13, we make 1 RLS at each vertex.  In row number 14, we knit 3 sc, 1 decrease and another 17 sc.  We fill the part with syntepuh and continue knitting. </p><h2>  Finishing work on carrots </h2><p>  In rows No. 15 and No. 16 we make 1 sc in all peaks.  In a row No. 17 we knit 13 RLS, 1 decrease and 6 RLS.  We count 20 columns.  In a row No. 18 and No. 19 we knit 1 sc in each vertex.  In row number 20 we do 6 sc, 1 decrease, 12 sc.  In rows No. 21 and No. 22 we knit 1 sc in each loop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hargaa.id" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pattern vegetables" class="if uuid-3028093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3028093.jpg"></div><p>  In row number 23 we do 15 scs, 1 decrease, 2 sc.  Checking yourself - you should get 18 loops.  In a row No. 24 and No. 25 we knit 1 sc in all the peaks.  In row number 26 we do 9 sc, 1 decrease and 7 sc.  We count 17 loops.  Add a little more filler to the workpiece. </p><p>  In rows No. 27 and No. 28 we knit 1 sc in all loops.  In row number 29 we make a decrease and 15 sc.  We count 16 loops.  In row number 30 we do 1 sc in all loops.  In row No. 31, we perform 11 RLS, a decrease and 3 RLS.  The carrots are almost ready. </p><p>  In row number 32, we knit 1 sc in all loops.  In row number 33 we do 3 scs, a decrease and 10 sc.  In row number 34, we knit 1 sc in all loops.  In row number 35, we perform 7 RLS, a decrease and 5 RLS.  We count 13 loops.  In row number 36, we make a decrease and 11 sc.  In row number 37, we use the scheme (1 RLS - decrease) 4 times.  We get 8 loops.  In row number 38, repeat twice (1 sc in the next two loops - decrease).  Add the required amount of filler.  You can cut and fasten the thread.  Congratulations, our bright carrot is ready!  See how crocheted vegetables and fruits are created easily and simply.  Remember knitting patterns and be sure to use them in your work.  I wish you creative success! </p><h2>  How to tie cabbage?  Another good idea piggy bank </h2><p>  For crocheting vegetables (cabbage) we will use green yarn (250 m thick per 100 g) and a 3 mm hook.  You will also need a filler, markers, scissors, a needle with a big eye. </p><div class="photo" data-original="petitspixels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet fruit and vegetable apple pattern" class="if uuid-3034646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3034646.jpg"></div><p>  First, we perform the "core" of cabbage.  We make a magic ring and 6 sc in it.  In row number 2, we knit increases to each vertex.  In row No. 3 we use the scheme 6 times (1 sc - increase).  In row number 4, repeat the pattern (1 sc in 2 loops, increase) 6 times.  We count 24 loops.  In row number 5, repeat 6 times (1 sc in 3 loops, increase).  We get 30 loops.  In rows No. 6 - No. 10 we knit 1 sc in each vertex. </p><p>  In row number 11 we use 6 times the scheme (1 sc in 3 loops, decrease).  We get 24 loops.  In row number 12, repeat 6 times (1 sc in 2 loops, decrease).  We count 18 loops.  We start our workpiece with filler.  In row number 13, repeat 6 times (1 sc, decrease).  In row number 14, we make 6 times decreases.  Cut the thread and drag the tip through the end loop.  Sew a hole and hide the ends. </p><h2>  We knit cabbage leaves and collect the product </h2><p>  We make small cabbage leaves according to the following scheme.  In row number 1 we make a magic ring and 6 sc.  In row number 2, we perform 3 VP, 1 C1H (column with 1 yarn) in the same loop.  Next, repeat 5 times (1 C1H, increase).  We close the joint venture to the top of the beginning chain.  In row number 3, we do 3 VPs, 1 1 in the same loop, repeat 11 times (1 1, increase).  Cut the thread and fasten.  By analogy, we knit another 7 of these leaves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.tinyrabbithole.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet vegetables and fruits pattern 2" class="if uuid-3028143" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3028143.jpg"></div><p>  We perform large leaves by analogy with small ones, but add another 1 row.  In row number 4, we knit 3 VP, draw in the next loop (1 1, increase), then we use the pattern 11 times (1 1 in the next 2 loops, increase).  We get 36 loops.  Done.  We knit a few more large leaves and proceed to assembly.  First, we sew small, and then large leaves to the core.  So our cabbage is ready!  She turned out very realistic and beautiful.  Hopefully, the crochet patterns of fruits and vegetables presented in this article have proven useful. </p>
