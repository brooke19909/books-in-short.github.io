    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The regional center belongs to the historical Volyn region and is located in the northwestern part of the country.  Rivne (Ukraine) celebrates the <span>day of the city</span> on the last August Sunday. </p><p>  1283 - the date of the first mention of the name of the settlement, which was part of the Principality of Galicia-Volyn.  But during excavations in the central part of Rivne, archaeologists discovered objects dating from the tenth century.  These are the remains of buildings, pottery, weapons.  It remains to find only the legendary arch, which flaunts on the arms of the city. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  So, we found out that the city of Rivne appeared on the map of Ukraine about a thousand years ago.  What does its name mean?  The first version says that it means the area on which the city is located - a lowland plain.  In documents of the early years occasionally, but there are other toponyms - Rivne, Rivne.  But there is another hypothesis, which states that in the past the city had powerful defensive ditches filled with water.  In support of this version, researchers cite the existence of a suburb called Zarovoye. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="exactly on the map of Ukraine" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/875462.jpg" width="600"></div>

He always had a favorable geographical position.  That is why in the course of history he repeatedly passed from hand to hand.  After the Mongol invasion and the collapse of the Galicia-Volyn principality, the city moved to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  In 1793, he became part of the Russian Empire, and in 1941 the Germans chose it as their center in Ukraine.  After the independence of Ukraine, Rivne became a regional center.  The modern city is beautiful, green, cozy and interesting in terms of attractions that are not only on the surface of the earth, but also under it. </p><h2>  Sights of Rivne </h2><p>  Rivne (Ukraine) is very interesting for tourists.  Its main attractions include: </p><ul><li>  Museum of Ukrainian Art; </li><li>  a monument to Princess Maria Rovnenskaya; </li><li>  a zoo operating since 1982; </li><li>  a monument to the soldiers who died for Ukraine; </li><li>  park them.  T. Shevchenko, spread out over an area of ‚Äã‚Äã30 hectares. </li></ul><p>  24 km from the regional center in the village of Klevan, which is ancient Rivne, is the famous <span>Tunnel of Love.</span>  An amazing miracle of nature, which is associated with the romantic legend of the Ukrainian Romeo and Juliet.  In Klevani you can also see the ruins of a 15th-century castle, a church (17th century) and a church (18th century). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the city is exactly Ukraine" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/875463.jpg" width="322"></div>

    <h2>  Catacombs </h2><p>  Rivne dungeons (Ukraine) is another attraction of the city, which, however, is very little studied.  Recently discovered moves are striking in their grandeur and complex system.  It is believed that it was them, some of which were found back in the sixties of the last century, that V. Korolenko described in "Children of the Underground". </p><p>  Local historians and enthusiasts suggest that underground passages, walls and caves are traces of the ancient city of Sureng, the former capital of Dulibia, the Slavic empire that existed from 250 to 832 years. </p><p>  The city of Sureng is mentioned in the book of Veles under the name Soreng.  Historians believe that before Kievan Rus on the territory of the Slavs there were tribal associations, which can be considered the first states.  A thorough analysis of the book of Veles and a detailed study of other written sources confirms this fact.  The death of the city happened in the middle of the 9th century, when Kiev began to rise.  Perhaps its causes are related to the plague epidemic, but perhaps it was destroyed by external forces.  So far this question remains a mystery. </p><p>  Here he is, a city on the Ustya River, surrounded by secrets and riddles! </p>
