Those very days and weeks of selfless rest and freedom.  Legitimate time in order to forget about the hated work, the bad boss, almost everything else, surrendering to the arms of the sea wave and the warm rays of the southern sun.  However, the question arises of where to go, what to see and where to relax so that you remember it, like it and not hit it hard in your pockets.  Turkey?  Yes, cheap, yes, good service, but what to do outside the hotel?  Thailand?  Dominican Republic?  In our dangerous times, not everyone will decide to go to distant lands, especially with children.  What to choose?  And Crimea remains.  The same peninsula of happiness and eternal celebration with numerous houses, hotels and camp sites, including, for example, the Mir camp site in Alushta, which we will talk about in more detail later. </p>

    <h2>  Crimea </h2><p>  Hotels, <span>pensions, motels,</span> beautiful promenades with bright lights and loud music, native speech around and an atmosphere of serenity.  Crimea can be treated differently, but there is no such person who would not remember this place.  It happens that someone arrives and unsuccessfully chooses a vacation spot.  He comes across violent neighbors, and in a cafe by the beach they deceived a couple of hundred rubles, and that‚Äôs all - this poor man becomes a walking anti-advertisement of domestic resorts.  Others come in families of 10 and 20 years in the same place and can not imagine life without the Crimean mountains and the Black Sea with corn on the beach.  What is the reason?  Obviously, in a place of rest and, accordingly, in the people who work and live there.  This can be ‚Äúplanned‚Äù in advance by booking a hotel room.  For example, at the Mir camp site in Alushta.  Reviews about this place are not at all difficult to find.  However, they will help to understand who is suitable for relaxing here, what are the strengths and weaknesses of the camp site and whether it is possible to relax in such a place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  the south coast of Crimea </h2><p>  <span>The southern coast of Crimea,</span> or simply South Coast, is one of the most popular destinations.  Yalta can be considered a year-round resort.  After all, the winter Crimea is no less beautiful, but much calmer and cheaper, and the sea can replace a warm pool in the open sunny sky.  This part of the peninsula is sung in songs and poems.  Brodsky wrote about Yalta. A. Chekhov and L. Tolstoy lived here.  The emperors built their palaces here and spent a lot of time enjoying the beauties of nature and the wonderful climate. </p><p>  Yalta is the most famous and expensive resort in the Crimea.  Luxurious hotels, palaces, attractions, mountains, palm trees, coniferous forests, the sea and a subtropical climate made this cozy city the Russian Riviera.  In summer, Yalta increases so much that its population is almost a million people - tourists from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and other countries are eager to come here.  Before Crimea became an apple of discord between the two fraternal countries, international festivals, sports, concerts with the participation of world stars of show business took place here, and in the areas of mountain serpentine, a rally was held every year with the participation of legendary racers.  All this made Yalta one of the most expensive places in the Crimea.  However, who is stopping to relax in the cities adjacent to Yalta?  For example, in Alushta.  The nature here is still subtropical, the mountains are high, the sea is blue, <span>the recreation centers are</span> comfortable, but most importantly, the prices.  They no longer bite so much. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Holiday Prices </h2><p>  Prices, of course, depend on the time of year and even the month of summer.  In July and August, as a rule, the cost is higher for everything.  Prices at the Mir camp site in Alushta are among the most affordable on the South Coast.  In addition, various discounts are constantly available here.  For example, the cheapest option - a house without amenities in the velvet season or in the spring will cost only 400-500 rubles.  The price does not include meals and other services.  In the summer, such a house will cost almost 550 rubles.  And the most expensive option - a single cabin with amenities - will result in 1200-1500 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  The Mir camp site in Alushta, Crimea collects the most controversial reviews.  And unfortunately, most of them cannot be called positive.  People complain about the lack of amenities and repairs in the houses.  Some compare them to chicken coops.  There are also reviews and complaints that hot water is not always available at the base, and the administration is often not ready to solve the problems that arise.  There is no service as such at the Mir camp site in Alushta, despite the fact that sometimes you can see reviews in which people praise the maids.  In addition to frankly bad comments, you can see satisfied holiday-makers praising the local nature, the sea, the location of the boarding house, paths and local food surrounded by greenery.  Thus, there are two types of people: the first - disappointed by the rest in this place, the second - those who say the following words: "If in the Crimea - only at the Mir camp site.  The choice is yours. </p>
