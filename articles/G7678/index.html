Here we come for a walk after work, breathe air on weekends, play with children.  There are cities where there are a lot of parks and squares, but <span>in Khabarovsk there</span> is little choice.  Therefore, it is advisable to know well about those that are.  Today we‚Äôll talk about North Park.  Khabarovsk is gradually ennobled, like many cities of Russia.  This also applies to walking areas, so the park today is not the same as the older generation remembers it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="northern park Khabarovsk" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1945257.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For walks and more </h2><p>  The Northern Park (Khabarovsk) was only shady alleys where it is so good to spend time on a hot day.  Of course, it is very beautiful.  But there was absolutely nothing more to do here.  Today, a family ecopark with a children's entertainment center is being built on the territory.  This makes your stay here even more interesting.  Let's talk about everything in order. </p><h2>  How can I get to </h2><p>  Northern Park (Khabarovsk) is located in the corresponding microdistrict.  You can get to it by public transport.  For example, from the bus station - 11, 23, 35, 4 or 71 routes.  Buses run regularly, so the waiting time will not exceed a few minutes.  You need to get to the stop "Technical University".  From there you will have to walk about 600 meters to the park gate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It‚Äôs even more convenient to travel by car.  To do this, you can drive along Saltykov-Shchedrin Street or Pacific.  On both sides there are convenient entrances and parking lots where you can leave your personal transport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Park North Khabarovsk photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1945258.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What's interesting here </h2><p>  Northern Park (Khabarovsk) is surrounded by greenery.  Trees, unique shrubs, flower beds and flowers - at the height of summer, it is fantastically beautiful.  There is a cascade of ponds in the square where you can admire ducks of various breeds and watch fish.  Since last year, a unique service has been opened for lovers of sitting on the shore with a fishing rod.  Paid fishing costs <span>500 rubles</span> for 3 hours.  If you want to take a husband and children for a walk at the same time, then a lesson has already been found for the man - he will surely be waiting for you on the shore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle in the park northern Khabarovsk" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1945259.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Walk with children </h2><p>  Severny Park (Khabarovsk), the photo of which we provide in the article, today has become an ideal entertainment center.  For children there is a free playground with slides and carousels.  It is small, but is popular.  All slides and labyrinths are free, but there is also an interesting addition.  We are talking about paid inflatable towns and trampolines.  Calculate your free time, because pulling children out of the playground in an hour is almost impossible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to take time </h2><p>  While all the other family members are having fun, you can try to catch a successful shot.  Severny Park (Khabarovsk) is one of the most successful places for photo shoots.  And not only ordinary selfie near the flowerbed.  Often you can see themed photo shoots, and even a real costume show.  Wedding photoshoots are especially often held here - picturesque landscapes are ideal for this. </p><h2>  Wedding Palace </h2><p>  Field check-in takes place here.  This service is not cheap, but it will be unforgettable.  A real palace courtyard with carved gates and a beautiful walkway, a hall and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãflowers decorated with delicate paintings.  The architectural style of the palace evokes mixed feelings.  Very beautiful, but too expensive and artsy.  But still there is no better place for holiday photos.  There are several arbors and sculptures around the palace: a white carriage, angels and fountains.  And squirrels walk fearlessly here, there are a lot of them in these places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Park North Khabarovsk how to get there" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1945261.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Playground with wooden sculptures </h2><p>  It is located just above the ponds.  They appeared as a result of the competition in 2011.  After the announcement of the results, she remained as a decoration of the park.  The sculptures depict the heroes of various fairy tales.  They are very well executed and most visitors consider it their duty to take pictures with them.  Of course, over the years, the figures have changed a bit, some of them have cracks, others have broken off some details, but on the whole they remained in good shape. </p><h2>  Temple of Seraphim of Sarov </h2><p>  There is a completely unique place in the park.  Typically, holy springs are located outside the city, on the territory of the monasteries, and here you have the opportunity to draw water directly for a walk in the park.  Of course, this only makes sense to believers.  The temple of Seraphim of Sarov was laid here in 2003.  The white-stone structure with a golden dome looks very impressive, especially on a sunny day. </p>

    <h2>  Fairytale castle in North Park </h2><p>  Khabarovsk is waiting for another pleasant surprise.  A magnificent castle is being built right on the territory of the park, which seems to have come down from the pages of a fairy tale today.  Surrounded by a fortress wall, it looks solemn and unusual.  A wall of stone will frame the main entrance.  And what‚Äôs most interesting is an exact copy of a medieval building.  During the construction, heavy, wooden beams and severe masonry, drawbridge will be used. </p><h2>  Fun in the castle </h2><p>  Near the castle, guests will be waiting for a lot of interesting things.  This is an arena for holding knightly tournaments, decorated with a fountain.  In addition, a picnic area for family holidays and cooking meat on the grill will be split in the surrounding area.  The project is not limited to this.  An eco-park is building a climbing wall and a rope park where guests can go in for sports.  Here they also lay a football field and attractions, as well as a unique race track where you can learn the rules of the road.  So far this is all and much more is only in the project, but soon the residents of the city will be able to see its implementation.  We are sure that all residents will want to visit this castle after the construction is completed.  Most likely, guest visitors will come even from nearby settlements, which will quickly recover costs. </p><h2>  Where to eat </h2><p>  But there are no eateries in the park yet.  There are only small points of ready-made food where you can buy ice cream, pizza, mini-barbecue.  The choice of drinks is much larger, but their cost here is not too attractive.  Cafes in the Northern Park of Khabarovsk will appear when the castle construction project is completed.  On its territory it is planned to place a whole zone allocated for foodcore.  Here you can drink coffee with cake or dine thoroughly.  In the meantime, going for a walk, do not forget the bread for the ducks and a few sandwiches for yourself.  A walk in the fresh air arouses appetite. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Northern Park is today beloved by the townspeople and visited throughout the warm season.  With the completion of the construction project, the number of guests is planned to increase several times.  It is not only beautiful, but also very fun.  Children can play a lot, and parents can sit quietly in the shade of trees and enjoy the picturesque scenery. </p>
