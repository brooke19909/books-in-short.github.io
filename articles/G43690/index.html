Among them, there are DX-models and FX.  They differ among themselves in that the latter received full-frame sensors from the manufacturer.  Optics must be sought depending on the size of the sensor.  This is due to the fact that on DX-type cameras, ultra-wide-angle devices, unfortunately, will not be able to provide the desired viewing angle.  In the article, we will consider the most suitable <span>wide-angle lenses</span> for Nikon. </p><h2>  Sigma 10-20 / 3,5 </h2><p>  The described lens received excellent characteristics, high build quality and good functionality from its manufacturer.  The average cost of optics is $ 400.  The lens differs from its competitors in that it has a large aperture, and the image stabilization option is missing.  From the huge range of ultra-wide-focus devices that Sigma offers, this one has a low cost, it is larger and much better in quality.  The optics diaphragm received seven blades.  The ring type zoom, it is silent.  By dimensions, the model is an impressive size, has a special thread for the filter.  Its diameter is 82 mm.  Optics received a high level of sharpness and contrast, and these indicators are the most uniform in all tricks.  Edging is controlled perfectly, distortion is almost imperceptible.  This optics is quite successful for those who are just starting to take pictures or are already an amateur.  The ratio of quality and cost is the most profitable.  If you need to choose a wide-angle lens for Nikon, then it is better to pay attention to this particular model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wide angle lenses for nikon" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1703929.jpg" width="500"></div>

Due to the high viewing angle, the lens makes it possible to use special functions and options that are available in more professional devices at a minimum distance.  Built-in ring zoom, optics provides a high level of sharpness.  Especially the latter prevails in the center of the photos, even if the focal length is minimal.  The feedback from the lens owners makes it clear that distortion is well controlled.  By the way, the latter is often a minus of such a technique.  There is no stabilizer, the diaphragm is malfunctioning.  However, if the viewing angle is perfectly selected, then the lens shows itself only from the best side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wide angle lens for nikon d3100" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1703930.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Sigma 8-16 / 4,5-5,6 </h2><p>  Another great device from the Sigma manufacturer.  This model is the best wide-angle lens for Nikon.  It was distinguished by low zoom (double), however, it has a large viewing angle, and autofocus is as smooth as possible.  The bulk of the optics from the manufacturer may seem similar to the classic technique.  Especially when it comes to price, technology and specifications.  This model is worth paying attention to everyone who needs wide-angle optics.  Even with the fact that the zoom is minimal, at high focal lengths there is a noticeable difference in the review.  This is an advantage of this model.  The lens itself was distinguished by its large size, it is long.  The hood is available directly in the housing, due to which impressive dimensions were obtained.  The zoom ring works fine, the focus system also.  Build at a great level.  The only drawback is that distortion can be observed at the end of the range.  But if we consider the model as a device with an excellent viewing angle and good quality, this lens has no equal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inexpensive wide angle lens for nikon" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1703931.jpg" width="600"></div>

Its mass was about 1 kg.  This was influenced by a constant aperture value.  The optics built-in motor is quiet and runs smoothly.  The same can be said about auto focus, the functioning of the zoom.  If you compare this model with others that were produced by this manufacturer, then it should be noted - it is one of the best.  What distinguishes this optics from competitors of its own manufacturer?  The presence of a mechanism that allows you to switch between automatic and manual focus.  It is connected directly to the ring.  Reading the reviews of the owners, we can conclude that such a solution is the most successful and correct.  This eliminates unnecessary waste of time on long switching.  The lens provides the most favorable quality of photos that a professional creates.  In the center there is sharpness, there is a special edging.  However, some believe that the angles could be a little sharper.  The hood is built-in, so you can always avoid glare and ghosting.  But because of it, you can not use filters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="choose wide angle lens for nikon" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1703932.jpg" width="559"></div>

    <h2>  Tokina AT-X Pro 12-28 / 4 DX C </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the lens has a focal length of 12 cm, it can not be called wide-angle.  However, he still received such a title.  Optics offers a fairly extensive zoom.  It also allows you to shoot in any conditions, which makes it universal.  The lens is reliable and has a silent motor.  Buyers specify that the device lacks a manual control method.  Moreover, there is no special mechanism that would help to switch quickly in focus modes.  If the zoom is minimal, slight distortion may appear.  At long distances - they are absent.  Sharpness is high, but not enough to surpass the previous model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best wide angle lens for nikon" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1703933.jpg" width="587"></div>

    <h2>  Nikon AF-S 18-35 / 3.5-4.5 </h2><p>  This model is an inexpensive <span>wide</span> - <span>angle lens for Nikon.</span>  Optics has a variable aperture.  It alone is much smaller and cheaper.  What does the photographer lose at the same time?  The angle of view has changed slightly.  This already hints that the audience of the lens is amateurs and beginners.  Build quality at a high level.  Vibrations are practically absent, but in general, optics do not suppress them.  The coating of the device is complex, which allows you to get rid of unnecessary scratches and mechanical damage.  When shooting, glare does not appear.  Owners make it clear that aberrations are controlled well, so there are no complaints.  In addition, for a cheap device, such indicators are more than enough.  Small details are visible well, even if they are located on the edge.  Sharpness at a short zoom distance is a little disappointing.  Some wide-angle lenses for Nikon have better options. </p><h2>  Nikon AF-S 14-24 / 2.8 </h2><p>  The lens may surprise some with its size, but the performance is at a good level.  This optics is useful for mirror and full-format devices.  Even with the fact that the lens cannot offer a wide viewing angle, one way or another, it provides excellent photo quality, without aberration and the slightest distortion.  This optics will cost dearly.  It costs about $ 1,500.  The reviews confirm that the wide-angle Nikon F lens (the rival of the described model) is much smaller, the same - larger.  The front lens is very arched.  For her, you will have to purchase a special hood, which is similar in shape to a petal.  Thanks to it, glare will not appear.  Autofocus is fast than all Nikon wide-angle lenses can boast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon f wide angle lens" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1703934.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tamron 15-30 / 2.8 </h2><p>  The last lens in the review is not too wide, but it has the necessary dimensions to get the appropriate title.  The zoom optics are powerful and have an impressive aperture.  The design is not afraid of moisture, it received a good build quality and as a result gives beautiful pictures.  Autofocus is quiet, smooth and fast.  All wide-angle lenses for Nikon have similar characteristics. </p>
