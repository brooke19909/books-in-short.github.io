    <h2>  Personal actions </h2><p>  UUD is usually divided into four types.  The first category includes personal educational universal actions.  They provide the semantic and value orientation of students.  Pupils learn moral standards, learn to correlate events and actions with ethical principles, realize the meaning and significance of morality, try to try on social roles that they further master in interpersonal relationships. </p><p>  In this category, it is customary to distinguish three types of personal actions.  The first includes life, professional, and personal self-determination.  To the second - meaning formation.  In accordance with the GEF, this is the name of the establishment by schoolchildren of a connection between the motive of study, its purpose, results and prospects.  Meaningment manifests itself if children think about the importance of education for them and are able to answer the question of what it means to them. </p><p>  The third type includes moral and ethical orientation - one of the most important personal components that affects the moral attitude of the child. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Regulatory action </h2><p>  They must also be mentioned.  Educational universal actions related to this category provide schoolchildren with the organization of their educational activities. </p><p>  Take, for example, goal setting.  It implies the student‚Äôs ability to set a learning task.  The goal-setting in this situation is based on the correlation of the studied with the unknown. </p><p>  Regulatory training universal activities also include planning.  A person who knows how to determine the sequence of intermediate goals and draw up a certain ‚Äúorientation‚Äù for their achievement may have great prospects in the future. </p><p>  The same category of actions includes forecasting, the ability to control their activities, adjust and adequately evaluate it.  And of course, one cannot forget about self-regulation.  It is much easier to develop and improve educational universal actions if a person is able to use his will, as well as mobilize his energy and strength.  However, teachers and parents should teach all this to children.  Without showing interest and working on oneself, the makings of even the most useful qualities and skills ‚Äúfade away‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Cognitive activities </h2><p>  This is the third category.  It should be noted by attention, telling about universal educational actions on GEF.  Teachers should actively contribute to the development of cognitive skills of their students.  These include general educational and logical abilities, as well as the formulation and subsequent solution of the problem. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The teacher is obliged to develop in children the ability to independently identify and formulate a cognitive goal, find the necessary information, structure the knowledge gained, consciously and competently build speech, meaningfully read. </p><p>  In the process of obtaining education, students receive new universal learning activities.  They become able to analyze and synthesize, establish causal relationships, build a logical chain of reasoning, prove the correctness of their words, put forward and substantiate hypotheses, formulate problems and independently create ways to solve them.  All of these actions, children learn to carry out in the classroom.  After all, lessons are the main pedagogical tool for implementing the requirements of the Federal State Educational Standard. </p>

    <h2>  Communicative actions </h2><p>  Each person carries them almost from birth.  After all, people are social beings.  Many universal educational activities are communicative in nature. </p><p>  Take, for example, planning cooperation between the teacher and the students.  Together they determine the goals and functions of the participants, choose methods of interaction.  Collectively seek and collect information, identify and identify problems, look for ways to solve them.  In ambiguous situations, the ability to control and correct the opponent‚Äôs behavior is manifested. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, in the process of obtaining education, children master the dialogical and monological forms of speech.  These skills also include universal training activities on GEF.  During the course of schooling, children must master the norms of their native language. </p><h2>  About the formation of UUD </h2><p>  All of the above skills, abilities and qualities do not arise from scratch.  The formation of universal educational activities is a complex process carried out and controlled by teachers. </p><p>  Their goal is to provide their pupils with assistance in the process of mastering all the <span>components of educational activity.</span>  Each child under their guidance should become a person with the basics of moral behavior and general learning skills.  This is the model of a graduate of primary school, declared by the requirements of GEF. </p>

    <h2>  results </h2><p>  The successfully implemented program of universal educational activities is favorably reflected in the level of development of children.  They gain the ability to learn independently, set goals for themselves, seek and apply information for completing tasks, control the process, and give an adequate assessment of the results. </p><p>  UUD - these are the skills that need to be laid in all elementary school lessons.  No wonder the founder of scientific pedagogy Konstantin Dmitrievich Ushinsky said that every lesson should be a goal for the teacher.  Pupils must constantly improve, and learn something new in all lessons, without exception. </p><h2>  About the process </h2><p>  Now we can talk a little bit about how the universal educational actions in the lessons are carried out.  There are tons of methods.  But the most popular is the use of intellectual games.  After all, we are talking about elementary grades.  And they learn children who are still at the age when they want to have fun. </p><p>  The game is a powerful means of socializing the child, contributing to the development of empathy, reflection, the ability to look at oneself from the outside.  What UDD can be developed in children by this method?  Variety.  The formation of the ability to think associatively contributes to the game "Association".  The point is simple.  The teacher calls one word, and the children begin to name what they associate with it. </p><p>  Then the principle becomes more complicated.  The teacher lists several words at once, and the children should distribute them into two groups, each of which is characterized by a particular feature.  The row may be: cat, sofa, dog, parrot, table, wardrobe, drawer, dolphin, chair.  In this case, the students will distinguish two groups, in one of which they will bring animals, and in the other - furniture.  And this is just one such example.  In fact, intellectual games exist in large numbers, which cannot but rejoice.  After all, each lesson for children can become diverse and at the same time informative. </p>

    <h2>  Specifics and problems </h2><p>  It is important to note that in our time the development of universal educational activities is not carried out as before.  There are many reasons for this. </p><p>  Gradually, pre-school activities lose their relevance - they are replaced by educational activities.  Because of what in the lives of children there is a completely miserable plot and role-playing game aspect.  A preschooler learns the motivational sphere too early.  And this is not good, since first the child must form a psychological readiness for educational activity. </p><p>  First of all, modern parents should understand this.  Who are accustomed to focus on mental development, forgetting about the spiritual and moral component. </p><p>  The awareness of children has also grown.  Also, the Internet has supplanted literary reading, which is very bad.  It is very difficult for non-reading children to master the method of semantic analysis of texts, to develop imagination and logical thinking.  Many preschoolers become intellectually passive, because they have unlimited access to the World Wide Web, and if you need to find out something, they don‚Äôt study, they just look for it in an online search. </p>

    <h2>  Teacher Tasks </h2><p>  The teacher has countless goals.  He must draw the attention of the students to the developing value of all the tasks that they perform.  He also needs to prove the need to acquire this or that knowledge, to assure children of its usefulness and practicality.  It is advisable for the teacher to interest students in discovering new knowledge, developing memory, and conducting extracurricular activities for self-development. </p><p>  In addition, the teacher attracts pupils to participate in various events and collective creative affairs, encourages their initiative, always provides an opportunity to correct a mistake.  And that‚Äôs not even 1/10 of what a teacher does.  Therefore, highly qualified teachers are priceless.  After all, they do not just implement the requirements of GEF - they help children grow up worthy and competent individuals with perspectives. </p>
