    <h2>  Security </h2><p>  The territory of the complex is fenced, is under round-the-clock security, equipped with a video surveillance system.  The developer made sure that every resident of the complex felt as safe as possible.  Moreover, the houses are equipped with a modern fire alarm system, so there is no reason for concern. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  For the implementation of the project, Vsevolozhsk district was selected.  New buildings will appear near the metro station "Ladozhskaya".  Convenient transport interchanges, public transport stops - all this will allow residents of the Yaninsky Cascade complex to easily reach anywhere in the city.  And do not be embarrassed by the proximity to the Ring Road.  Residents will not care about the noise from the street, because the "green filter" - a wall of centuries-old green spaces separates from the busy highway with a very dense traffic of the new building.  The complex itself is literally immersed in greenery, because it is surrounded on all sides by trees, shrubs, which makes the air literally filled with oxygen.  The first stage project has already been completed.  So, the inhabitants of his houses note that breathing here is especially easy: so clean and fresh air. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Architectural solution </h2><p>  LCD "Yaninsky Cascade" impresses with its architectural solution.  The light facades of new buildings with panoramic glazing combined with a variable number of storeys of buildings helped the developer to get away from the boring and nobody-interesting concept of the "anthill", where neighbors prevent each other from enjoying a comfortable life.  The use of modern technologies and high-quality materials allowed to achieve the highest construction speed. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Vsevolozhsk district was chosen for the construction of the Yaniskiy Cascade residential complex is not by chance.  This is the center of the active life of modern residents of the metropolis.  Take the whole family and go for a walk through the woods, on a picnic, riding bicycles.  Breathes here in a special way.  Residents of the complex emphasize that there is no such clean and fresh air in any other point in the city. </p>

    <p>  At the moment, the architecture of the microdistrict is quite developed.  Residents of new buildings note that during the commissioning of the first stage houses they experienced a shortage of shops, but today the situation has changed radically.  Excellent shopping and entertainment complexes are being built in the immediate vicinity, as new facilities are commissioned, new venues and recreation areas, sports grounds, and stadiums appear.  The district clinic works, according to the residents' opinions, pretty good.  For car owners, a four-story parking is intended. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  The layout of the Yaninsky Cascade is of interest to potential buyers of real estate no less than other components.  Novoselov is waiting for more than one and a half thousand apartments with modern planning solutions.  All residents of the first stage houses managed to appreciate the spaciousness of the apartments.  Yaninsky Cascade-2 was also commissioned in 2015.  Almost all apartments have already been sold out.  That is why, if you are still counting on an apartment in a picturesque area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSt. Petersburg, pay attention to the Yaninsky Kaskad-3 residential complex.  You should hurry, because the number of free apartments every day only decreases.  Want to get acquainted with the planning decisions of the Yaninsky Cascade-3? </p>
