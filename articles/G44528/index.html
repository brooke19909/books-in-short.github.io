  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Successful socialization of preschool children as a result of competent interaction between the family and the preschool institution</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern scientists understand socialization as a continuous process, as a result of which the individual is included in various kinds of relations between people.  They make a person dependent on society.  The formation of the social development of an individual lies in the assimilation by her of universal human experience, namely, knowledge, skills, and in using them in her work.  And also in public life. </p><p>  Successful socialization of preschoolers is associated with such concepts as ‚Äúeducation‚Äù, ‚Äúeducation‚Äù, ‚Äúupbringing‚Äù, ‚Äúdevelopment of a harmonious personality of a child‚Äù.  These processes become complete only if they are focused.  The formation of childhood sociogenesis is a very specific moment, which requires the direct influence of adults.  Their specially organized activities make it possible to accompany the formation of the child as a person with his own opinions and beliefs, which makes this process complex.  The socialization of preschoolers arises not only in the family, but also in <span>preschool institutions</span> during the processes of upbringing, education and development of a harmonious personality of a child.  <span>Religious organizations</span> and countercultural groups, which have completely different goals and objectives, can also influence a small person. </p><p>  Socialization in kindergarten is a specially organized process during which children get to know and master the existing reality of the world around them.  A competent pedagogical work of a preschool educational institution is capable of ensuring its favorable course, which allows you to organize the continuity and continuity of all stages of the child‚Äôs familiarization with human life.  <span>The socialization of children</span> has as its ultimate goal the formation of their readiness to enter into interpersonal relations and their further development of culture.  Readiness is understood as desires, abilities and abilities of a child. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Currently, the problem of socialization of preschool children is given special attention.  Psychologists and educators are studying issues related to the harmonious development of the personality of children and parenting in the family, which directly affect their ability to join the reality of the world.  And they also lay the foundations of social competence that allow this process to proceed in the most optimal way.  It is these characteristics that will allow a person to be successful in all of his main activities in the future.  Currently, <span>social competence</span> is understood as the ability of a child to satisfy needs through interaction with the outside world on the basis of socially acceptable ways of realizing his activity. </p><p>  According to L.S.  Vygotsky, the child is initially a social being, as it directly depends on the people around him, in the first stages - from parents and other family members, and after that - from educators and teachers.  This is a fundamentally significant fact for the activities of the <span>DOE.</span>  <span>The kindergarten teacher</span> acts as a kind of cultural model for a small person.  Successful socialization of preschoolers will depend on the literacy of the work of the teacher.  Since he acts as a direct role model.  The meaning of success is considered in the context of the creative socialization of the child and his individualization, the ability in the conditions of constantly changing being to create not only himself, but also a new culture.  And also to join spiritual and material values.  The ability to create culture is based on the formation of universal human abilities, based on the knowledge and assimilation of knowledge, skills.  It is they who become the basis for the inclusion of a small person in society. </p><p>  <span>V.T.</span>  <span>Kudryavtseva</span> notes that the process of creating culture should not be understood as the creation of new things or ideas, but as the realization of a creative imagination, the ability to focus on the position of other people, randomness, mastering common ways of working with things and objects, mastering the elements of reflection, building a sensual picture of the world and the formation of universal forms of thinking and moral attitudes towards their own kind. </p><p>  The basic characteristics of a child‚Äôs successful socialization are: competence, initiative, creativity, the arbitrariness of mental processes and behavior in general, responsibility, independence, security, developed self-awareness, freedom of behavior, and the ability to adequately self-esteem. </p><p>  In the upbringing and development of a small person, as well as in the acquisition of his social experience, the family plays a crucial role.  It is in the family, which is the primary institution of upbringing, that the socialization of preschoolers proceeds naturally and painlessly.  Its formation is based on the <span>continuity of generations.</span> </p><p>  Experts have repeatedly proved the fact that the family and kindergarten ensure the integrity and completeness of the cultural, educational and socio-pedagogical environment for the development and self-realization of the child.  The successful interaction of the family and the Kindergarten is based on competent and harmonious complementarity of each other, and not on duplication and replacement of socially significant functions of one educational institution with another. </p>
