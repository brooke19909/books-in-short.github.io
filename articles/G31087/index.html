What kind of program is this, how profitable is it, and does it make sense to spend time registering with it?  Let's look at all the conditions of participation together, and then you decide whether you need these bonuses or not. </p><p>  “Thank you from Sberbank” acts as a bonus program, under which for each purchase that is paid by card, points are awarded to customers' bonus accounts under the name “Thank you”.  In the first three months, their value, as a rule, is one and a half percent of the purchase price, and in the subsequent 0.5%.  When paying for goods with partners, accrued points can reach up to 20% of the money spent.  The article describes in detail where you can pay "Thank you from Sberbank" and the conditions for calculating bonuses. </p><h2>  Who can become a member of the program? </h2><p>  This bonus program today applies to absolutely all cards issued by Sberbank, with the exception of Maestro.  If there are several of them, then “Thank you” is credited to a single account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sravni.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where can I pay thanks from Sberbank" class="if uuid-3177981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3177981.jpg"></div><h2>  Features and conditions </h2><p>  In order to become a participant in the program under consideration and to understand that it is possible to pay “Thank you from Sberbank”, you need to register in it through an ATM.  It can also be done through the Mobile Bank.  And also through Sberbank Online. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As part of registration through the terminal, the owner of the plastic needs to insert a card into the device, enter the code, and then select the section called “Bonus program”, indicating the mobile number in the appropriate form and confirm his agreement with the existing program rules.  After that, an SMS with a password will come to the specified phone.  You will need it to contact the banking contact center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="riafan.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what can I pay with points thanks from Sberbank" class="if uuid-3177987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3177987.jpg"></div><p>  When registering through the Internet bank, you must enter the system, and then select the option “My bonuses” in the menu, enter the mobile number and email address in the form that appears on the screen.  Further, as in the first case, the holders receive an SMS message with a password for further communication with the contact center of a financial organization.  Connection, just like participation in the program, is absolutely free and no commission is charged. </p><p>  The third option involves the use of a mobile bank.  To do this, send a message to number 900, in which to write the following text: “Thank you ****”, where **** are the last four digits of the card number.  In response, a code comes in, which must also be sent to the specified number. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But where can I pay with “Thanks from Sberbank” bonuses?  We will clarify further. </p><h2>  Using Sberbank Online </h2><p>  Customers can track the total points accumulated using the Internet.  This option is available in the Sberbank Online system.  The link to the page with the program for bonuses is in the personal menu on the left.  On this page you can register in the "Thank you" program.  For this, you also need to specify a phone number with an email address, and then agree to the rules.  After that, the client will receive a message with a password.  If you have a Momentum card, you can connect to the system at least five days after receiving the appropriate plastic. </p><h2>  How can I find out my balance? </h2><p>  Before you find out where you can pay “Thank you from Sberbank”, you need to find out the number of points awarded.  There are only three ways to carry out a check.  First of all, you can find out through the information terminal.  There you need to select a special section called the “Bonus Program”.  Here, customers who often use Internet banking can easily find accrued bonuses in their personal account. </p><p>  And finally, you can find out your balance by using a mobile phone.  To do this, send an SMS, in which to write "9" to the number 6470 (the request is free).  Next comes the answer about the number of points awarded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nsb.lk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where can I pay with points thanks from Sberbank" class="if uuid-3177985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3177985.jpg"></div><h2>  Using bonuses </h2><p>  When using points, the question arises: "How much can I pay" Thanks from Sberbank "?  Partner stores accept up to ninety-nine percent of total purchases in the form of bonuses.  In the event that the account has three hundred points, then, having bought products at Pyaterochka for the same amount, the client will pay only one ruble.  The remaining amount will be written off due to bonuses.  Each store has rules with nuances for the use of points, in connection with this you need to clarify this in advance on the website of Sberbank, or ask employees of institutions.  When a person specified whether a certain store accepts bonus payments, what percentage of the amount they can pay and knows how many points are on his account, he can safely pay for the purchase and save money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.barclays.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where you can pay with bonuses thanks from Sberbank" class="if uuid-3177979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3177979.jpg"></div><h2>  What do we have to do? </h2><p>  This requires the following: </p><ol><li>  At the checkout, warn the seller that there is an intention to pay part of the purchase price with “Thank you” points. </li><li>  It is necessary to clarify whether it is required to write off absolutely all bonuses or only part of them. </li><li>  Then they give the card to the seller, and he, in turn, pays with points.  The rest is paid in cash (whether cash or cashless). </li><li>  You also need to remember to check if the funds were debited instead of bonuses. </li></ol><h2>  Is it possible to pay “Thanks from Sberbank” for a purchase via the Internet? </h2><p>  Online stores that allow such a calculation are, first of all, Euroset and MTS.  They accept points for payment on the site, and with those in offices.  Such partners also include Ozon along with Technopark, Online Tickets, LitRes and so on.  The list of companies can always be clarified on the official website of the bank.  Thus, you can pay “Thank you from Sberbank” anywhere, including via the Internet.  In order to pay for the purchase using points in the online store, the following is required: </p><ol><li>  Marked goods that need to be purchased (they are sent to the buyer's basket). </li><li>  At the next payment step, the option "Pay with bonus points" is selected. </li><li>  Next, the operation is confirmed.  Points are deducted as payment.  Do not forget that part of the amount is paid with money from the card. <div class="photo" data-original="www.newsbtc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Can I pay thanks from Sberbank" class="if uuid-3177982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3177982.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  About program partners </h2><p>  <span>What</span> can I pay with “Thanks from Sberbank” bonuses?  To date, the partners of the program in question are over one hundred large companies, including regional and federal retail chains along with online stores.  Partners who have a total of more than ten thousand outlets throughout the country can purchase goods with services in such categories as, for example, mobile devices and digital technology, railway and airline tickets.  In addition, you can buy beauty and health products from these companies at a discount, along with jewelry, clothes and shoes, construction and decoration materials, and so on. </p><h2>  Competitor Programs </h2><p>  Promsvyazbank (the bonus system is called PSBonus), TKS-Bank (“Bravo”), Absolut Bank (“Honorary Customers”) and other organizations have similar loyalty programs.  The greatest demand among customers, as a rule, are affiliate programs and airlines.  For example, when making purchases on cards, consumers are given bonus miles, which can be exchanged for airline tickets.  Next, we will examine in detail where the described bonuses are applicable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shorelinecards.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thanks from Sberbank how much can I pay" class="if uuid-3177986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3177986.jpg"></div><h2>  “Thank you from Sberbank” points: where can I pay? </h2><p>  In the event that a person is accustomed to visiting specific establishments, and at the same time to shop at your favorite store, you need to see if there are any familiar names in the list of partners for which you can pay with these bonus points.  They can be used in completely different ways, for example: </p><ol><li>  In many restaurants and cafes.  The partner of the program in question is a food network called Burger King.  If a person is used to having a snack there or visits on weekends with his family, he can pay for the meal with corresponding points. </li><li>  In various supermarkets.  People go to grocery supermarkets, buying food every day.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that Pyaterochka acts as a partner of the described program, however, it accepts payment of points only in some large cities in stores at specific specified addresses. </li><li>  You can spend such bonuses in a clothing store.  Many branded stores accept "Thank you" for paying for such brands as Kari, "Daughters-Son", Zenden, Baon, Oodji, Finn Flare. </li><li>  You can also watch a movie.  For example, a cinema network called Kinomax is also a partner of the program. </li><li>  Bonuses are used to pay for purchases in Euroset (as part of the purchase of a phone or accessories for various gadgets). </li><li>  In MTS salons, you can top up your phone account with the appropriate bonuses from Sberbank. </li><li>  Many online stores accept payment with such bonuses. </li><li>  Some pharmacies with gas stations are partners, but this does not apply to popular and well-known institutions. </li></ol><p>  Above, we listed places and situations where you can pay "Thank you from Sberbank."  The list of shops for ordinary people may actually seem meager, but this is not a reason to refuse to participate in such a program.  Nevertheless, it’s quite possible to purchase groceries, eat, and, in addition, pay for cellular communications or attend a movie. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what can I pay with bonuses thanks from Sberbank" class="if uuid-3177983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3177983.jpg"></div><h2>  What restriction on accrual is provided? </h2><p>  In order to understand that it is possible to pay with “Thanks from Sberbank” points, it should be noted that they are not awarded: </p><ol><li>  As a result of any currency transaction. </li><li>  For the manipulation of the acquisition of prohibited goods. </li><li>  When money is transferred from one plastic to another. </li><li>  As part of the payment for communal services, services of mobile communication providers, television and more. </li><li>  Amid the transfer of funds to an electronic wallet. </li><li>  For the second and each subsequent automatic payment made during the day. </li><li>  When buying the fourth and next items at one point of sale. </li></ol><p>  Clients also do not receive bonuses if they pay for goods with co-branded cards issued jointly with Aeroflot and MTS. </p>
