Without it, it will not be possible to repay the credit card of the financial institution mentioned above or work with debit plastic will not seem possible.  The procedures are complicated by the fact that Tinkoff does not have separate service terminals.  But this does not mean that it is impossible to replenish plastic or the process is allowed only with a commission.  Below we will consider all possible methods of transferring money to Tinkoff bank cards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recharge tinkoff card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2182271.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Translation Methods </h2><p>  In fact, everything is not as difficult as it seems.  Especially if you know how to act under certain circumstances. </p><p>  Modern citizens can replenish the Tinkoff card in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  through the official Tinkoff page; </li><li>  mobile banking; </li><li>  using online banking; </li><li>  via Tinkoff terminals; </li><li>  at the box office of a financial organization; </li><li>  through electronic wallets; </li><li>  at Tinkoff partner organizations; </li><li>  by working with payment terminals (e.g. Qiwi). </li></ul><p>  In some cases, a commission is charged for transactions.  And some of the listed ways to replenish the Tinkoff card include a cashback.  Small, but it does have a place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff card replenishment without commission" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2182272.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tinkoff site </h2><p>  Let's start with the simplest scenario.  We are talking about replenishing the Tinkoff card without a commission through the official page of a financial organization. </p><p>  In order to carry out a transaction, you must: </p><ol><li>  Go to the tinkoff.ru page in the browser. </li><li>  Select the item "Payments" in the functional menu. </li><li>  Scroll to the "From card to card" section. </li><li>  Indicate the details of their plastics - first the one from which to write off funds, then - where to transfer the money. </li><li>  Click on "Translate". </li></ol><p>  It is done.  Now it remains only to wait.  After about 5 days (this is the maximum period), the money will go to the specified plastic.  Tinkoff does not charge a transaction fee, but some issuing banks may require it. </p><h2>  Online banking </h2><p>  Replenishing the Tinkoff card is not such a difficult task.  The next rather interesting and simple method of transferring money is working with Internet banking.  It is about serving Tinkoff, as well as any other financial institution. </p><p>  In the first case, you have to: </p><ol><li>  Register on the TKS website. </li><li>  Log in to your "My Account". </li><li>  Select "Payments" in the main menu. </li><li>  Click on "Bank Transfer" or "From card to card." </li><li>  If necessary, select "Card of another bank" in the "From" section. </li><li>  Enter the details of bank plastics. </li><li>  Click on the confirmation button. </li></ol><p>  In reality, everything is simpler than it seems.  In almost the same way, you will have to act with the Internet banking of other financial organizations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="replenishment of a tinkoff card from a Sberbank card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2182273.jpg"></div>

Many modern citizens work with Sberbank.  Their online banking is easy to learn. </p><p>  Replenishment of the Tinkoff card is reduced to an algorithm of the following type: </p><ol><li>  Register in the Sberbank Online service.  This can be done using an ATM.  Some prefer to use one-time logins and passwords.  They are also taken at ATMs / terminals of Sberbank. </li><li>  Open the page of the Sberbank Online service. </li><li>  Log in to your personal account. </li><li>  Enter the login confirmation code.  He will come to the mobile device. </li><li>  Go to "Payments and transfers." </li><li>  Click on the item "To the card" or "From card to card." </li><li>  Enter the details of bank plastics - first "Sberbank", then - Tinkoff. </li><li>  Click on the "Transfer" button, after specifying the transaction amount. </li><li>  Confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  Similar actions are processed 3-5 days.  Replenishment of the Tinkoff card from the Sberbank card provides for a commission.  Now it is 1.5% of the total transfer amount.  At the same time, through Sberbank you can not transfer more than 30,000 rubles at a time. </p><h2>  In cash </h2><p>  Is it possible to replenish a Tinkoff card without commission (or with it) with cash?  Yes.  But to do this is problematic. </p><p>  The operation is available in special self-service terminals.  All machines working with Tinkoff Bank can be seen on the organization‚Äôs official page or in the mobile application. </p><p>  What's next?  Once a citizen has decided in which ATM he can transfer money to a card, he will have to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Insert the plastic into the ATM. </li><li>  Enter PIN to enter. </li><li>  Click on "Payments in my region" - "Cash transactions". </li><li>  Select the "Refill" item. </li><li>  Insert bills into the receiver. </li><li>  Press the confirmation button. </li></ol><p>  This technique, as a rule, does not provide for a commission.  But he is not in great demand.  Indeed, replenishment of the Tinkoff Bank card is possible by bank transfer.  Such operations can be carried out at any time of the day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff Bank recharge card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2182280.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Qiwi to the rescue </h2><p>  Some people prefer to use the services of <span>Tinkoff partners.</span>  For example, Qiwi allows using its payment terminals to transfer funds to bank plastic. </p><p>  In general, the transaction manual will look like this: </p><ol><li>  Find the Kiwi terminal. </li><li>  Select in it "Other" - "Tinkoff". </li><li>  Indicate the details of bank plastic. </li><li>  Insert bills into the receiver. </li><li>  Click on "Pay." </li></ol><p>  In a few minutes, the funds will be credited to the indicated account.  Sometimes you have to wait up to a couple of hours.  A commission is charged for the operation - 1.5% of the transaction amount.  In addition, a citizen cannot transfer more than 15,000 rubles at a time. </p><h2>  "Post of Russia" </h2><p>  We found out how to recharge a Tinkoff card from a Sberbank card.  And with the rest of the simple and quick methods of transferring money, we also managed to get acquainted.  But that is not all. </p><p>  You can contact the Russian Post for help.  In this case, the client will replenish the account in cash.  To achieve this goal you will have to bring your passport and receipt with details.  The latter can be found on the official page of the Tinkoff Bank. </p><p>  All that remains to be done is to contact the Russian Post cash desk with documents and money.  You do not need to do anything else - the employees of the corresponding service will transfer the funds at the details specified in the payment. </p><h2>  Online wallets </h2><p>  We replenish the Tinkoff card (we already know the conditions and interest charged for transactions) through virtual wallets.  Consider the process on the example of Yandex.Money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff card conditions and interest" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2182270.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The algorithm of actions will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Open Yandex.Money. </li><li>  Go to the section "Money transfers". </li><li>  Click on "Map" in the drop-down list and click on "Continue." </li><li>  Select "To Bank Card". </li><li>  Indicate the details of the plastic. </li><li>  Enter the amount of the transfer. </li><li>  Click on the "Pay" or "Transfer" button. </li></ol><p>  Typically, the transaction fee is from 1.5 to 5%.  The relevant information will appear on the screen after entering the payment amount. </p><h2>  Salons of communication and payment systems </h2><p>  "Tinkoff" -bank offers replenishment of the card in the mobile phone shops, at its partners.  For example, in "MTS" or in the "Messenger".  In general, no transaction fees are charged. </p><p>  You will have to act in the same way as in the case of Russian Post - a citizen gives a payment or calls a card number, gives money and waits. </p>
