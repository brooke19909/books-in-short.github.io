What documents are needed?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A rather interesting question for many citizens is the return of 13 percent from treatment.  And no matter what kind of medical care is involved.  The main thing is that you can get the so-called <span>tax deduction</span> for it. </p><p>  This topic is of interest to many.  Especially when it comes to dental treatment, because they are usually repaired for a fee.  Few people agree to a free service.  And every citizen who has this or that income, can receive a return of 13 percent from dental treatment.  Yes, and medical treatment in general.  How to do it?  What is the deadline?  We will talk about all this below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="13 percent refund on treatment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1224643.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Who is eligible </h2><p>  To begin with, who is entitled to receive a <span>social tax deduction</span> in our case?  It is also called a deduction for treatment.  Not all citizens apply for it, but only a few.  However, most of the time most people have this opportunity. </p><p>  Why?  The thing is that a return of 13 percent from treatment is possible only when it comes to a person who is officially employed.  That is, such a payment is possible in the presence of income tax.  And nothing more. </p><p>  But the unemployed and officially unemployed people do not have the right to receive one.  But a return of 13 percent from treatment to pensioners, according to the current legislation, will be made.  But ordinary unemployed citizens - no. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Passport </h2><p>  Well, now a little about what documents we need to receive a deduction.  This question is really important.  After all, if you do not provide a complete list, then you will simply be refused a refund.  And you have to start all over from the very beginning. </p>

    <p>  The first thing you need is an identity card.  In our case, this is a passport.  A refund of 13 percent from treatment without this document (or rather, without a copy of it, can be unauthorized) does not take place.  You can try to present any other <span>identification document,</span> but most likely you will be refused.  Keep this in mind! </p><h2>  Declaration and declaration </h2><p>  Do you need a 13 percent return on your dental treatment?  The documents that will be required to receive this payment, as practice shows, are not so difficult to get.  For example, you need a tax return.  It is submitted to the tax authorities until April 30 of each year and reflects your income and expenses.  This is an important reporting document. </p><p>  You also need to write a free application.  Without it, it makes no sense to contact the tax authorities.  A deduction is only possible upon a citizen's application.  Original document required.  It must contain information about the medical institution, as well as about you and the treatment.  Do not forget to register the reason for the appeal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Important: in the application you will have to indicate the bank details for which a 13 percent return from treatment will occur.  In the absence of them, you will either be refused, or you will have to convey the missing documents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="13 percent refund with dental treatment documents" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1224645.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About the medical institution </h2><p>  What else?  On the above list of everything you need does not end there.  In addition to the proposed documents, you will have to worry about informing the tax authorities about the issue of providing data about the place of your treatment.  In fact, you should not be afraid of this feature. </p><p>  Want to get a 13 percent refund on your treatment?  What documents are needed to deduct this type?  It turns out that you will need a license from a visited medical institution.  Have to take her a certified copy.  Problems with this point, as a rule, do not arise. </p><p>  In the case of dental treatment, a license will be sufficient.  In some situations, <span>accreditation of a medical</span> worker may also be required.  But this is not such a common case.  So do not worry about him. </p><h2>  Payments </h2><p>  Next, you will need to confirm that you paid for the treatment.  For this, any payment checks are suitable - receipts, statements, as well as a service agreement.  By the way, without the latter, a return of 13 percent from treatment is impossible in any case.  If the check can be replaced by some other evidence, then the contract is not. </p><p>  Also note that from the employer (yours) you will have to take a certificate of form 2-NDFL.  It serves as proof of your income.  If you work for yourself, fill it out yourself.  Only the original is required; copies are not acceptable.  But checks and receipts can and should be photocopied, and then presented (even without certification). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="13 percent return from treatment to senior citizens" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1224646.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Other documents </h2><p>  What else will a 13 percent refund from dental treatment require?  In principle, the document already listed can be contacted by the tax authorities minus.  But, as practice shows, most often additional and not the most important papers are asked from taxpayers.  What can be attributed to them? </p><p>  Firstly, these are marriage / divorce / birth certificates.  Such a requirement is rare, but people used to play it safe once again.  Enough uncertified copies, originals not needed. </p><p>  Secondly, pensioners will need a <span>pension certificate.</span>  It serves as evidence of compensation for paid treatment in a particular case.  A regular copy is also sufficient.  Usually all the paperwork ends here. </p><h2>  The timing </h2><p>  What is the deadline for making a tax deduction request?  Here, citizens have an alternative to resolve the issue.  The thing is that most often deductions can be made in the last 3 years.  But it‚Äôs recommended that a refund be made for treatment as soon as possible, within a year.  Better yet, by the end of the tax reporting period. </p><p>  The application is considered together with all the documents for about a month, a maximum of one and a half.  After you receive a response from the tax authorities.  You are either satisfied with the request, or denied, indicating the reasons.  You can try to correct the situation and try again. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refund of 13 percent from the treatment what documents are needed" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1224647.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Crediting funds to the account indicated in the application takes about 2 more months.  Total, the whole process takes about 120 days.  Therefore, try to start preparing as soon as possible. </p><p>  The faster you deal with this task, the less headache you will have in the future.  As you can see, a return of 13 percent from the treatment documents requires different.  But if you start the preparation correctly and in a timely manner, you will not have any problems! </p>
