Someone had thought up and made a plan for their vacation in advance, but someone had just realized that the time was right for beaches, bathing suits and nature walks.  Unfortunately, not everyone has the opportunity to go somewhere abroad, but </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to relax in Russia in the summer" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13375/407033.jpg" width="600"></div>  then the cottage is quite satisfied.  However, we all sometimes forget that our Motherland is immense, and those who are familiar with geography should not have a question where to relax in Russia in the summer.  But it is still worth considering this topic in more detail.

    <h2>  Beaches, sea and sand </h2><p>  Many people living in the central regions dream at least once in their life to go to the sea, soak up the azure beach and sunbathe.  All Russians have a huge number of opportunities to get exactly what they want, and without paperwork with a visa.  Our most famous beaches are located in Anapa, Gelendzhik, Sochi and Tuapse.  Of course, the Sochi resort can no longer be attributed to an economical option, since the Olympics made and left significant changes, but the rest of the resorts would be affordable for all lovers to relax at sea.  In Russia, namely in the Krasnodar Territory, Gelendzhik and Tuapse are favorite places for vacationers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features, pros and cons </h2><p>  In any case, you will have to get there on your own, which will not be difficult, since you will have to travel inside the country.  But the search and booking of a boarding house, rest house or rooms in the private sector can be completely and completely entrusted to the travel agency, for a fee you can also secure a meeting car.  Perhaps the only embarrassing moment is our idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãRussian beaches and resorts in general.  Many deny themselves pleasure </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov Russia where to rest" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13375/407032.jpg" width="280"></div>  to spend a vacation within Russia only because they are still sure that there is no service there, and the beaches are dirty.  Everything is already wrong, so you can not worry, because on the Black Sea there are modern hotels near the sea with excellent service, and small cozy hotels.  The advantages include the relative cheapness of a trip to such a resort;  depending on the choice of housing, the whole trip will cost you from 8 to 20 thousand rubles.  Now you know where you can relax in the summer.

    <h2>  catch the wave </h2><p>  We are all different, and not everyone likes passive lying on the beach under the scorching sun.  What to do with those who prefer to relax actively?  In Russia there is a place for such.  For example, in Anapa, namely, on the central beach, you will find everything you want, from water skiing to trendy windsurfing and kitesurfing.  Competitions have been held at this water-skiing stadium for a long time, but for fans there will always be a place.  There are also individual stations where experienced instructors will teach you the basic techniques of water sports.  Here is a worthy place <span>where</span> not only to <span>relax in Russia</span> in the summer </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where better to relax in the summer" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13375/407031.jpg" width="415"></div>  nice but also fun.

The sports club, which has the interesting name ‚ÄúWater Area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Summer‚Äù, offers its guests windsurfing, climbing and many other non-standard sports.  The only minus of this place is the age limit, children under 14 are not allowed there.  Thus, the <span>Sea of</span> Azov can please you with active rest <span>.</span>  <span>Russia,</span> where you can relax in different ways, is huge and immense, so everyone will find rest to their liking. </p><h2>  Camping Romance </h2><p>  In addition to <span>relaxing on the sea,</span> our homeland can offer a lot of other types of pleasant summer pastime.  So, for example, there were still places untouched by civilization, it was they who were the best suited to go camping.  Moreover, hiking are different.  It can be a classic holiday in tents with songs by the fire, or you can choose something more interesting.  The Republic of Karelia is famous for its mountain rivers, which means that in this region you can always do </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where you can relax in the summer" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13375/407030.jpg" width="600"></div>  rafting, that is, descent along the river in kayaks and rafts.

    <h2>  Lake Baikal </h2><p>  There are many places where you can have a good rest, but if you are a lover of long walks through the forests and a lover of beautiful natural landscapes, then you should go to Lake Baikal.  If the choice is difficult for you, that is, you want both this and that, then travel agencies can offer you a combined tour, which will include rafting, and a camp, and bike rides, and even climbing mountains.  Do not forget that there is another entertainment available to residents of Russia, it is speleology.  In the Irkutsk region alone, there are at least 200 caves that are waiting to be explored. </p><h2>  River and sea cruises </h2><p>  The Volga, Yenisei, Irtysh, Ob, Lena are some of the most famous Russian rivers, it is on them that cruises are launched every spring.  What could be more beautiful than an unhurried boat trip, during which you can see a lot and take pictures on a wide variety of backgrounds.  This type of vacation is suitable for pensioners and families with children who are wondering where to relax in Russia in the summer.  The most popular route is </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to relax in the Crimea in the summer" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13375/407029.jpg" width="600"></div>  a trip from Saratov to Volgograd, it will take 3 days and leave a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãimpressions for a small price.  And how do you like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãvisiting all the "pearls" of the Black Sea coast, because there are also sea cruises?  You can enjoy breathtaking views of Odessa, Sevastopol, Alushta and Yalta, visit the royal summer residences.  You can use a cruise as a way to get to a place to relax in the summer.  In Crimea, for example, there are a lot of coastal cities that are famous for their beauty.  In addition, usually the price includes excursions, from which you will learn a lot of new and interesting things.

    <h2>  Snowboard in the summer? </h2><p>  There is nothing fantastic in this, because in our country there are areas where snow does not melt all year round.  Take, for example, <span>the highest mountain in Russia</span> - Elbrus.  It belongs to the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range and has a height of 5642 meters.  Here, at an altitude of 3800 meters, Gara-Bashi station is located, where snowboard lovers gather every summer.  On average, such a vacation will cost you 10-15 thousand rubles per week. </p><p>  Someone goes sunbathing on the beach in winter, so why not do the opposite?  Just imagine what kinds of views from such a height.  If you don‚Äôt know how to ride, always </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="relax at sea in Russia" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13375/407207.jpg" width="460"></div>  There are instructors who will teach you the basics.  And do not think that there are few tourists here, even if this is not the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  Russia, where you can relax in the summer, even skiing, is immense, so anyone will find something for themselves.

    <h2>  Chalets </h2><p>  If you do not want to travel far or vacation time is limited to several days, then the best choice for you will be a vacation at the camp site.  In addition, this is a fairly economical option, but it all depends on the place.  As a rule, they are located along the banks of rivers and lakes and have existed since Soviet times.  But do not be alarmed, today most of them are in an appropriate state and have all the necessary amenities.  This is a great option if you are still thinking about where to relax in Russia in the summer.  Swimming in a pond, long forest walks, fishing, horseback riding and boating, picking berries and mushrooms, campfire songs and barbecue are just a small part of what camp sites can offer you.  All this in addition to clean air and indescribable landscapes.  The most popular recreation centers can be found in the suburbs and in the Volga region, especially in <span>the</span> Volga <span>River delta</span> .  The latter will especially please fishermen with a rich catch.  If you do not want to go far, pay attention to the camp sites in your region. </p><p>  <span>Where is it better to relax</span> in Russia in the summer, and where is worse - this question is not entirely correct, because it all depends on your preferences and desires.  There is a place for everyone in our country, and there is no need to go anywhere. </p>
