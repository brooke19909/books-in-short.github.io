  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Organized crime: definition, causes, conditions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Theorists of anarchy believe that any system is violence against the individual.  However, in the absence of proper control by the “white systems” - the state, “black systems” - organized crime, take control of the life of society.  Human nature is characterized by a desire for orderliness, therefore, in any case, systems are formed on both sides, sometimes forming “gray systems”, that is, for example, police bribed by criminals. </p><p>  What is organized <span>crime?</span>  <span>These are</span> local, existing within the framework of one state, or even transnational organizations consisting of criminals and aiming at illegal activities in most cases to make huge profits.  They are distinguished by high centralization and iron discipline from temporarily emerging associations of petty criminals.  Usually the scale of their activity is extremely large and high profitability.  Some researchers also refer to the concept of "organized crime" as terrorist groups.  But such people have slightly different motives - political. </p><p>  In different states, the percentage of the population and the number of money rotating in this shadow sphere may differ.  For the United States, Mexican drug dealers pose the greatest danger. </p><p>  What are the causes and conditions of organized crime?  The reasons are varied, primarily they are associated with a low economic level in the state.  To put it simply, people come to organized crime because of despair and the inability to honestly earn a <span>living of an</span> average <span>standard.</span>  The level of education is of great importance, only the organizers of illegal business are educated.  It is also important that society understands the clear boundary between “what is good and what is bad” for a given state.  Attitudes towards prostitution in the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates are completely different.  And doubts of individuals about the correctness of the general opinion leads them to the ranks of criminal organizations.  What are the conditions?  Organized crime often occurs where there is an undeveloped law, vague wording, and also in areas where official structures (police) are corrupt and make a deal with the organizers of criminal activity. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Why has transnational organized crime spread so much?  The fact is that the legislation in some states allows the payment of money received in a criminal manner for earned money, in other countries this is called money laundering.  Thus, an international organization makes money “legal” in another state, and then transfers it to a more “stricter” country, after which it can be easily used and not attract attention.  Organized crime (such as trafficking in prostitutes) also exploits property inequality in different states.  For dubious work, it’s easier to recruit a girl who has no job or prospects in her homeland.  Therefore, people are so easily found, even when it is clearly visible that future work is more like slavery. </p><p>  Foreigners who want to marry a Russian, recently began to avoid, like fire, girls from the town of Lugansk, and from Yoshkar-Ola.  The fact is that there was a whole organization.  In most cases, not even a girl “worked” with men.  There was a whole system for receiving money from men who were begging for specious purposes - such as an operation for a grandmother.  And the "bride" promised to come at the expense of the groom.  Naturally, problems arose, and if the deceived did not agree to solve them, the brides disappeared.  And if he agreed, even larger amounts of money passed from a naive man into the pocket of scammers.  The scale was very large, so much was said about this story, especially abroad. </p>
