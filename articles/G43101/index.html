    <p>  You can get from the Barbarian gap to the resort city of Anapa, having overcome no more than 12 km.  This part of the beach got its charming name because of the gorge in which it is located. </p><h2>  Rest in the resort village of Sukko </h2><p>  Sukko is a very hospitable village, located quite close to the city of Anapa.  Each tourist will leave unforgettable emotions and feelings.  The village is mesmerizing with tranquility, silence and peace.  It is surrounded on all sides by mountains.  Almost all beaches are small pebble.  As a rule, there are few people on them.  This attracts tourists.  Air and sea are clean.  In the village, without a doubt, there is something to see and where to visit.  Extreme lovers can go to the picturesque mountains. </p><p>  It can be noted that in the region of the village of Sukko the Caucasus Mountains originate, however, they are not too high and reach only 400 m. The area is filled mainly with broad-leaved trees (oak, beech).  Pines and junipers are often found, which release tar that is beneficial to the body in the air.  <span>Cypress marsh</span> grove <span>,</span> which is noted in the Red Book, is also located in Sukko.  Barbarian gap - a picturesque place by the sea, which is also located near the village. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you pay attention to the origin of the name of the settlement, then it is translated from the Tatar language as "river".  The swimming season in the village can last until October.  However, for those who are used to vacation abroad on the beaches of Turkey, a vacation in Sukko will seem peculiar.  Here it is necessary to seriously weigh all the advantages and disadvantages. </p><h2>  Advantages of relaxation in the village of Sukko </h2><p>  Silent, clean, almost untouched by man beaches - the main plus of this place.  Compared to the noisy Anapa, this factor is important.  The place is suitable for lovers of peace of mind and unity with nature. </p>

The beach area is hidden from prying <span>eyes by the mountains</span> and therefore little known.  Sometimes here you can see endangered species of birds, animals and plants.

    <p>  The beach (Varvarovskaya gap) is not so civilized in comparison with the central beaches of Anapa, but from this it still does not lose its attractiveness.  Water in the sea practically does not bloom.  However, this beach has everything that a tourist needs.  These are the most common changing cabins, sun loungers, water rides, toilets, kiosks, rescue stations.  On the beach, everyone can visit the cafe.  The only negative is the lack of any stores in the territory, so it is better to think about food and drinking water in advance.  Here, every vacationer will find something for everyone (water parks, yacht trips and much more). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Underwater flora and fauna will please the diving enthusiast.  Indeed, in these places there are a large number of hollows, boulders, many rare species of fish.  Tourists who live in tents should not worry about the presence of fresh water (there is a fresh stream on the shore). </p>

An <span>environmental fee is</span> provided for cars to enter the beach <span>,</span> which is about 100 rubles per car.  For this purpose, a checkpoint, blocked by a barrier, was built before entering.  When you are on this beach, it seems that a person‚Äôs foot hasn‚Äôt stepped here.
