But experienced tourists are advised to go to the hotel to wash in the sauna.  Here in the shower there is always hot water.  The VIP rooms at the hotel include bathtubs.  In ordinary rooms there is only a watering can.  The showers in the hotel, unfortunately, are not too large.  Which, of course, according to many tourists, has a very negative effect on the convenience of living. </p><h2>  What you should know about </h2><p>  <span><span><span>The views from the windows of the hotel, according to many tourists, are actually simply magnificent.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The local mountains look really very beautiful.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The sea in this place has a unique blue hue.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>However, before going to the balcony in a bathing suit in rooms with windows facing the mountains, experienced vacationers advise our compatriots to think carefully.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The fact is that below, under the walls of the hotel there are many shops owned by local residents.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Their owners and Turkish clients adore taking pictures of hotel guests who are not quite dressed and can even call the</span></span></span> <span><span><span>room</span></span></span> <span><span><span>with an indecent proposal for a short acquaintance.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Hotel Infrastructure </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Good reviews about <span>Club Hotel</span> Beldiana are also available because they include:</span></span></span> </p><ul><li>  <span><span><span>pool;</span></span></span> </li><li>  hammam; </li><li>  massage room. </li></ul><p>  <span><span><span>There is, of course, a small sports corner in this hotel.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>After all, this hotel belongs to the four-star class.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>However, unfortunately, judging by the reviews, the simulators in the hotel gym are malfunctioning.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>So it is unlikely that guests will be able to pull up their physical form with their use.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>Also, tourists have the opportunity to purchase any tour directly at the hotel.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The hotel has its own small office with one guide.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Business people can rent a conference room at this hotel.</span></span></span> </p>

    <p>  <span><span><span>About the staff of</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Club Hotel Beldiana</span></span></span> <span><span><span>(Kemer) reviews are</span></span></span> <span><span><span>also conflicting.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>All hotel staff are fluent in Russian.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But at the same time, according to many vacationers, they are not fulfilling the requests of the guests promptly.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Most of the people working at the hotel are Kurds.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>For any additional service (and sometimes it is</span></span></span> <span><span><span>necessary) they like to take a separate fee.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>For example, this way you can speed up check-in or get a room with a sea view.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Unfortunately, judging by the reviews, cases of petty theft sometimes occur in this hotel.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>For example, cosmetics may disappear from the nightstands.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Money at the</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Club Hotel Beldiana 4 *</span></span></span> <span><span><span>hotel</span></span></span> <span><span><span>sometimes disappears even from safes.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>There are not too many such reviews, but still they are.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Therefore, hotel guests should be more attentive to their belongings.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>Also, many tourists are not advised to purchase excursions on site.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Here they are too expensive.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>On the streets of Beldibi you can buy some interesting trip for a much smaller amount.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Moreover, an excursion with a street guide will be no less interesting.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Beach Hotels </h2><p>  <span><span><span>The sea from this hotel is 100 meters.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>You can reach it in just a couple of minutes.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>This, of course, is quite convenient.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>However, the beach of this hotel itself has earned not very good reviews from tourists.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>You have to go to it along a rather dirty road.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>And the sand on the beach itself is not particularly clear, according to many vacationers.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>In addition, the cleaners on the coastline are quite arrogant and are often disrespectful to tourists.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>Not too good deserved</span></span></span> <span><span><span>reviews</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Club Hotel Beldiana 4 *</span></span></span> <span><span><span>(Turkey)</span></span></span> <span><span><span>, including the fact</span></span></span> <span><span><span>that</span></span></span> <span><span><span>the reception</span></span></span> <span><span><span>here does not give out beach towels.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>However, with all this, infrastructure on the seashore, tourists in this place</span></span></span> <span><span><span>can use for free.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>For the convenience of vacationers</span></span></span> <span><span><span>,</span></span></span> <span><span><span>deck chairs and umbrellas</span></span></span> <span><span><span>are</span></span></span> <span><span><span>provided</span></span></span> <span><span><span>here</span></span></span> <span><span><span>.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>Entering the water on the hotel‚Äôs beach, according to many vacationers, is not very convenient.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Unfortunately, many boulders are scattered along the coastline.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>The beach at <span>Club Hotel</span> Beldiana (Turkey), judging by the reviews, is not particularly attractive and comfortable.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>However,</span></span></span> the sea itself in this place is always very clean, beautiful and warm.  Swimming in it is quite nice.  In addition, next to the hotel there are small, quite comfortable wild beaches.  If desired, guests can sunbathe here without infrastructure, but without boulders. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Rooms for</span></span></span> <span><span><span>rent</span></span></span> <span><span><span>in the</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Club Hotel Beldiana 4 *</span></span></span> <span><span><span>hotel</span></span></span> <span><span><span>, of</span></span></span> <span><span><span>course, with meals.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>There are two restaurants in the hotel - open and closed.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The hotel cooks are prepared, according to many of its former guests, not bad.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>True, few meat dishes are served here.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But what is available is always tasty and fresh.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The disadvantages of the main restaurant, most visitors include not too high quality service.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Seats at tables for breakfast, lunch or dinner are not enough for all guests.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Meals are served in the hotel's buffet restaurant.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>The staff themselves in the restaurant of the Club Hotel Beldiana 4 * hotel (Beldibi), reviews about which in this regard are good, fairly polite, efficient and helpful.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>True, some waiters demonstrate a ‚Äúcreeping‚Äù attitude towards tourists from rich countries (for example, towards the Germans), and, unfortunately, they are slightly dismissive of Russians.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But this happens extremely rarely.</span></span></span> </p>
