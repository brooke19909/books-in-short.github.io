There are also Frankfurt gingerbread cookies, in fact these are cookies, usually made at Christmas, and marzipan is used to make it. </li><li>  To buy yourself something, it is recommended to use the euro, because another currency is not accepted.  However, if you took rubles with you (dollars or hryvnias, or anything else), you can go to any local bank and you will be exchanged. </li></ul><h2>  Frankfurt map </h2><p>  The main advice is to buy a Frankfurt card (Frankfurter Tageskarte).  It will allow you to visit museums, travel by transport and so on.  It is given either to one person or to a group. </p><p>  Its advantages: </p><ul><li>  Some museums offer a discount of up to 2 euros from the entry price, some allow for 50%, some for free. </li><li>  Public transport is free. </li><li>  Discounts from 15 to 25% for opera and theater. </li><li>  Discounts on purchases from some manufacturers 10% in shopping centers, from 10 to 20% - at the zoo, when sightseeing. </li></ul><p>  When buying cards, they usually give a brochure where all the discounts are indicated.  If you have a card for a day, then it is valid until the end of the working day, usually this day is indicated on the ticket itself.  If the card is for 2 days, then it already begins to operate on the day of registration and ends with the working time of the next day.  The card can be purchased at many retail outlets, for example, take it at the airport.  It can also be ordered online and received by mail or purchased at the hotel. </p>
