Trade routes through rivers connected the Black, Caspian and Baltic Seas.  Handicraft actively developed - the work of local craftsmen was in demand in Europe. </p><p>  In Veliky Novgorod two centuries earlier than in Paris, wooden pavements appeared.  In the XII century there were already plumbing and sewage. </p><p>  There are many surprising facts in history.  For example, the city managed to avoid the Mongol invasion, thanks to which unique monuments of ancient Russian architecture were preserved. </p><p>  We are talking about the St. Sophia Cathedral (1050), the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary of the St. Anthony Monastery (1119), the St. Nicholas and Dvorishchensky Cathedral (1136), the Paraskiev Friday Church on the Market (1207) and other ancient temples. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Veliky Novgorod hotels" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1197484.jpg" width="600"></div>

The windows offer beautiful views of the Hagia Sophia and the banks <span>of the Volkhov River.</span>  However, many travelers believe that the price-quality ratio, even taking into account the location, is unacceptable. </p><p>  ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù belongs to the famous ‚ÄúAmax Hotel‚Äù chain in our country.  Veliky Novgorod is a popular destination, so it‚Äôs pretty easy to find reviews on the Web.  At the moment, the hotel is undergoing renovation of rooms, and the old rooms still scare guests with plumbing fixtures with cracks, broken furniture and various stains on the walls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Intourist" </h2><p>  Long walks in Veliky Novgorod must necessarily end with a delicious meal and a good rest.  For travel it is best to choose a hotel in the city center, so as not to spend a lot of energy on the way back. </p><p>  The Intourist Hotel (Veliky Novgorod, Velikaya street, 16) combines a great location, reasonable prices and comfortable rooms.  In the immediate vicinity are the main attractions: Novgorod Kremlin, Central Park, Drama Theater.  F. M.

Ordering theater tickets, drawing up an excursion route and translation services for foreign tourists - you just have to enjoy your vacation in Veliky Novgorod. </p><h2>  Traveler opinions </h2><p>  It seems that the spring update affected several hotel complexes at once.  Guests at the Intourist Hotel welcome repairs, but the noise from nine in the morning does not give them much joy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel is more suitable for picky guests who come to the city for new impressions and are ready to turn a blind eye to small flaws.  For example, the lack of sound insulation, a draft in the rooms, a very weak Wi-Fi signal and surface cleaning. </p><p>  If you do not plan to spend most of the time at the hotel, then the offer from Intourist can be considered. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúVolkhov‚Äù </h2><p>  Hotel ‚ÄúVolkhov‚Äù on 24 Predtechenskaya Street offers you to plunge into the history of the city. </p><p>  In 1959, the first guests crossed the threshold of the hotel, the opening of which was timed to coincide with the 1100th anniversary of the city.  In 1998-1999, thanks to large-scale reconstruction, the Volkhov turned into a hotel that meets the highest standards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Volkhov hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1197485.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The idea that there was no limit to perfection did not leave the leadership, so another transformation took place two years ago.  Service, modern technical equipment and a good location - today there is everything you need for relaxation and fruitful work. </p><h2>  The symbol of the city </h2><p>  All rooms are decorated in a classic style.  Warm shades in the interior, comfortable furniture and equipment promise guests a comfortable stay. </p><p>  The room fund of the Volkhov Hotel consists of single and double standard rooms, junior suites, suites and family rooms.  In addition, guests have the unique opportunity to book one of the duplex duplex rooms with panoramic windows.  On the ground floor there is a cozy living room and a small dining room, and on the second floor there is a bathroom and a spacious bedroom. </p><p>  The hotel infrastructure includes the Volkhov restaurant of European cuisine, a billiard room and a lobby bar, a tour desk and a sauna with a mini-pool, dry cleaning and laundry services, as well as a hairdresser. </p><p>  For business events, the hotel has two conference rooms equipped with modern technology, air conditioning and wireless Internet access.  In addition, the restaurant can provide a coffee break, a set lunch or a buffet table. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúThree cats‚Äù </h2><p>  Hotels in Veliky Novgorod are best booked in advance.  With the onset of spring, tourist flow increases, and rooms in the historical part of the city end very quickly. </p><p>  Mini-hotel ‚ÄúThree cats‚Äù offers home comfort and hospitality (Veliky Novgorod, 3, Oborony str.). </p><p>  All rooms are equipped with necessary furniture, private bathrooms and LCD TVs.  A full rest is the key to a great trip.  This is perfectly understood by guests after sleeping on orthopedic mattresses. </p><p>  The hotel has a large equipped kitchen, where a rich breakfast is served in the morning, and during the day guests can cook their own meals.  In addition, ‚ÄúThree Cats‚Äù provides free on-site parking, Internet access, a taxi call and lunch service from restaurants in the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Three Cats Veliky Novgorod" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1197489.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Additional services: </p><p>  - bicycles for rent; </p><p>  - Cedar barrel; </p><p>  - a sauna; </p><p>  - photographers Service; </p><p>  - organization of excursions. </p><h2>  Economical ‚ÄúVoyage‚Äù </h2><p>  A great option for budget travelers is the Voyage Hotel (Veliky Novgorod, Timur Frunze-Olovyanka St., 19/1). </p><p>  Despite the location in the heart of the city, the hotel offers accommodation at economy class prices.  The rooms are 8-bed, triple, family, double double and twin twin have a shared bathroom and shower, as well as a spacious kitchen. </p><p>  The cheapest bed will cost in an 8-bed room - from 400 rubles per day.  Double with a double bed and a TV - from 1200 rubles per day.  The most expensive junior suite with a private bathroom costs from 2300 rubles per day. </p><p>  The list of additional services is small and resembles other hotels in Veliky Novgorod: order pizza, ‚Äúalarm clock‚Äù and call a taxi.  However, lovers of extreme entertainment will certainly be interested in cooperation between the hotel and the Evacuation 53 company, which organizes unusual jeep tours.  Anyone can test their strength on the road with a valid driver‚Äôs license.  Participation in a jeep tour will cost 1,500 rubles (one hour) as part of a small group. </p><h2>  From ‚ÄúBirch bark‚Äù to ‚ÄúPark Inn‚Äù </h2><p>  Many travelers used to know the magnificent ‚ÄúPark Inn‚Äù by ‚ÄúRadisson‚Äù under the name ‚ÄúHotel Beresta‚Äù (Veliky Novgorod, 2a Studencheskaya St.). </p><p>  The hotel is equipped with 226 magnificent standard rooms, business class, junior suite, suite and one apartment.  It offers guests Wi-Fi, a hairdryer, a TV and a telephone, as well as toiletries.  The price of the reservation includes breakfast and access to the sauna complex in the morning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Beresta Veliky Novgorod" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1197490.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Park Inn is a real spa hotel (Veliky Novgorod), because Beresta SPA is considered one of the best centers in the city.  Herbal and Finnish saunas, a jacuzzi, a Russian steam bath, a large pool, a hammam, massage rooms and beauty parlors are equipped here.  Relaxing procedures, body shaping, pedicures and manicures, services of stylists and makeup artists are able to emphasize the natural beauty of charming visitors. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Two establishments work for travelers - the main restaurant with two banquet halls ‚ÄúGallery‚Äù and the summer cafe ‚ÄúIn the Sun‚Äù.  Visitors note the original interior and a large selection of dishes.  Drinks and light snacks are available at the lobby bar. </p><p>  The only thing Park Inn loses to other hotels in our review is location.  But we all understand that it was simply impossible to organize such an infrastructure in the historical part of the city. </p><p>  On the vast territory of the hotel there are flower beds and lawns, a summer barbecue area and tennis courts.  The youngest guests will be happy to visit the Kazinaki City entertainment center with slot machines and attractions, a restaurant with a children's menu, an intricate maze and a 5D movie theater. </p><p>  The Park Inn has an information center where you can buy tickets to various events, get information about events in the city, or recommendations on how best to draw up a cultural program.  As we already said, the hotel is not in the historical part, like the hotels of Veliky Novgorod listed above, so walking to the main attractions will take about half an hour. </p><h2>  Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  Regular guests note that after the change of ownership and name at the hotel, almost nothing has changed.  Great spa, friendly staff and great food in restaurants. </p>
