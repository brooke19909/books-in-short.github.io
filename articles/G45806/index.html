  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Printers for printing on film: description and overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Printing on film finds many uses today.  Perhaps the main one is outdoor and interior advertising, as well as printing a variety of labels and stickers.  Making any advertisement using print on film is economical and practical. </p><p>  Equipment for this is represented by plotters and solvent printers.  The former are used to cut ready-made stickers, and the latter are used directly for printing. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  Technical features </h2><p>  All existing printers for printing on film are classified by the number of colors.  Four-color models provide high-speed printing of images in medium quality.  And, for example, eight-color ones work a little slower, but the quality of the goods received is at a very high level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="the-gadgeteer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A variety of printers for printing" class="if uuid-2464591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2464591.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing such a printer, you should pay attention to the following characteristics: </p><ul><li>  Printing surface - a printer for printing on a self-adhesive film must necessarily have a vacuum type surface, otherwise the film will not adhere to the surface. </li><li>  Brand - brand popularity is not always guaranteed to provide a long service life and high build quality.  The very same China, contrary to popular opinion, produces printers whose quality is in no way inferior to eminent brands in Europe. </li><li>  Printheads - when choosing, it is preferable to give priority to heads with an extended service life for industrial purposes.  For example, Epson heads have worked well for interior printing.  They work quite slowly, but provide a high quality resolution.  For universal and outdoor printing, experts recommend choosing Konica, Seiko or SPECTRA heads.  With medium quality resolution, they provide high print speed. </li><li>  Carriage - this mechanism is distinguished by the possibility of adjusting the allowable distance between the material and the printheads and the method of movement.  The carriage can move along the beam with bearings or along a <span>linear guide.</span>  When choosing, it is worth giving preference to the first option.  It features a long service life and provides more accurate positioning. </li></ul><h2>  Plotter </h2><p>  This is a special wide format printer with additional features.  For example, curly cutting can be done on it.  The plotter will allow you to print on a wide variety of materials - vinyl, film, tissue paper, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A plotter-printer for printing on film protects the resulting image from mechanical stress, and also increases resistance to the negative effects of ultraviolet radiation and weather conditions. </p><h2>  Varieties of films </h2><p>  According to the properties of the film are divided into several types: </p><ul><li>  matte, glossy; </li><li>  single, double-sided; </li><li>  translucent, transparent, opaque; </li><li>  self-adhesive and non-adhesive; </li><li>  waterproof and non-waterproof; </li><li>  thermal transfer or for printing at ordinary temperature; </li><li>  siliconized and with other types of special coatings; </li><li>  colored and white. </li></ul><p>  Such a film is produced mainly universal.  It is suitable for both a laser printer and an inkjet.  But there are films that are suitable only for inkjet or laser printing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Printer Range" class="if uuid-2464577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2464577.jpg"></div><p>  The most common version of the film is most often used in A4 format, but you can purchase non-standard format material on order or in special stores. </p><p>  Laser printer film appeared on the market several years ago.  Its capabilities exceeded all expectations, but its price is far from the lowest.  Despite this, the variety and choice of such a film on the market is wide enough, as they say, for every taste and color. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Film printer </h2><p>  The Epson Stylus Photo 1410 model is perfect not only for printing large format photo images, but also for high-speed color and monochrome printing of documents.  Its distinguishing feature is the high resolution printing of photographs - 5760 x 1440 dpi. </p><p>  This printer can print on the front surface of compact discs, as well as on labels and a special film for printing on an inkjet printer. </p><p>  The printer uses Claria branded inks based on dye-based water-soluble dye.  Photos taken using them will retain color brightness for 200 years when stored in an album. </p><p>  An irreplaceable ‚Äúemployee‚Äù in design bureaus, the <span>HP Designjet T520</span> large format film <span>printer, has</span> found its application in companies that are involved in large-scale printing of printing products - in advertising agencies, design and engineering bureaus.  Using it, you can easily and quickly display photos and texts on film and paper in color and black and white. </p><div class="photo" data-original="catalog.onliner.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Printer for printing on a different film" class="if uuid-2464570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2464570.jpg"></div><p>  For maximum resolution, four colors of HP branded pigment ink are used.  For film rolls, an automatic cutter can be used. </p><h2>  Canon imagePROGRAF iPF6400 plotter </h2><p>  Equipped with a 12-color innovative pigment ink system, this large format printer is designed for printing photographs, labels, stickers and artistic images.  This device is used as a printer for printing on film in advertising agencies and retail chains.  A special image processing technology provides smooth transitions of tones, enhanced <span>color gamut</span> and increased resistance to scratches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tenaui.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Printer for printing on film" class="if uuid-2464568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2464568.jpg"></div><p>  The model features improved transmission of black and saturated tones, which allows you to achieve the necessary print quality and exceptional print quality. </p><h2>  Economical and functional </h2><p>  With five separate ink tanks and Wi-Fi connectivity, the high-performance Canon Printer <span>PIXMA iP7240 is</span> great for high-quality and fast printing of photos, banners, documents, printing on film and CD-ROMs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.computerhouse.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Film printing" class="if uuid-2464565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2464565.jpg"></div><p>  It is easy to connect to it from anywhere in the house from a mobile and stationary device.  Given the technical equipment, this printer for printing on film and paper guarantees its owners the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  high quality and speed of color and black and white prints; </li><li>  long service life; </li><li>  extreme ease of use. </li></ul>
