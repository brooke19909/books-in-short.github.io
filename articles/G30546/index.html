A great option would be crafts from the tubes of juice. </p><h2>  Flower vase </h2><p>  Such a product can be presented as a souvenir to mom, grandmother or aunt.

The child will like this task, especially since it is not difficult to make a vase, and the result will be bright and beautiful. </p><p>  To make such crafts from juice cans, in addition to the usual set of materials and tools, you will need clay, stationery erasers, a disposable plate and a postcard.  Various bows, ribbons, etc. are useful for decor. </p><p>  For stability, all the tubes are cut in half and fastened with clerical gum.  The design is glued to a disposable plate or postcard.  Next, the vase must be decorated with satin ribbons and a bow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crafts from juice tubes" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1544290.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <p>  Now we should proceed to the manufacture of a flower.  To do this, all the tubules from the juice must be cut into pieces of 2-3 cm. The entire flower will consist of individual inflorescences.  They are made from small pieces of tubules, one of the sides of which is cut into small fringe.  Ready inflorescences are inserted into each other and mounted on a plasticine ball.  The more inflorescences turn out, the more magnificent the flower will be.  When it is completely ready, you need to combine the entire structure, and the craft is ready. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Crafts for the New Year: Christmas tree toys </h2><p>  Children are always looking forward to the New Year holidays, and to make preparations even more interesting and more fun, you can make a Christmas tree toy yourself. </p><p>  For work, you need cocktail tubes, scissors, thread and a needle.  First of all, the tubes are cut into 8 parts of 5 cm and 4 parts of 4 cm. It is necessary to connect four parts of 4 cm together using a needle and thread.  The part is fixed with a knot, but the thread is not cut. </p><p>  Next, two more 5 cm pieces are put on the same thread and the thread is threaded into one of the sides of the square.  Similarly, you need to draw all sides of the square, in the end you should get four triangles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crafts for the New Year" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1544289.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Two vertices of the triangle are connected from above, the other two - from below.  On one of the resulting vertices, a loop is hung for hanging, and on the other a bead or bell. </p><p>  And although New Year‚Äôs crafts made of tubes look much simpler than purchased jewelry, a toy made by the child‚Äôs hands will take pride of place on the Christmas tree. </p><h2>  Photo frame </h2><p>  Craft in the form of a frame for photographs, made of tubes of juice, looks bright, while it is very practical.  The frame will fit perfectly into the design of the children's room, and for its manufacture you will not need special materials, everything you need can be found at hand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Crafts from juice tubes in the form of a photo frame are made quickly and easily.  First of all, you need to prepare a cardboard base, which will correspond to the size of the photo.  Next, measure the length of the corners of the frame and cut out the corresponding segments from the tubes.  They are glued on the sides.  After that, you need to cut out many of the same segments from multi-colored tubes and stick them to the cardboard base with glue or double-sided tape. </p><p>  A photo is attached to the back and the frame is ready.  If desired, you can additionally attach a piece of cardboard, so that the frame stands confidently on a horizontal surface. </p><h2>  Crafts from tubs from children's juice: geometric figures for educational games </h2><p>  Thanks to such constructions, a fun geometry can be studied with a child in a playful way.

    <p>  First, try to make a pyramid.  To do this, it is necessary to fold along the short part of the tube, it is inserted into the long part.  Thus, a triangle is obtained.  Identical figures are fastened together with adhesive tape and combined into a pyramid.  In a similar way, you can add a wide variety of shapes: pentagons, squares, etc. </p><p>  Crafts from juice cans for children will be an excellent occasion for entertaining games and will help the child remember new geometric shapes. </p><h2>  Jewelry </h2><p>  Girls of any age love jewelry.

    <p>  Making such jewelry is very simple.  Tubules from juice are cut into segments of different sizes.  They need to be strung on a thick thread, but it is better to use fishing line.
