    <h2>  Example </h2><p>  The woman was on maternity leave from February 2014 to July 2015.  In October 2015, she issued a sick leave certificate from 06.10 to 17.10.  Over the past two months, her salary amounted to 9.8 thousand rubles.  Total work experience - 6 years.  How to pay sick leave?  According to the employee, in the calculation of average earnings, the more ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù period of 2013-2013 will be used. </p><p>  (360 + 378) / 730 * 12 * 0.8 = 9.7 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Without a formalized statement, the calculations would be carried out on the basis of the ‚Äúminimum‚Äù: </p><p>  (5.9 * 24) / 730 * 13 * 0.8 = 2.04 thousand rubles. </p><p>  When calculating benefits, the amount will be calculated: </p><ul><li>  ten days - based on experience; </li><li>  in the following days - half of the monthly salary. </li></ul><p>  This algorithm works if the child has been treated on an outpatient basis.  If the mother was in hospital with the child for treatment, the disability certificate is paid in full based on the length of service. </p>
