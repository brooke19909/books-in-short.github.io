    <p>  In appearance, OSMA is neither like Stochastic nor moving averages.  Rather, it contains something from the MACD.  Similar indicators of the Forex market perfectly show divergence.  These are leading tools - they help the trader to see a reversal even at that moment when the price has not yet finished updating its highs or lows. </p><h2>  "Three screens of Elder" </h2><p>  Try to apply indicators for MT4 (the most accurate).  With the help of Forex pointers identical to ‚ÄúThree Elder Screens‚Äù, you can receive messages from several devices at once, study them and set trading goals.  In the new model of this algorithm, special alerts are used that warn of a probable transaction opening. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The basic tools used are MACD, Stochastic, as well as a moving exponential average.  Of course, the best moment to open a position appears when all the above algorithms give a certain sign. </p><h2>  "Moving Average" </h2><p>  We continue to consider indicators for MT4 - the most accurate.  The Moving Average index, without a doubt, belongs to the category of the best Forex market indicators.  On its basis, many other well-known devices successfully used by traders have been created. </p>

    <p>  A moving average is a trending algorithm that determines the direction of the current market movement.  There are several types of this tool: simple, moving weighted average, exponential.  Each of these devices has its own qualities and can be used in specific market conditions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bollinger Band </h2><p>  What other indicators are there for MT4 (the most accurate)?  The Bollinger band indicator is used when new Forex instruments are created from a pair of moving averages.  In it, all MAs are shifted for a certain period in relation to each other.  Thanks to this nuance, the so-called envelope was created in which two curves describe the faces, and the third is placed in between in the middle. </p><p>  The essence of working with this device is easy to understand.  Between faces the price is constantly fluctuating.  She only occasionally leaves them in order to be in the envelope range again.  Transactions can be opened when the price touches one of the faces or is falsely broken. </p><h2>  Adx </h2><p>  Each trader needs indicators for MT4.  The ADX algorithm is built in a window separate from the graph.  Its name is translated into Russian as the ‚Äúindex of addressed movement‚Äù.  Current traders very often use his testimony. </p>

    <p>  Using the ADX indicator, you can determine the relevance of the current trend.  This device has several values, around which its curves fluctuate.  It is better to work with him when applying trend algorithms, since he independently does not determine the direction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  MACD </h2><p>  Many traders say that indicators for MT4 help them in trading.  Using MACD, you can not only identify situations where you can open transactions at the current rate of movement, but also determine the prospects for a market reversal using divergence.  This tool is not new.  Nevertheless, today every trader has used it at least a couple of times. </p><p>  This algorithm is good in that it provides different <span>types of signals,</span> as well as oscillators.  This device belongs to modern <span>trading systems.</span> </p><h2>  Parabolic sar </h2><p>  And what other accurate indicators are there for MT4?  Parabolic Sar belongs to the category of new Forex market pointers.  The device we are analyzing works with acceleration.  It is plotted on the chart in the form of points placed below and above the price. </p>

    <p>  When the points are below the price curve, a buy message appears.  When they are found higher, you can sell.  This device is good in that it can be used to receive more accurate signals.  But in this case, it must be used in tandem with other indicators. </p><h2>  Stochastic </h2><p>  The rating of indicators for MT4 2016 must be studied by each trader.  "Stochastic" today enjoys tremendous popularity in the trading environment.  <span>This oscillator</span> helps to identify oversold or overbought conditions in any market device.  It also reports divergence in the market. </p><p>  In addition, Stochastic gives proactive signals about the reversal of the current trend within the boundaries of the side trend (valid only during the flat period). </p><h2>  Ishimoku </h2><p>  This device attracts with its mystery.  This algorithm can synchronously indicate the current direction and predict its turn.  The amazing quality of "Ichimoku" is that due to a device such as a cloud, it helps to establish a balance of power in the market. </p><h2>  Scalping strategies </h2><p>  Each trader uses indicators for MT4.  What are the most accurate algorithms for scalping?  Scalping strategies in all markets are considered the most cost-effective - they greatly simplify the decision-making process. </p><p>  If we consider a simple minute candlestick chart, the CC1 indicator, popular among traders, shows good results.  In this option, transactions are made in the direction of the prevailing trend from the extreme units of the pointer: </p><ul><li>  sell off from level 100; </li><li>  we get from level 100. </li></ul><p>  Income is determined when the inverse boundary is reached. </p><p>  By the way, most accurate scalping indicators were first created for completely different purposes, and CCI is a prime example.  It was made to analyze trends in the commodity market even when domestic trade was possible only on some liquid stocks and futures. </p>

    <p>  As for non-standard indicators of this kind, it is not known whether there is any algorithm that can turn into a ready-made <span>trading strategy.</span>  For example, the FX Engine strategy is capable of producing intraday signals.  The Golden Varitey indicator, built on standard formulas, is a key link in this system.  It turns out that everything has been invented for a long time.  It is only necessary to correctly modernize stop loss and select the parameters. </p><p>  Nevertheless, in order to have something to compare the classics with, we give examples of non-standard algorithms.  Many readers are already familiar with Fisher, as one day his first variations were sensational on the Web - at first he was presented as the Grail, after which a ‚Äúredrawing‚Äù in history was revealed.  But in version Fisher_11, this defect was eliminated, so today it can be successfully applied on minute charts. </p><p>  Like all exact scalping pointers, Fisher can be used either in combination with other algorithms (like a filter) or separately as a signal module. </p><p>  Another relatively accurate indicator for scalping is WA Scalping.  In appearance, it is no different from other histograms.  Traders became interested in it because its authors are Arabs.  And this is very rare, since many indicators are produced either by our fellow countrymen or by colleagues in Asia and the West. </p><p>  Using WA Scalping, it is recommended to trade according to the following canons: </p><ul><li>  after the red bar has appeared - we are selling, and we set the profit only when the green one has arisen; </li><li>  in Long we act under inverse circumstances. </li></ul><p>  Most scalpers do not wait for a return signal to close a position: they use the set take profits calculated taking into account the volatility of the trading device. </p><p>  Accurate scalping indicators benefit only with prudent management of funds.  After all, a scalper should pinch off the market little by little, and not crave "at all", as in a casino. </p><h2>  Binary options </h2><p>  So, you already know what indicators to use for MT4.  The most accurate algorithms for binary options - this is what we will now consider.  In this case, the selection of the most decent signals is similar to the selection of a platform for trading.  In fact, such pointers are determined only by testing well-known strategies. </p>

    <p>  For binary options, the most reliable indicators are: </p><ul><li>  Moving averages, which are used by almost all traders.  They are considered the simplest to understand and apply.  This adaptation shows the most important course of market movement.  The downtrend is suitable for Put deals, and when the chart is turned up, the Call options are most profitable.  Exponential moving averages help smooth out some of the shortcomings of averages.  They are great for trading short-term options in high volatility markets. </li><li>  <span>Trend indicators,</span> which are a simple way to identify pronounced trends in the market.  A moving average in this case also applies to popular signals.  To determine the general market movement, it is customary to apply several charts with different periods.  The maturation of the expressed course is indicated by the simultaneous reversal of several curves in one direction.  Sometimes traders also use counter-trend indicators.  Using these pointers, you can determine the course of market development in the near future.  Such tools are most convenient for identifying points of purchase at a trend reversal. </li><li>  For binary options volume indicators are very convenient.  With their help, you can evaluate the activity of other players.  These market movement signals do not show, but with the help of them you can clearly identify the minimum and maximum, as well as determine the reinforcement of the trend with money.  Binary options traders use more than precise pointers.  The use of auxiliary signals allows us to assess the randomness of prices or market volatility.  However, they are not suitable for independent testing.  They can be used to make a decision on opening an option. </li></ul>
