The answer to this question interests many citizens who, for certain reasons, have accumulated a large number of coins.  So, you can exchange a trifle for banknotes in a store, in a bank and even at the post office.  However, not all employees of these organizations are happy to accept coins from a citizen and engage in their allocation.  You will learn more about all this from this article. </p><h2>  Short introduction </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.justiceforkenny.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to exchange coins for paper bills" class="if uuid-2781160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43172/2781160.jpg"></div><p>  What should a man do if he has accumulated a large amount of trifle?  You can go to the store and give part of the coins for the goods.  Nevertheless, most citizens prefer to exchange a trifle for paper bills.  But not everyone knows where this can be done. </p><p>  So, now you can exchange a trifle for paper money in a bank.  To do this, you just need to contact the nearest branch of Sberbank and approach any free employee.  But not the fact that a person will take a trifle. </p><p>  The thing is that a bank can, but is not required to, exchange coins for paper bills.  This must be taken into account.  Therefore, if a citizen was refused to exchange trifles for banknotes in one branch of the bank, then you can apply to another.  There is nothing special here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, when answering the question of many citizens about where it is possible to exchange a trifle for paper money, it must be said that this can be done at Sberbank.  Any friendly employee of a commercial organization will help a person with the solution of such a problem. </p><h2>  In addition to the foregoing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.atlasconcorde.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank branch" class="if uuid-2781167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43172/2781167.jpg"></div><p>  In order to exchange a trifle for banknotes in Sberbank, you just need to contact a free employee.  It will be necessary to write a statement indicating the amount of trifle that a person would like to replace with paper money.  You need to have a passport with you.  Without this document, the bank employee will not conduct the operation.  This must be remembered. </p><p>  By the way, when exchanging money at a bank, a small commission of one to three percent may be charged.  Also, citizens should be aware that if the little things are less than one hundred rubles, the operation to exchange coins for banknotes will not be carried out.  This rule must be taken into account. </p><p>  In addition, if a bank employee denied a citizen an exchange of trifles for paper money, then the latter may file a complaint with management.  But it is not a fact that an employee of a commercial organization will incur any punishment for such actions.  Moreover, he is also unlikely to be fired from work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Go to a shop </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="People in the store" class="if uuid-2781196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43172/2781196.jpg"></div><p>  Where can I change a trifle for paper money?  I would like to return to this issue once again.  So, you can do this in any store.  Nevertheless, one should not forget that the cashier of a trading network can calmly refuse to exchange a small item for banknotes to a citizen.  But it's still worth a try.  But it‚Äôs best not to exchange a large amount of little things, but to buy some product for the most part.  The remaining money can be asked to be exchanged at the checkout.  This is nothing special.  Moreover, many people who want to get rid of the little things give small money for travel in public transport, a store, and even when paying loans and utilities. </p><h2>  Visit a pharmacy </h2><p>  People always need medicine.  Therefore, part of the accumulated little things can be purchased drugs, and the rest of the coins just exchange. </p><p>  As a rule, small money should always be in pharmacies.  Otherwise, there will simply be nothing to hand over change to clients.  Therefore, employees of the pharmaceutical network will only be happy if a citizen pays for the goods in small detail and asks to exchange coins for paper bills.  So, if a citizen has accumulated a lot of iron money, then you can safely go to the pharmacy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Go to the mail </h2><div class="photo" data-original="themoscowtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="You can change money in the mail" class="if uuid-2781191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43172/2781191.jpg"></div><p>  Where can I change a trifle for paper money?  I would like to return to this issue once again.  For this purpose, you can visit the local post office.  As a rule, employees of this institution, who daily conduct a large number of cash transactions, are simply interested in having as much detail as possible at the cash register.  Otherwise, people will have nothing to hand over change from large bills. </p><p>  In addition, you can pay at the post office for utilities, such as electricity and gas.  For this, you can also use the accumulated trifle.  So do not worry about where to exchange coins for paper money. </p><h2>  Special Terminals </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sbank-gid.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coin exchange through the terminal" class="if uuid-2781185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43172/2781185.jpg"></div><p>  Time does not stand still.  Therefore, for the convenience of citizens, special devices were created with which you can very quickly and easily exchange small things for paper bills.  Unfortunately, but so far such terminals are only in Moscow.  Therefore, people living in provincial cities, until they can try in action a new banking device.  Nevertheless, in the future such terminals will appear in other cities of our country. </p><p>  The most interesting thing is that this banking device is very easy to use.  In addition, it indicates all the actions that a citizen must perform to exchange money.  In the terminal you just need to put all the available trifle, and then select the desired action.  By the way, through it you can immediately receive cash paper money or deposit this amount on your phone or card.  An exchange commission is charged by the terminal in the amount of one to three percent.  All citizens need to know this. </p><h2>  Open an account </h2><div class="photo" data-original="russia-ic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Customer service" class="if uuid-2781177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43172/2781177.jpg"></div><p>  Where to exchange a trifle for paper money?  The simplest thing is to deposit them into your bank account.  As a rule, only ten rubles are required when opening a savings book.  So, why not deposit this amount on a small change?  In this case, you only need a passport and a desire to become a regular customer of the bank.  So there is nothing complicated.  Moreover, when opening an account, you can deposit all the available trifle into your account, and then withdraw money from it through the bank's cash desk, but with paper bills.  This is completely legal and no one can refuse it. </p><h2>  Loan payment </h2><p>  Where can I exchange a trifle from a piggy bank?  In this case, everything is very simple.  Especially if a person has financial obligations to the bank.  You can simply give all the available trifle as a loan installment.  Thus, you do not have to exchange anything.  But a small portion of the debt will already be paid. </p><p>  Moreover, if a citizen wants to pay a loan installment in detail through the cash desk of a commercial organization, an employee of the same bank has no right to refuse him.  Indeed, in such a situation, it does not matter with what money - small or large, the necessary amount will be paid.  The main thing is that loan installments are timely. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  Where can I exchange, change the little things?  This is best done through special terminals.  But at present they are available only to residents and guests of the capital.  Therefore, if you want to exchange a trifle, you need to contact the nearest branch of Sberbank or a store, as well as a pharmacy.  But one must be prepared for the fact that even in these organizations one can be denied.  Therefore, a trifle needs to be spent gradually, for example, to pay for bus fare or when buying some products.  So it will be much easier than asking a cashier in a store or an operator at the post office to exchange several hundred small money for paper bills.  This must be taken into account. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  How to exchange a trifle for banknotes?  To do this, you need to visit the nearest branch of Sberbank and ask any free employee to help a citizen in a similar situation.  To do this, you will need to write an application and provide your passport.  I would also like to note that a person should be prepared for the fact that he will be refused.  Nevertheless, you should not be upset and you can visit another branch of the bank. </p><p>  In addition, part of the little things, as mentioned earlier, is best given for the purchase of some goods in the distribution network or spent on the payment of part of the installment for a loan, utilities.  This option is perhaps the best. </p><p>  Is it possible to exchange a trifle for banknotes in a bank?  The answer in this case will be positive.  But bank employees do not always want to engage in such operations.  Therefore, a citizen may also be denied the exchange of small money for paper bills. </p>
