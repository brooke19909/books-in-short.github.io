The main directions and history of research</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Relations between people and animals began to take shape even in primitive times.  Knowing the habits and behavioral patterns of the various inhabitants of our planet was vital for people living in that distant time.  Some species of animals were so dangerous that a meeting with them threatened imminent death for a careless hunter.  Only knowledge of the mechanisms that drive these ferocious beings could save a life in such a situation. </p><h2>  Primitive times </h2><p>  Previously, the attitude towards animals was completely different than today.  This is evidenced by numerous cave paintings and primitive works of art of that time.  If the present person considers himself to be the owner of the earth and considers animals a soulless resource that must be used for his own purposes, then our ancestors treated this issue quite differently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="animal science is called" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40566/1183127.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Then the animals were revered, studied with them, some were even deified.  Not only man changes the world, adapting to constantly changing environmental conditions.  Evolution perfectly adapted all living things to their environment.  For example, ants can teach the correct organization of collective work and even the principles of building all kinds of structures.  Beavers show an example of how mind and assertiveness can change the world.  The tiger is an excellent hunter with excellent reflexes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In those days, there were sciences that studied the behavior of animals.  Naturally, they were much simpler, but, despite this, they led to mutually beneficial cooperation.  So, dogs could warn about the approach of strangers, in return receiving part of the food obtained by people.  Observation of wild animals could provide information about the approach of a natural disaster.  It is not surprising that the strikingly sharp feelings of animals evoked reverence and a desire to imitate them. </p><h2>  History of animal behavior and psyche research </h2><p>  When did the modern knowledge system that studies the psyche of animals began to develop?  We can say that this research trend originated in the XIX century, thanks to Jean Baptiste Lamarck.  Today, the science of animal behavior is called ethology and has many followers around the world, but in those days, such knowledge was more likely to belong to philosophy than to the natural sciences.  Lamarck was the first to set forth the theory that organisms change under the influence of the external environment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the name of animal behavior science" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40566/1183130.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The talented Frenchman believed that the transformations taking place in the physiology of living beings were caused by the reaction of their nervous system to continuously changing living conditions.  He believed that at first the psyche of the animal changes, and then the qualities necessary for adaptation are developed, which are transmitted to the next generations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Revolutionary approach </h2><p>  Lamarck identified the main directions in the study of animal behavior for many years to come.  He argued that the psyche depends on the nervous system and identified three main mental acts - irritability, sensitivity and consciousness.  In addition, he believed that instincts occupy a key place in the life of animals, as they allow you to act correctly, without wasting time thinking and uncertainty.  It is interesting that Lamarck did not set a man apart from animals, as his colleagues like to do. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ethology animal science and" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40566/1183131.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of course, one cannot talk about ethology without mentioning Charles Darwin.  The contribution of this outstanding person to science cannot be overestimated.  His work, entitled ‚ÄúManifestation of Emotions in Animals and Man,‚Äù examined the behavior of living beings from the point of view of evolution, which served as the basis for further scientific research of his students and followers. </p><h2>  Darwin </h2><p>  Ethology is the science of animal behavior, and other related industries owe much to Charles Darwin.  This non-standard person was born in the UK, where he was educated at the best universities in the country.  But his innovative conclusions were not made in laboratories and libraries.  For six years he traveled the world, watching animals, studying their behavior and aureole.  Do not be Darwin, who knows how modern science would develop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It was the works of Charles Darwin that studied man and animals from an evolutionary point of view.  The scientist believed that the qualities that his colleagues attributed only to the individual (curiosity, attentiveness, love, imitation) are among our smaller brothers.  Often they are poorly developed, but in some cases they are not inferior to humans.  Also, many instinctive reactions, such as hair straightening or teeth grinning are inherent in both animals and humans.  It was Darwin's works that became the basis on which the research of the founders of ethology - Lorentz and Tinbergen was built. </p><h2>  Darwin's findings </h2><p>  The conclusions reached by this tireless researcher were fundamentally different from the generally accepted dogmas of that time.  It was he who began the objective, not subjective study of the psyche.  The main areas of animal behavior science have evolved through this approach.  Previously, scientists considered man to be something separate from nature, thought that its laws did not apply to people and did not affect them in any way.  Of course, such ridiculous conclusions only entertained the pride of such researchers, but did not develop science. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="main directions in the study of animal behavior" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40566/1183125.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Darwin abandoned these illusions.  Moreover, he came to the conclusion that humans and primates have a common ancestor, since their instincts are similar to each other.  He also identified three main categories of behavior - instincts, learning ability and reasoning ability.  In his opinion, the difference between the psyche of humans and animals was not in quality, but in the degree of development. </p><h2>  Ethology </h2><p>  The science of animal behavior is called ethology.  <span>Conrad Lorenz</span> and Nico Tinbergen are considered its founders.  It was these zoologists who decided to combine an evolutionary and causal approach to the study of animal behavior.  They were interested in the reasons why the beast performs this or that action, what significance does it have for the survival of the species and its evolutionary formation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of animal behavior and psyche research" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40566/1183128.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Ethology is the science of instincts.  In this case, the behavior of animals is pointless without considering their habitat.  Lorenz, Tinbergen, and other scientists working in this field understood that instincts were formed as an organism‚Äôs attempt to adapt to environmental conditions.  Therefore, it is the habitat that forms both the physiological characteristics of the species and its behavioral reactions. </p><h2>  Principles of Ethology </h2><p>  Most ordinary people don‚Äôt even know what the name of the animal behavior science is called.  And ethology, by the way, is a serious discipline.  Scientists in this industry base their conclusions on materials obtained by observing animals in their natural habitat.  The development of technology has greatly simplified this process.  Now ethologists can record the behavior of animals on video, make audio recordings.  This allows not only to examine in more detail every moment in the life of a particular species, but also to share it with colleagues.  Also, the camcorder can observe the life of wild animals without disturbing them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ethology nystinct science animal behavior" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40566/1183126.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This allowed modern scientists to learn the main features of the formation of instincts, to get acquainted with the role of stimuli that trigger them.  Ethologists are trying to better learn about the role of acquired and innate qualities.  It turned out that some instincts develop even when the animal does not interact with the stimulus that causes them.  It is interesting that it is instincts that ensure the harmonious coexistence of individuals of one species and their dispersal in a certain territory. </p><h2>  The Importance of Ethology </h2><p>  As you already know, the <span>science of animal behavior is</span> called ethology.  This word is not common, but the importance of discipline is very great.  Observation of wild animals in their natural habitat helps to better understand the world around and, accordingly, better adapt to it.  After all, everything on the planet is interconnected, each type of living creature, one way or another, affects the entire ecosystem.  Moreover, by studying the behavior of animals, we can draw interesting conclusions about ourselves, to understand why people do this, and not differently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="animal behavior sciences" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40566/1183129.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Not everyone knows the name of the science of animal behavior, but most of us use its fruits.  Research in this area will optimize such an important industry as animal husbandry.  Today, this industry is fully automated, turned into a ruthless conveyor that uses the most primitive concepts of living things.  The resulting product is of terrible quality, not to mention the harm it does to the health of consumers.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to conduct objective research on this topic, as livestock companies are very rich.  If you apply the knowledge gained by ethologists in agriculture, then the quality of the products produced will necessarily increase. </p><h2>  Prospects </h2><p>  The science of animal behavior is called ethology and is one of the most important areas today.  Man has exploited nature for too long, without thinking about what he is doing.  However, the knowledge gained by ethologists can put an end to this.  Putting these studies into practice will help restore the natural order of things on Earth.  Understanding how animal instincts were formed will allow us to look into the past of our own species, to understand the conditions in which our ancestors lived, and, finally, to reveal the secret of human origin. </p>
