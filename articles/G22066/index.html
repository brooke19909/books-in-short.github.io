    <p>  How did the collapse of the USSR?  The causes and consequences of this event are still of interest to historians and political scientists.  It is interesting in that so far not everything is clear about the situation that developed in the early 1990s.  Now many residents of the CIS would like to return to those times and again unite in one of the most powerful states in the world.  So why then did people stop believing in a happy future together?  This is one of the most important issues that many are interested in today. </p><p>  The event, which occurred at the end of December 1991, entailed the creation of 15 independent states.  The reasons for the <span>collapse of the USSR</span> lie in the country's economic crisis and in the distrust of the simple Soviet people to power, no matter what party it represents.  Proceeding from this, the collapse of the USSR, the causes and consequences of this event are associated with the fact that the Supreme Council of the <span>Soviet Union</span> after the self-recusation of President of the State M. Gorbachev  decided to cease the existence of a country that won two wars. </p><p>  Currently, historians identify only a few reasons for the collapse of the USSR.  Among the main versions, the following can be distinguished: </p><p>  - too tight a political system in the country, which forbade many liberties to the people in the field of religion, censorship, commerce, etc .; </p><p>  - not entirely successful attempts by the Gorbachev government to rebuild the political system of the Soviet Union through reforms that led to the economic and <span>political crisis</span> ; </p><p>  - the lack of power in the regions, because almost all important decisions were made by Moscow (even regarding those issues that were completely and completely in the competence of the regions); </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - the war in Afghanistan, the cold war against the United States, the constant financial support of other socialist states, despite the fact that some areas of life required significant reconstruction. </p><p>  <span>The collapse of the USSR,</span> causes and consequences led to the fact that the <span>economic crisis of</span> that time was transferred to the new 15 states.  So maybe it wasn‚Äôt worth rushing with the collapse.  After all, this declaration did not significantly change the situation among the people.  Maybe in a few years the Soviet Union could even out and calmly continue its development? </p><p>  Perhaps the reasons and consequences of the collapse of the USSR are also related to the fact that some states were frightened of the new form of power, when many liberals and nationalists passed into parliament and themselves left <span>the union.</span>  Among these countries were the following: Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Georgia, Armenia and Moldova.  Most likely, it was they who set an excellent example to the rest of the republics, and they even more began to desire a disconnection.  And if these six states waited a little?  Maybe then it would be possible to maintain the integrity of the borders and political system of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  The collapse of the USSR, the causes and consequences of this event were accompanied by various political congresses and referenda, which, unfortunately, did not bring the desired result.  Therefore, at the end of 1991, almost no one believed in the future of the largest country in the whole world. </p><p>  The most famous consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union are as follows: </p><p>  - instant transformation of the Russian Federation, where Yeltsin immediately carried out several economic and political reforms; </p><p>  - there were many ethnic wars (mainly these events took place in the Caucasus territories); </p><p>  - the division of the Black Sea Fleet, the collapse of the Armed Forces of the state and the division of territories that took place between recently friendly nations. </p><p>  Everyone must decide for themselves whether we did the right thing in 1991, or if we had to wait a bit and allow the country to recover from many problems and continue our happy existence. </p>
