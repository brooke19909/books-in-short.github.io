    <h2>  Khan Nagai and foot </h2><p>  One of their legends says that once lived Khan of Nagai, his tribe was engaged in breeding horses and cattle.  To make it easier to control wayward animals, drovers used lashes.  In honor of the prince and his people, lashes began to be called whips. </p><p>  According to another version, the lash was small and for convenience it was not worn in the hands, not on the shoulders, but removed by the bootleg.  The name is associated with the human foot.  The lash was next to the leg and gradually it became known as a whip.  These are the different stories associated with this thing that exist. </p><p>  Since ancient times, the whip was considered a Cossack <span>military weapon.</span>  Although initially it was an accessory decorating the ceremonial form of the Cossack.  During the Patriotic War of 1812, the Cossacks opposed the French soldiers, if the main weapon of the Cossack failed, he used the whip and very successfully.  A Cossack combat Nagayka could be a formidable weapon in experienced hands, with its help they knocked down the enemy from the horse, knocked out the weapon from his hands and inflicted heavy, and sometimes even fatal wounds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Already in peace days, the whip was used as a tool for punishing the guilty Cossacks.  It was also used when <span>hunting wolves,</span> so as not to waste gunpowder. </p><p>  By decree of Emperor Alexander III, published at the end of the 19th century, it became an obligatory item to be worn by a Cossack. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="battle Cossack" class="if" height="495" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/1364352.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Century-old traditions </h2><p>  The most expensive and honorable gift was considered a whip.  Usually she received the groom at the wedding as a gift from the future father-in-law.  It was believed that the Cossack whip could be owned only by a married Cossack.  In the house she didn‚Äôt wallow <span>anyhow,</span> but hung in a certain place in the bedroom. </p><p>  If the owner of the house threw a whip at the guest‚Äôs feet, he had to lift it and hug the owner, thereby showing his respect.  If she remained lying on the <span>floor, the person</span> did not want to show his humility to the owner and he had reasons for resentment. </p><p>  If two Cossacks were in a quarrel, they could exchange whips - and the insults were considered forgotten.  If it was given, it was considered a special privilege rendered to a person for any services or as a sign of good relations.  When discussing any issue at a meeting of Cossacks, the raised Cossack nut was considered a sign of consent and approval. </p><p>  She was even credited with special power.  It was believed that she was able to scare away evil spirits, so she was hanged over the cradle of an unbaptized baby. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When the Cossack died, a whip was put in the coffin along with a saber. </p><p>  Each Cossack had to be able to own these weapons.  Only boys from 8 years old were taught to 12. In the training they used techniques of folk dances and games. </p><h2>  The main stages of ownership technique </h2><p>  Nagayka was to be an extension of the hand, only then it became a serious weapon that could protect its master from offenders.  Before proceeding to the development of ownership techniques, it was necessary to learn how to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Rotate it in different directions and at different speeds, without touching itself. </li><li>  Rotate the nut, weighted, which was attached to the tip of the whip. </li><li>  Learn to handle two lashes. </li></ol><p>  When the basic elements of possession were assimilated, they went on to practice striking.  Three main types of striking are known: </p><ul><li>  With return.  The ultimate goal of this strike is to defeat an adversary by grabbing his arms, legs or the whole body. </li><li>  Beat the slap.  It is applied at the very end of the whip, and it is necessary at an angle of 90 <sup>0.</sup> </li><li>  With a guy.  After hitting the hand, you need to quickly pull back so that there is a feeling of cutting the blow. </li></ul><p>  Secrets of ownership passed from father to son, from generation to generation. </p>

    <h2>  What is the Cossack whip </h2><p>  The handle and lash are the two main elements that make up the Cossack whip.  The photo presented above perfectly demonstrates this. </p><p>  The handle was made of wood, which could be braided with leather.  The handle of 10-15 centimeters is always shorter than the whip.  There are two loops: one larger for the owner‚Äôs hand, the other smaller for pushing the curled lash when not in use. </p><p>  The lash was made of leather.  In ancient times, there were two of them: one for the horse or other animals, and the other for use in the battle with the enemy.  That whip, which was not needed, was retracted into the handle, and if necessary, it was taken out. </p><p>  The lash consists of several parts: a fringe, located at the very beginning of the lash, the main part, braided with straps and a small bag of leather, at the end of the lash, in which the load is placed, to strengthen the blow. </p>

    <h2>  Types of Crap </h2><p>  There are two types of craps: </p><p>  1. Don. </p><p>  The Don Cossack Nagayka is distinguished by the length of its wooden handle and lash, which is 15-20 cm longer.  The length of the handle itself is from 30 to 45 cm. During use, the whip rotates around the handle with rotational movements. </p><p>  2. Kuban. </p><p>  The length of the handle is much shorter than that of the Don.  Moreover, it is braided by the skin and a sharp transition to the whip is not observed.  Due to this, it is very convenient to strike with a click. </p><h2>  Manufacturing technique </h2><p>  In the old days, in every village, each master had his own secrets of making nuts, which were kept secret.  It is quite possible to do Cossack whips with your hands today, having the necessary knowledge and materials. </p><p>  Previously, they were made from cattle skin, and the skin had to be moist all the time.  They started the manufacturing process with a handle, inserted hair or a stick into it, which were braided with leather straps. </p><p>  But it is not necessary to look for the skin of an animal to make a whip these days, an ordinary leather jacket, which has already fallen into disrepair, is quite enough. </p>

    <p>  Whether this tool will be the subject of cruelty and mockery of the weaker, or vice versa, the subject of pride, honor and dignity, depends only on its owner.  The owner of a nagaika must remember the glorious history of the Cossacks, and then it will be in good hands, and the traditions of our distant ancestors will be preserved. </p>
