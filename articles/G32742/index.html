    <p>  Krasnodar Territory is the Russian territory.  Such famous resorts as Sochi, Anapa, Gelendzhik and others are located here. Crimea returned to Russia in 2014, and now Russian tourists do not need to cross the Ukrainian border in order to get to the peninsula.  Gurzuf, Yalta, Feodosiya, Sudak, Yevpatoriya, Koktebel, Alushta and Alupka and many, many other cities and towns of Crimea will be happy to receive guests in the summer season.  Many tourists, "savages" - both Russian and Ukrainian - prefer the local inexpensive budget vacation on the Black Sea.  Unfortunately, Ukraine is now in an unstable state, and mainly in 2014, only Russians go on vacation to the Crimean coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now let's talk about sunny Abkhazia.  This area was once part of Georgia and was part of the USSR.  But after perestroika, everything changed dramatically, and now it is a separate state.  However, in order to enter the country, Russian citizens do not need a passport.  If you have long dreamed of traveling savage to the Black Sea, relaxing in such picturesque places as Pitsunda, Gagra, Sukhumi or New Athos will not disappoint you.  In addition, the local population in these places is distinguished by traditional hospitality and goodwill. </p><h2>  Youth holidays in Crimea </h2><p>  Youth is not afraid of extreme sports!  And if older people, having arrived to the south as "savages", prefer to settle in a cozy private sector with all amenities, then young people often go south with a tent.  Remember the famous movie "Three + Two"?  That's about the same as in that movie!  Only in our time you can relax in specially equipped campsites, it is much safer and prudent from all points of view. </p>

    <p>  In Crimea, near the city of Alushta, there is a pennant camp "Pennant", located in the forest.  On its territory there is water and light, as well as gas, toilets and a kitchen.  A wonderful holiday on the Black Sea is provided by the Green Shelter and Heraclea campgrounds located in Laspi Bay. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Near Foros there is a Bastion camp, between Alushta and Partenit you can stay in a tent in a camp called Utes, in Koktebel every summer there is a camping camp Khimik, etc. All these youth camps are set up in very picturesque places, not far from from the sea.

    <p>  The Green Shelter is located in Laspi Bay, in a juniper forest.  The guests are offered 2- and 3-seater modern tents, in which there are inflatable comfortable beds and bedding.  There is a dining room on site, and amenities include toilets and showers.  The highlight of this place is that 500 meters from the camp there is a nudist beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another place where you can spend a wonderful vacation on the Black Sea coast in the Crimea is the Hercules camp, which is also located in the bay of Laspi.  This campsite is 40 km from Sevastopol.  Fans of scuba diving are especially eager for this, since it is in the local waters that the so-called stone garden is located, consisting of bizarre piles of stone blocks of various shapes.  On the territory of the tent camp there is a first-aid post, there is a parking lot, toilets, a dining room and a shower. </p><h2>  Camp "Cliff" </h2><p>  The Black Sea, camping, the abundance of the sun, magnificent mountain views, a cheerful youth company, clean air saturated with the smell of relict trees - this is what awaits tourists in the Utes camp.  The tent camp is located between Alushta and Partenit.  From the high coast, an extensive view of the <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãcoast</span> opens <span>,</span> stretching from Sudak to Alushta.  5 meters from the camp flows a clear mountain stream, hits a spring, from which you can drink water. </p>

    <p>  The nature here is almost wild, stone cliffs and trees close the clearing with tents from the rest of the civilized world.  In order to swim in the sea, you will have to go down from a height of 40 m. Usually, the descent takes 3-4 minutes, but the climb to the camp will be longer - 5-6 minutes.  We can say that these conditions are most suitable for young, strong and healthy people.  The pebble beaches below are equipped with free showers.  The water in the sea is clean and clear.  Like everywhere in the Crimea, there is something to see in the vicinity of the camp.  If tourists decide to unite to go on an excursion, then the commandant remains on duty at the camp, so you can be calm for the safety of the property. </p><h2>  "Bastion" and "Chemist" </h2><p>  Camp "Bastion" is located in the southernmost point of the Crimea, near Foros.  Like most of these youth camps, it is divided in the forest, on a high bank (height - 70 m above sea level).  Descent to the nearest <span>wild beach</span> can take about half an hour, and 2-3 minutes will have to go down a very steep path.  But there is an alternative: you can go to the sea to equipped beaches through the park.  This is one of the most beautiful places on the Crimean peninsula.  Around - picturesque "stone chaos", a gorgeous view of the sea, the Foros Church.  Nearby is one of the attractions of the Crimean coast - <span>Forossky Park.</span>  Every year during the summer months many lovers of silence and solitude come to the Bastion, and they are not disappointed. </p><p>  And now it's time to talk about a recreation center located near Koktebel.  That's <span>where it's nice to relax</span> at sea with a tent!  Many have heard about the marvelous beauty of the local nature.  "The land of blue peaks" - this is how the word "cocktail" is translated from the Turkic language.  The village is located in a bay, protected from the wind and fog by the mountains, near the long-extinct Kara-Dag volcano.  This area is famous not only for the exquisite beauty of the landscape, but also for its climate.  It is so soft, dry and warm that even in winter, roses bloom here.  Here in such a beautiful place and camping "Chemist" and sheltered.  The territory of the tent camp is well equipped: there is a fence and 24-hour security, a shower, a toilet, washbasins, a left-luggage office.  Near <span>the recreation center</span> there are grocery and clothing stores, a bazaar, canteens, as well as a dolphinarium and a water park.  From the gates of the camp to the sea - only 30 meters.  An important detail: after 23.00 it is forbidden to make noise at the camp site, security is strictly watching this, so night discos are excluded.  Those who like to walk at night are invited to do this outside the campground. </p><h2>  With a tent in the Krasnodar Territory! </h2><p>  Camping on the Black Sea coast <span>in the Krasnodar Territory is</span> organized for visitors literally near each resort city and village.  Here are a few names of the most popular and visited places where you can live in tents: campsites "Pine Paradise", "Juniper", "Credo", "Natalkina", "Gluboky", "Nazarova Dacha", "Circassian Gorge" (Arkhipo-Osipovka ), "Sail", "Crab Bay", "Juniper Grove" (Kabardinka village), "Pine", "Thin Cape" (Gelendzhik);  Parking: on the Kiseleva rock (Tuapse), in the Grekova Slit, in the Snake Slit, in the Dark Slit (Krinitsa).  And this is not a complete list of places adapted for "wild" recreation. </p><p>  Tourists need to know that at campsites they can count on a maximum of amenities, while at the parking lot the benefits of civilization can be absent almost completely.  The latter option is suitable for those people who are looking for maximum privacy and do not like noisy companies. </p><h2>  Recreation, Black Sea.  Kabardinka, camping "Parus" </h2><p>  The village of Kabardinka is located just 15 kilometers from the city of Gelendzhik.  It has amazingly beautiful places and a healing climate.  It is believed that this place in its climatic conditions resembles the southern coast of the Black Sea.  The swimming season here lasts almost from May to November.  For the "savages" there are many cozy places. </p><p>  Autocamping "Sail" (formerly "Dubrovka") found shelter on the very shore of the sea, opposite the famous children's recreation center "Orlyonok".  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe recreation area is almost 3 hectares.  Here you can park up to 100 cars, including a place for buses and minibuses.  Camping has its own pebble beach, where there are canopies and changing rooms.  Tents are only 10 meters from the beach.  What is important: they stand in the clearing under the pine trees, and this adds to the extra heat in the heat.  Here is a wonderful vacation!  Krasnodar Territory, the Black Sea, the lush southern nature and freedom that every true "savage" dreams of - all this awaits vacationers near Kabardinka. </p>

As you can see, everything is provided for here, and even savages with children can feel quite comfortable in such a wild recreation area. </p><h2>  "Crab Bay", "Juniper Grove" or "Lavender" - the choice is yours! </h2><p>  We continue to talk about wild summer vacations on the Black Sea, or rather, about the best places for it.  Between Novorossiysk and Kabardinka, almost in the center of Tsemess Bay, right on the slope of the picturesque coastal ridge there is a camping with the sea name "Crab Bay".

A large landscaped pebble beach - 500 meters in length, next to the boarding house "Kabardinka".  This campsite is considered one of the best on the coast.  In it you can get a relaxing wellness vacation on the Black Sea.  Gelendzhik, by the way, is very close, so the connection with civilization will not be completely lost. </p>

    <p>  Another good offer for savages is the Lavanda camp site, located in the very center of the village of Kabardinka.  It also has all modern amenities, including water and light.  The territory is under reliable protection.  The tent camp itself is in the shadow of sprawling trees, so that even on the hottest day you can enjoy the coolness and breeze. </p><h2>  Campsites Arkhipo-Osipovka </h2><p>  Campers located near the village of Arkhipo-Osipovka are ready to provide the best holidays on the Black Sea.  Camp "Pine Paradise" will give its guests the opportunity to breathe in the wonderful healing air of a pine forest.  From tents to the sea - about 150 m, there are toilets, showers, barbecue facilities for cooking hot food on fire. </p><p>  Autocamping "Natalkina" belongs to the local forestry.  The campground is set up under juniper trees, the territory is quite large and well-maintained.  Nearby is the camping "Alesya".  Here you can comfortably organize family vacations with children.  The camp area has all the necessary amenities. </p><p>  Here is another good camping near Arkhipo-Osipovka - "Deep".  It is located on a high seashore, so that vacationers have breathtaking views of the Black Sea landscapes.  The facilities are also on top. </p><p>  The next campsite, which I would like to say more in detail, is called "Quiet".  It is located in a quiet and beautiful forest corner.  Here it is possible to settle both in tourist tents and in trailers equipped with kitchens, bathrooms and a shower. </p><h2>  Should I go to rest with a tent in Abkhazia? </h2><p>  Is Abkhazia suitable for camping?  This question is controversial.  On the one hand, the nature of those places is so beautiful that one wants to be alone with it, but on the other hand, you need to think about your safety.  If you want to go to the Black Sea with a tent savage, a <span>vacation in Abkhazia is</span> probably not the best option.  Although there, of course, there are campsites and parking for lovers of freedom.  For example, on the way to the famous <span>Ritsa Lake,</span> there is a guarded tent city, but, frankly, it is located too far from the Black Sea.  If you are traveling to Abkhazia, it is best to stop at a private residence, well, or in a hotel. </p><h2>  Benefits of Wildlife </h2><p>  The vast majority of people believe that only those who do not have enough money for more comfortable conditions go to sea with a tent.  Of course, a wild vacation on the Black Sea eats much less money than living in a sanatorium or rest house.  Even a cheap Crimean private sector will make you spend much more than living in a free space in a tent city. </p><p>  But the reality is that not only citizens with limited monetary resources prefer to rest savages.  As mentioned earlier, the main admirers of such a life in the south are young people.  As a rule, young people travel with companies to relax, and for her there is nothing better than living next door to "tramps" like them.  Rest on the Black Sea with a tent involves night swimming, and songs around the campfire with a guitar.  And how nice, tired of the day from the sun, endless swims and playing beach volleyball, falling asleep in the fresh air to the sound of the sea surf! </p><p>  There are nature lovers who, for no reason, would agree to exchange such a life for something more civilized.  There are "savages", so to speak, by vocation. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of relaxing with a tent </h2><p>  Of course, not everything is as cloudless as it can be imagined.  Outdoor life can bring many unpleasant surprises.  For example, a tourist may need urgent medical care, and getting it in a tent camp will be quite problematic, especially if he is far from the city. </p><p> Not all campsites have a full range of necessary amenities (toilets, kitchen, etc.).  So when choosing a place for your wild vacation you need not be too lazy and collect as much information as possible about the various camps.  For some vacationers, a big drawback may be the lack of shops, although with a car you can easily overcome a couple of kilometers to the nearest village and buy everything you need.  If you are driving a savage to the Black Sea, vacation can be very extreme, this must be taken into account. </p><p>  Camping life can be quite noisy.  Songs with a guitar and night discos in the fresh air can last until the morning, so lovers of sleep in silence are unlikely to be happy with such extreme sports.  In specially equipped secluded parking lots, where there are not so many people and tents, there is much more calm and silence, of course, but there are usually no amenities there.  In addition, no one will be responsible for the safety of your things.  Meanwhile, as you know, tents cannot be locked.  So to leave valuable things and money in them is not recommended. </p><h2>  What you need to take with you on a trip </h2><p>  In order for an inexpensive vacation on the Black Sea to bring you only positive emotions, you must definitely take a full medicine chest with you on the road.  You never know what kind of misfortune can happen on vacation!  You can accidentally injure your leg on glass, hit, your head or stomach may hurt.  All such cases must be well secured.  A small supply of drinking water and non-perishable products with a long shelf life is also better to take with you on the road.  Perhaps, there will be no need for all this, since the modern "wild" vacation in the tent towns is quite comfortable in the domestic plan.  But different surprises cannot be ruled out.  Crimea is waiting for its guests!  We wish you a pleasant stay and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãvivid impressions! </p>
