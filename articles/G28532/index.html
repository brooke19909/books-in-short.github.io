    <h2>  Cyprus, vacation in november: weather </h2><p>  The life expectancy of indigenous Cypriots is higher than in developed countries.  The reason for this is the healthiest climate on Earth.  The inhabitants of the island do not know infectious diseases.  This is another of the reasons that attract tourists to the resorts of Cyprus.  Summer is hot, up to 35 <sup>¬∞</sup> C, winter is mild and warm - 10-15 ¬∞ C, snow falls in the mountainous areas, and then the resort turns into a ski resort.  Not too bad, right? <sup> </sup>  The official holiday season opens in April and ends in October. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The weather conditions in Cyprus in November cannot be unambiguously described.  Year to year is not necessary.  The beginning of the month is more often the continuation of velvet October, maybe only more precipitation.  It should be understood that precipitation is in Cypriot, this is not a long rainy season.  A cloud will hit, rain will pass and after an hour the sun will shine again.  But you need to stock up on an umbrella for this time.  The second half of November is cooler.  If the air warms up to 21-22 ¬∞ C during the day, then at night the thermometer can drop to 12-13 ¬∞ C. This temperature regime is suitable for tourists who like walks on the coast, but cannot tolerate the heat.  You can‚Äôt exactly name the place where it is warmer in Cyprus in November.  The temperature is almost the same in all resorts, but there are special places for a beach holiday in the off-season.  One of them is the beach, not far from the Connos Bay Hotel in Protaras.  It is protected on all sides by rocks, and the water here remains warm for a long time. </p><p>  If we compare the amount of precipitation, Nicosia will be relatively "dry", and Ayia Napa will be the most "wet". </p>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Do they bathe in Cyprus in November?  Quite possible.  The first days of the month, when the sea still stores the warmth of a sunny summer, swimming is comfortable.  Gradually, the water gets cooler, especially after rain.  The water and air temperatures in November are identical: 21-22 ¬∞ C. For someone, such water is an excellent option, but for someone who loves 25 <sup>¬∞</sup> C <sup> </sup>  and higher, swimming pools are offered in hotels and pensions.  You can sunbathe and just breathe in the sea healing rest without fear of sunburn under the hot rays, although it is recommended to apply sunscreen even during this period.  Those who do not agree to visit Cyprus and not plunge into the sea, it is better to choose Limassol for relaxation.  This resort is located in a small lagoon and is hidden from the winds, so it feels like the temperature is a couple of degrees higher.  A full <span>beach holiday in Cyprus</span> in early November, judging by the reviews, the phenomenon is not rare. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cyprus, vacation in november: prices, shopping, discounts </h2><p>  Active tourist life in Cyprus in November calms down.  But calms down - does not mean to stop.  The island is always open for tourists.  Silent - this means that you can get a relaxing holiday without noisy companies and crowds of tourists.  As for prices: tours to Cyprus in November cannot be called a budget holiday, Cyprus is still an expensive resort, but with the beginning of November everything becomes cheaper by 30-40%.  Agree, this is a significant plus.  Travel agencies during this period offer extended excursion programs, which are less successful in the hot season.  Under the scorching sun, it‚Äôs somehow not up to trips.  November is a season of abundance of southern fruits just harvested from fields and orchards. </p><p>  In the tourism sector, everything is getting cheaper by the first days of the month, but this process does not affect prices in stores.  If anyone hopes to ‚Äúshake‚Äù Cypriot shops in the offseason, then this is not the best choice.  The fact is that the discount time here is strictly defined by law: April and February.  There may still be sales at the end of summer and before the New Year - that's it.  In other times, shops in Cyprus are expensive. </p>

    <h2>  Gastronomic tourism </h2><p>  Why is rest associated only with the beach?  Yes, the water in Cyprus in November may not be pleasant to everyone in its warmth, but the air temperature is suitable for long and exciting trips and exploring the whole island.  November is the time to harvest grapes, vegetables and fruits.  Exciting trips through the villages will help you learn the other side of Cyprus life, not the resort.  <span>Local flavor,</span> culture of life, traditions - this is new material for understanding the world.  And if you consider that in such places you can try real homemade cheeses, wines, olive oil, sweets and pastries, then such an informative tour will be doubly pleasant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Those who have already tried the rest in Cyprus in November, leave reviews about their favorite places.  So, for Cypriot honey, it is recommended to go to the village of Kornos, and try real Turkish delight - in Geroskipou.  Craftsmen also offer to buy souvenirs of folk crafts.  Pottery, tablecloths of handmade embroidery are amazing in beauty, of course, are not cheap, manual laborious work nevertheless. </p><p>  Only in November is a local holiday - the festival of zivania.  Zivania is a traditional alcoholic drink, a local ‚Äúwhiskey‚Äù made from grapes.  Good holiday, don‚Äôt say it.  the venue is the villages of Pelendri and Alona.  In addition to tasting the drink, they offer products and dishes of national cuisine. </p>

    <h2>  Walk outdoors </h2><p>  November for us is a habitually dull, rainy and gray period, causing in many people drowsiness, runny nose and depression.

What you must visit: </p><ul><li>  Transparent Blue Lagoon. </li><li>  The romantic village of Lania, on the banks of the reservoir. </li><li>  The most beautiful waterfall in the Troodos mountains. </li><li>  Landscapes and views from Cape Cavo Greco. </li><li>  A salt lake, not far from Larnaca, where thousands of flamingos live. </li><li>  Garden of spicy herbs in the village of Avgorou. </li><li>  Camel park in the village of Mazotos. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Party People </h2><p>  With the end of the season, most nightclubs and other entertainment venues are closed, some hotels await the same fate, most of which are designed for beach activities.  Most - but not all.  For those who can not imagine relaxation without noisy night companies, bright lights and music, there are establishments along the embankments that work year-round and wait for their visitors with the onset of darkness.  Ayia Napa is especially attractive in this regard. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of November Cyprus </h2><p>  So, to summarize our study on the theme "Cyprus, vacation in November."  The weather of this period is odd to our November, but beach vacations may not take place due to cold water and rains.  What else needs to be provided: </p><ul><li>  To travel to this region during the off-season, you need to know in advance which hotels and pensions are open and which are closed.  Especially if the trip is planned with children. </li><li>  Many entertainment venues are also closed. </li><li>  Infrequently, but there are days with cold gusty winds and heavy rain.  See the forecast, it‚Äôs a pity if these couple of days fall on vacation. </li><li>  In November, the second flowering of trees, herbs and many flowers begins.  Beauty can be dangerous for allergy sufferers. </li></ul><p>  And now the good news: there are still more advantages. </p><ul><li>  Reviews of tourists say that most often in November they still bathed, sunbathed and even sunburned. </li><li>  The situation is relaxing from the hustle and bustle, as everywhere is much calmer. </li><li>  Prices for all services, including excursions and spa, are much lower. </li><li>  There is no sweltering heat that prevents you from viewing the sights of the island. </li><li>  Time for walks, contemplation of beautiful landscapes, close acquaintance with the life and customs of the local population.  During this period, it is generally advised not to go to fashionable hotels, but to look for places in small private pensions in the villages: comfort is not less, but there are more impressions. </li><li>  When, if not in November, try out the local cuisine. </li><li>  An abundance of cheap freshest fruits. </li><li>  The period when it is necessary to strengthen the immune system and improve the body. </li><li>  A good way to shorten the gloomy rainy autumn season. </li></ul>
