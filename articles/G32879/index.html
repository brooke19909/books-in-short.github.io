    <h2>  What was the difference between the life of nobles in ancient Egypt? </h2><p>  The Egyptians deified the figure of the king, their pharaoh, that is, they considered him infinitely superior to ordinary people.  Nobles, as close to the king God, occupied a special place in the ancient Egyptian hierarchy. </p><p>  Pharaoh devoted much time to traveling around the country.  He ordered the construction of new and restoration of old temple buildings, decorating altars and sacred statues depicting the gods.  In addition to peaceful affairs, the rulers fought wars.  Nobles helped their master in the fulfillment of his plans.  Some monitored the treasury and the receipt of taxes, others ordered the extraction of stone for the tombs, others carried out legal proceedings against the conspirators, and the fourth gathered armies and controlled the guards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The nobleman and agriculture </h2><p>  The life of a <span>nobleman in Ancient Egypt</span> did not pass in rest on a bed near the pool.  Approximate king led an active life as he himself.  As a reward for the fulfillment of his instructions and orders, the pharaoh bestowed upon those close with lands with peasants.  In the future, these possessions could be sold, donated or bequeathed to the heirs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="life of a nobleman in ancient Egypt" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18967/548312.jpg" width="400"></div>  In addition to personal possessions, close associates of the pharaoh had at their disposal official property and state lands, the proceeds from which went to the treasury.  The life of a nobleman in ancient Egypt depended not only on his position in society, but also on the fulfillment of state duties.

    <p>  Reporting was provided to the manager, who in all severity did <br>  statements for his master.  Information for the entire period was presented by the custodian of business books. </p><h2>  In the house of a noble Egyptian </h2><p>  The life of the Egyptian nobleman in the absence of military campaigns proceeded in beautiful large houses built of stone.  Around the building was usually a garden with fruit trees and flower beds.  A terrace was attached to a <span>two-story house</span> with a flat roof.  Since Egypt is a country with a hot climate, a pond was surely arranged in the garden, which created coolness. </p><p>  The interior of the house was striking in its luxury, although the furniture was quite simple: armchairs, chairs, a bed for rest and sleep, a round dining table and a square for household or kitchen work.  Archaeologists have found that the birthplace of chairs and armchairs is precisely Ancient Egypt.  The dwellings of the nobles serve as proof of this fact. </p><p>  The internal architecture of the house is elegant, rich and colorful: </p><ul><li>  ceilings are supported by luxurious columns; </li><li>  the walls from top to bottom are covered with bright frescoes; </li><li>  everywhere carpets with exquisite ornaments and fabric curtains; </li><li>  at the top of the ceiling are small windows through which sunlight penetrates the house; </li><li>  the entrances to other rooms are closed with double doors. </li></ul><p>  The life of a nobleman in Ancient Egypt was filled with various events: from wars, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="life of an egyptian nobleman" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18967/548307.jpg" width="272"></div>  before the management of state and own economy.

    <h2>  Briefly about Egyptian culture </h2><p>  From ancient Egyptian times, not only monumental cultural monuments, such as the pyramids and architectural structures, but also other inventions and achievements have survived.  Among them are bronze mirrors polished to a shine and having a handle for holding.  Not only the life of the Egyptian nobleman, but also the life of priests, peasants, and even slaves of this country was associated with special irrigation technology and medical, astronomical, mathematical knowledge. </p><p>  The apparatus of government and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsocial laws began to develop in the ancient land of the pharaohs. </p>
