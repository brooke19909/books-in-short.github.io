Invented more than fifteen centuries ago in ancient India, this game has not yet lost its relevance and relevance.  Until the mass entry of computer equipment into the everyday life of a large number of the world's population, chess remained the best simulator for the mind.  You can even say that this is a game of rulers, since a very large number of leaders of countries and provinces, generals of special services and armies are masters of sports in this game.  Let's try to understand its features and understand how to win chess. </p><h2>  The essence of the chess game </h2><p>  Many <span>great chess players have</span> devoted more than one year of their life to honing chess skills to perfection.  As in any kind of activity, in order to become a master, in chess it is necessary to spend a large amount of time on understanding the theoretical base and further improving the acquired skills in practice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to win chess" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11768/400981.jpg" width="541"></div>

    <p>  Chess sport should not be considered as just a game.  This unique sport can be called a trainer for the mind.  One should not ask a question about how to win chess, but about why this is necessary! </p><p>  It has been scientifically proven that in the course of life, the level of human intelligence can increase significantly.  Anyone who devotes a large amount of their time to systematizing and acquiring new knowledge will undoubtedly surpass their more gifted peers who do not. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to win chess quickly? </h2><p>  So, suppose you are still interested in the intellectual and creative opposition that a chess game reveals to a person.

    <p>  The answer to these questions is trying to give a large number of chess tutorials, reference books and Internet resources.  Devoting a certain period of time to the study of reference material and applying knowledge in practice, one can identify a number of patterns in the game. </p><p>  Players can be divided by the number of moves that they are able to think through in advance.  And we can say with a great deal of probability that: one of them, which, for example, is able to calculate all the standing combinations on the board three moves ahead, will win against someone who takes only two steps forward. </p><p>  Based on this assumption, it can be assumed that if you have a player in front of you who is unable to think out a game even for one move, you can use a standard simple combination of several moves against him. </p><h2>  How to beat a beginner in chess? </h2><p>  There are a huge number of options for starting a game that you can play against a beginner chess player.  This type of players is inclined to completely not analyze the arrangement of figures on the field and to move them thoughtlessly.  We can say that almost any game, if applied correctly on the board, will bring victory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chess games" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11768/401021.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Unfortunately, answering this question is quite difficult.  Scientific research conducted not so long ago showed that the most modern computers are too tough for the human mind.  Indeed, how to win chess against a machine that calculates all possible moves for dozens of steps forward? </p><p>  The answer to this question is to find vulnerabilities in a computer program.  We should not forget that any program is written by a person, and it is human nature to make mistakes.  If you know in advance the weak point of the computer logic algorithm, then as expected, you can take advantage of the hole in the program code and beat the computer that imagines itself to be a god. </p><p>  But undoubtedly, any program and hardware can be beaten by a better-written program and more powerful equipment.  This rule applies to the game against the person, if the opponent is clearly stronger than you.  You can use a computer simulator of the game (chess can also be an unfair confrontation!), And a transmitting radio device. </p>
