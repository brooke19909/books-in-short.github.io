For example, you will have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe state of the smartphone‚Äôs battery in sleep mode and during its operation. </p><h2>  What is standby time? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="meme-arsenal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hachiko mode" class="if uuid-2367095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80195/2367095.jpg"></div><p>  Modern technologies in cell phones provide many different functions that provide more convenient and long-term work with them.  One of these is a function called sleep mode. </p><p>  Standby mode (aka ‚Äúsleep mode‚Äù) is a phone feature that provides a slower battery drain.  Its essence is that this process does nothing.  Thus, this is the state of the phone in which all unused applications on the device are turned off. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Sleep mode" class="if uuid-2367975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80195/2367975.jpg"></div><h2>  IPhone standby </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blognews.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone standby" class="if uuid-2373546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80195/2373546.jpg"></div><p>  Like any other modern phone, the iPhone has a sleep function.  It is used to avoid any unintentional clicks and clicks if the phone has not been used for a long time.  In this case, the phone goes into standby mode and locks the screen.  However, the iPhone provides the ability to adjust the intervals off the phone.  It should be noted that both users of smartphones based on Android and customers of apple products can choose any convenient interval for them: one minute, two, three, five, or never.  To change the interval, you can use the following algorithm: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Go to Settings. </li><li>  In the menu that opens, select the "General" item. </li><li>  From the proposed list, go to "Auto-lock", where various time intervals for switching the iPhone to standby mode will be presented. </li></ul><h2>  Battery Standby </h2><p>  Now we will try to answer another question.  In what state is the battery in standby mode? </p><p>  One of the characteristics of modern phones, which is considered an important aspect when choosing, is the duration of its work.  It is also determined by the battery capacity of the device, as well as the power consumption of both user-installed and built-in factory applications and settings.  It is quite simple to understand that, while in a standby state, the battery charge is consumed for a rather long time, because the smartphone is inactive.  But there are such nuances.  If the phone discharges quickly, but sleep mode is on, this serves as a signal for the user to pay attention to the occurring malfunctions of his device.  There are several reasons for this, which we will now consider. </p><h2>  Why does the battery run out quickly? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="geek-nose.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The phone runs out quickly: what to do?" class="if uuid-2373628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80195/2373628.jpg"></div><p>  The phone discharges quickly for the following reasons: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  There is a malfunction in the battery itself. </li><li>  Automatic updates of various applications in the <span>background</span> or any task manager crashes. </li></ul><p>  You can start diagnosing your device to identify the type of failure using the built-in monitoring utility.  You can find it in the "Settings" menu.  For example, in the latest versions of android there is a function of "Optimization", which allows you to diagnose the entire device. </p><p>  In the "Optimization" menu there is also the opportunity to see in detail the status of your battery.  Here you will find information about those applications that consume the most battery power of your smartphone.  Thus, you can understand whether the software is a mistake and a large waste of energy.  If you have not noticed any significant changes or excessive power consumption in this menu, then most likely the problem is a little deeper and lies in the battery itself. </p><h2>  How to get rid of fast battery consumption? </h2><p>  Firstly, after diagnostics by built-in or specially installed applications, you can turn off automatic application updates and enable the "Energy Saver" mode, which is available on most modern cell phones. </p><p>  If this does not help, then you can try to dig a little deeper and normalize the battery.  (It is worth noting that before performing the following steps, it is better to create a backup copy or transfer all the necessary files to another device in order to avoid data loss). </p><p>  First, open the "Settings" menu. </p><p>  Then go to the "Reset Settings" item and return them to the factory settings.  In this step, all user data will be deleted from the device, so we strongly recommend that you back up the necessary files. </p><p>  Now you need to completely drain the battery. </p><p>  After that we take out the battery for several minutes.  Having inserted it back, we leave the phone on charge without turning it on.  It is worth noting that it costs from three to eight hours to charge it, without any additional action.  This procedure should be carried out several times, after which, most likely, everything will return to normal. </p><p>  However, if this does not help you, you should change the battery or take the smartphone to a service center. </p>
