The operator serving it is JSC National Payment Card System.  It was developed in order to create an independent money transfer system within the country and abroad in the near future.  Today, all major banks issue the Mir card and serve customers on a par with other world famous money systems.  Today we will consider not only how such a system works and what are its differences at the moment from others, but also learn about the Mir map. </p>

    <h2>  How does the national map work </h2><p>  The advantage of the national payment system is that it does not depend on economic and political factors, and nothing can affect its functioning.  Of the shortcomings, it can be noted that this system is just starting to work, and it takes time to develop its potential.  How does the World Map function and what are its goals? </p><ol><li>  It was developed by Russian technology and meets international safety standards.  There is a chip on it that protects it from copying and other fraudulent activities. </li><li>  It is possible to make transfers using the national operator. </li><li>  Independence of the country's payment space from foreign organizations. </li><li>  You can get a card for free at 73 Russian banks.  But the service is paid, according to the tariffs of the bank in which it is issued. </li><li>  The Mir card is accepted for payment in all organizations with a cash turnover of more than 40 million rubles.  For example, Auchan, Metro, Carousel, Lenta, fast food restaurants, etc. </li><li>  Such a card operates only in the territory of the Russian Federation.  In order to travel abroad, it is necessary to issue a Mir-Maestro card or another co-badging card of the joint two systems. </li><li>  Payment security in online resources and online points. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="payment card world reviews" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54079/1838325.jpg" width="420"></div></li></ol><h2>  Opinion of Mir cardholders </h2><p>  It is safe to say that the reviews on the Mir payment card are all positive.  Many users of the national translation system first encountered it when the employer expressed his intention to transfer wages to this card.  Since more than 70 Russian banks cooperate with it, the potential holders did not have any concerns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Like everything new, you always want to try it out and test the effectiveness.  The Mir card did not have any problems with money transfers, replenishment of a mobile phone account, payment in an online store and grocery supermarkets.  Reviews of the Mir credit card as a domestic product evoke a sense of patriotism and pride in the country, since it is not inferior in its functionality to Visa, MasterCard, Maestro. </p>

    <p>  For people who are active on the Internet (shopping, work), it is also important how secure the transfers will be.  When making money transfers, there were no delays or freezes of the system.  Thus, the user reviews of the Mir card are positive. </p><h2>  Bonus card system "World" </h2><p>  To maximize the functionality and attractiveness of the card among the population of the country, the bonus program "Mir" was developed.  It consists in the fact that when making payments from partners of the payment system, the card holder accrues points or miles, which he can then use at his discretion.  According to reviews, users of the Mir card noted that the bonus system is attractive, but how to use it is not yet clear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  In which case the Mir card will not work </h2><p>  As you know, the national payment system only plans to enter the world market.  In order to go abroad now, it is required to issue a co-baging card ‚ÄúMir‚Äù, since it will not be able to work in a simple format, as it is now.  When it is issued at any bank, the employee will be obliged to warn you about this.  Therefore, holders who made payments abroad have no reviews about the Mir card. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, it was noted that the distribution of the payment system is not as wide as that of its world competitors.  Therefore, in small organizations you may be denied service. </p><h2>  VTB24 Bank is a member of the national transfer system </h2><p>  This is one of the first Russian banks to start issuing a national card.  And its release implied 4 options at once: classic, gold, platinum and Privilege.  These cards are available for use both in free form and on a payroll project.  VTB24 offers the population the issue of the Mir card for use both within the state and beyond in the form of co-badging. </p>

    <p>  The bank management shared its plans for the issue of the card.  From the end of October to the end of December 2016, it was planned to issue about 350,000 cards for organizations of budgetary sectors, and by 2018 the volume of annual issue is planned to be about 1,400,000 pieces.  Card service is possible at all ATMs of the bank and its partners, where there is a sticker ‚ÄúWorld‚Äù. </p><h2>  Reviews on the card of the payment system "Mir" </h2><p>  The operation of the Mir card, regardless of the financial institution (VTB24, Sberbank, Alfa Bank, etc.) is not affected by the choice of the bank itself.  Accordingly, the reviews about the Mir card of one bank practically do not differ from the responses about the cards issued by another financial organization.  The difference will only be in the nuances of serving the population.  All settlement operations are carried out on a par with other similar systems.  And to meet a review of the Mir card, as a card that works worse than MasterCard, for example, is impossible. </p><p>  Many express the opinion that the transfer of pensioners and employees of budgetary organizations without fail is nothing more than a way to spread as much of the national payment system as possible.  Someone perceives "coercion" negatively, while someone is neutral.  But this does not affect the feedback from users of the Mir cards. </p>

    <p>  It is pleasant to note that this is the first national system that not only loudly declared itself, but also lives up to expectations, as was originally promised by the president of the Russian Federation.  She also seeks to take the position of a global money transfer operator.  This was noted by most users in reviews of the payment card "Mir". </p><h2>  "World Map" from "VTB24" </h2><p>  VTB24 has developed a plastic card based on the Visa payment system.  It is designed for citizens who often travel by plane or train.  Depending on the type of transport (plane or train), there is a specific card where, after making a ticket purchase, miles are awarded to you.  Also, when booking a ticket at a hotel, you will receive a bonus as a traveler.  The advantage of this card is that it is issued free of charge (annual service is paid), free travel insurance is provided for the entire duration of the credit obligations of the card. </p><p>  This is a card that allows you to not only replenish your account, but also to take a loan from VTB24.  A <span>grace period</span> (up to 50 days) is offered, as with most similar products, which provides additional comfort to the bonus in the form of miles. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews of the holders of "World Maps" from "VTB24" </h2><p>  According to reviews of the World Map (VTB), there is a negative impression of accruing miles for purchases made.  Tariff users complain that the bank neglects to fulfill the conditions for accruing points, as it refers to the unfair fulfillment of the conditions for using the card.  When submitting documents on making transfers, in accordance with the current World Map program, the response was never received by the applicant.  Similar moments are found regularly in the reviews of the holders of this card. </p>
