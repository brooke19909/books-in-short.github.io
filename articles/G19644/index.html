They amuse with their pronunciation, but this raises many questions.  Here is a list of the weirdest place names. </p><h2>  Train station Erofei Pavlovich </h2><p>  If a person says that the place of his birth or residence is, for example, the village of Erofei Pavlovich, then his interlocutor will have doubts about the veracity of this information.  Fantasy is required to explain the origin of such a strange name.  The image of the fabulous whale Erofei involuntarily looms, in the womb of which is everything that will meet in his way, including residents of the village of the same name.  The ridiculous names of cities and villages always bring a smile. </p><p>  Also Russian and Soviet prose writer M.M.  Prishvin was surprised when he met a railway station with a sign ‚ÄúErofei Pavlovich, Trans-Baikal Railway‚Äù while traveling around the Amur Region.  This is indeed so, a geographical map serves as confirmation.  Funny names of villages and villages you can try to find yourself. </p>

    <h2>  Why is it called that? </h2><p>  The name and patronymic, which respectfully call the settlement, are unique not only in the Skovorodinsky district, but throughout the whole of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At a certain stage of the construction of the <span>Trans-Siberian Railway</span> in 1909, the need arose to create a large station for trains, which were to continue on the eastward track.  As a result, the station was the first stopping point.  The name of the Russian explorer Khabarov is connected with the study of the Amur Region, and then the annexation of this territory to Russia in the middle of the 17th century. </p><p>  When the question arose of naming the new station and the workers' settlement, it was decided to somehow connect it with the famous Cossack Erofei Pavlovich Khabarov.  However, the city of Khabarovsk already existed in the Far East by 1880, there was even a village, the name of which turned out to be consonant with the famous surname.  Of all the possible options, only Erofei Pavlovich remained.  Few of today's youth, who are rarely interested in the history of the Amur Region, guess whose name is still the <span>railway station.</span> </p><h2>  Khrenovoye village in the Voronezh region </h2><p>  A visitor to a web resource dedicated to Voronezh may be struck by the following inscription: "... Horseradish is the heart of Russia."  Who would have thought that a village with a pessimistic name might be famous?  At the beginning of the 17th century, young Peter I, full of energy, planned to build a military fleet, for which, in the area where <span>the Bityug River</span> flowed <span>, a</span> ship forest was prepared.  All passing today must take a photo next to the sign.  The ridiculous names of villages are many in Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Later, the village of Khrenovo appeared here, near which Count Orlov built a stud farm that specialized in the famous breed - Orlov trotters.  Apparently, so that the residents did not feel flawed, the derived names of the farm and the river, respectively, Khrenische and Khrenovchanka, arose.  Such ridiculous village names are sometimes outraged and perplexing. </p>

    <h2>  Whole fields of horseradish! </h2><p>  When meeting a road sign with a similar name, ambiguous associations arise.  However, after a detailed study, everything falls into place.  The fact is that since ancient times there was a lot of wild horseradish along the banks of the river mentioned above, a whole meadow of this "sweet" plant.  Built in the 50s of the 17th century, the fortified point was given the corresponding name "Khrenovsky dangerous town." </p><p>  Another version is also known, which also has a right to exist.  Catherine II, passing in her carriage, called the road ‚Äúcrap‚Äù - she made such a strong impression on the empress. </p><h2>  Mars in the Moscow region </h2><p>  Everyone who wants to visit Mars does not have to wait until the interplanetary spacecraft is prepared for launch.  The path to Mars is much shorter.  Instead of a long, grueling journey, it is suggested to go to the Moscow region with comfort.  There in the Ruza district is the village of Markovo.  Having crossed the Moscow River on a suspension bridge, you get to Mars.  Funny names of villages in Russia can be found on the map. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The destination in question with the red planet combines only a common name.  Space exploration projects began to line up in the young country of the Soviets in the early 1920s.  The guide to action was Tsiolkovsky‚Äôs ideas about creating colonies on other planets.  Komsomol members were fond of the design of aircraft and airships.  At the dawn of Soviet power, a fashionable trend arose - the builders of the social system without exploiters united into communes.  Near the Moscow River a similar settlement appeared - the Red Planet (or simply Mars).  According to the author of the unusual name of the red commune, it was at the same time associated with the dream of its inhabitants about cosmic distances and the building of communism.  Villages with funny names have always attracted the attention of passing people. </p>

    <p>  After a period of take-off, the ‚Äúcosmic‚Äù village fell into decline for some time.  Cottages built in the early 2000s transformed the area to such an extent that the people called it ‚ÄúRuza Switzerland‚Äù.  They remembered the glorious "space" about 5 years ago and decided to recreate the forgotten image of Mars.  Locals were not limited to the construction of attractions for children and an improvised spaceport, where even a place was found for a model of an old rocket.  Everywhere there are necessarily things that have something to do with space.  For example, in a restaurant, dishes are served to visitors like astronauts in tubes. </p><p>  In general, the "Martian" area has a wonderful vacation away from the bustle of the city.  Oddly enough, the settlement with the name Mars in the Moscow region is not the only one.  At least, such ‚Äúnamesakes‚Äù can be found in seven other Russian regions.  In addition, there are settlements with the names of <span>space objects</span> : </p><ul><li>  Moon (Smolensk region); </li><li>  The Sun (Pskov Region); </li><li>  Venus (Republic of Belarus); </li><li>  Jupiter (Bashkortostan). </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="funny names of villages in Russia" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28002/1133696.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Khokhotuy village in the Trans-Baikal Territory </h2><p>  Not only that, the village and the railway station are called Hohotuy (the emphasis is on the letter ‚Äúu‚Äù).  In their vicinity there is still a river that someone once dubbed the "Fools".  The geographic location of the "laughing" objects is the Trans-Baikal Territory.  The emergence of a working village in 1899 was facilitated by the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway.  The task of the sawmill included the uninterrupted supply of wood for the railway.  Naturally, the enterprise required labor and the organization of some infrastructure.  The funny names of the villages make everyone who finds themselves in such a village smile. </p>

    <p>  There are two versions that try to explain the origin of the name of the village.  Both of them are of Old Buryat origin: </p><ol><li>  According to one of them, ‚Äúlaughter‚Äù should be translated as ‚Äúbirch‚Äù.  Indeed, birch trees grow in large numbers in this area. </li><li>  According to the second version, the word "huhutui" literally means "blue mountain".  The mountain here takes on a blue tint with a certain play of light. </li></ol><h2>  Fried Bugor in the Samara region </h2><p>  The village of Fried Bugor is located in the <span>bend of the</span> Volga River.  Two options are known to explain the name.  Each of them has a right to exist. </p><ol><li>  The word "fried" of non-Russian origin.  It should be read in Turkic, namely ‚Äújar‚Äù, ‚Äã‚Äãi.e.  "Steep (high) shore." </li><li>  In those distant times, when burlak traction was used to tow ships upstream, the custom of initiation into burlaks arose.  Experienced barge haulers stood in two rows from the foot to the top of the hill.  The newcomer had to climb through the ranks to the top.  At the same time, comrades "fried" on the back with bags of grass. </li></ol>
