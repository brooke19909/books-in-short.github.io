Therefore, wireless headphones are becoming an increasingly important purchase.  However, there are more and more of them every month.  Choosing the right pair of devices can be much more complicated because of this.  <span>The bluetooth headphone rating</span> in this article will help the reader understand which model is best for him.  Several categories of devices will be presented. </p><p>  Choosing on-ear headphones or earplugs, vacuum ones, in-ear earphones is a moot point.  There should always be an individual approach related to the ease of use of each form factor by an individual.  Once you have established what you need, then you can decide whether wireless is the best option for you. </p><p>  If you prefer flying over long distances, be sure to use on-ear headphones with the ANC (active noise reduction) function.  If you are actively involved in sports, then designer models may be more convenient. </p><p>  After all this, you will need to find the model that fits into your budget.  Some devices have an overpriced price tag, and this does not always indicate a better build or sound quality. </p><p>  This article will help you make the right choice.  Below is a ranking of bluetooth headphones that span different segments and shapes: from excellent ANC noise canceling devices to low-cost and sports kits. </p><p>  Currently, buyers mostly leave a lot of positive reviews about the model Sony WH-1000XM3.  These headphones are the leader in the ranking.  However, their form may not suit someone.  Therefore, in the review below, various types and variants of models of wireless devices will be given.  The price segment also varies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  1. Sony WH-1000XM3 </h2><p>  In the ranking of bluetooth headphones, the first place is occupied by the model Sony WH-1000XM3.  It is her most often bought by users today. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pocket-lint.com" data-author=": Chris Hall, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stylish look" class="if uuid-3230951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/121006/3230951.jpg"></div><p>  Pros highlighted by users: </p><ol><li>  Better noise reduction. </li><li>  Great sound quality. </li><li>  Great fast charge function. </li><li>  Comfortable fit. </li><li>  Adaptive control. </li></ol><p>  Minuses: </p><ol><li>  Sounds at high frequencies interfere with playback. </li><li>  Large enough to carry them in your pocket. </li></ol><p>  Sony WH-1000XM3 have the best noise reduction on the market.  Not only can they block the noisy aircraft engines, they also eliminate the noise from passengers talking.  Sound quality has been improved thanks to a new analogue amplifier that produces a cleaner, more stable and enjoyable type of playback. </p><p>  They are also supplied unassembled.  Quick Listen mutes the sound, allowing you to listen to the outside world through headphones, while Ambient Sound does the same, but allows you to continue listening to music. </p><p>  Add a whopping 30 hours of battery life for wireless playback (40 hours of wired connectivity), as well as additional noise reduction capabilities with Sony Headphones, and the WH-1000XM3 can be called high-end universal headphones.  Not all devices can compete in quality with this model.  Therefore, it is considered the leader in the ranking of bluetooth headphones.  But if we consider the price segment, the gadget is many times more expensive than other models. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  2. B&amp;O Beoplay H9i </h2><p>  The B&amp;O Beoplay H9i is also rated among the best bluetooth headphones due to its ergonomics and performance. </p><p>  Pros mentioned in reviews: </p><ol><li>  Beautiful appearance. </li><li>  Great build quality. </li><li>  They sound great. </li><li>  Proximity sensors work. </li><li>  Removable battery. </li></ol><p>  Cons too: </p><ol><li>  Touch control may be inconvenient. </li><li>  Sometimes when connected, the application is buggy. </li><li>  High price. </li></ol><p>  If you have a taste for stylish things and objects, and also love high-quality sound and expensive materials, then you need to check out the B&amp;O Beoplay H9i.  These are some of the most beautiful and luxurious wireless headphone types on the market, made from a mixture of anodized aluminum, hardened cowhide and ultra-soft sheepskin.  Quality and luxury are immediately visible.  Therefore, in the ranking of the best bluetooth headphones, this model takes an honorable second place. </p><p>  The gadget is not just beautiful, it is full of different functions.  The headphones have Bluetooth, active noise reduction, battery life of about 18 hours, touch control and the mode of "Transparency".  There are also proximity sensors for automatic playback and automatic pause when removing or putting on headphones.  In addition, they sound great, but are quite expensive. </p><h2>  3. Bowers &amp; Wilkins PX </h2><p>  The bluetooth headphone rating for the phone includes the Bowers &amp; Wilkins PX version.  It is noteworthy that the manufacturer has recently been on the market, and has already received hundreds of positive reviews from customers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": Vlad Savov, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quality housing" class="if uuid-3230952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/121006/3230952.jpg"></div><p>  Pros noted by users: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Fantastic sound. </li><li>  Convenient smart connection sensors. </li><li>  Auto charge, connect, play. </li><li>  Attractive design. </li></ol><p>  Cons are minor: </p><ol><li>  Noise reduction is low. </li><li>  Fragile temples. </li></ol><p>  Bowers &amp; Wilkins PX, or B&amp;W, are among the best headphones on a par with models such as the Bose QC35 II and Sony WH-1000XM2.  To differentiate itself, B&amp;W focuses on its core strengths: luxurious design and sound quality for music lovers, but with some impressive tricks. </p><p>  These techniques include adaptive noise reduction and a smart usage sensor that will detect when the headphones are on the head and when they are turned off, pausing playback accordingly.  They are even smart enough to know when you pick up your headset to talk or listen to your surroundings.  Not all models boast such technology.  Therefore, in the ranking of bluetooth headphones for the phone, this pair takes 3rd place. </p><p>  The only caveat: their noise reduction can not compete with brands such as Bose or Sony, but this more than compensates for their sound quality.  If you need the best noise-canceling music wireless headphones currently available, this model will be just right.  However, you should immediately purchase a separate case, so as not to damage the case. </p><h2>  4. Bose QuietComfort 35 II </h2><p>  The Bose QuietComfort 35 II was also included in the ranking of wireless bluetooth headphones.  The brand is known and popular all over the world. </p><p>  Here are the advantages that reviews give out: </p><ol><li>  Excellent noise reduction. </li><li>  Great microphone for calls. </li><li>  Lightweight and comfortable. </li><li>  Long battery life. </li></ol><p>  Minuses: </p><ol><li>  No aptX. </li><li>  Competitors in the review sound better. </li></ol><p>  Bose has a long history of creating great headphones, especially with active noise canceling, and the Bose QuietComfort 35 II are the latest in this series. </p><p>  Like their predecessors, they are lightweight and comfortable, so they are ideal for travel, not to mention the fact that they provide the best noise reduction on the market. </p><p>  There is still no support for aptX (or aptX HD) in this version, but the headphones still sound great, but do not quite comply with the B&amp;W PX or Sony WH-1000XM2 sound standard.  Although it can only be distinguished by true connoisseurs of good sound.  In the ranking of wireless bluetooth headphones, this model takes 4th place. </p><p>  There are a number of interesting innovations.  Noise reduction can now be adjusted, and there is a built-in Google assistant for sending notifications from your phone.  In addition, the battery life is up to 20 hours in contactless mode or 40 hours in wired mode. </p><h2>  5. Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless </h2><p>  The quality of bluetooth headphones includes a rare Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless model.  It is quite difficult to find them in the market, but buyers in the reviews note the value of this purchase, as well as the following advantages: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": Ced Yuen, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quality finish" class="if uuid-3230953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/121006/3230953.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Great looks and build quality. </li><li>  Good battery life. </li><li>  Effective noise reduction. </li><li>  Great, high quality sound. </li></ol><p>  Cons also noticed users: </p><ol><li>  Newer competitors have much more features. </li><li>  Outdated design. </li></ol><p>  Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless are not new headphones on the market.  However, they are still in demand among users and receive excellent reviews from customers.  What you get is Sennheiser's signature rich sound, plus all the audio special effects are well emphasized by the speakers without squeaks and rattles.  They are not as neutrally balanced as the B&amp;W PX, but at the same time they work in stereo without fail. </p><p>  Noise reduction is one of the most effective that you can get for this money (the price is around 12 thousand rubles), and the wireless performance is stable.  They lack a motion sensor and finger control modules, like newer headphones, but this does not necessarily matter, especially when they have such an affordable price on the market today.  Buying them is definitely worth it if the gadget fits the style and technological innovations. </p><h2>  6. Audio Technica ATH-M50xBT </h2><p>  In the rating of bluetooth headphones for sound quality, the version of Audio Technica ATH-M50xBT is included.  She has received many positive customer reviews. </p><p>  Noted advantages: </p><ol><li>  Excellent built-in nylon membrane. </li><li>  Breathtaking sound. </li><li>  Good wireless reliability. </li></ol><p>  Minuses: </p><ol><li>  Unusual pairing style, there are difficulties with synchronization. </li><li>  A slightly duller sound than the older M50 models. </li></ol><p>  Like the M50x and the M50 before it, the Audio Technica ATH-M50xBT delivers amazing performance at a relatively affordable price. </p><p>  They are one of the most attractive and interesting wireless headphones at an affordable price, according to customer reviews, with high performance that allows you to hear every single sound with special effects.  In the upper and middle frequencies, there is dynamism, and the sound stage is full of clarity and quite wide for headphones of this form factor. </p><p>  The gadget does not have very low power consumption, like Sony and Sennhesier, but it perfectly conveys the rhythm of the track, which distinguishes the model and makes it one of the leaders in the review. </p><p>  The rating of wireless bluetooth headphones for the phone is made up of models of a different price segment and form factor.  Specifically, this device has many advantages, but in design and shape it may not be suitable for everyone. </p><p>  Headphones do not come with active noise canceling like the Sony WH-1000XM, but they are almost half the price and are a great alternative if you are looking for Bluetooth wireless headphones that have excellent stereo sound balance. </p><h2>  7. Urbanista Seattle </h2><p>  Users always strive to get powerful sound from such devices.  The Urbanista Seattle model was included in the rating of full-size bluetooth headphones based on this criterion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.frostmagazine.com" data-author=": Catherine Balavage, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Folding mechanism" class="if uuid-3230954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/121006/3230954.jpg"></div><p>  Here are the pluses consumers noticed: </p><ol><li>  Good quality. </li><li>  Thoughtful design. </li><li>  Great sound. </li></ol><p>  And here are the cons: </p><ol><li>  No NFC and APTX. </li><li>  High frequencies play poorly. </li></ol><p>  If you need a universal pair of wireless headphones for less than 10 thousand rubles, then Urbanista Seattle would be a great choice.  Many buyers respond positively to this model and say that it can even compete with the leaders of the rating. </p><p>  Although there are models and brands of devices with improved functions, including those with longer battery life, most buyers prefer to use these headphones every day.  They sound better, while remaining on your head during active sports. </p><p>  Like most headphones in this class, there is a pleasant bass boost for amateurs.  The rest of the sound is played evenly and displays decent detail on each channel.  In general, little is not liked by buyers in this model.  As they themselves say in the reviews, all this is offset by an affordable price. </p><h2>  8. Audio-Technica SonicFuel ATH-AR3BT </h2><p>  The vacuum bluetooth headphone rating includes the compact Audio-Technica SonicFuel ATH-AR3BT, which has many interesting options. </p><p>  Pros noted in reviews: </p><ol><li>  Great sound. </li><li>  High performance wireless. </li><li>  Portable type. </li><li>  Affordable price. </li></ol><p>  Minuses: </p><ol><li>  There is no storage case. </li><li>  Inconvenient volume control. </li></ol><p>  The category of wireless headphones, the cost of which is less than 10 thousand rubles, includes Audio-Technica SonicFuel ATH-AR3BT, an excellent pair of inexpensive gadgets that sound great.  They don't have the latest touch features, but their sound quality more than makes up for it. </p><p>  Their compact design makes it easy to fit on your ear.  The case itself is stylish and durable, despite the fact that it is mainly made of plastic.  On the left earphone are all the necessary controls, where you will also find NFC for quick pairing. </p><p>  When fully charged, they will work in active mode for up to 30 hours.  Customer reviews say that this level of charge surpasses many modern models on the market.  This wireless headphone model offers clear, hiss-free sound, a reliable connection and a neutral equalizer that will work well with many genres.  Settings are made in just a few touches. </p><h2>  9. AKG N60 NC Wireless </h2><p>  According to buyers, the AKG N60 NC Wireless model was included in the ranking of the best wireless bluetooth headphones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="headphonereview.com" data-author=": Christian de Looper, "><img itemprop="image" alt="High definition sound" class="if uuid-3230955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/121006/3230955.jpg"></div><p>  Here are the advantages they highlighted: </p><ol><li>  Great sound. </li><li>  Lightweight and durable body materials. </li><li>  Foldable design. </li><li>  Good noise reduction. </li></ol><p>  There are also disadvantages: </p><ol><li>  Few upholstery on the headband. </li><li>  No NFC. </li></ol><p>  The AKG N60 NC Wireless is a miniature pair of active noise canceling headphones that can be used when traveling or playing sports. </p><p>  The lightweight folding design of the model makes the headphones much more portable than their larger competitors, and the 15-hour wireless battery is more than acceptable for their size, plus they will also work passively if you need to connect a wire. </p><p>  As for noise reduction, the N60 NC Wireless cannot quite compete with Bose silence levels, but the technology is able to muffle noise from external sources well. </p><p>  They also sound great, offering spectacular, detailed and well-organized performance that simultaneously sounds colorful and expressive. </p><h2>  10. House of Marley Positive Vibration 2 Wireless </h2><p>  The House of Marley Positive Vibration 2 Wireless model got into the rating of bluetooth-earphones-earplugs, which are used during vigorous activity. </p><p>  They noted such advantages: </p><ol><li>  Rich sound. </li><li>  Affordable price in the market. </li><li>  Nice appearance. </li></ol><p>  Cons, according to customer reviews, at such a low price are completely absent.  Quality equals value. </p><p>  Good-looking headphones with Bluetooth and a price of less than 5 thousand rubles won over many users.  And while there are no tricks.  The model is completely worth the money.  In the past, the manufacturer has released several rather mediocre models with bright colors, but at the same time they had good characteristics.  For the money you are not mistaken. </p><p>  They are comfortable and not too large considering their design on the ear.  Aluminum cups are the nice design touches we expect from more expensive alternatives.  It‚Äôs wise to use a 12-hour battery in this price range, there are basic controls, and the sound is good too.  These headphones will not overshadow the more expensive models, but they are very profitable.  In addition, the gadget is perfect for everyday use. </p><h2>  11. Sony WF-1000X </h2><p>  The popular model Sony WF-1000X with a convenient fixation system in the auricle is included in the rating of bluetooth earphones-in-ear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtings.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/sony/wf-1000x"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractive look" class="if uuid-3230957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/121006/3230957.jpg"></div><p>  Pluses, according to reviews, she has a lot: </p><ol><li>  Excellent noise reduction. </li><li>  Adaptive noise reduction works completely. </li><li>  Comfortable, sturdy fit in your ear. </li><li>  Auto Connect and Disconnect. </li><li>  Great sound. </li></ol><p>  Less cons: </p><ol><li>  The charging case is large. </li><li>  High price. </li></ol><p>  If you need a pair of cordless in-ear headphones, the Sony WF-1000X is the first truly contactless device.  This is noted in the reviews by the buyers themselves.  The model has full autonomy and does not require connecting cables for synchronization or charging. </p><p>  Putting sound quality in the first place, manufacturers took several elements from last year's series of devices (overhead, wireless, noise-canceling) Sony MDR-1000X and placed them in a tiny case small enough to fit in your ear. </p><p>  They not only stand an order of magnitude higher than any wireless in-ear headphones that are known today.  The devices are good enough to replace many wired competitors.  At the same time, these headphones are also the first of their kind with a noise reduction function. </p><p>  This means that you get not only excellent sound and complete freedom of movement, but also the opportunity not to use a wired connection.  Users consider this model to be one of the convenient and compact, but at the same time expensive. </p><h2>  12. TicPods Free </h2><p>  The rating of wireless bluetooth in-ear headphones included one of the popular models of the TicPods Free version.  Many find it similar in functionality to Apple iPods. </p><p>  Other advantages are also mentioned in reviews: </p><ol><li>  Decent sound. </li><li>  Good battery life. </li><li>  Large scale of volume. </li></ol><p>  Cons are negligible: </p><ol><li>  The shape is not very convenient. </li><li>  Touch controls do not always work correctly. </li></ol><p>       ,      ,  TicPods Free ‚Äì     . </p><p>    8     ,       .     Siri, Google Assistant  Alexa,              . </p><p>          ,    ,  ,    ,      12-      . </p><p> The only drawback is the slightly atypical design.  At TicPods, the design is a bit similar to Apple Airpods, which attracted many buyers, but it has its own nuances.  The model will be a great addition for a long trip, but playing sports or leading an active lifestyle with such a device will be problematic. </p><h2>  13. Jaybird X4 </h2><p>  The latest Jaybird X4 model in the review was included in the bluetooth headphone rating for sports.  It was created specifically for active people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rizknows.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.rizknows.com/reviews/jaybird-x4-vs-x3-review/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reliable and lightweight" class="if uuid-3230958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/121006/3230958.jpg"></div><p>  Users are satisfied with the following points: </p><ol><li>  Tight, comfortable fit. </li><li>  Decent sound for a sporty type kit. </li><li>  Great build quality. </li></ol><p>  But what causes dissatisfaction: </p><ol><li>  It can fall out easily. </li><li>  There is no single-channel operation mode. </li></ol><p>  If you are looking for headphones for active sports, then the Jaybird X4 model will be suitable for this.  Wireless devices provide a reliable and comfortable fit, a long battery life of eight hours, as well as a type of housing protected from sweat and IPX7 water. </p><p>  The sound quality is also stable by standards for headphones of this format.  The Jaybird app additionally allows you to quickly and easily customize the X4 sound to your liking.  The only drawback is that they use a proprietary charger.  It is not so resistant to moisture, so you need to be careful when charging. </p><h2>  Why buy such a device </h2><p>  The main reason is convenience - wireless headphones offer unprecedented freedom from tangled cables, not to mention the connectors on the gadgets.  Active Noise Reduction (ANC) is a common and useful feature for blocking a noisy environment, and should be considered if you travel frequently or are in public places for a long time.  It is worth noting that in the ranking of bluetooth headphones in 2018 almost did not include models with a similar option.  She appeared and began to be used not so long ago. </p><h2>  What to look for when buying </h2><p>  The first question when buying a pair of wireless headphones: why are they needed and how much should they cost?  High cost does not always provide stable performance and better materials.  If you purchase such a product for the sake of innovation and popularity, it is better to consider gadgets at a price not exceeding 10 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Bluetooth in-ear headphones are a great choice for sports and are often waterproof for outdoor workouts (not to mention sweat).  However, it is important to consider the structure of the auricle.  Therefore, it is necessary to check whether additional pads and inserts of different sizes are included with such devices. </p><p>  Overhead models have become the most popular for everyday use.  Such headphones are usually a little smaller and cheaper, but by design they are not always the most comfortable, especially for those who wear glasses.  This form, according to reviews of many buyers, is convenient, but with prolonged listening and lack of ventilation, the ears can become very hot. </p><p>  Battery life is another factor that ranges from more than 20 hours in larger headphones to just three hours in fully wireless models.  They are good for most trips to work, but not so convenient for long trips. </p><p>  For the best sound quality, look for support for aptX or aptX HD (Sony offers its own solution called LDAC).  The lack of additional noise ensures the best playback of tracks, and also allows you to escape from the hustle and bustle of loud conversations. </p>
