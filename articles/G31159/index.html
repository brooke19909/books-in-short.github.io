  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dry water</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Novek 1230 - powder (dry) water was discovered in 1968.  For some time they forgot about this discovery.  Probably considering that dry water is not needed.  However, many scientists claim that this substance can help humanity cope with global warming. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 21st century, research on dry water was resumed.  A group of English scientists at the University of Liverpool took up the task of practical use of this discovery. </p><p>  Dry <span>water,</span> which includes ninety-five percent of ordinary water, is similar in appearance to icing sugar.  Each droplet is covered by a special shell of silicon dioxide.  This compound of oxygen and silicon is considered the most stable.  The <span>silica</span> shell does not allow drops to spread and merge.  The size of each drop is not more than one micron. </p><p>  During the experiments, it was found that dry water has an excellent ability to absorb gases.  Presumably, the substance can absorb gases that provoke the appearance of the <span>greenhouse effect</span> on the planet.  It is this direction of the practical use of the substance that was studied by Liverpool scientists.  In laboratory conditions, it was found that dry water is able to absorb three times more carbon dioxide than simple water for the same period of time. </p><p>  The substance can probably help produce frozen methane, located at the bottom of the oceans.  The discovery of dry water can help to collect and accumulate in large enough quantities other gases that are difficult to produce.  In addition, the technology for producing the substance itself can be applied to other liquids.  It also opens up promising opportunities in the development of many branches of technology and science. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Along with this, British scientists tried to prove that the use of such a form of liquid may be relevant when transporting and storing potentially hazardous materials.  For example, researchers have suggested that a new method for storing automotive fuel for hydrogen engines can be obtained. </p><p>  Dry water, the formula of which is CF3CF2C (O) CF (CF3) 2, has two properties in common with ordinary water.  Both substances have neither taste nor smell.  In plain water, oxygen acts as an oxidizing agent.  The oxidizing agent in this substance is fluorine. </p><p>  Dry water has <span>a boiling point of</span> about fifty degrees, freezing - one hundred and eight degrees.  However, even in the process of boiling, scientists say, if you lower your hands in Novek 1230, then there will be no burn.  The substance has a high density. </p><p>  Due to the lack of ability to conduct current, dry water can be used in electrically safe rooms.  The substance decomposes under the influence of ultraviolet radiation.  In open containers, dry water can be stored for no more than five days. </p><p>  The substance is widely used in fire extinguishing, especially in rooms where a sufficiently large number of electronics and <span>high-voltage</span> equipment are <span>concentrated.</span>  Such premises, for example, include generator, server, power plants, transformer, etc.  The extinguishing effect is achieved as a result of cooling and active absorption of heat. </p><p>  Powdered water does not damage paper.  It is in connection with this, in archival rooms, in museums, they try to install <span>a fire extinguishing system</span> using Novek 1230. For example, this system is used in the Hermitage. </p><p>  Powder water is harmless to humans.  However, researchers do not recommend drinking it.  A small boiling point will not allow you to brew in powder water neither tea nor coffee.  Sugar does not dissolve in it either. </p><p>  According to scientists, powder water will soon be used everywhere. </p>
