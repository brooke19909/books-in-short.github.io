Vityazevo is a wonderful resort town located near Anapa.  Tourists are attracted here by the clear sea, good beaches and plenty of entertainment.

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The most convenient and fastest way is, of course, an airplane.  Vityazevo Airport accepts flights from 47 cities of Russia and is the base for five airlines.  To get to the village, you will need to order a taxi or stop the private owner.  The fare varies from 400 to 600 rubles.  However, most guest houses organize a free shuttle service for their spa guests. </p><p>  A train ride is still the most popular way of traveling among Russians.  If you decide to come to rest in Vityazevo with this type of transport, then you should keep heading for Anapa.  Typically, tourists land at the Tunnel station, which is located five kilometers from the village.  The fare to the final destination in an official taxi will cost about 900 rubles.  Anyone who wants to save money can drive 120 rubles to the <span>Anapa bus station,</span> and then transfer to one of the many minibuses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  As in any coastal village, everything here is for rent - from small rooms to large private houses.  However, if you decide to relax in comfort, take care of early booking and do not forget that hotels with children's infrastructure are selling rooms instantly.  Perhaps you want to settle in one of the modern hotels in the village of Vityazevo?  Rest on the seashore in comfortable conditions will cost 2500 rubles per night.  The territory of such resort hotels often has one or two small pools, a children's playground, a dining room and several residential buildings.  Often these hotels have at their disposal small clean beaches.  Perhaps the only negative of this type of housing is a small area.  Therefore, the hotels have a limited number of parking spaces, few green spaces and places for a relaxing holiday.  Let's consider more accommodation options that Vityazevo can offer tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vityazevo Holiday House" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1284541.jpg" width="400"></div>

Prices </h2><p>  As a rule, the owners of their own houses erect several guest buildings around the main building, arrange a summer kitchen and decorate the dining area with ivy and grapes.  Small rooms without amenities cost about 400 rubles per night, and more comfortable options (with shower, refrigerator and air conditioning) from 800 rubles.  If you want to save a little, then try to organize a vacation (Vityazevo) without intermediaries.  There are two ways to do this.  The first is quite risky - to come to the village without prior agreement and look for housing on the spot.  The second is to contact the owners of private houses via the Internet in advance and discuss the conditions.  Of course, we recommend choosing the second way, since it is very important to know all the conditions in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in Vityazevo guest houses" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1284544.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in Vityazevo by the sea </h2><p>  We want to offer you another not too expensive accommodation option.  Many local businesses offer everyone to spend their holidays in <span>Vityazevo.</span>  <span>Guest houses</span> and recreation centers left over from the Soviet era were previously designed exclusively for workers in industrial plants and factories.  Currently, they have hospitably opened their doors to holidaymakers and delight non-spoiled Russians with their low prices.  It may seem to you that the buildings are quite old, and the furniture blows the spirit of the mid-20th century?  Then add to this the high service, your own clean beaches and three meals a day.  Perhaps, after weighing the pros and cons, you will stop at this option and not regret it.  For our part, we want to offer you a list of the most popular bases and indicate the cost of living in them: </p><ul><li>  Vityazevo (rest house) - 450 rubles per place in a standard room. </li><li>  Barguzin - 980 rubles. </li><li>  Marines - 1100 rubles. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  The central beach is a visiting card of the village.  It is because of the gentle entrance and the golden sand that tourists come here with young children.  However, in season the resort‚Äôs popularity can play a trick - it gets crowded here, the beach becomes dirty, and the shallow water blooms from the mud.  Therefore, vacationers have to go in search of a place in the sun closer to Anapa on pebble beaches.  However, if you are a happy tenant of a hotel with a private beach, then you should not be afraid of such problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in vityazevo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1284556.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Treatment </h2><p>  Many tourists seek to combine rest in Vityazevo with joint treatment and spa treatments.  Those who have not purchased a ticket to one of the local sanatoriums and decided not to spend money on a beauty salon, go to the Vityazevsky estuary - a source of therapeutic hydrogen sulfide mud.  Here, citizens apply a healing slurry to the body, and after a while they wash it off.  Some even collect dirt in jars so that they can treat joints, skin diseases and a number of other ailments at home.  Another popular source of health is mud volcanoes on the Taman Peninsula.  Tourists come here to explore the local attraction, experience the healing properties of mud, and at the same time swim in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  What kind of entertainment and excursions are available for tourists who come here on vacation?  Vityazevo offers holidaymakers: </p><ul><li>  Take a walk along the main street of Paralia and look at several shops lined up on both sides of the boulevard.  Here you can eat in one of the street cafes, and then buy some souvenirs as a keepsake. </li><li>  Visit the dolphinarium and amusement park "Byzantium".  A dolphin show usually lasts about an hour, and after that children (and all adults who wish) can take memorable photos and even swim with these smart marine mammals. </li><li>  Go to the village of <span>Bolshoi Utrish,</span> where you can go diving, visit the largest dolphinarium in the region and take a walk through the reserve, where unique juniper trees grow. </li><li>  Visit the specially built <span>castle ‚ÄúLion's Head‚Äù</span> in Sukko and watch a spectacular knightly tournament organized by professional actors.  We recommend that you do this in the evening, since at this time of day the performance is more spectacular.  After the performance, spectators can take part in such thematic workshops as modeling dishes in a pottery workshop or making forged objects under the direction of a blacksmith.  Here you can also learn how to shoot from a real bow or try on knightly armor. </li><li>  Take a trip to Anapa to see the famous lighthouse, explore the complex of fountains and visit several museums.  The city has a dolphinarium and many children's attractions.  Here you can buy a ticket for a yacht and take a short sea voyage. </li></ul><p>  Go with children to the Olympia water park and ride on themed water rides.  Here you will plunge into the world of ancient Greek gods, heroes and first people.  You can also participate in a foam party and watch an exciting animated show program. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest vityazevo" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/1284560.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Local kitchen </h2><p>  It is very easy to arrange meals in the village.  Perhaps you will like the local cafes, the average cost of a lunch in which is 200 rubles, and dinner with drinks - 300. Traditionally, merchants carry corn and churchkhela on the beaches, and along the promenade are trays with a variety of different foods.  Therefore, finding a snack in the village is not a problem.  Restaurants offer vacationers a wide variety of cuisines - here you can find Greek cafes, chain pizzerias, barbecue, pubs with an impressive beer list, and Japanese food restaurants.  If you are afraid of catching an intestinal infection or simply want to save money, you can cook your own food yourself or entrust this responsibility to the hostess of your hotel. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who have been here are happy to recall a summer vacation.  Vityazevo is a wonderful place where you can have a fun vacation, undergo a course of treatment or spa treatments, as well as explore local attractions.  Vacationers say that the best thing is to come to the village in June or early September.  During these months, the sea is quite warm, housing prices and food are moderate.  Another important plus is a small influx of holidaymakers.  This means that there is always a place on a small local beach and children can frolic at their pleasure. </p>
