    <p>  The disadvantages of the brand's products include not too convenient for unwinding bundles of woolen threads and tablets for them.  Before work, it is advisable to distribute all the colors on special bobbins for storing floss or use an organizer.  Some needlewomen note the friability and softness of linen canvas in the new “Create it yourself” sets.  The difficulty is caused by the scheme, especially after working with other cross-stitch kits.  At "Riolis" the shade of threads and its color designation do not match. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unusual stories in the Riolis sets </h2><p>  The company is able to surprise its fans with special plots for cross-stitch.  The 2014 Riolis novelties were a series of sets with sports themes: Biathlon, Curling, Pair Skating, Hockey.  They are very easy to perform and are suitable even for beginner needlewomen.  The “snowboarder” in this series is designed for experienced embroiderers. </p><p>  In 2016, Riolis celebrated its twentieth anniversary.  Many paintings based on the works of famous artists and plots devoted to the traditions and scenic spots of Russia appeared in the catalog: sights of Moscow, St. Petersburg and Crimea, <span>Zhostovo painting,</span> Russian hunting, ballet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch riolis new items" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1828074.jpg" width="458"></div>

    <p>  Each set, regardless of size and complexity of execution, is designed to the smallest detail.  Designers bring to perfection even the most ordinary floral plot, masterfully selecting transitions and midtones so that the finished work looks voluminous and “lively”.  The patterns are so simple that the needlewoman can only enjoy the embroidery process, abandoning everyday worries. </p><h2>  New in the catalog of 2017 </h2><p>  In the catalog of 2017, among the cross-stitch from Riolis, the novelty was a series of miniature paintings with the inhabitants of the rural farmstead “Khutorok” and several plots with pirate themes.  Designers have not forgotten about lovers of plant motifs: bright bouquets, unusual wreaths attract attention and are able to decorate the interior in any style.  Craftswomen who prefer pastel colors and smooth transitions of color can also find a set for themselves.  The list of new products is constantly expanding.  The manufacturer follows the trends in the world of needlework and constantly supplements its sets with new, previously unused techniques: embroidered on canvas with a printed pattern and a plastic canvas, embroidered stitch, ribbons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch riolis new items 2014" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1828077.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Tips for beginner embroiderers </h2><p>  A few recommendations for last: </p><ol><li>  Before starting work, you must always wash your hands with soap, so as not to stain the canvas and drawing. </li><li>  Glue the folds and corners of the circuit with tape.  This will help prevent her premature damage. </li><li>  If you want to reuse the circuit from the set, it is better to make a copy and work with it.  Thanks to the appropriate color symbols, the lack of color will not interfere with operation.  The difference between the shades of thread and its transfer on paper can only confuse an inexperienced needlewoman. </li><li>  When working on the hoop, try not to pull the embroidery so as not to damage it. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch riolis new items 2014" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1828078.jpg" width="458"></div></li></ol><p>  Cross stitch kits “Riolis” will suit both beginners and experienced embroiderers.  The company catalog will be an excellent source of inspiration and will help you make a good choice. </p>
