    <h2>  Who is this machine for? </h2><p>  Of course, the technical specifications of the <span>Lenovo A6000</span> LTE are very modest as of today.  With a diagonal of 5 inches, now no one can be surprised, and the 4-core CPU can certainly not boast of outstanding performance.  From the position of price, this device also does not stand out from competitors.  But still there is one important feature in this device - this is high sound quality.  The manufacturer itself, first of all, positions this smartphone as a device for music lovers.  It is based on this position, we will consider this device.  But, besides this plus, this device has many more advantages with which it will please its owner.  It is about them that we will go further. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  It is typical of an economy-level gadget in the <span>Lenovo A6000.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> are only just confirmed without fail.  It includes: </p><ul><li>  The device itself. </li><li>  Accumulator battery. </li><li>  Standard interface cord. </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  Warranty card and device usage manual. </li></ul><p>  The case of the smart phone is made of plastic, and the newly-made owner will have to immediately buy a case to maintain its original state.  For the same reason, you immediately need to purchase and paste a protective film on the front touch panel of the gadget.  Like most manufacturers, Lenovo does not equip its devices with an external flash drive.  This accessory is also recommended to be purchased immediately after buying a smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance and usability </h2><p>  This color model of the cell phone has three color variants of the case: white, red and black.  The weak half of humanity is primarily focused on the Lenovo A6000 White mobile phone.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  this is only confirmed.  The same can be said about the red version of this gadget.  Well, the most practical in this case is the Lenovo A6000 Black mobile phone.  The reviews of the owners of the device highlight its increased resistance to the appearance of various kinds of damage.  More precisely, they appear in the same way, but on a black background they are not so noticeable.  On the front panel of the device is a 5-inch HD-screen.  Under it is a touch-sensitive control panel, standard for this manufacturer, which includes three buttons.  Sensors, a front camera and a speaker are displayed above the screen.  All physical buttons that provide gadget lock and volume control are displayed on the right side of the device.  This greatly simplifies the process of working on this device.  On the bottom edge of the smartphone there is only a talking microphone, and on the opposite side there are MicroUSB and an ‚Äúaudio jack‚Äù.  On the back cover are: the main camera, its backlight based on one LED and two loud speakers, which provide the phenomenal sound of this model.  The entire body of the device is made of plastic, and even the mechanical buttons on the right rib cannot boast of the presence of metal.  This is not surprising, because the device is a budget level.  Therefore, the gadget must be understaffed with a cover and a high-quality protective film.  All this will avoid possible damage to the case during use of the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  <strong>CPU</strong> </h2><p>  A very modest CPU is used in the Lenovo A6000.  The reviews, of course, highlight the acceptable performance level of the Snapdragon 410 (namely, this chip from Qualkom is used in this device) in most applications.  But this is true only for undemanding applications.  But demanding programs will not function normally on this gadget.  This central processor has only 4 computing modules.  They are based on the A53 architecture, and their frequency can increase when solving the most demanding tasks to very modest levels by today's standards - 1.3 GHz.  All this provides a fairly good level of energy efficiency of this processor solution.  Acceptable performance is achieved through 4 cores.  In this case, if necessary, unused computing modules of the central processing unit are disabled.  This silicon crystal is manufactured in accordance with the 28-nm process technology.  Another important feature of this chip can be called support for 64-bit applications.  But, again, the most demanding programs on this CPU will not work normally. </p>

    <h2>  Graphic accelerator </h2><p>  Paired with a CPU, this device uses the Adreno 305 graphics accelerator.  Like the central processor, the video accelerator was developed by Kualkom.  A high level of performance, like the CPU, this solution can not certainly boast.  But for most of the tasks (including the launch of medium-sized toys in terms of demanding on the hardware resources of the smartphone) it is enough.  The main purpose of this graphics accelerator is to free the CPU from processing video information displayed on the touch screen, and this is exactly what this graphic solution copes with. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  A sufficiently high-quality screen is installed in the <span>Lenovo A6000.</span>  <span>Reviews, a review</span> on the Internet confirm this, highlight this significant plus of this model.  Its diagonal, as noted earlier, is 5 inches.  Resolution in this case allows you to display an image in HD or 720p, that is, 1280 x 720 pixels.  The display matrix itself is manufactured using IPS technology.  Accordingly, the picture is bright and saturated.  And the viewing angles are as close as possible in this case to 180 degrees.  In this case, there is no noticeable distortion of the image on its surface.  Another advantage of the device is the presence of a sensor for automatically adjusting the brightness of the display.  Not every entry-level model has a similar sensor. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The rather small capacity of the integrated drive in the Lenovo A6000 LTE is 8 GB.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  distinguish this feature of this "smart" phone as a small drawback.  In this case, the operating system in this device takes about 3 GB.  To install programs allocated 2 GB.  And the user can use the remaining 3 GB to store personal documents (photos, videos, and so on).  This is clearly not enough to unleash the full potential of this model.  Therefore, the owner of Lenovo A6000 will have to additionally buy an external flash card.  Its maximum size in this case can reach 32 GB.  RAM in this smartphone is only 1 GB.  At the same time, system processes occupy about 600 MB.  That is, the user, when launching their applications, can count on the remaining 400 MB.  Again, to run 3-4 applications this is enough.  But still it is recommended to periodically clean the RAM.  Also, optimization software will not be out of place.  For example, the "Wedge Master" will significantly optimize the use of RAM.  It can be installed from the branded app store of the search giant. </p><h2>  Cameras, device features for photos and videos </h2><p>  The high quality of reproduced sounds boasts a smartphone Lenovo A6000 LTE.  Reviews highlight another plus: it is the main camera.  Although it is based on a sensor with modest 8 megapixels today, but these are ‚Äúreal‚Äù megapixels, and not obtained using the interpolation technology now popular.  The device also implements technologies such as autofocus and LED backlight.  All this allows you to get photos of very good quality.  There is also the ability to record video on this device, but the format of the clips received with its help will be 720p.  The front camera is based on a more modest sensor - 2 megapixels.  For making video calls this is more than enough.  But this is enough for a selfie.  Given the fact that this device belongs to the initial segment, these shortcomings are not so significant for this niche of gadgets. </p>

    <h2>  Battery smart phone and its features </h2><p>  The capacity of the complete battery is 2300 mAh in the Lenovo A6000 LTE.  Reviews indicate that with active use this is enough for 12-14 hours of work.  This value will decrease to 6-7 hours if you run an average toy in terms of hardware requirements of the smartphone.  Well, in the highest saving mode, you can already count on 2-2.5 days of battery life.  Again, to achieve this, you will have to use the device to a minimum.  And the optimization software for energy consumption certainly will not be superfluous.  On the other hand, another option to increase the autonomy of the Lenovo A6000 can be an external battery, which, when discharging the main battery, will allow you to stay connected.  Although this is not quite an ‚Äúelegant‚Äù solution, which will complicate the use of the device during its active use.  But there is definitely no other solution in this case. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  All the main data transfer methods are implemented in Lenovo A6000 LTE.  This list includes the following: </p><ul><li>  The device has 2 SIM cards.  Both of them can work in all existing mobile networks today: GSM (the second name of this standard is 2G, theoretically information transfer speed can reach 500 kbps, and this is enough to communicate on social networks or download a simple site);  3G (when working in such a mobile network, the information transfer rate could theoretically reach 63 Mbps, and this is already quite enough for making video calls, watching online video and downloading already large Internet resources);  LTE (or as it is also called - 4G, in this case, the speed increases to a maximum of 150 Mbps, and this already makes it possible to watch videos online in HD quality). </li><li>  Another fast wireless way to share information on this device is Wi-Fi.  In this case, the maximum speed is 100 Mbps, and this, as in the case of LTE, allows you to watch video in 720p format. </li><li>  You can connect a wireless headset or share photos or videos of a small size with the help of "Bluetooth".  Its version is 4.0, and this allows you to easily connect to most devices of this class. </li><li>  To implement navigation functions, a GPS transmitter is integrated in this device.  This is enough to turn a smartphone into a navigator.  Also for these purposes, Google Maps are preinstalled, but professionals in this case recommend using specialized software. </li><li>  Two functions are assigned to the wired MicroUSB.  The first one is charging the battery.  But the second, no less important, is synchronization with a PC. </li><li>  The last wired interface is an audio jack.  It allows you to connect any external speaker system to this gadget and output sound to it.  In this case, the sound quality will be simply excellent. </li></ul><h2>  System software </h2><p>  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù is a system software installed in the smartphone Lenovo A6000 LTE 8 GB.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  they talk about the version number 4.4, preinstalled on it initially.  But then, at the first connection to the global web, the system software is updated to version already 5.0.  Otherwise, the software set on this device is typical.  There is a built-in email client from the search giant.  Chinese engineers have not forgotten about Google Maps, Google +, and other utilities from the developer of the operating system.  Also there are mini-applications from the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù on the device: organizer, calendar, calculator and more.  Well, it‚Äôs difficult to do without social networks now.  On this device, ‚ÄúTwitter‚Äù and ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù are pre-installed.  Everything else that is not included in this list will have to be installed separately from the application store. </p>

    <h2>  Gadget Reviews </h2><p>  There are virtually no significant flaws in the Lenovo A6000.  Reviews and a review of its specifications clearly indicate this.  Its only negative can be considered a short battery life.  But this issue is easily solved with the help of special optimization software and an external additional battery.  Otherwise, this gadget boasts a number of advantages: </p><ul><li>  Excellent sound quality and the presence of 2 speakers at once. </li><li>  A fairly productive platform, as for an elementary class device. </li><li>  Flawless main camera. </li><li>  The latest version of system software. </li><li>  Quality display. </li></ul><h2>  Device price now </h2><p>  The most affordable today is the Lenovo A6000 black smartphone.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  indicate its affordable cost: about 115 dollars.  If you add 5-10 dollars, you can purchase a white or red version of this device.  In principle, this can be said to be the standard cost of such devices today.  Lenovo A6000 cannot boast of something remarkable in this regard.  But the improved sound quality, the excellent main camera and the impeccable touch screen are the pluses that precisely make this device stand out from its analogues. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  One of the best deals in its class is the Lenovo A6000.  The reviews of its owners confirm this.  This is a truly balanced solution, in which there was even a place for a twist: improved sound quality.  But even if this is discarded, it‚Äôs all the same, Lenovo has got another excellent device that will not leave anyone indifferent.  The most often found today is the Lenovo A6000 LTE 8 GB black.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  distinguish its feature related to the fact that dirt, fingerprints and scratches on it are not so noticeable as in other cases.  Moreover, his price is lower.  Separately, it should also be noted that an updated version of this device, which is designated as "Lenovo A6010," has already appeared on the market.  It differs from the "A6000" in the presence of 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage.  Of course, it is more preferable to buy it, but the cost of this gadget is much higher.  There is also a Chinese version of this device - Lenovo K3.  It also has identical characteristics, but it will not work in 3G and LTE networks, as it is optimized only for the Chinese market, which has other mobile standards.  These important nuances when buying this device must be paid attention to. </p>
