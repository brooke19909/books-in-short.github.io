    <h2>  Young years </h2><p>  Goncharov Nikolay Afanasevich was born in St. Petersburg in 1787.  His family lived in the Linen Estate, which was located next to the shipbuilding plant.  The thing is that this plant was founded by Nikolai Afanasevich‚Äôs great-grandfather, especially for the construction of the fleet of Peter I. It is not surprising that the Goncharov family lived in abundance and could afford to give their son a quality education. </p><p>  In addition, the boy had a phenomenal intelligence, thanks to which he quickly mastered all the educational material.  So, to his adulthood, he thoroughly knew four languages: French, German, English and Russian.  He was no less gifted in musical art. </p>

    <h2>  Goncharov‚Äôs disease </h2><p>  In the period from 1811 to 1814, Nikolai Afanasevich manages the affairs of his father, as long as he carries out a special order of the sovereign at the border.  But upon returning home, the senior Goncharov excommunicated his son from family affairs, despite the fact that he managed to achieve great success in this.  This became a trigger - the young gentleman began to constantly look for joy in wine in order to drown out the offense against his father.  And once, being very drunk, he falls from the horse upside down. </p><p>  Physically, Nikolai Goncharov was not injured, but his mind became confused.  Periods of melancholy gave way to attacks of fierce aggression towards others.  So, under the influence of anger, he almost stabbed his daughter Natalia, who miraculously escaped by closing herself in the room. </p><p>  Over the years, the disease only progressed.  Because of this, friends, relatives, and even his own wife turned away from him one after another.  Therefore, in September 1861, Goncharov Nikolai Afanasevich died all alone in his old house in Moscow.  According to the records, in the end his only friend was only the old servant, who either from fidelity or from hopelessness did not dare to leave him. </p>
