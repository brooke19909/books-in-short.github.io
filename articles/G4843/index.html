The right choice of vacuum cleaner is crucial in creating the comfort of a modern home. </p><p>  A vacuum cleaner is a device that is now taken for granted, but this has not always been the case. </p><p>  History says that the first attempts to create a vacuum cleaner were made in England in 1599. </p><div class="photo" data-original="qwyw.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of Vacuum Cleaners 1" class="if uuid-2319360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2319360.jpg"></div><p>  In June 1869, Chicago inventor Ives McGaffey developed and patented a sweeper.  McGaffey was not driven, cleaned carpets with a hand pump and was the first analogue of vacuum cleaners in the United States.  The vacuum cleaner was made of wood and canvas and was called the "Whirlwind". </p><p>  John Thurman invented the first gasoline-powered vacuum cleaner in 1899.  He is considered the first invention for a motorized vacuum cleaner.  In the UK, Hubert Cecil Booth worked on his own version of a motorized vacuum cleaner and patented it on August 30, 1901.  This car was so big that it rode on a horse-drawn carriage, worked on gasoline and consisted of long hoses that ran into the room through the windows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fuau.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacuum Cleaner History 2" class="if uuid-2319362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2319362.jpg"></div><p>  A manual vacuum cleaner for the home was very bulky, noisy and inefficient.  The first disposable vacuum cleaner bag was made in Toledo, Ohio in 1920.  A bag with a filter fiber was thrown away after removal from the vacuum cleaner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Vacuum cleaners continue to improve and adapt using new technologies.  The inventor of the first vacuum cleaner probably did not think that a modern <span>sweeper</span> would look like the photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="5productreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacuum cleaner of the future" class="if uuid-2319392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2319392.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of Dust Collectors </h2><p>  Currently, vacuum cleaners are divided into two types: a manual vacuum cleaner from the network and a cordless one on batteries.  The principle of operation of network vacuum cleaners is very simple and affordable even for a child.  The plug is inserted into the outlet, the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù is turned on, and the cleaning process begins. </p><p>  The main advantage of wired vacuum cleaners is unlimited working time and power from 1200 to 2200 watts.  The price depends on the brand of the vacuum cleaner, its configuration and functionality.  On average, it ranges from 12,000 to 30,000 rubles. </p><p>  Such a vacuum cleaner is not always convenient.  It is not safe to pull the cord around the room, especially when minor children live in the house, they can catch the cord and get injured.  It also cannot be used outdoors, for example, when it is necessary to clean garden furniture. </p><p>  In the case of such cleaning, <span>cordless vacuum cleaners</span> have an indisputable advantage <span>.</span>  They are not tied to electricity, they allow you to freely move around the room and clean things that are far away, these can be seats or mats in the car.  They are not as efficient in power as wired, they work for no more than 60 minutes, nevertheless they are in demand among their customers.  They are used in small areas and for cleaning surfaces outside residential premises. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  With a device not tied to an outlet, cleaning takes less time, and most of them are great for use in cars, which makes them even more versatile. </p><h2>  Hand vacuum cleaner rating </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mall.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacuum cleaner" class="if uuid-2319400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2319400.jpg"></div><p>  Half the effort when vacuuming is spent constantly connecting and disconnecting the vacuum cleaner to get to the right place.  Cordless vacuums do not have these drawbacks. </p><p>  Instead of doing a large cleaning every week, it is easier to quickly and immediately clean dirty stains and remove spilled crumbs after dinner so that they do not spread throughout the house.  A good cordless vacuum cleaner is expensive, and their battery life is different.  The most powerful ones last about 60 minutes, and the less powerful ones last 20 minutes, and the buyer will have to make this choice between cost, cleaning efficiency and time. </p><p>  Review of manual vacuum cleaners by rating 2018: </p><ol><li>  Bosch Athlet BCH 625 KTGB. </li><li>  Electrolux Rapido. </li><li>  Philips MiniVac EnergyCare 10.8 V. </li><li>  LG CordZero Bedding. </li><li>  Samsung Flex Slim. </li></ol><h2>  Bosch Athlet BCH 625 KTGB </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.hughes.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern vacuum cleaner" class="if uuid-2319422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2319422.jpg"></div><p>  Bosch handheld vacuum cleaner, one of the most popular brands, has proven itself in operation.

A higher price means better suction, longer battery life and shorter recharge times.  Vacuum cleaners with lower price indicators have weak designs, low functionality and a short period of operation, up to 20 minutes. </li><li>  All vacuum cleaners have a reduced weight of 3-5 kg ‚Äã‚Äãcompared to the weight of the network dust collectors (7 kg). </li><li>  Battery charging time is considered normal - from 2 to 5 hours, some models charge up to 16 hours. </li><li>  A turbo cleaning function is required, then garbage can be removed in 10-15 minutes, with conventional models up to 40 minutes. </li><li>  Cordless vacuum cleaners are ideal for small areas where dust and dirt can be easily removed. </li><li>  A small handheld vacuum cleaner works worse on a carpet; many of them require that the turbo unit sucks in dust and animal hair, which requires sufficient power. </li><li>  The dust collecting capacity is around 0.6 liters, compared to 2-3 liters for wired vacuum cleaners.  This means that cordless vacuum cleaners should be cleaned more often from dust, and this is not so good for those users who suffer from dust allergies. </li><li>  Frequent complaints from customers are caused by the noise of the model.  The quietest models are called Dyson vacuum cleaners, which have several innovations, including acoustic felt in the engine, which absorbs vibrations and streamlined air ducts that reduce turbulence. </li><li>  The warranty period for servicing vacuum cleaners ranges from 1 year to 5 years.  A model such as the Hoover Air Cordless Lift Bagless BH51120PC Review has a 5-year warranty period.  This is one of the newest wireless vacuum devices with a 50-minute runtime and two lithium-ion batteries. </li></ol><h2>  Prospects for the development of vacuum cleaners </h2><p>  Alternative types of vacuum cleaners are becoming increasingly popular, in particular hand-held vacuum cleaners.  This category in 2017 recorded a significant increase in consumption.  Forecasts suggest that the market for cordless vacuum cleaners will grow by 9.02% until 2019. </p><p>  Further development of automatic vacuum cleaners for residential areas is expected using sophisticated features, including sensory movement, scheduled cleaning and automatic movement.  Vacuum cleaners will run on infrared sensors, which will provide a logical serial path to avoid obstacles, as well as with extended battery life. </p><p>  Industry players make major investments in research and development of vacuum cleaners using touch controls and voice recognition technology to enhance user convenience.  In addition, it is expected that growing preference will be given to automatic and intelligent vacuum cleaners.  <span>The main suppliers of a manual vacuum cleaner on the market in 2017-2018:</span> </p><ul><li>  Bosch und Siemens Hausger√§te; </li><li>  LG </li><li>  Neato Robotics; </li><li>  Samsung </li><li>  Vorwerk; </li><li>  De'Longhi; </li><li>  ECOVACS; </li><li>  Groupe SEB; </li><li>  Hanool Robotics. </li></ul><p>  It is expected that devices with a built-in security feature will appear, such as unauthorized entry into the apartment, intrusion and fire alarm.  Battery-powered handheld vacuum cleaners are a great modern choice. </p>
