  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moscow and Ryazan are now even closer than before</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The distance from Moscow to Ryazan is only 200 kilometers.  And <span>modern transport</span> allows you to get there in a matter of hours.  Business contacts, travel interests and many potential experiences are mutually accessible to residents of both cities. </p><p>  The birthplace of Sergei Yesenin is an ideal place both for large cheerful companies, and for a lonely traveler craving for new romantic experiences and interesting acquaintances. </p><h2>  How to get there by car </h2><p>  The distance from Moscow to Ryazan by car can be covered in about 2-4 hours.  Such a long time is associated with high traffic on Moscow roads. </p><p>  You need to move either along the E30 highway, or along the Novoryazanskoye highway.  In the first case, you will have to go around, but busy roads will probably be avoided. </p><p>  The option of such a trip is not the most convenient. </p><ul><li>  Firstly, it will not be possible to bypass paid sections of the route. </li><li>  Secondly, to spend 4 hours to overcome 200 kilometers is very short-sighted. </li><li>  Thirdly, such a move will tire you, and you will not get the impression of the city. </li></ul><p>  You can save money spent on fuel by taking fellow travelers with you.  Fortunately, modern technologies provide a lot of opportunities for selecting those. </p><p>  The average cost that drivers set is 350 rubles.  This is cheaper than other means of transportation for the companion and convenient for the owner of the car, as it allows you to ‚Äúbeat off‚Äù the full cost of fuel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Ryazan" class="if uuid-2393630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2393630.jpg"></div><h2>  Rail is even easier </h2><p>  Moscow and Ryazan are connected by high-speed railway.  You are not waiting for the Sapsan, of course, but you can get there.  And very fast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Twice a day, a direct train Moscow - Ryazan leaves the capital.  It takes about 2.5 hours.  There are also a huge number of passing flights, for example, No. 46 - a seated train going to Voronezh.  Using it, you can get to Ryazan even faster. </p><p>  In addition to speed and relatively low prices, a serious plus is that the trains are now very comfortable.  Each seat has an electrical outlet, each wagon has dry closets and the ability to order coffee and an hour with cookies. </p><p>  The ticket price ranges from 700 to 1500 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ultrasawt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="girl at the train station" class="if uuid-2393649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2393649.jpg"></div><h2>  Travel by bus </h2><p>  From the bus station Kotelniki or Krasnogvardeiskaya you can go from Moscow to Ryazan by bus.  It will take longer than a train - about 3-4 hours.  Buses are not very comfortable, but you can tolerate a few hours.  A serious minus of this method of transportation is the lack of any amenities in transport.  There is no place to charge the phone, go to the toilet or wash your hands too.  Of course, the bus will make several stops, but traveling will not give comfort. </p><p>  In general, the event is more than dubious.  A long trip in unsanitary conditions, when still rocking, is not a good idea. </p><p>  The average ticket price is from 400 to 1000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="austingwalters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="straight road" class="if uuid-2393634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2393634.jpg"></div><h2>  What to choose? </h2><p>  Of course, each person understands comfort differently.  Someone does not see their trip without their own car, someone likes hiking and is able to get with a backpack from the station to the hotel. </p><p>  Perhaps the most appropriate option is to travel by train from Moscow to Ryazan. </p><ul><li>  Firstly, it is very fast.  A couple of hours - and you are already in another region. </li><li>  Secondly, it is cheap enough.  A round-trip ticket in a comfortable carriage will cost 1.5-2 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Thirdly, it is very convenient.  Seat cars have comfortable seats with tables and a footrest. </li></ul><p>  Do not waste a minute of your life in vain - travel, fill your life with events and impressions.  How can you worry about vain problems when you have a train car in front of you, and in front of you a new city with its own special spirit and entertaining sights?  So feel free to go from Moscow to Ryazan and spend an unforgettable weekend in central Russia. </p>
