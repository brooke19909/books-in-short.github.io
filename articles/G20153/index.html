    <p>  Becquerel Henry was born on December 15, 1852 in Paris, in the house of Cuvier, which was the property of the National Museum of <span>Natural History.</span>  The life of each of the members of the famous Becquerel dynasty was connected with this house.  The grandfather of the future scientist, Antoine Cesar Becquerel (years of life - 1788-1878), was first a member of the Paris Academy of Sciences, and since 1838 - its president.  The research of minerals carried out by him was widely known.  In particular, he studied their magnetic, thermoelectric, piezoelectric, mechanical and other properties.  The house contained a unique collection of samples, which played a large role in the life of Becquerel Alexander Edmond, son of Antoine Cesar.  This person (years of life - 1820-1891) was also engaged in research.  In addition, he was a member of the Paris Academy of Sciences, and since 1880 he became its president.  Also, Henri Becquerel's father was a professor of physics and served as director of the National Museum of Natural History. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The first studies of Henry </h2>

    <p>  When Henry was 18 years old, he began to help his father in his studies, becoming his assistant.  It was then that he developed an interest in the problems of photography and phosphorescence, which Becquerel remained for his whole life.  This interest was inherited by Antoine Henry, his son.  Henri Becquerel‚Äôs book ‚ÄúLight, its causes and actions‚Äù later became Antoine‚Äôs handbook. </p><p>  Antoine Cesar, the grandfather of our hero, paid great attention to the education of his grandson.  From a young age, the boy had something that allowed Antoine, who did not see his outstanding abilities, to consider that he would go far. </p><h2>  Education at the Lyceum and Polytechnic School </h2><p>  The atmosphere that reigned in Cuvier's house contributed to the formation of Henry's deep and serious interest in physics.  The boy was identified in the Lyceum of Louis Legrand.  In this educational institution, it should be noted that he was lucky with the teachers.  At the age of 19, in 1872, Becquerel Henry graduated from the Lyceum.  Then he continued his studies at the Polytechnic School.  From the first course, the young man began to actively conduct his own research.  Subsequently, the experimental skills acquired at this time were very useful to him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Personal tragedy, first publication </h2><p>  Upon graduation, Henry began a 3-year period of service at the Institute of Railways, where he carried out engineering activities.  At this time, he married the daughter of a professor of physics.  The girl's name was Lucy Jamen.  He met her back in lyceum years.  However, the family happiness of the scientist was short-lived.  Becquerel Henri lost his beloved wife, who was barely 20 years old.  She left him a newborn son, Jean. </p><p>  Science helped Henry survive this loss.  The scientist is completely immersed in his research.  In 1875, the first publication of Henri Becquerel (in the Journal de Physicist) took place.  His article was noticed, and a 24-year-old scientist was offered to become a tutor at the Polytechnic School.  In this educational institution, after 20 years, he was already a professor. </p><h2>  Work with father, doctoral dissertation </h2><p>  Becquerel Henry in 1878 began working at the Museum of Natural History, where he was an assistant to his father.  The main subject of their work was related to the field of magneto-optics and crystal optics.  In particular, scientists carried out interesting studies of how the plane of <span>polarization of light</span> rotates in a magnetic field <span>.</span>  This curious phenomenon was discovered by Michael Faraday.  Every day watching the successes of his son, who was already known as an excellent experimenter, Father Henri was proud of him.  Antoine Henri Becquerel in 1888 presented his doctoral dissertation at the Sorbonne.  This work was a continuation of the research of his father and grandfather, as well as the result of ten years of work by the author himself.  She was rated very highly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Scientific career and new marriage </h2><p>  Henri Becquerel a year later became a member of the Paris Academy of Sciences.  He took the post of secretary of the physical department.  After 3 years, Henry was already a professor at the National Museum of Natural History.  His second marriage, 14 years after widowhood, dates back to the same time. </p><h2>  An important discovery made by chance </h2><p>  If it were not for the will of chance, we would recall this scientist only as a conscientious and qualified experimenter, but no more.  However, one very important event occurred.  It was thanks to him that Henri Becquerel became known throughout the world.  Interesting facts about this scientist are numerous, but the most curious, perhaps, is related to how he discovered radioactivity. </p><p>  On March 1, Henri Becquerel studied in his laboratory the luminescence of uranium salts.  Having completed the work, he wrapped a sample (a patterned metal plate coated with uranium salt) in opaque and thick black paper.  The scientist put this sample on a box with photographic plates in a drawer and closed the drawer.  After a while, Henry took out a box of photographic plates.  He showed them, most likely, following his habit of carefully checking everything.  The scientist was puzzled, as he discovered that for some reason they were illuminated.  Henry saw an image of a metal patterned plate, which for some reason appeared.  How could he explain this?  The light could not get on the plates.  Therefore, as Becquerel realized, some other rays caused this action. </p><h2>  Further study of rays discovered by Becquerel </h2>

    <p>  Physicists already knew about the existence of rays that lead to blackening of photographic plates and are invisible to the eye.  Only six months before, X-ray made its sensational discovery.  X-ray detection is one of the most important events in the <span>history of physics.</span>  At this time, everyone was talking about him.  Perhaps this is precisely why the report made by physicist Henri Becquerel at the Paris Academy of Sciences on March 2, 1896, was met with keen interest.  The scientist on May 12 spoke about his discovery at the Museum of Natural History, in front of a wide audience.  And then he announced this at the Paris International Physical Congress, held in August 1900.  By this time, the one who discovered radioactivity had already realized that the radiation he discovered was not luminescence.  It is also unlike other radiation known to physicists.  Neither under chemical nor physical (pressure, heating, etc.) influences did not change.  It was not possible to detect a decrease in its intensity.  It seemed that a certain inexhaustible source radiates this energy. </p><p>  By that time it was already known that the action of invisible rays discovered by Becquerel, leads not only to blackening of photographic plates.  They also produce other actions, including biological ones.  For example, ulcers formed on Becquerel‚Äôs body from a drug that was in his pocket.  They did not heal for a long time.  Since then, scientists have begun to put drugs in lead boxes. </p><h2>  Collaboration with M. and P. Curie </h2>

    <p>  Among those who were interested in the discovery made by Becquerel, there were a number of outstanding scientists.  It should be noted Henri Poincar√©, as well as D.I. Mendeleev, who specially arrived in Paris to get acquainted with its author.  Also among these scientists were the spouses Maria and <span>Pierre Curie.</span>  Curie's interest has led to important results.  The history of the discovery of radioactivity continued with the following finding out: it turns out that it is inherent, in addition to uranium, to some other chemical elements, albeit to different degrees.  Scientists continued to study the physical nature of the rays discovered by Becquerel.  As a result of this, the effect of energy release occurring during radioactive decays was discovered, as well as induced radioactivity, etc. </p><h2>  Honored Recognition </h2><p>  The outstanding achievements of Henri Becquerel received well-deserved recognition.  The scientist was invited to the Royal Society of London.  In addition, the Paris Academy of Sciences awarded Henri all the then insignia.  Becquerel spoke on August 8, 1900 in Paris at the International Physical Congress, at which he read the keynote address. </p><h2>  Nobel Prize </h2>

His biography is also interesting because this scientist became the first Frenchman to bring the Nobel medal to Paris.  The Curie spouses, unfortunately, could not come to get it in Stockholm.  For them, the Nobel Prize was awarded to the Minister of France. </p><h2>  last years of life </h2>

    <p>  An enthusiastic reception, honors, international recognition - all this awaited Henri Becquerel.  However, he did not change his lifestyle.  The scientist until the last days remained a modest worker devoted to science.  Henri Becquerel, whose discoveries were so important for the further development of science, died in Le Croisic (Brittany) at the age of 55.  Craters on Mars and the Moon are named in his honor, as well as a unit of radioactivity - becquerel.  The name of this scientist is included in the list of the greatest French scientists, which is located on the ground floor of the Eiffel Tower. </p><h2>  The fate of Jean Becker </h2><p>  Successful was the scientific career of Jean Becquerel.  He was a worthy successor to his father.  This scientist was born on February 5, 1878 in Paris, where all Becquerels worked.  His life was long.  The scientist died at the age of 75, being a member of the Paris Academy of Sciences and a recognized physicist. </p><h2>  New questions </h2>

    <p>  Like all fundamentally new achievements, such as the discovery of energy-saving technologies, the detection of radioactivity has given scientists not only answers.  It also raised new questions and problems.  What mechanism underlies radioactive decay?  What actions do rays produce and why?  Scientists still do not have an exhaustive answer to these and other questions. </p>
