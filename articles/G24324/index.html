    <h2>  Hotels and après ski </h2><p>  And what to do when the evening comes, and you already have plenty of frolic on the tracks of the Canazei ski resort?  Reviews of tourists are advised to take a closer look at the Eges spa center, where you can visit an excellent thalassotherapy course, take a steam bath in the sauna and swim in the pool.  In Alba di Canazei there is the ice palace "Gianmaria Scola", where ice skating is practiced.  The resort itself has a good movie theater, and if you miss museums, then in the nearby town of Vigo di Fassa there is a very good exhibition dedicated to Romance culture.  In the Sella Ronda Valley, a ski marathon is held, where thousands of participants and spectators gather. </p><p>  The resort itself and the neighboring villages have many housing options.  This is not too expensive hotels for three or four stars, and apartments designed to accommodate large companies or families.  In terms of amenities and value for money, tourists recommend hotels such as Azola, Lorin, Crepe Negra, Fjordalizo and Grunvald. </p><h2>  Ski resort Canazei (Italy): reviews </h2><p>  Experienced tourists value the slopes from Chiampak to Alba above all, but this is the road for true adrenaline lovers.  Freeride lovers prefer Belvedere, which is located at an altitude of 2500 meters above sea level, as well as the peak of Call Rodell.  Moreover, the photos of the Canazei ski resort from here are excellent.  But in those places there are often avalanches, so you need to carefully monitor the weather and warnings of special services.  Apre-ski and restaurants are praised by many tourists in the neighboring villages of Albé and Peña.  The hotels here are very beautiful, directly integrated into the stunning mountain scenery and built in the style of Tyrolean chalets. </p>
