    <h2>  Sunmelia Beach Resort Hotel Spa 5 *: reviews of the infrastructure of the complex </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The quality of tourist services provided at this hotel was very good.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Its territory is planned quite ergonomically.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">All infrastructure elements in the hotel are located compactly, and finding them if necessary will not be completely difficult.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The pools in this complex are large and deep.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">So swimming in them, judging by the reviews, is convenient.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">And the water in the hotel pools is usually clean.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The slides at this hotel are praised by absolutely all travelers.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">At least, children's attractions of this type in the hotel, as many of its guests note, are quite safe.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">On adult slides, experienced tourists are advised to ride carefully.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Here, unfortunately, you can get injured.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Not too good</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span

data-mce-mark="1">In the courtyard of the hotel, unfortunately, you can see quite a lot of garbage.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">In the mornings, guests are sometimes even bothered by a not too pleasant smell.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Animations in this recreation complex are standard.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Judging by the reviews, nothing original is offered to vacationers here.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">This complex was once built for German tourists.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">And they, as you know, are not too big lovers of animation.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Recently, Russian vacationers are increasingly visiting the hotel.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">But under them the hotel’s service, apparently, has not yet been managed.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The elevators in this hotel, as many vacationers note, are working properly.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">However, at the peak of the season, tenants often have to stand in line in order to climb them to the floor.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">According to many guests, elevators in such a large hotel could have been provided and more.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">In general, tourists evaluate the work of this hotel, judging by the reviews from the Internet, as quite tolerable.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">On the special websites of tour operators, in the "Reviews" section, the ratings of Sunmelia Beach Resort Hotel Spa 5 * are approximately 3.5-4.5 out of 5 possible.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">And this, of course, is quite a lot.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Staff Travel Reviews </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">In general, tourists rate the hotel as quite comfortable.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">However, up to 5 stars, according to most vacationers, he still does not reach a bit.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">In any case, the staff at this hotel is working, judging by the reviews, it is quite friendly.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Domestic tourists in this hotel are polite and helpful, like any other, including from richer countries.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Unfortunately, not all employees understand the Russian language here.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">But in English the hotel staff speaks well.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">So, our compatriots in this hotel do not have any special problems with communicating with employees.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">In an extreme case, the Russians can use some kind of software translator on a smartphone.</span></span></span> </p>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The hotel dining room reviews of domestic tourists earned pretty good.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The food in the main restaurant of the hotel is served quite tasty.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The crowds in the dining room of the hotel are mainly only at peak season.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">At other times, guests can eat here without a crush and queues.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The Sunmelia Beach Resort Hotel Spa 5 * (Manavgat, Kyzylgach) operates, like most other five-star hotels, on an all-inclusive basis.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Guests who book rooms here receive free regular and brunch.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Lunches and dinners are served on the buffet.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Also included in the price are night soup, ice cream and sweets during certain hours.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">In addition to the dining room, this hotel also has several good, according to many guests, bars.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">One of them is located right on the beach.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Here you can also have a good snack at any time.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Many guests even go to the main dining room only in the morning, having lunch and dinner at this bar.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Meals here are also served free of charge to hotel residents.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span

data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">If desired, residents of the complex can choose, for example, fish or Turkish.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Beach Hotels </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The Sunmelia Beach Resort Hotel Spa 5 * hotel (Side, Kyzylgach) is located quite close to the sea.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The distance from its pool to the beach is only about 300 meters.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The hotel guests have to go to the sea first along the paved path, and then along the bridge.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The latter is thrown over the river, in which fish and turtles live.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">If desired, the residents of the hotel can rest in the gazebo along the way.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The hotel-owned beach itself has earned good traveler reviews.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">It is significant in size, and therefore there are almost no crowds here.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">One of the undoubted advantages of the Sunmelia Beach Resort Hotel Spa 5 * in comparison with many other complexes in Turkey is, according to many vacationers, the presence of a large number of sun loungers on the beach.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Hotel guests use loungers for free.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">At the same time, there are enough of them even at the peak of the season for everyone.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Among other things, judging by the reviews, the sun loungers on the beach are also comfortable (with a grid instead of a mattress and very light).</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Sun loungers are installed on the hotel beach not under umbrellas, but under a common awning.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">This, according to many travelers, is also very convenient.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Of course, beach towels are also provided at the hotel.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">This service at the hotel is also free.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Tourists can pick up towels at the spa.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Excursions guests of the hotel Sunmelia Beach Resort Hotel Spa 5 * are usually taken in the city.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Here they are cheaper than a tour operator.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Very good, according to many tourists, the agency is, for example, on the left side of the street, in the direction from the hotel to the village.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Here, all kinds of trips are sold even at a lower cost than that of merchants on the beach.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Unfortunately, there are no particularly interesting sights in Kyzylagach itself.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">To look at something worthwhile, tourists have to go to Side.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Here you can visit, for example, in the Agora - the center of the ancient city.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Columns made of marble from the Temple of Athens, the ruins of the Temple

This operator has earned a good reputation mainly for the fact that it offers its customers at most only comfortable and not too expensive hotels.  The only drawback of this company is its partnership with airlines that are not particularly popular and often not particularly credible. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Having bought a ticket to the Sunmelia Beach Resort Hotel Spa 5 * from "Aneks", "Pegasus Tourist" or from any other company, time in Turkey, therefore, can be spent quite pleasantly.  This hotel, even if it is not considered by the vacationers to be the best in the country, still offers guests a quite decent service.  In addition, the rooms here are rented, despite the fact that this hotel is five-star, at a relatively low cost.  For unpretentious tourists, this hotel is certainly suitable very well.  Those vacationers who want more comfort on vacation should still look for a hotel in Kyzalgach more expensive and with better service. </p>
