  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple swan: manufacturing secrets</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Carving is the art of aesthetically slicing fruits and vegetables.  Real craftsmen carve art masterpieces, decorating dishes in restaurants and hotels.  However, you can learn the basics of this type of creativity at home, having a sharp knife and a desire to learn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple swans" class="if uuid-2397036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2397036.jpg"></div><p>  In the article, we will consider how to cut a swan from an apple.  Step-by-step instructions and recommendations for beginning masters will help you easily cope with such a task.  It will be possible to decorate with a swan any festive dish, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãfruits, surprise a child who does not really like apples.  A beautiful large apple, a sharp knife and lemon juice will help to carry out the plan.  But more about this later in the article. </p><h2>  How to choose an apple? </h2><p>  In order to make a beautiful apple swan when carving, the fruit is selected in bright saturated color and elongated shape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="noteablemusictherapy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what apples to choose for carving" class="if uuid-2397937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2397937.jpg"></div><p>  It must be fresh and juicy so that the pulp of the fruit is dense.  When decorating, you can put two swans.  One is from red, and the other is from a green apple. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Preparation for the cutting process </h2><p>  So that when making a swan from an apple, nothing distracts from the process, you need to prepare everything you need next to it on the table.  You will need a sharp knife with a wide blade, if there is a knife for carving, then you can use it.  Since this fruit quickly darkens when cut, releasing juice, you need to prepare lemon juice or sliced ‚Äã‚Äãlemon slices.  Each slice is processed immediately before darkening occurs. </p><p>  To accidentally a sharp knife did not cut off the extra layers of the fruit, when making a swan from an apple, masters advise using the same butter knives as a stand.  To avoid damaging the surface of the table, use a plank. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  The first central slice in the manufacture of the swan from the apple is made at a slight slope, so that the tail of the fruit remains on one side.  Then the pulp is immediately processed with lemon and flipped down to the plank. </p><p>  Next to the workpiece, oil knives are placed on the table on the left and right.  Then, with a sharp knife, cut a rectangular corner from one and the other side of the middle of the apple.  Each of the corners is cut into smaller ones, as shown in the second frame of the photo below.  Do not forget to wipe all the small parts with lemon or sprinkle with lemon juice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a swan from an apple" class="if uuid-2397026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2397026.jpg"></div><p>  Then work continues on the central part.  Some leave it unchanged, but carved incisions can also be made on it.  It will be enough to cut off a corner or two.  If you have special curly knives for carving, then it will be beautiful to make a pattern on this part of the apple. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Making the neck and head of a bird is the next stage of work on a swan from an apple.  Perform it from half cut off at the beginning of the fetus.  You will need to cut an even layer with a width of 7-8 mm.  A thin strip separates along the lateral line of the apple with the peel.  You can leave the tail, you get a crown on the head of a royal bird.  The beak is pointed. </p><h2>  Assembly of all parts </h2><p>  When the preparations are over, you can begin to collect all the elements together.  Thinly cut corners are inserted into the rectangular side openings, with each slightly shifted backward.  Try to keep the distance between the parts the same.  When the wings on the left and right are assembled, begin work on installing the head. </p><div class="photo" data-original="food-hacks.wonderhowto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="step-by-step explanation of work" class="if uuid-2397044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2397044.jpg"></div><p>  This can be done in two ways, depending on the size of the cut neck.  If your part has a narrow strip, then the hole is cut out small, as in the photo in the step-by-step instruction.  However, many cut the wide lower part of the neck so that the head is attached more securely.  Then the hole under the neck is cut large, as in the photo above. </p><p>  Since the knife is sharp, and the slices are even and smooth, all the details are perfectly combined in the craft.  You can safely take it in your hand and shift it onto a festively decorated dish, without fear that it will crumble on the table. </p><p>  Carving of a swan from an apple can be considered in detail in the following video. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="N-5dwCj2zGw" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-5dwCj2zGw&amp;t=31s" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/2/7/5/2275.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, making jewelry with fruits with your own hands is not difficult.  Get down to business, you will definitely succeed! </p>
