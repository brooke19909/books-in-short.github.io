Why?  There are several explanations for this phenomenon.  Firstly, even in summer heat, Halkidiki is buried in lush greenery, which can not be said about the islands of Greece scorched by the sun and dried by the salty wind.  Secondly, the proximity to the ancient heritage of ancient Greece.  Relaxing here, you can join the sacrum, making a pilgrimage to Mount Athos, or just sailing on a ship around the peninsula-monastery, closed to women.  And finally, the offer of housing.  In Halkidiki you can find both expensive five-star hotels and budget hotels.  In this article we will consider the resort complex Sani Resort (Halkidiki).  Where is it located, what are its rooms and services, is it possible to reserve a place there yourself, or is the hotel available only for package tourists - we will describe all this below.  An informative basis for writing this article to a large extent served as traveler reviews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sani Resort (Halkidiki)" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1879106.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Halkidiki: what rest is there? </h2><p>  Before we begin the description of the hotel complex Sani Resort (Halkidiki), let's describe the place in which it is located.  The peninsula from a height resembles the trident of Neptune.  Three long capes stretched into the sea: Agion Oros, Sithonia and Kassandra.  For tourists, only the last two peninsulas are available.  Agion Oros, otherwise St. Athos, is a monastic republic.  Cassandra and Sithonia are different.  The last peninsula is quieter, respectable.  It is suitable for families with small children, lovers who come to Greece for a honeymoon, wealthy pensioners from Western Europe.  The average check at Sithonia is two times higher than at Kassandra.  It should be said that the resort complex is located just on this last peninsula.  Address Sani Resort (Halkidiki) - Kassandra.  It is always fun here, as young people like to relax in these places.  But violent (and sometimes loud) fun is concentrated on the beaches of the towns, because there is cheap housing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the peninsula </h2><p>  If you purchased a ticket to one of the hotels Sani Resort (Halkidiki, Greece), then you have nothing to worry about.  An airport transfer is included in the package.  Halkidiki is a large island, but it does not have its own airport.  The nearest touchdown point is Thessaloniki.  Direct flights of Aegean Airlines, Aeroflot, Ellineyr and Es Seven fly to Moscow from the airport of this city.  The first offer is more attractive in terms of price and travel time (150 euros round trip, three hours in the air).  Residents of St. Petersburg will have to pay twice as much for the flight.  The most budget option is offered by Turkish Airlines - 270 euros, and the fastest (six hours) - Lufthansa (five hundred euros). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sani Resort (Halkidiki) Greece" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1879105.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to the hotel complex </h2><p>  An independent traveler should be patient before he reaches the Sani Resort.  Halkidiki is a very large peninsula.  Its three prongs extended into the Aegean Sea for one hundred and fifty kilometers.  First you need to get from the airport to the bus station of Thessaloniki.  By taxi, such a trip will cost 25 euros.  The cheapest option to get to Halkidiki and Kassandra in particular is KTEL buses.  They specialize in delivering from the capital of the region passengers settlements of the peninsula (and there are a total of thirty-two of them).  The road will take about an hour and a half and will cost ten euros.  By taxi it will be faster, but the cost of the trip with a breeze will increase to one hundred euros.  The hotel complex occupies Cape Sani - hence its name.  The territory has its own <span>helipad,</span> so customers can be delivered directly from Thessaloniki Airport in ten minutes.  The bus arrives in the nearest village, from which the hotel has a free shuttle service for guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Sani Resort (Halkidiki)" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1879111.jpg" width="600"></div>

Of course, the client of one hotel can enjoy the infrastructure of all five establishments.  Between them runs domestic transport.  And each of the hotels is designed for a certain type of tourists.  For example, Porto Sani will appeal to adherents of a healthy lifestyle and yachtsmen, since its territory is adjacent to the pier.  You do not like the hull and would like to live in a secluded bungalow?  Then you - in the "Sani Club".  The same private lifestyle is respected at Dunes.  Sani Beach is a classic beachfront hotel.
