These searches are not always successful.  Therefore, our material and the above versions will be useful to those people who want to know the origin of the name Polyakov. </p><h2>  Version one: from the word "Pole" </h2><p>  To trust that all carriers of this surname are Poles is not worth it.  The explanation lies in long-standing events.  So, centuries ago, great importance was attached to the place where people lived.  Based on this fact, nicknames appeared.  But not every resident by nationality was a Pole.  For this reason, there are so many people with this surname. </p>

    <h2>  Second version: from the word "field" </h2><p>  So, we study further the origin of the surname Polyakov.  In ancient times, those people who were involved in field conservation were called ‚ÄúPoles‚Äù.  If you give a literal interpretation, then the Pole or raspberry was called a plain or field resident.  These words were also used to name the steppe black grouse. </p><h2>  Little known versions </h2><p>  <span>The history of the origin of the</span> Polyakov <span>surname is</span> directly associated with the word "Pole", or, in other words, lead a free life.  Thus, the Polyakovs are not serfs, but the most free people.  Because the surname has become common in the Cossack environment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is a possibility that the origin of the Polyakov surname is directly related to the roots in the names in which the initial combination of letters is ‚ÄúFields‚Äù.  We are talking about Polievkt, Polyana, Poluyan. </p>

    <p>  According to the next version, people who visited the Polish side and adopted some of the features of local residents (it could be speech manners or manners of movement), began to be called the corresponding nickname Polyak.  The version is quite probable, because in the XVI century close communication between Russians and Poles was traditional. </p><p>  And the last version of the origin of the surname Polyakov, which we will give, claims that the child who was born in the field was also called a Pole in Russia.  By the time of adulthood, the boy or girl legally received the name Polyakov (a). </p><h2>  Surname Polyakov: origin and significance </h2><p>  The value of this surname will cease to be a secret if it is possible to find information about those traits of character and personality that are inherent in its carriers.  If you cite the positive qualities, it is worth mentioning their activity, compliance, frankness, swiftness, honesty, kindness, complaisance.  Polyakov is the most common surname in the territory of the former USSR; it is well accepted by society. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It‚Äôs not always easy for people who have this surname to focus on achieving specific goals; in life, they attach great importance to new trends and are guided by their own impulses. </p>
