    <p>  Cosman has established itself as a quiet family-run hotel with home cooking, special dishes for the youngest tourists.  Here reigns calm and measured.  There is no intrusive animation.  But the <span>beaches of the coast</span> deserve the highest praise from tourists. </p><p>  Those who lived at Cosman Aparthotel claim that the ‚Äúcorresponding services for the appropriate money‚Äù rule does not work here, its level of service actually exceeds the declared ‚Äúthree stars‚Äù.  Perhaps that is why a relatively small hotel was able to bypass the rating of many five-star hotels on the websites of tour operators - 8.67 out of 10 possible points. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Cosman Aparthotel 3 (Crete) is located in the beautiful area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCrete, called <em>Kokkini Hani</em> , which in Greek translates as ‚Äúcock comb‚Äù.  Tourists who came to rest in the village have the opportunity to admire the sea and mountain landscape at the same time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel complex can be attributed to the second line.  From it to the sea is only 600 meters.  However, you have to go along a rather pleasant well-groomed road, so the path is not annoying. </p><p>  Geographically, the hotel is very well located.  It is only 15 km from Heraklion, the capital of Crete, and the international airport is 7 km away.  Within walking distance from the hotel is the <span>main road leading</span> to the center of the Gouves resort.  There is a good transport interchange, regular buses run regularly.  The main attractions of the island are located half an hour from the hotel. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The lifestyle of Cosman Aparthotel is quiet and measured, it coincides with the calm rhythm of the resort village of Kokkini Hani: daytime siesta and the practical lack of nightlife, if you do not take into account several nightclubs in the center of this village. </p>

    <p>  The territory of the hotel complex is very compact.  Almost all of it is occupied by an outdoor pool and terrace area.  She is always clean and tidy.  Around the pool there is a sufficient number of sun loungers and umbrellas for the lounge of the hotel guests.  There is also a bar where you can take soft drinks in the afternoon, and in the evening - beer, local white and red wine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel zone of the pool is very popular.  There are always vacationers.  Especially on hot days, when the shade of the canopies reliably protects from the sun, and slightly chilled water is served in the pool.  All this plus soft drinks such as forfe, cola and sprite provide a pleasant stay. </p><p>  At Cosman Hotel there is parking, a currency exchange.  The first circumstance is very useful for those who want to rent a car and independently explore the beauty and sights of the Mediterranean island. </p>

    <p>  There is a paid internet corner and billiards. </p><h2>  Building </h2><p>  Cosman Aparthotel was built in 1988.  Its full modernization took place in 2012.  The institution positions itself as an aparthotel on the market of travel services, as hotel rooms are close to apartments in functionality. </p><p>  The number of rooms is in two buildings: two-and three-story.  The rectangular buildings of a typical resort building with seemingly uncomplicated architecture, their facades are professionally painted with a combination of pastel brick, yellow and turquoise colors and are maintained in a presentable condition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The meaning of such functional architecture is not in external forms, but in ensuring proper housing conditions inside the buildings themselves.  The latter aspect is indeed observed.  The floors of the buildings have high ceilings, the architects did not save on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhotel rooms, and judging by the reviews, the guests really like it. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  There are 56 cozy guest rooms at the Cosman Aparthotel.  It is correct to start the description of the hotel complex rooms with the pure Cretan style in their design, which is characterized by the revitalization of the interior with unexpected bright details, an expressive combination of colors, thoughtful non-contrast lighting. </p><p>  Room sizes are from 20 m <sup>2</sup> to 50 m <sup>2</sup> .  There are 3 types of them in the hotel: standard, family, family double.  It is noteworthy that each guest room has a fully equipped kitchenette where you can make tea, coffee, warm up or cook food. </p>

    <p>  The hotel guests in their reviews indicate only one drawback in the equipment of the rooms: a too compact shower without a shower cabin. </p><p>  Rooms are cleaned six times a week, bed linen and towels are changed twice a week. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The Cosman Aparthotel is close to the beach.  The sandy shore, with a smooth entry into the water.  The sand is wonderful, clean and soft.  Umbrellas and sun loungers are provided to vacationers for a fee.  There is a beach volleyball court.  On the beach there is an opportunity to have a snack and drink soft drinks. </p><p>  However, motorists from among the vacationers are not limited to visiting the nearby beach.  A special attraction of Cyprus is the world-famous beach with fine and soft pink sand Elafonisi, which is located in the southwestern point of the island.  This color was obtained thanks to local sea shells crushed for thousands and thousands of years. Not far from the village of Metaly there is another exotic beach, the sand of which is red.  However, it is not recommended to take small children there.  Part of the path to it falls on a mountain trail along which there is no passage. </p>
