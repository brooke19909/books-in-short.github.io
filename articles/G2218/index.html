  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cottage Village "Karavaevo Lake-2": description, location, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many residents of the capital, as well as those moving from other places, increasingly prefer to live outside the city, in the conditions of a better environmental situation, to breathe fresh air.  Land plots for sale are gaining more and more popularity in this regard.  One of these is the cottage village "Karavaevo Lake-2", located in the Domodedovo city district of the Moscow region. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  If you drive about 33 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road along the Kashirskoye Highway, then turn left and still overcome a little more than 10 kilometers, then you get directly into Karavaevo Lake-2.  This project was launched after the successful development of the territory of the similar village "Karavaevo Lake", located within walking distance from his brother. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Panoramic view" class="if uuid-3175275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3175275.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of the village </h2><p>  "Karavaevo Lake-2" is spread over 25 hectares.  In total, 157 land plots of various sizes are offered for sale: from 10 to 17 acres.  The price for the allotment is from 900,000 to 1,600,000 rubles.  This location was not chosen by chance.  The village comfortably surrounds the forest, creating the most favorable ecological environment, the ability to breathe fresh air and enjoy the silence after a noisy metropolis.  Nearby are two ponds and the river Severka, near which you can relax in hot weather or go fishing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The location of the village "Karavaevo Lake-2" outside the city raises the question of the safety of its residents.  For this purpose, a fence around the perimeter is provided for the entire territory, a checkpoint is set up and security personnel are on duty around the clock. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The road to the village" class="if uuid-3175277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3175277.jpg"></div><p>  The administration of the village "Karavaevo Lake-2" takes care of its residents, centrally clearing the inner-village roads of snow in the winter, monitoring their lighting.  Cars at the entrance will not get stuck in a rut, as an asphalt road leads to the village. </p><h2>  What conditions are created? </h2><p>  The village‚Äôs own infrastructure offers its customers 10 kW of electricity supplied to the site, the ability to supply main gas, the right to connect to which has already been paid.  In order not to have to travel far for the necessary products, household cleaning products, within walking distance there are two stores offering everything you need. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction of houses" class="if uuid-3175274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3175274.jpg"></div><p>  For recreation of residents and their children a playground is provided.  And around the village there are many places where you can comfortably sit with the whole family, take a walk with pets.  In order to prevent waterlogging during melting snow in spring or heavy rains, a drainage drainage system is provided. </p><p>  At a distance of about 7 kilometers from the cottage village is the urban-type settlement Barybino and the village of Lobanovo.  You can get there by regular bus, which runs regularly.  Barybino is a fairly large settlement in which there are all the necessary objects of social infrastructure: school, kindergarten, clinic, temple, shops.  Residents of the village "Karavaevo Lake-2" can also take advantage of all this. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about Karavaevo Lake-2 can be heard from those who bought land and have already been built.  Some of them have chosen this cottage village as their permanent place of residence, away from the bustle of the city. </p><p>  Basically, the opinion of people is positive.  Indeed, fresh air, panoramic views of the village, the ability to live in unity with nature outweighs the few inconveniences associated with the lack of a well-developed network of infrastructure facilities.  But, on the other hand, life away from the city is chosen consciously, striving precisely for the above conditions. </p><p>  Some are not happy with the fact that they have to travel longer than if they lived in an urban environment.  But everyone makes his own choice.  Most such a life is enough. </p>
