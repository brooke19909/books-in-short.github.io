A small town is located in the north of the country, on the banks of the Kiyula River, almost a hundred kilometers from Tallinn.  Despite its small size, there is something to see. </p><p>  Rakvere attracts tourists with numerous historical and architectural monuments, ancient houses and temples, its own theater, as well as buildings in the style of Estonian functionalism. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.393199" data-lng="26.478416899999957" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/0/3/4/17034.png"></div><h2>  When is the best time to visit the city? </h2><p>  Rakvere (Estonia) is located in the temperate zone, transitional from continental to marine.  It is characterized by cool summers and warm winters.  In July, the average temperature does not rise above +17 ¬∞ C, and in February very rarely drops below ‚Äì5 ¬∞ C.  It is believed that it is more interesting to come to Rakvere in the summer, but in other seasons the weather here is comfortable for tourism. </p><h2>  Attractions Rakvere </h2><p>  The memorable places of this Estonian town are largely connected with its medieval history.  This is an ancient castle, and a Lutheran church, and narrow streets with preserved ancient buildings.  In addition, museums and city parks are important modern tourist sites.  We will introduce you to some of them in this short review. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tarvas </h2><p>  And we will begin our acquaintance with the city with its symbol - a sculpture installed on the hill of Vallim√§gi.  The sculpture of the huge tour, called Tarvas, appeared in Rakvere in 2002.  The author of the project was a local sculptor - Tauno Kangro.  The dimensions of the monument are impressive: its length is seven meters, and its height is four.  It is interesting that it was made on the initiative of the citizens who became the sponsors of the monument.  The names of all who contributed to the creation of the monument are carved on its stone pedestal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kultuurilinnad.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tarvas in Rakvere" class="if uuid-3205780" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3205780.jpg"></div><h2>  Old castle </h2><p>  We continue to explore the attractions of Rakvere.  Locals are proud of the medieval castle, which rises on the hill Vallim√§gi.  Until 1558, its owner was the Livonian Order.  Then he replaced several rulers, each of whom made changes to the architecture of the structure.  The castle was badly damaged during the war between the Poles and the Swedes (1602-1605).  During this period, he lost his defensive significance, since its restoration required a lot of time and money. </p><p>  Today the castle is a museum complex.  Visitors can see the expositions that are dedicated to the history of the fortification, early firearms.  Restorers were able to create a medieval atmosphere here.  Visitors at the entrance are met by controllers dressed in costumes of that time.  The castle has many different workshops in which you can not only touch everything, but also try yourself in one of the crafts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.lipilin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rakvere Castle" class="if uuid-3205803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3205803.jpg"></div><p>  In the gloomy dungeon of the castle is a room of fear, which is divided into three sections.  The first is a torture room with various tools for crushing, cauterizing and stretching the human body.  Then visitors can fall into the crypt with the "rotten dead".  In the last room there is hell, where the floor vibrates, howls and other chilling sounds are heard.  The overall atmosphere of the room helps to emphasize the appropriate lighting. </p><h2>  Estonian Police Museum </h2><p>  There are several museums in the city, but first of all, we recommend that you visit this one, since you cannot pass by such a Rakvere landmark.  It was decided to create by police officers who turned to museum workers for help.  The importance and complexity of the work of the police decided to present here in a playful way.  Adults and young visitors are offered to change into police uniforms, compose an identikit, take fingerprints, find important evidence and find fake money.  Moreover, here you can try on the role of the criminal. </p><p>  The museum exposition is interactive.  Here, visitors will be told about the history of law enforcement agencies of the country.  We are sure that such an excursion will be interesting for both children and adults. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.turizm.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Police" class="if uuid-3205812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3205812.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of the Holy Trinity </h2><p>  Many tourists will be interested in the cult sites of Rakvere.  There are three temples in the city.  A recognizable symbol of the city is the Lutheran church, which is the highest building of the county. </p><h2>  Church of the Holy Trinity </h2><p>  This church was built in the Middle Ages, and in the XVIII century it was updated and rebuilt.  The building has a high tower, the spire of which is visible from all over the city.  It impresses with its carved elements, which were performed by famous Estonian baroque craftsmen, the interior of the shrine. </p><p>  The temple attracts tourists with its ancient altar, which differs significantly from similar structures in its originality.  It is completely made of wood. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thepinsta.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Holy Trinity" class="if uuid-3205817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3205817.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of the Nativity of the Virgin </h2><p>  And another Rekvere church in Estonia.  She is known for storing the relics of St.  Sergius of Rakvere.  Interestingly, these are the only relics in the country put on display by visitors. </p><h2>  Monument to Arvo P√§rt </h2><p>  The famous Soviet and Estonian composer lived in Rakvere as a child.  The monument to the great countryman is installed on the central square of the city.  The sculpture depicts a boy standing next to a bicycle.  He paused to listen to the bewitching music that comes from the speaker.  The monument was unveiled for the 75th anniversary of the composer (2010). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Arvo P√§rt" class="if uuid-3205834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3205834.jpg"></div><p>  Paul Myand and Seakul Simson - the authors of the monument - not only perpetuated the memory of a fellow countryman, but also tried to convey the idea that an outstanding cultural figure could grow out of every child.  Every day, exactly at noon, Kyrie sounds on the tower of the Lutheran church - an amazing bell ringing written by Arvo P√§rt. </p>
