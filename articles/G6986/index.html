  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Superbright LEDs. Characteristics and parameters</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At the dawn of the era of LEDs, even a slight glow of the element seemed to be a breakthrough, because even a few pieces combined together practically did not consume energy.  Time passed, and similar products developed with it.  Today you will not surprise anyone with super-bright LEDs, which have become used everywhere.  But despite their prevalence, people know little about such LED elements.  Today's article will correct this omission. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ledrise.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Superbright LED Chips" class="if uuid-2988041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2988041.jpg"></div><h2>  High Brightness LEDs: General Information </h2><p>  Similar elements can be formally divided into 2 categories.  Some have increased power, others are designed in such a way that, at low power consumption, they can produce a luminous flux, which is several times more than that of conventional analogues. </p><p>  One of the representatives of such superbright LEDs are Cree products.  The cost of such chips is quite high, which leads to the appearance of many fakes.  Chinese manufacturers were especially distinguished in this field.  Often, their products at first shine even brighter than the original, but the counterfeit quickly degrades.  Already after 10-15 hours of continuous operation, the diode fades to a complete failure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about SMD components, then among them you can also find superbright LEDs, but their power consumption will be much higher, as well as the dimensions.  But the elements of small sizes can be found under the brand name Epistar.  Quite good quality and a long service life are the reasons for the popularity of these LEDs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.caferacerwebshop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pretty bright glow for two chips" class="if uuid-2988047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2988047.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of similar elements and their characteristics </h2><p>  In the manufacture of such LEDs, certain semiconductors are used.  If you divide them by type, you can distinguish 2 main: </p><ol><li>  AlInGaP - elements of yellow, green, orange and red colors are made from it. </li><li>  InGaN - white, blue, green and blue-green LED elements. </li></ol><p>  The characteristics of superbright LEDs allow them to be used in completely different fields.  They are used for lighting workshops, streets, apartments.  Such elements are also installed on cars as daytime running lights, dimensions or dipped headlights.  However, the latter option is increasingly losing popularity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tosave.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="This lamp is designed specifically for the car." class="if uuid-2988033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2988033.jpg"></div><p>  The fact is that during operation, ultra-bright LEDs become very hot.  After their installation in the headlamp housing, they have to work almost constantly, which leads to an increase in temperature and rapid degradation.  But as dimensions that are included only in the dark, when the street is much cooler, they proved to be quite good. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But the most common area of ‚Äã‚Äãapplication of superbright LEDs can be called lights.  Such a device with elements installed in it, for example Cree, is able to penetrate the darkness with a beam at a distance of up to 2-3 km.  At the same time, its energy consumption will remain at a fairly low level.  Most often, foreheads are used by fishermen during night fishing - the luminous flux reaches the bottom through the water column of 3-4 meters. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-url="https://youtu.be/HH9h0iS6P5o" data-id="HH9h0iS6P5o" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/2/3/7/1/12371.jpg"></div><h2>  Application of LEDs in the automotive industry </h2><p>  Not all LED elements are suitable for cars.  Many types need only 2-3 V power, while the car‚Äôs on-board network needs 12 V. That is why the manufacturer offers specialized LED elements for cars.  The main thing here is to understand where it is possible to put superbright LEDs at 12 volts, and where they should not be mounted.  After all, if such elements are standing on the brake lights, it is likely that they will blind the driver of the car going behind, and this will not lead to anything good.  Also, do not install them in the backlight of the panel - it will be impossible to drive in the dark with such ‚Äútuning‚Äù. </p><p>  It is acceptable to install 12-volt superbright LEDs in reverse lights, dimensions, as well as interior lighting.  In these cases, the installation of such equipment will be justified.  It is possible to include LEDs in the circuit as a passing beam, but in this case, the organization of high-quality air cooling is necessary.  An example of such an application of ultra-bright elements are Lexus cars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tr.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Low beam from superbright LED" class="if uuid-2988059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2988059.jpg"></div><h2>  LED operating voltage </h2><p>  Many people attach too much importance to this parameter, not understanding its essence.  Here is the point.  If, for example, it is written that the nominal value of a super-bright LED is 3 volts, this figure only means a voltage drop on it.  A more important parameter is the operating current of the element, which can reach 1 A. </p><h2>  What to consider when choosing and installing </h2><p>  Choosing superbright LEDs for a car or other application, it is worth paying attention not only to the characteristics declared by the manufacturer, but also to the appearance of the product, the quality of its manufacture.  Often a fake can be detected even by visual inspection with the naked eye.  Falsified LEDs may have irregular edges, the chip under the lens is often located asymmetrically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED dimensions look good" class="if uuid-2988036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2988036.jpg"></div><p>  Undervalued compared to the average market should also alert the buyer.  Before going to the store, it is better to familiarize yourself with the prices on the official websites of manufacturers of such products - this will save you from purchasing low-quality goods. </p><p>  Installation of ultra-bright LEDs also requires compliance with certain rules.  Even with good ventilation, if there is the possibility of an additional radiator, it is worth doing.  Use thermal compound to connect the chip to the cooler. </p><h2>  The pros and cons of using superbright elements </h2><p>  Like any equipment, such LEDs have supporters and opponents.  According to surveys conducted by an independent company, about 30% of respondents opposed the use of such LED elements.  The most interesting thing is that the use of superbright LEDs for flashlights became the cause of the negative attitude.  People said that it is very harmful when they shine in the eyes with such a beam.  A strange opinion came from residents of the United States of Aamerica, where surveys were conducted on this topic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="guide.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do not install ultra-bright LEDs on STP signals" class="if uuid-2988025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2988025.jpg"></div><p>  Basically, the use of such elements in lighting devices has more positive than negative qualities.  Of course, if you purchase a high-quality, branded product, its cost will be high, however, it will last much longer than a low-grade cheap diode.  The main thing in this matter is to compare their capabilities with the level of need for such an acquisition. </p><h2>  To summarize the above </h2><p>  Superbright LEDs are truly the pinnacle of development of LED elements today.  Do not complain that their cost is quite high.  Like any other device, over time they will fall in price.  Although it is possible that the engineers will develop some other new product that will eclipse the ultra-bright LED.  Based on the pace of progress in all technical areas, this cannot be ruled out. </p>
