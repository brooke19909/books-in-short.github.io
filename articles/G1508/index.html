It was founded by the Lithuanian princes Koriatovichi.  The first wooden castle appeared on the left bank of the river in the 14th century, the New Castle - in the 17th century on the high right bank.  And in the 16th century a castle was built on the island of Kempa.  The name of the city comes from the Old Slavonic word ‚Äúvno‚Äù, which means ‚Äúgift‚Äù.  There are many versions of its appearance, but the most likely of them is from the name of the river Vinnichka. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of vinnytsia" class="if" height="446" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/469205.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The city was stimulated by the construction of a railway near it in 1870.  Vinnitsa became the administrative center of Podolsk province in 1914. </p><p>  The "calling card" of the city is a fire tower, which is located in a small square named after  Kozitsky and the arch at the entrance to the city PKiO.  I would like to advise everyone who wants to independently explore the city of Vinnitsa (sights): you will need a map of the city.  It can be purchased at the station, at kiosks selling printed products. </p><p>  Today we want to introduce you to the sights of Vinnitsa and Vinnitsa region. </p><h2>  Church of St. John the Evangelist </h2><p>  It was built in Malye Khutor in 1783, and in 1896 was slightly redone.  It is a wooden structure, later covered with iron.  The church consists of four log cabins connected along the longitudinal axis.  The sacristy adjoins the altar from the south side, the narthex is on the west side.  To this day, the appearance of the church has not undergone virtually no changes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of vinnytsia reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/469206.jpg" width="600"></div>

Pirogov </h2><p>  Sights of Vinnitsa are natural, historical and architectural monuments.  One of the most popular of them is the Pirogov Museum.  It is a complex, which includes the scientist‚Äôs house (there is an exposition telling about his activities), a museum-pharmacy, a necropolis church.  Here is the embalmed body of the great doctor.  At first, the estate belonged to A. A. Grikolevsky.  After his death, in 1859, N.I. Pirogov bought it at the auction.  At that time, he worked as a trustee of the Kiev school district.  In a short time Pirogov managed to put in order a slightly neglected farm estate.  The new owner built a one-story house on a high basement, farm buildings, a pharmacy, planted a wonderful birch grove and <span>orchard.</span> </p><p>  The sights of Vinnitsa are almost always in perfect condition.  This is a merit of local authorities and sponsors. </p><h2>  Church of the Virgin Mary </h2><p>  Vinnitsa (Ukraine), the sights of which surprisingly harmoniously combine unique natural monuments with man-made samples, invariably attracts tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions of Vinnitsa fountain" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/469207.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Church of the Virgin Mary was built in 1745 by the Vinnytsia headman Louis Kalinovsky.  It was erected for the order of the Capuchins.  The fate of the church is characteristic of all the churches of the former USSR.  During its existence, several owners changed, and in 1932 its activities were ceased by the Bolsheviks.  During the Patriotic War, when Vinnitsa was occupied by the Germans, the church was repaired, and divine services continued.  After the war, the Soviet authorities closed it again and in 1961 they gave the building to a lecture hall, where atheistic lectures were regularly given. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Only after the <span>collapse of the USSR,</span> in 1991, the church was returned to the Catholic Church.  It is curious that the Orthodox priests provided substantial assistance in this.  Since 1999, magnificent organ concerts have been regularly held here, in which organists from around the world take part. </p><h2>  Church of St. Nicholas </h2><p>  This building is located in the most beautiful place of the Old Town, on the left bank of the Bug River.  In the middle of the 13th century a small chapel appeared on this place.  It was built by the inhabitants of the Kiev-Pechora Lavra, monk Vladimir and hieromonk Nikolai.  They fled from Kiev, captured by the Tatar-Mongols.  At night Saint Nicholas appeared to them, indicating the place where the <span>Poklonniy Cross</span> and a small church should have been installed. </p><p>  At the end of the 18th century, the Uniates captured the temple, but in 1772 it was liberated.  Today the temple is under the control of Archimandrite Alexy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Vinnytsia and Vinnytsia region" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/469208.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Roshen Fountain </h2><p>  Thousands of tourists annually come to Ukraine to see the sights of Vinnitsa.  The Roshen Fountain is the largest light and musical floating sample in Europe.  This is a unique <span>hydraulic structure.</span>  Its central stream reaches a height of 70 meters, and the expansion in width is 140 meters.  The projection screen, which is formed by splashes and water dust, is approximately 16 x 45 meters.  The fountain is installed on a floating special platform ninety-five meters long.  Water jets beat out of 277 nozzles, 67 pumps pumping water from the Southern Bug provide operation of the structure.  Amazing light paintings create 560 <span>powerful lights</span> under water and laser beams.  Many visitors to the city who come to see the sights of Vinnitsa, reviews about this miracle on the water, leave enthusiastic.  And those who have already heard about the fountain, seek to spend their first evening in the city near it.  Its opening took place in 2011.  It works daily in the warm season. </p><h2>  Countess Shcherbatova's Palace </h2><p>  We continue to explore the sights of Vinnitsa and its environs.  Our next stop is in the town of Nemirov, at the magnificent Shcherbatova Palace.  The construction of this structure was somewhat delayed (1894 - 1917).  It is still not clear who is the author of the project.  The building is made in the neoclassical style: bay windows, colonnades - all this pleases the eyes of visitors.  It should be noted the magnificent garden surrounding the palace.  Its area is 85 hectares.  Rather, it is even a botanical garden, since trees and shrubs were brought here from all over Russia. </p><p>  Today, the Vanguard sanatorium is located in this palace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vinnytsia Ukraine attractions" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/469209.jpg" width="524"></div>

    <h2>  Tulchin City - Potocki Palace </h2><p>  The city was first mentioned in 1607 as the Nestervar fortress of the Bratslav <span>Voivodeship (Poland).</span>  In the second half of the 18th century, the city belonged to the Pototsky magnates.  The palace of Stanislav Felix Pototsky was preserved in its original form.  It was built according to the project of the Frenchman Lacroix.  Experts consider him a model of classicism in Ukraine. </p><p>  During the life of the owners, the palace shone with splendor and luxury: refined stucco molding, gilding, chic furniture.  The walls of the palace were decorated with great canvases of famous masters: Rembrandt, Raphael.  Three paintings from this palace are kept in the Louvre. </p><p>  The design was done by the Dutchman Merckx.  He carefully thought out the design of each room.  The palace was often visited by famous people of that time, luxurious balls were held. </p><h2>  Werewolf - Hitler‚Äôs bid </h2><p>  It‚Äôs hard to believe, but in a quiet and picturesque place between the villages of Kolo-Mikhailovka and Strizhavka there was a ‚Äúden of the beast‚Äù - A. Hitler‚Äôs temporary werewolf ‚ÄúWerewolf‚Äù.  Translated from German means ‚Äúwerewolf‚Äù or ‚Äúarmed wolf‚Äù.  Now tourists have nothing to look at.  Retreating, the Germans blew up the bunker.  This Hitler‚Äôs bet is the most mysterious of the seven that existed.  It is still not known how it was arranged.  It is believed that the bunker had several floors.  Destroyed even information about the "den". </p><h2>  Sadovsky Theater </h2><p>  Many sights of Vinnitsa are associated with art.  First of all, it is the N.D. Sadovsky Music and Drama Theater.  He opened his doors to the audience in 1911.  However, until 1917, only visiting artists performed on its stage.  The troupe was formed only in 1920. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vinnitsa attractions map" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/469214.jpg" width="600"></div>
