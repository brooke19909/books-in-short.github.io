Description of the residential complex and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The ancient city of Kazan, spread on the banks of the Volga, surrounded by forests and groves, without exaggeration, can be called the most beautiful in the region.  New buildings of Kazan, which currently number around 50, give the city a new, more European look, and most importantly, help citizens to acquire their own comfortable housing, not inferior to international standards.  Here are just some of the objects that are being completed: LCD "Melody", LCD "Fairy Forest", LCD "VDNH", LCD "Sunny City".  Each new building offers apartments with improved layout, landscaping, creating infrastructure. </p><p>  It is very difficult for potential buyers to make a choice, because, ceteris paribus, real estate prices are also approximately the same and average 55,000-60,000 rubles per m <sup>2</sup> .  We offer detailed information about the LCD "Nightingale Grove", in which five buildings have already been commissioned, and the last two are being completed.  For the most part of this complex, beautification of house sections has been completed, infrastructure has been created, and conditions for a comfortable, happy life have been created. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The residential complex "Nightingale Grove" is located in the Volga <span>region of Kazan,</span> on the outskirts of the city.  His address: Rauis Gareev street, plot number 80.  Now the territory in this part of the city is being actively built up, so in the near future there will be a large modern microdistrict.  Literally across the road from the complex under consideration is built LCD ‚ÄúFairy Forest‚Äù, LCD ‚ÄúTulpar‚Äù is being built nearby, and a little closer to the center of LCD ‚ÄúSunny City‚Äù.  The place for the construction of the Nightingale Grove was ideally chosen because there are no large industrial facilities nearby, only forest tracts and other natural objects.  At the same time, the city center and all its diverse infrastructure are also quite close, and you can reach the facilities in 5-10 minutes on foot if you wish, such facilities as the Tulpar Sports Complex, the Children's Clinical Hospital, and the KGAU Institute. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  LCD "Nightingale Grove" is located in close proximity to Rauis Gareev Street, one of the central in Kazan.  Many city routes run along it, including buses No. 22, 33, 37, 45, 55. They can be delivered anywhere in the city.  The traffic interval on any route is no more than 15 minutes, the stop is located 100 meters from the complex. </p>

    <p>  In relation to the metro station "Nightingale Grove" is also not very far away.  The metro station closest to the LCD is called Victory Avenue.  It is about 3.8 km away, so walking there is not very convenient, but you can get there by bus in five minutes. </p><p>  For motorists, the location of the complex can be called wonderful.  A kilometer from it passes the Orenburg tract leading through the city, and on the opposite side is the large Novo-Davlikeevskaya street, which also leads to the center of Kazan. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  New buildings in Kazan, located closer to the outskirts of the city, have an important advantage over those being built in the central regions.  It consists in excellent ecology - the most important factor for human health and life.  The "Nightingale Grove" complex is located near the Farmer's Forest, along the alleys of which you can walk in the summer, and in winter there are ski slopes.  Immediately on the opposite side of Gareeva street there is also an extensive forest park zone, and just a kilometer from the complex, Lake Upper Kaban splashes.  An unfavorable factor from an environmental point of view can only be called Gareeva Street itself, with its rather intense cargo flow.  This is especially true for residents of buildings No. 1 and No. 3, whose windows overlook the roadway. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Who is building </h2><p>  LCD "Nightingale Grove" erects one of the most experienced developers in Kazan SK "Gran".  She has been working in the construction market of Tatarstan for almost 17 years.  Over the years, the company commissioned over 70 objects, including the educational buildings of Kazan University, clinics, sports facilities, several factories, separate houses and large-scale housing complexes.  The priorities in the work of the company are, first of all, the quality and delivery of facilities on time.  IC "Gran" seeks to take into account the needs of all categories of citizens: the elderly, and young families with children, and sports enthusiasts.  For this purpose, infrastructure facilities being built by the company are necessarily being built.  At the same time, the developer sets affordable prices for apartments so that people with average incomes can purchase them. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and Design </h2><p>  In the complex "Nightingale Grove", according to the general plan, there will be 7 buildings.  Houses from number 1 to number 5 have 9 floors, and houses number 6 and number 7 are being built in 11-14 floors.  The location of the buildings in the complex is designed so that they form separate small enclosed courtyards.  Across the road from houses No. 3 and No. 4, a nine-story IFC building was erected, a second one is being planned nearby.  These IFCs are also called the Nightingale Grove.  All buildings in the considered LCD are built according to frame-monolithic technology, the external walls are made of bricks, the balconies and loggias are glazed, which creates a pleasant and harmoniously completed look of the facades.  Creating comfortable housing in the Nightingale Grove, the developer paid special attention to the improvement of the territory.  In the courtyards of the LCD trees and flowers were planted, fountains were built, benches were installed. </p>
