However, she became famous long before that, back in the mid-90s.  It was then that the head of the family, Robert Kardashian, became famous as a lawyer who saved the famous athlete and actor O. Jay Simpson, who was accused of double murder, from the death penalty. </p><h2>  Parents </h2><p>  Robert Kardashian Sr. was born in 1944 in Los Angeles into a family of descendants of Armenian emigrants from the Kars region of the Russian Empire.  A year before the extermination of the Christian population, his great-grandfather and great-grandmother was taken to Germany by preacher Efim Klubnikin.  From there they went to the United States, where their son Tatos went into business, thanks to which the family quickly improved their financial situation.  By the time Robert Kardashian was born, they owned a large canned meat production enterprise. </p>

    <h2>  Robert Kardashian: biography </h2><p>  Bob's childhood passed in the rich area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBaldwin Hills.  He graduated from a prestigious high school and then the University of Southern California with a bachelor's degree in business management.  Although the parents hoped that the son would be at the head of a company owned by their family, Robert Kardashian decided to become a lawyer.  To this end, he continued his education at the University of San Diego, and after receiving a doctorate in law, he was a practicing lawyer for about 10 years.  Despite the fact that he had no shortage of clients, Kardashian decided to stop his activities in the field of jurisprudence and went into business.  In particular, in 1973 he became one of the co-founders of Radio &amp; Records. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Professional triumph </h2><p>  After an almost twenty-year hiatus, Robert Kardashian returned to advocacy to support his longtime friend O. Jay Simpson, who at that time was considered one of the most famous American football players.  In addition, he starred in the Naked Gun trilogy and had an impressive list of sports awards. </p>

    <p>  Initially, it was assumed that Robert Kardashian would simply help Simpson's lawyers, who were in charge of the double murder of an ex-wife and her lover.  However, after some time, Bob led the defense and succeeded.  Kardashian skillfully used the racial factor, putting forward a theory of collusion of white policemen against a black athlete.  In addition, he managed to convince the jury that Simpson's ex-wife was mistakenly killed by representatives of the Colombian mafia.  According to the defense, they allegedly confused her with a drug addict friend who lived with her under one roof.  As a result, Simpson was acquitted, and the prosecutor stated that the decision of the jury was dictated by feelings and was contrary to common sense. </p><p>  This process praised Kardashian in American jurisprudence, and also gave him a reputation as a person who does not abandon his friends.  In addition, in the 90s, it was joked in the United States that any criminal to whom Bob answered positively could sleep peacefully, so the stars of the first magnitude, including Michael Jackson himself, began to trust him in the conduct of legal proceedings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  A family </h2><p>  In 1978, Robert Kardashian violated the family tradition and married a woman of non-Armenian descent - Chris Jenner.  Although the parents were initially categorically opposed, they had to accept the choice of their son, especially since the daughter-in-law did everything to please them.  This marriage lasted 12 years, during which the couple had three daughters and a son, Robert Kardashian Jr.  Today, they are all well-known media personalities, as well as doing business.  Despite the divorce of the parents, the children have maintained excellent relations with their father and always proudly emphasize their Armenian origin.  In memory of him, Kim and her sister Chloe, husband and daughter, visited their historical homeland in 2015 and dedicated one of the episodes of the reality show ‚ÄúThe Kardashian Family‚Äù to their journey. </p><h2>  Death </h2><p>  On September 30, 2003, the <span>American media</span> reported the death of Robert Kardashian.  A well-known lawyer died at the age of 60 from cancer of the esophagus after a difficult but unsuccessful treatment in the best clinics.  Most obituaries have again reminded everyone of the role that Robert Kardashian played in the Simpson case.  The funeral <strong> </strong>  lawyers took place at the city cemetery Inglewood (California).  By the way, Simpson did not appear on them, although he later told reporters that he would never forget that Bob was with him in the most difficult days.  Some detractors called the death of Kardashian a punishment of heaven for the fact that he saved the guilty person from punishment.  Others noted his human qualities, such as exceptional devotion to everyone who trusted him, and the highest professional excellence. </p>
