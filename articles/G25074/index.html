    <h2>  About staff </h2><p>  People who have been here say that the hotel has nice and friendly staff.  The only negative is that no one speaks Russian.  Only in Thai or English, therefore it is better to take a phrasebook or dictionary with you on the road. </p><p>  Check-in at the hotel starts at 14:00.  But if the guests arrived earlier, then there will be nothing wrong.  There are two scenarios.  They can be given a temporary number so that they wash themselves, put themselves in order and rest.  Then, when the apartments ordered by tourists are released from previous residents, they will be relocated.  And the second option - guests will be accommodated immediately if the room that they issued is already prepared for living. </p><p>  Cleaning, by the way, at the hotel daily.  Maids constantly bring clean bottled water, tea and coffee sets to their rooms, and also replenish hygiene supplies.  Linen and towel changes are also daily. </p>

    <h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  This hotel allows children of any age.  Moreover, if the guests arrived to rest with a baby whose age does not exceed four years, you will not have to pay extra for his stay.  But you will have to stay in the places available in the room.  Fortunately, the apartments are equipped not only with beds, but also with a sofa in the living room. </p><p>  If the child is not even two years old, then a crib will be allocated for him.  It will also be free.  But if someone more adult (over four years old) comes with guests, then for the installation of an extra full-sized bed and accommodation, you will have to pay 800 TNV per day (at the current rate, this is about 1,400 rubles).  But at most in one room only one berth can be provided.  And if the installation of an extra bed is necessary, then the administration must be informed in advance.  The guest will have to send a confirmation. </p><p>  The hotel also has connecting rooms.  If potential guests need just such apartments, then on this occasion, you must also inform in the application or contact the administration directly. </p><p>  You should also be aware that when applying for a reservation, you will need to provide your credit card details.  The property accepts Visa, Master Card, American Express and JCB.  The card must be provided upon arrival, along with an identity card. </p><p>  To arrange a transfer, you must contact the hotel at least three days before departure.  It will be necessary to report the details of your flight, as well as discuss other relevant nuances.  A transfer costs 1,500 TNV (approximately 2700 rubles). </p>
