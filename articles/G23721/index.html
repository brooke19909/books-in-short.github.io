Of course, Antalya is the leader in demand among the resorts of the Turkish Riviera.  Nevertheless, other coastal cities also have an army of fans who, once having bought a tour to one of the comfortable hotels of one or another resort, for example, the Yildiz Butik Hotel 3 * (Kemer), fall in love with these parts and come back here more than once. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kemer photo" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/672173.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kemer - the pearl of the Mediterranean </h2><p>  Kemer is a modern resort on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, in the famous province of Antalya.  This is a pretty young city.  He became such only 100 years ago.  Until recently, it could only be reached from the sea, that is, by water.  After the city began to gain popularity as a beach resort, local authorities made a highway to it.  And now, having arrived in Antalya (the airport closest to the city is right here), tourists can get to it by car in just half an hour: dolmush, buses, taxis or rented cars.  Kemer consists of several areas: Beldibi, Kirish, Goynuk, Camyuva, etc. The aforementioned Yildiz Butik Hotel 3 * hotel is located in the city itself.  And this is his main advantage, especially in the eyes of young people.  Indeed, in the immediate vicinity of it are numerous nightclubs, discos, restaurants, bars and other entertainment centers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of rest in the city of Kemer: photo and description </h2><p>  This resort is perfect for both excursion and beach tours.  The swimming season here lasts for six months: from May to October.  The beaches here are amazing - clean and well maintained, with developed infrastructure.  On the other hand, both in the city and its environs there are many cultural attractions that you must definitely see.  The most interesting of them is Mount Yanartash, located not far from the Olympos National Park.  And lovers of seafood dishes will also <span>enjoy the rest in Kemer</span> : there are many coastal restaurants where skilled chefs prepare incomparable dishes based on various seafood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yildiz butik hotel 3" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/672164.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  If you purchased a tour to Yildiz Butik Hotel 3 * (Kemer / Turkey), then first you will need to fly to Antalya, and then go along the highway for about 45 km.  By the way, if you live somewhere in the north of Russia, then you absolutely do not need to go to Moscow, and then fly from there to Turkey.  Of some large cities of the Russian Federation, charter flights fly to Antalya if not regular.  Tourists who pay for the transfer from the airport to the hotel when making the tour can be calm, because they will certainly be met in the waiting room and taken to the hotel complex.  And another wonderful option is a preliminary car rental.  Then, at the airport parking lot, the guest will find a car that can go to Kemer, of course, if he has an <span>international driving license.</span>  Renting a car per day will cost about 30 euros. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Yildiz Butik Hotel 3 * (Turkey / Kemer): general description </h2><p>  This hotel was opened in 1997.

Unfortunately, more spacious rooms are not in the Yildiz Butik Hotel 3 * hotel.  Photo numbers you can see in the article.  Basically, the situation is not so bad.  Especially when you consider that you are unlikely to stay in the rooms for long (after all, people go to the resort not to lie on the couch, right?).  Each room has a balcony.  There is no individual air conditioner, because centralized cooling and air conditioning are available everywhere.  The living rooms are equipped with a TV with satellite channels, a telephone with direct dialing of international numbers, a safe and a minibar (for a fee), a refrigerator, a bathroom with toiletries and a hairdryer.

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  As already noted, the Yildiz Butik Hotel 3 * hotel is not on the first, but on the second lane.  Nevertheless, its own beach is very close - only 300-350 m. If you quickly go, you can get there in 4-5 minutes.  Unfortunately, the seashore here is covered not with sand, but with pebbles.  However, if you purchase special rubber swimming shoes, the pebbles will not interfere.  The biggest advantage of this beach is that all the equipment here - changing rooms, umbrellas, sun loungers, towels and mattresses - is provided to tourists free of charge, of course, if they wear a bracelet with the hotel logo.  There is also a net for playing beach volleyball, a playground with swings, as well as various water activities.  Guests can ride a banana, scooter, catamaran, go windsurfing, etc. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Most comments about this hotel are positive.  Tourists can not complain about the cleanliness, nor the level of service, nor the internal arrangement of rooms or public areas.  From the reviews it becomes clear that this is a very decent hotel, which corresponds to its three stars.  The only discontent that tourists show is due to the poor assortment of dishes during meals.  Although, if we consider the menu from the point of view of European standards, it is quite normal.  Everything else, including the location of the hotel, infrastructure, proximity of attractions, as well as the level of service, suits guests, and they rate the hotel at 4-5 points. </p>
