The fastest growing and most effective for the advertiser is video blogging and community management.  It is extremely cheap, but as efficient as possible.  And as an example, we should take the Aleksey Vilniusov community, reviews of which were studied to write this analysis of its activities. </p><h2>  Community Briefs, Trade Criticism </h2><p>  According to legend, the community is organized by a trader who successfully trades on options and feels that he should share a strategy on the Internet.  So to speak, to help those in need to earn a lot and quickly.  Many members of the group publish reviews in the Alexey Vilniusov VK community, it is open to visitors but has an interesting product - access to the VIP club.  It is provided if a member of the community has a deposit of more than 30,000 rubles, of course, in Olymp Trade. </p>

    <p>  Of course, this is one of the proofs of close cooperation with the broker.  Otherwise, how to get honest information that a member of your group has this deposit, but did not make an account screen and add zeros?  You should also study the tactics that earned him money.  Its components are as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  trading on minute charts, where there is a lot of "market noise" and artifacts of the activity of <span>HFT trading robots</span> ; </li><li>  use of the option contract doubling system when losing; </li><li>  lack of clear criteria for entering a deal; </li><li>  the lack of a news filter or elements of fundamental analysis to cut off periods of high volatility with unpredictable price behavior; </li><li>  trading in large amounts without adequate money management. </li></ul><p>  From these theses, a logical conclusion follows that "Alexey Vilnius" is a divorce.  This is just a marketing product of Olymp Trade company, which is needed to attract new customers.  And the person of an allegedly independent options trader who has chosen to show other people how to make a lot of money his life‚Äôs business is great for this. </p><h2>  Aggressive marketing </h2><p>  This scheme works this way: the dealing center creates a character who supposedly earns excellent money on the simplest doubling strategy.  He leads the community ‚ÄúAlexey Vilnius Reviews‚Äù (transliteration of this name is the address of Vkontakte).  The founder lives in the most expensive hotels and buys great cars for himself and his wife.  Perfectly!  And partly <span>it‚Äôs true,</span> because the company doesn‚Äôt cost anything to finance such an ostentatious family, but not for the money earned from trade, but for the salary from Olymp Trade.  It is likely that a person or group in the marketing department is constantly moving to these hotels or they rented a house on the coast.  This will be cheaper and more effective than attracting customers through traditional advertising. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The official group has more than half a million people.  With such a presentation of material on trade, the conversion from group members to customers is significantly increased and can reach 50%.  Then to which broker do the community members go where Alexey Vilniusov runs the game?  Olympus Trade, that's right.  It is he who advertises this blogger and works directly with him.  More precisely, he is a blogger only for all of us, but for a company he is a valuable employee. </p><h2>  Alexey Vilniusov.  Olympus Trade creates video bloggers </h2><p>  Note.  When creating the Aleksey Vilnius community, Olympus Trade took into account all the little things and potentially vulnerable points, but did not miss the main opportunity, which is to promote our services through the specified blogger.  In video recordings and on the VK.community page, Alex.V very often offers promotional codes that supposedly increase the size of the account. </p><p>  Of course, becoming a very famous blogger, you can try to impose your terms of cooperation.  But here the situation is different: a broker through his own community publishes everything he wants.  And, of course, he pays a certain salary to Vilnius, but not the full advertising fee.  In addition, a trader who usually makes deals on behalf of the blog owner puts a lot of money into circulation.  By the way, Treyderul and some other bloggers broadcasting from the screen in interesting outfits do the same.  This tactic, allegedly presented by a third-party person not related to the broker, is very conspicuous in the minds of potential customers.  But the Aleksey Vilniusov community, reviews about which are generated on the Web almost every second, is not independent at all, but completely owned by Olymp Trade. </p>

    <p>  It aims to attract the maximum number of customers for Olympus and earn on them.  With huge losses for traders, it‚Äôs quite simple to maintain even a large marketing department.  It is therefore surprising why there are so few such "Alekseev Vilniusovs" and "Traderyul".  Then why can a lot of money go into a deal without the risk of loss?  And here everything is easier than you might expect.  The broker will give his advertising person huge amounts of money, as much as necessary.  But this does not mean that Olympus will lose them.  This is the kitchen of options, where the loss of the client is the profit of the company. </p><p>  The money allocated for recording the video will be returned back to Olympus in any case.  Either the video will not be recorded the first time, and the funds in the form of a loss on a real account will go to the company, or if you win, a video with excellent profitability will be received.  And therefore, a video blogger, or rather, an official or bribe employee of Olymp Trade, can afford a few takes.  More precisely, repeat the recordings endlessly until you receive excellent quality video content that can attract a huge number of customers. </p>
