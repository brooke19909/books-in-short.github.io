List of places, interesting ideas and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If a guy suggested that you initiate the first meeting, or you just decided to spend time with your lover, the common and commonplace places for dates immediately go to your head: a movie theater, cafe, a walk in the park. </p><p>  Where to go with a guy in Moscow?  The answer to this question largely depends on your place of residence, season, on your tastes and on the tastes of a young man, on the availability of free time, etc. Next, the article will present a list of places in Moscow where to go with a guy. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.755826" data-lng="37.617299900000035" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="8"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/7/8/2/7782.png"></div><h2>  How to choose? </h2><p>  Before starting to think about where to go with a guy in Moscow, you need to make a list of places that you want to visit.  In order not to make a mistake in the choice, try to find out from the young man where he would prefer to go today or tomorrow.  Here's what you need for this: </p><ul><li>  Determine the specifics of your meeting - whether you want to arrange an entertainment program for a guy, to have fun together, or to organize a romantic date. </li><li>  Choose a cozy and modest place, of course, if you want to contribute to the development of a serious relationship (for a guy you already meet, expensive restaurants are suitable). </li><li>  Having accepted general wishes, choose something new, for example, an unfamiliar movie, if you decide to go to the cinema, or a new cafe, so as not to accidentally go to the same institution where your young man often went with his ex-girlfriend. </li><li>  Find out how he prefers to use his free time, where he feels most comfortable, where he likes to go with friends. </li></ul><p>  Having clarified all the details, you will be able to understand where to go with a guy on a date in Moscow, so that he and you can get the maximum pleasure and positive emotions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, it is worth considering the fact that a lot depends on the first meeting: it can destroy a connection that never started, or become a new impetus for the further development of relations. </p><h2>  Where to have a date? </h2><p>  If you want to enjoy each other's company, then you need to exclude crowded places.  It‚Äôs best to pick up something cozy and quiet.  And it‚Äôs not necessary to choose a luxurious restaurant to create a romantic mood for both of you.  Well, where to go together in Moscow? </p><div class="photo" data-original="boonbox.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="horse ride" class="if uuid-2740616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100245/2740616.jpg"></div><p>  Where to go with a man?  Where to go in Moscow if this is your first meeting?  The first thing that may come to your head is a sparsely populated cafe.  In most cases, this is a win-win standard idea, although there are some nuances here.  It is very important to look at a really good institution with decent cuisine (it would be better with music as well). </p><p>  A romantic meeting can be held on the roof of a house.  It will, of course, be necessary to organize light furniture (chairs, a table), wine, a serving and a light meal.  Before the meeting itself, you need to make sure that the roof is not dirty, check the weather forecast and take a blanket with you just in case.  And then you can at night not only stroll at altitude, but also admire the stars. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another good place to have fun is hookah.  Judge for yourself: close communication, quiet pleasant music and a cozy booth are simply ideal conditions for a romantic meeting.  The main difficulty is to choose a hookah that both of you might like. </p><p>  Another romantic event is a tram ride along the river.  A more expensive option is yachting, in addition to which there is champagne and strawberries.  Probably the only thing that can overshadow an excellent day is the presence of seasickness in your companion.  That is why it is necessary to clarify in advance whether the guy had noticed symptoms of such an ailment. </p><p>  It‚Äôs also a pretty good option - to take a walk in the park, you only need to warn the young man in advance about the upcoming event.  In general, in a picturesque park you can have a very entertaining time: in the summer season - take a walk and watch the enchanting sunset, in winter - play snowballs and dazzle a snowman, and in the fall - throw leaves. </p><p>  According to reviews, an interesting place in Moscow, where it will be exciting to go with a guy, is a hippodrome, where you can ride your favorite horse.  If you are already familiar and plan to further develop relations with a guy, then you can invite him to your home.  But whether far-reaching intentions appear after this meeting depends only on what level your relationship is. </p><h2>  Places to have fun </h2><p>  It is a completely different matter if the main goal of your meeting is to spend time actively, enjoy each other‚Äôs company in action, and not in a relaxing environment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.calvertjournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ferris wheel" class="if uuid-2740624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100245/2740624.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, you can show yourself as a sports person and go with a guy, for example, to a dance floor or skating rink.  Here are some unusual places for young people in Moscow are most popular: </p><ol><li>  If your boyfriend loves dancing, then why not give him a one-time lesson in a dance studio?  Great idea!  Many couples are advised to pay for classes in Latin American dances and get a charge of good mood and energy for the whole day. </li><li>  In the winter season, you can invite your lover to ride on an open city ice rink, and in the summer months - in an indoor ice rink.  Firstly, you are guaranteed to have a great time, and secondly, if a guy does not know how to skate, you can teach him. </li><li>  One of the best ideas is to take a young man to the race track if he is a fan of risky entertainment and adrenaline.  Here you can arrange races, drive cars, provided that you both drive well.  If you are afraid, then there is a calm option - karting, where you can go without anxiety and special worries. </li><li>  What about taking a walk with a chosen one in a leisure park or playing different children's slot machines?  An element of competition, as many have noted, is guaranteed to bring you closer and add special acuteness to your relationship.  Naturally, such a meeting will be remembered by anyone for a long time. </li><li>  Another of the "adrenaline" entertainment is an amusement park.  Free fall tower, roller coaster - all this can give a lot of impressions and adrenaline.  Again, there is a calmer variation "for the cowardly" - you can just ride on a ferris wheel. </li><li>  A very good place for dating, where it will be nice to go with your lover in Moscow is a water park if your boyfriend loves activity.  There you will expect water rides, sprays and hills.  However, we advise you to make sure your boyfriend can swim.  Believe me, it's better to play it safe. </li><li>  If you want to make an excellent date and spend the day to good use, then pay attention again to horseback riding.  This pastime will not be commonplace, and it is best to walk in nature, outside the city. </li></ol><p>  In any case, your chosen one will remember both a romantic date and an active pastime in any case, although you need to carefully plan the plan.  And you need to keep in mind that the meeting will almost never be absolutely perfect, so do not bother and just enjoy chatting with a young man. </p><h2>  Where to go in the capital? </h2><p>  Many girls are thinking about where to go with a guy in Moscow.  Fortunately, the capital can provide a huge selection for a potential date.  Let's look at a list of places for a perfect date in Moscow. </p><h2>  Tsaritsyno </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.likealocalguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsaritsyno park" class="if uuid-2740607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100245/2740607.jpg"></div><p>  Where to go for a walk with a guy?  You can spend the day in Tsaritsyno Park, located about half an hour from the city center by metro.  Here you can take a walk along the paths that Catherine II‚Äôs foot stepped on.  The luminous musical fountain will simply amaze your imagination with unusual illumination in the dark.  In addition, in the park there are various pavilions and ponds with swans. </p><h2>  Tretyakov Gallery </h2><p>  Where to go with a guy in Moscow?  In reviews and recommendations, young couples are often advised to visit museums.  Not every couple in love loves to come here, but do not rush to reject this option - in the Tretyakov you can visit the lecture hall.  You will have the opportunity to enjoy the story, which is accompanied by music tracks and videos, as well as see the real show.  Such an event is sometimes much more interesting than a regular walk along the street.  This is confirmed by many lovers.  Naturally, it is best to first familiarize yourself with the nearest lectures on the institution‚Äôs website. </p><h2>  Planetarium </h2><p>  Perhaps one of the most romantic events is admiring the celestial bodies under the starry sky.  Nowadays, young people cannot be surprised by technical innovations, but the starry sky always remains ‚Äúin fashion‚Äù.  In winter, you can endlessly watch the stars while drinking hot tea from a thermos (and first familiarize yourself with star charts on the Internet to find not only the Big and Little Dipper, but also Lira or Cassiopeia).  However, there is a more comfortable way to observe the celestial bodies.  Many couples recommend going with their lover to the Moscow Big Planetarium to learn about distant universes in the Star Hall, in the Museum of Urania to look at the fragments from meteorites and touch the exhibits in the Lunarium. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russia-ic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow planetarium" class="if uuid-2740612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100245/2740612.jpg"></div><h2>  Places for walking </h2><p>  Where to go with a guy in Moscow in the summer?  For a romantic date, the Alley of Lovers, located in Moscow near Red Square, is also suitable.  Innumerable wedding processions are frequent guests here, because this place is a great option for offering a marriage and a declaration of love. </p><p>  Another place for <span>evening walks</span> in Moscow is the Pushkinskaya embankment, which begins at the Novoandreevsky bridge.  Here you will have a wonderful opportunity to listen to the waves, look at the ships passing by, and also just walk and enjoy the views.  Lovers note that all this gives even more romance to an intimate date. </p><p>  These two places are great for taking walks in Moscow.  Where to go in the capital is no longer a problem! </p><h2>  Secular reception </h2><div class="photo" data-original="c1.staticflickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Izmailovsky Kremlin" class="if uuid-2740610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100245/2740610.jpg"></div><p>  Not so often in the modern world there is an occasion to dress up in evening dresses.  Of course, you can organize a trip to the opera or theater, or you can become a guest of the real world ball. </p><p>  But what if you are not professional cotillon dancers and have a poor idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to dance a mazurka?  The organizers of such balls offer master classes at a purely symbolic price.  Many are advised to sign up in advance for several weeks to get to classes. </p><p>  Finding the right outfits won't be a big deal either.  For example, in the Izmailovsky Kremlin cavaliers and ladies in evening dresses and tuxedos are allowed to balls.  Here, the dress code requires guests only comfortable and elegant suits.  And for more themed events, you can find costumes for rent.  In the suburbs and Moscow, balls are held almost every week. </p><h2>  Culinary evening </h2><p>  If you are going for a romantic dinner, you can reserve a table in the restaurant.  And it‚Äôs better to create your own ideal menu, even learn how to serve haute cuisine yourself.  You can learn all the secrets of dishes of high-class chefs at special master classes. </p><p>  In 4 hours in Academia Del Gusto you will learn how to cook 4 dishes: dessert, hot, pasta and appetizer.  You don‚Äôt have to get bored: you will find a workplace for any ‚Äústudent‚Äù here.  Any dish prepared here is allowed to be tasted right away, washed down with a glass of Italian wine.  In addition, after the end of the lesson, the chef will give you a diploma on the passage of the master class, and you will also receive professionally taken photographs. </p><h2>  On high </h2><p>  Proximity to the stars and stunning views can be observed not only in planetariums.  You can also change the angle of view and enjoy the bird's-eye view of the city with the help of panoramic or rooftop restaurants.  According to reviews, this is very popular with many couples in love. </p><p>  In the city center on the 16th floor is the White Rabbit restaurant.  You need to visit here to admire the embankments of the Moscow River and the Kremlin, tasting the cocktails that the restaurant boasts so much about.  You can also try French or author cuisine. </p><p>  However, the record holder for height, of course, remains the SIXTY restaurant, which is located in the Federation Tower on the 62nd floor.  A choice of dishes of Russian, French and Italian cuisines.  To appreciate the beauty of the sky, which seems so close here, it is best to come with the appearance of stars or at sunset. </p><div class="photo" data-original="i.pinimg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restaurant &quot;Moscow" class="if uuid-2740613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100245/2740613.jpg"></div><h2>  Bar </h2><p>  In the capital, traditional games of cozy English pubs are very popular.  For a meeting, you can choose some calm bar or pub where you can go with a guy in Moscow and play darts from the heart, even arrange a mini-competition. </p><p>  You can find the atmosphere of foggy Albion and a darts board in a pub like Temple.  This is not only a bar, but also a steakhouse, so meat lovers will like it here.  The bar also regularly spoils its guests with live music. </p><h2>  Horse carriage </h2><p>  Where to go for a walk with a guy?  In the Kolomenskoye Museum-Reserve there is an opportunity not only to enjoy expositions and wonderful nature, but also to take part in one of the ancient pastimes in Russia.  In summer and winter (only in a sleigh) a horse-drawn carriage ride is available here, which, according to many couples, is very close.  In addition, in the museum-reserve you can still get acquainted with the horses themselves and their habitat. </p><h2>  "Bird House" </h2><p>  The opportunity to admire exotic birds from around the globe can be in the Moscow zoo "Bird House".  In the pavilion you can find more than 70 species of birds.  At the entrance to the pavilion you will find an exposition of bird nests and eggs.  In the rain forest sector you can see the fan-bearing crowned dove, which is the main symbol of inseparable love. </p><p>  You will find a real riot of flowers on the second floor, because tropical birds live here.  Numerous parrots are not the only inhabitants of this area.  The "Blue Bird of Happiness" - the blue Irena - also pleases visitors with its vibrant colors. </p><h2>  Tea ceremonies </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lipton.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tea ceremony" class="if uuid-2740615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100245/2740615.jpg"></div><p>  In the cold season there is nothing better than this hot drink when it snows outside.  And the Chinese tradition says that tea is a whole ritual, and not just a warming drink. </p><p>  In the Hermitage‚Äôs garden in the ‚ÄúTea Culture Club‚Äù you will have a chance to taste the best varieties of Chinese teas, and you will also learn to conduct a tea ceremony according to ancient rules. </p><p>  During the ceremony, food or pastries will not be offered to you, because tea is already a treasure in the view of the Chinese.  But first of all, you go there for the atmosphere.  You can choose either a regular tea party or register for a tea ceremony lesson. </p><p>  In the Tea House of the White Crane you can be offered to plunge not only into the tea traditions of China, but also to attend tea drinking ceremonies in Russia and Japan.  In addition to elite drinks from China, you will be served Indian masala or mate.  Here you can add sweets to tea. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, cultural time can be spent in numerous art galleries, museums or theaters.  You can stroll with a young man in a variety of parks - Tsaritsyno, Kolomenskoye, Kuzminki.  You just need to decide on the most suitable place. </p><p>  However, the most important thing is not how much money was spent on a date, but how much you take into account the interests of your soul mate, and your natural and sincere behavior. </p>
