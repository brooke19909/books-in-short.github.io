Outside a room or a special platform for a beginner, there are a lot of unexpected and uncontrollable factors.  Therefore, taking pictures on the street requires special attention.  First you need to successfully select the lens mode and properties that match the weather conditions.  It is also required to determine the place and time of day.  Well, of course, you should think through all the poses for a photo shoot on the street in advance.  Then each frame will be exclusive and original.  And the work itself will bring only joyful and bright emotions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poses for a photo shoot on the street." class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19074/376331.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A few street photography tips </h2><p>  To make the pictures especially beautiful and bright, you need to follow these simple rules of posing: </p><ol><li>  To leave the photos natural and relaxed, you do not need to hold your breath or take some kind of squeezed static pose.  If you completely relax, think about something good and fun, it will be visible even through the lens.  And the photograph itself will give such a mood an additional charm and liveliness. </li><li>  In any case, you can not slouch on each picture.  This makes the model quite unattractive.  In order to somehow correct the position and posture, you can use such a simple technique: move one leg back to give support to the spine.  This will allow you to stand straight without much effort and at the same time look quite natural. </li><li>  Many say that any camera adds a few extra pounds.  So, in order not to further increase your own dimensions, you should not simultaneously deploy shoes and shoulders to the lens socks. </li><li>  To give the photo liveliness and ease, you need to choose asymmetric poses for a photo shoot on the street and indoors: one leg or arm is bent, and the other is straight, etc. When a person just stands straight, it looks too static, as if on old Soviet official pictures. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poses for a winter photo shoot" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19074/376336.jpg?1397684613515" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  Universal poses for outdoor photo shoots </h2><p>  Each landscape and background is individual in its own way and requires a special approach.  Somewhere it is better to remove the general plan, but somewhere you need to work more closely and in detail.  But there are some universal poses for a photo shoot in winter, spring, on the beach or in the forest.  In any case, they will make each shot successful and interesting: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Frame "Defile".  This pose adds movement and expression to any shot.  You need to tilt your head slightly and turn the case away from the camera.  There should be a clear feeling that the person is leaving.  But at the same time, the head should not be tilted too low, otherwise the effect will be that you hide your face or just look down at your own shoes. </li><li>  Position "Criss-cross".  This pose gives the character a charming flirtation.  She looks both bold and innocent at the same time.  The position looks something like this: one leg is bent at the knee and set slightly forward, and the second is just straight.  Hands can be placed on the waist or hip.  In this case, the person directs the body towards the camera. </li><li>  "Triumph".  Such poses for a photo shoot on the street are used specifically to focus all attention on a specific person.  First of all, the picture will appeal to those who love to be in the very center of global attention.  To take this position, you need to raise your hands up and part them, slightly bend and raise one leg.  You can also raise your chin and straighten your chest. </li><li>  A laid-back position with some support.  Here you can sit with your legs completely crossed or stretching them out, one bend at the knee.  The support may be a bench, stone, wood and much more. </li></ul><h2>  The best poses for a photo shoot at sea </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poses for a photo shoot at sea" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19074/376337.jpg?1397684751817" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Azure water, a beach, golden sand or even smooth pebbles.  What could be better for a joyful summer shot?  Here you must take into account the horizon line.  And in order to prevent important shooting details from appearing in the shadows, high-quality reflectors should be used. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is also important to consider <span>solar activity</span> and excessive daylight.  Therefore, the best time to take pictures at sea is after five in the evening.  Then the pictures will not appear overexposed.  And the water itself will have a saturated color. </p><p>  Such a shooting is remarkable in that the poses for a photo shoot at sea can be very diverse.  In this case, you can work both far and near.  Moreover, the pleasant glare of the waves will beautifully play in the frame. </p><p>  For this background, poses with support on something are perfect: stones, sand, a deck chair, etc. Or the "Defile" position with a beautiful nymph going into the sea and sunset. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poses for a summer photo shoot" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19074/376338.jpg?1397685059731" width="236"></div></h2><h2>  Summer photo shoot </h2><p>  Summer is a wonderful fun time when you can get great shots and have fun.  You can use absolutely all surrounding objects as a props.  It does not matter where the action takes place: at sea, in the forest or on a busy street. </p><p>  The main thing is to choose the right clothes for the model, place and time of shooting.  If you stayed on a beautiful city embankment, then the ‚ÄúCriss-Cross‚Äù pose or any position based on any object will look spectacular. </p><p>  For a busy street, the Defile position or the more static Triumphant will do.  At the same time, random passers-by hurrying on business will simply be blurry shadows, and the person in the frame will turn into the <span>center of the Universe.</span> </p><p>  Interesting poses for a photo shoot in summer can be rehearsed at home, being alone in front of a mirror, and places to choose in advance.  A beautiful shot will also be obtained near the textured old wall of a building.  You can just lean on it.  A weaving vine will be an excellent natural props. </p><h2>  Interesting positions for winter <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poses for a winter photo shoot" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19074/376339.jpg?1397685180281" width="236"></div>  her photo shoots </h2><p>  Winter is especially beautiful when there is fluffy white snow everywhere and tree branches are covered with prickly hoarfrost.  This is the time when you need to clearly think through the exposure, position and photo details in advance. </p><p>  Poses for a winter photo shoot can be very diverse.  Frames where the model rests on a tree covered with snow or sits in a park on a snowy bench will look great.  You can also try to lie down on the snowy ground.  Interesting pictures are obtained at the rink or in the forest.  Here, the flight of fantasy is practically unlimited.  The main thing is not to freeze. </p><h2>  Filming in the forest </h2><p>  Photos in the forest should be especially lively and laid-back.  Therefore, do not choose strict, business clothes and do a <span>festive make-up.</span>  In the forest it‚Äôs quite convenient to photograph close-ups - thanks to the shadow of the leaves, the skin becomes almost perfectly even.  At the same time, you can choose a variety of poses for a <span>photo shoot in the forest</span> . </p>

    <p>  You can take pictures half-sitting or lying on any fallen tree or hemp.  A frame in green grass or among forest flowers will also look amazing.  The pictures in which the model is in motion will also look attractive: it hides behind a tree or branch, goes to a reservoir, etc. The main thing is to look and behave "naturally." </p><h2>  The most common mistakes when choosing a pose for street photography </h2><p>  Carrying out any photo work, you should avoid the most common mistakes that spoil even the most successful and exciting frames: </p><ol><li>  Choose a new, uncomfortable position or position.  Any pose is individual, and it is best to rehearse it in advance. </li><li>  When shooting outdoors, make the main one not the model, but the background. </li><li>  When choosing postures for a photo shoot on the street, you should always consider the position of the sun. </li></ol>
