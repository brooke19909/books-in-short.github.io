On its territory there is a unique reserve, which carefully protects its wards.  Connoisseurs and admirers of their native land strive for a never-ending stream to Samara land.  Recently, fortunately, it has become popular to travel to one's homeland.  There are many positive aspects to this.  Firstly, there is no change in the climatic zone, which is more easily tolerated by the body.  Secondly, in the native land there are so many interesting places that have long been famous.  And we must value and love our country.  Thirdly, "domestic" trips do not require the collection of various documents and papers. </p><h2>  Pearl Lada </h2>

From the site there is a beautiful view of the Volga, the nature around, the Trans-Volga distant.  The view of wildlife awakens thoughts about the distant past of this land.

    <p>  Then the site narrows, forming a narrow ridge, which is popularly called the Devil's Bridge, leading to the top of the mountain.  Here a small grotto is formed of stone blocks.  According to legend, he served as a refuge for "free people" whose chieftain was Stenka Razin, and <span>the Volga River</span> is visible for forty miles from here.  This is what Mount Strelna is remarkable for.  Zhigulevsky Reserve is proud of its sights and strictly protects them from uninvited guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  On the area map </h2>

The Samara region is located in the southeast of the East European Plain and forms a large bend - Samara Luka along the course of the great Russian Volga River.  The nature of this region has created a landmark that is known outside the region.  In the people it is called Mount Strelna.  This is the territory of the Zhigulevsk State <span>Nature Reserve,</span> which was organized in 1966 and bears the name of I. I. Sprygin, its first leader.  Mount Strelna is the highest peak of the Zhiguli, which reaches 375 m above sea level.  From its main massif, the <span>ridge of the mountain</span> first goes down, and then, quite unexpectedly, slightly up and forms a small area.

So here you can ride on the "overseas" highway.  Some note that even in this case, German pedantry and accuracy manifested itself: bonded workers performed their work exceptionally well.
