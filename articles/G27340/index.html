  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coat of arms of Kovrov: photo, description and meaning</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Kovrov was founded in 1778.  It is located on the banks of the Klyazma River in the Vladimir Region.  The economy of Kovrov is represented by enterprises of light, food, engineering and military industries.  City-forming are defense plants.  According to the latest data, the population of the city is 138552 people. </p><p>  This article shows what the coat of arms of Kovrov is. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Those who are interested in the appearance and description of the coat of arms of Kovrov will also want to know the history of this city.  Archaeological excavations have helped to establish that the first people in the territory of the modern settlement appeared before our era.  Tradition says that in the 12th century, the village of Elifanovka grew on the banks of the Klyazma River.  She got her name in honor of one of the first settlers, and Prince Yuri Dolgoruky is considered its founder.  Researchers have not yet been able to confirm or deny this information. </p><div class="photo" data-original="putdor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old carpet" class="if uuid-2512621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38228/2512621.jpg"></div><p>  In 1157, the village of Elifanovka became known as the village of Rozhdestvensky.  This happened after Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky ordered the construction of a Christmas church on this territory.  In the 16th century, the village became part of the ownership of the Kovrov princes, and therefore it was renamed Kovrovo.  In September 1778, Empress Catherine II issued a decree which granted Kovrov the status of a county town.  She also decided that the village needs an official symbol. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An interesting fact: the Kovrovsky plant named after V. A. Degtyarev produced the Voskhod and Kovrovets motorcycles (starting in 1946), which were decorated with a picture of a hare. </p><h2>  First version </h2><p>  The first coat of arms of Kovrov was approved in August 1781.  It was a shield divided by a horizontal strip into two parts.  In the upper part was the emblem of Vladimir governorship: it depicts a proud lion standing on its hind legs in a red field.  On the head of the king of beasts you can see the iron crown, and in his right front paw he has a long silver cross.  In the lower zone was a green field on which two hares sat.  Hares were not chosen by chance, but because they were found in large numbers in the vicinity of Kovrov.  The appearance of the first official symbol of the city was proposed by Volkov Alexander Andreevich, Russian herald master. </p><p>  Legend has it that the tsar's governor <span>Count Vorontsov</span> insisted on the image of hares on the coat of arms for the reason that he liked to hunt these animals in local forests. </p><h2>  Second version </h2><p>  A few decades later, the appearance of the coat of arms of Kovrov was changed.  The description, dated 1857, allows us to understand how the official symbol of the settlement began to look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kovrov.city" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old coat of arms of Kovrov" class="if uuid-2512610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38228/2512610.jpg"></div><p>  The emblem of the <span>Vladimir province</span> no longer occupied half the entire shield.  He moved to the upper right corner.  On a green field are two silver hares.  Beasts stand on their hind legs and look in different directions.  Hares have scarlet tongues and eyes.  The shield was crowned with a silver-walled crown, and behind it two gold mallets crosswise.  The instruments were connected by the Alexander ribbon. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Modern version </h2><p>  The coat of arms of the city of Kovrov found its present form only in 2012.  This happened in connection with the assignment to the village of the title of "City of Military Glory."  The official symbol was decided to be adjusted taking into account the recommendations of the Heraldic Council.  The changes practically did not affect the shield itself.  A photo of the coat of arms of Kovrov can be seen below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="modern coat of arms of Kovrov" class="if uuid-2512605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38228/2512605.jpg"></div><p>  In place of the red ribbon, a white and blue <span>order ribbon</span> came - a reminder that in 1978 the Order of the Red Banner of Labor was granted to the city.  The shield is crowned with a golden tower crown with five prongs, which serves as an indicator of the status of the urban district.  Behind the crown there are crossed swords that remind us of conferring the locality the title of ‚ÄúCity of Military Glory‚Äù.  The weapon has golden hilt and silver blades.  Hares are also all depicted on a green background, only now they are sitting on a yellow field.  The emblem located in the upper left corner remained unchanged. </p><h2>  Colors of the coat of arms of Kovrov </h2><p>  Often, it is the colors that help to understand what this or that official symbol means. </p><ul><li>  Silver color is very important.  He personifies the purity, perfection of the universe.  Also, this color indicates mutual understanding. </li><li>  Red color symbolizes strength and courage.  It also indicates commitment and willingness to work. </li><li>  Green color is a sign of unity with nature, the desire to merge with it.  It also symbolizes life growth, youth, health. </li><li>  Gold color is a symbol of prosperity and wealth.  Also, its use hints at stability, confidence in the future. </li></ul><h2>  Flag </h2><p>  The article provides information on what constitutes the coat of arms of the city of Kovrov.  But what can be told about the flag of the village?  Unfortunately, at the moment the city does not have a flag approved officially.  In April 2012, the previous version of the flag was canceled.  However, there is a sign that serves as a symbol of the municipality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flag of the municipality of Kovrov" class="if uuid-2512606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38228/2512606.jpg"></div><p>  This flag looks like a rectangular cloth of crimson color with a one-sided image.  In the center of it is the coat of arms of Kovrov. </p><h2>  Symbols of the Vladimir region </h2><p>  As you know, the city of Kovrov is located in the Vladimir region.  What are its official symbols? </p><div class="photo" data-original="inari.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coat of arms of the Vladimir region" class="if uuid-2512624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38228/2512624.jpg"></div><p>  The modern <span>coat of arms of the Vladimir region</span> was approved by the Legislative Assembly in January 1999.  On a rectangular shield of red color the gold lion leopard is represented.  The head of the beast is crowned with an iron crown inlaid with gold and precious stones.  In his right paw you can see a long silver cross.  Above the shield is the imperial crown, and the shield itself is surrounded by golden oak leaves.  Leaves elegantly connects St. Andrew's ribbon. </p><p>  The modern flag of the Vladimir region was approved in May 2017.  It looks like a rectangular cloth of red color, at the pole of which there is a light blue strip, making up one-eighth of the length of the flag.  At the top of the strip you can see a sickle and a golden hammer.  In the center of the red canvas is the image of the coat of arms of the Vladimir region.  It is known that in the development of flag design, the flag of the RSFSR was adopted as the basis. </p>
