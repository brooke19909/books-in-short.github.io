People ask this question in different cases.  Someone liked the new tariff plan, but someone just changed their needs.  Changing the tariff in Tele2 is a fairly simple action.  Let's find out about the change methods, as well as about which tariff plans you can connect today. </p><h2>  Ways to change the tariff </h2><p>  <span>The tariff plan</span> can be changed in several simple ways.  One of them is using the command.  It is published on the official website of the company.  For example, subscribers of Moscow and the Moscow Region can switch to the ‚ÄúMy Online‚Äù tariff by dialing * 630 * 500 * 15 # and a call key on the phone. </p><p>  An even simpler way to change the ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù tariff is to enter the phone number on the operator‚Äôs official website in the window with the selected tariff plan.  The old tariff is automatically disabled.  It is important to familiarize yourself with the cost of transition before changing the tariff plan: </p><ol><li>  On tariffs with a monthly subscription fee, you do not need to pay for the transition.  It is necessary to have on the balance sheet only the amount equal to the monthly fee.  It will be written off immediately, after changing the tariff. </li><li>  On tariff plans with a daily subscription fee and without it, the transfer cost is 0 only when the user has never made a change in the ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù tariff for 30 days.  Otherwise, you will need to pay a certain amount for the connection service. </li></ol><p>  Regarding the change in tariff, you can also contact any communication salon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mediaryazan.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tariff change in the salon &quot;Tele2&quot;" class="if uuid-2628107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2628107.jpg"></div><h2>  What is important to know before changing the tariff </h2><p>  It is convenient to choose a tariff plan on the official website.  It provides all the information about the size of additional packages, cost, etc. It is important only to indicate the region of residence at the top of the Internet resource.  This must be done in order to find out relevant information before changing the Tele2 tariff.  Each region has its own conditions, different teams to connect. </p><p>  For example, in Moscow and the Moscow Region, the following parameters are set on the My Online + tariff: 30 GB of Internet, unlimited social networks and communication applications, 800 free minutes and unlimited on Tele2 of Russia, 50 SMS messages, a monthly fee of 700 rubles a month.  In the Novosibirsk Region, this tariff differs in the size of the traffic (25 GB), the number of free minutes (700 minutes) and the size of the monthly subscription fee (360 rubles). </p><h2>  Current tariff plans for a smartphone </h2><p>  Today, the mobile operator offers its subscribers several tariff plans.  The tariff change "Tele2" is possible for the following options: </p><ol><li>  <em>"My Tele2."</em>  This is a daily subscription rate.  It offers a small package of Internet traffic, unlimited calls to Tele2 Russia. </li><li>  <em>"My conversation."</em>  This is a monthly subscription rate.  It is similar to ‚ÄúMy Tele2‚Äù, but it has an additional difference - a package with free minutes for talking with subscribers connected to other operators. </li><li>  <em>‚ÄúMy Online‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy Online +‚Äù.</em>  These rates are characterized by greater opportunities for communication.  They provide fairly large packages with gigabytes and free minutes. </li><li>  <em>"Classical".</em>  This is a simple tariff plan that does not provide for a monthly fee. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="sibdepo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tariffs for smartphones from &quot;Tele2&quot;" class="if uuid-2628145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2628145.jpg"></div><h2>  Tele2 Internet for devices </h2><p>  The SIM card from Tele2 can be used in a computer modem.  That is why the company created a special tariff plan ‚ÄúInternet for devices‚Äù.  You can go to it by changing the tariff "Tele2", valid on the SIM card.  Standard ‚ÄúInternet for devices‚Äù terms do not include a monthly fee.  Each megabyte spent is paid. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, it is not necessary to leave the standard conditions.  At the tariff ‚ÄúInternet for devices‚Äù, more advantageous options with different sized traffic packets are available for connection.  Some options provide unlimited access to the World Wide Web at night. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tariff for the Internet from &quot;Tele2&quot;" class="if uuid-2628119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2628119.jpg"></div><h2>  Archive rates </h2><p>  The company also has archived tariff plans.  They are valid for those subscribers who have not yet been abandoned.  For new connections, such tariffs are not available.  Previously, there were many profitable and interesting plans that make you think about changing the tariff on Tele2.  "Orange" is one of them.  This tariff plan was characterized by the same cost of calls to numbers of all operators of the home region.  Now Orange is closed for new connections. </p><p>  There was another plan that suggested the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãchanging the Tele2 tariff.  ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù was his name.  This tariff plan provided the opportunity for almost free communication with other subscribers of this mobile operator in the home region.  Blue is currently unavailable for transitions and new connections. </p><div class="photo" data-original="json.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Archive tariffs &quot;Tele2&quot;" class="if uuid-2628100" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2628100.jpg"></div><p>  Many archival plans left a positive impression on themselves.  However, existing tariffs are also quite interesting.  Of these, there is something to choose when changing your needs.  In addition, the company does not stand still, but keeps up with the times, developing.  Periodically, it opens up new tariff plans, so the question of changing tariffs will always be relevant.  And finally, a little advice.  If your tariff seems unprofitable for you, take a look at the mobile operator‚Äôs website.  Among the existing tariff plans, you can find something suitable for yourself. </p>
