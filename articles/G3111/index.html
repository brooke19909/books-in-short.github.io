    <p>  Probably every <span>intelligent person</span> thinks at least once in his life about how it all began, <span>how life appeared on earth,</span> where the first person on earth came from.  The question is so complex that scientists can‚Äôt give a definite answer.  We can only enjoy the fruits of the created conditions for life, work, give birth to children, get food, create the latest technology, produce robots, but still it is simply impossible to create such a unique system as a person.  Director of the Russian Institute of the Brain, the great scientist Ankylosing spondylitis, after researching the substance in the human head, said: ‚ÄúNone of the people can create a human brain.  Only the Lord God could do such a thing! ‚Äù </p><h2>  1. Doubtful theory </h2>

    <p>  But still, archaeologists are trying to delve into the mystery of world history.  Excavations are underway, the extracted materials are carefully studied.  The maximum age of historical artifacts is about 40 thousand years.  But according to estimates, the <span>first person</span> on earth appeared about 2.5 million years ago.  According to Darwin, a person descended from a monkey, and in schools this hypothesis was taken for the ultimate truth.  Why, now, monkeys do not continue to take on a human form?  They both repeated the movements after the trainer, and continue to perform actions on the machine.  No, the theory is completely unproven.  So there‚Äôs probably no point in puzzling.  Better try to find out what was the life of the first people on earth. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  2. Four-armed and two-armed </h2><p>  According to scientists, the very first person on earth appeared 2.5 million years ago in Africa.  They called him Homo habilis, that is, a <span>skilled person.</span>  Unlike the organ of primitive ancestors, his brain was larger and his mental abilities were much higher.  The first man on earth walked on four legs. </p><p>  Another million years passed, and a man who stood on two legs came to replace him, and from this came his name - Homo erectus - an erect man. </p><h2>  3. The emergence of our direct ancestors </h2><p>  Outwardly, our ancestors were very similar to monkeys, although they had human skills.  But with the advent of upright people, the rapid development of mankind began, and about 100 thousand years ago they took on outlines similar to modern human faces and forms.  It is they, Homo sapiens, who are our direct ancestors.  We were engaged in fishing, hunting, and farming.  There was interest in occupying large territories, exploring other lands, and resettlement began in Europe, Asia and Australia. </p>

    <p>  Life, of course, was difficult, a process of survival took place.  To get a piece of meat, you had to fight with terrible beasts. </p><p>  Names for centuries were given according to the material from which the tools for labor and against predators were made.  A little easier when they learned to make fire.  From history, we know that there were periods of stone, bronze. </p><p>  Then there was a division into clans, families, various races and nationalities.  As they accumulated, classes of rich and poor appeared. </p><h2>  4. The sensual creation of God </h2><p>  We studied data from historical references.  But there is another source from which it follows that the appearance of the first person on earth is the merit of the Lord God.  And to be honest, <span>this hypothesis</span> seems the most true.  Indeed, in addition to the complex system of the human body, we have a conscience, kindness, mercy, emotions.  And from the monkeys we would hardly have inherited such a psychological set. </p>
