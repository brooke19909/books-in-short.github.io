Two more administrative units moved here from the Troitsky district.

During the Great Patriotic War, the area was occupied, and the local area suffered significant damage. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The district underwent a number of changes, during which its borders, control system and device changed. </p>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  As for the demographic situation, there are much more people here in the summer due to the fact that many tourists come from St. Petersburg.  Many people like to visit Mshinskaya.  This is a wonderful array reserved for gardening.  If you look at the latest trends, the population naturally decreases gradually due to urbanization.  In settlements where urban conditions are created, slightly more than half the population of the region lives.  Most citizens are Russians by nationality. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  The functions of representative power are implemented by the Council of Deputies.  Each settlement sends two people to the legislature.  This, as a rule, is the head of the local administration, as well as an ordinary deputy, who was nominated on the board of managers.  The district is represented by the head of his administration. </p><p>  Since 2006, this position has been occupied by <span>Valery Vasiliev.</span>  Commissions engaged in interaction with local organizations involved in the construction and arrangement of land operate on an ongoing basis.  These are extra-budgetary bodies that supervise the erection of housing, the operation of communal complexes, the agro-industrial sector, the use of forests, budget expenditures, taxes and finances, entrepreneurial activity, energy, vehicles, communication systems and tourism.  Special attention is paid to the protection of health, provision of senior citizens, culture, sports and law enforcement. </p>
