    <p>  Waterpark "Aquapolis" reviews is positive.  The complex has entertainment for young children.  At the sight of children's slides and splashing fountains, kids who have just recently learned to walk experience a storm of delight.  Teenagers and adults like to conquer extreme slopes and bask in a variety of pairs.  Over the entire period of operation, the water park has never received serious comments regarding compliance with safety and hygiene standards. </p><p>  The only thing they criticize the Aquapolis water park (Pskov) for is the cost of visiting.  However, it cannot be called overpriced, since the complex is unique in the region and has no analogues.  In addition, it is quite profitable to purchase day passes, giving the right to unlimited visits to all attractions and doubles.  If you wish, you can celebrate a birthday or any other personal holiday in the water park. </p>
