Long gone are the days when the volume when listening to your favorite song was limited by the limit position of the audio lever or button.  Modern technologies come to the aid of music lovers and offer a new solution in the field of sound - subwoofers.  What is it, how to use it, and who managed to invent the most powerful subwoofer? </p><p>  A subwoofer is an acoustics system that is designed to reproduce the lowest <span>frequencies of a range of</span> sounds.  Subwoofers, or, as they are also called, subwoofers, reproduce sounds from 25 to 180 Hz, and some instances are able to produce even lower basses (from 15 to 170 Hz). </p><p>  The most powerful car subwoofer </p><p>  Subs can be used at home and in the car.  At home, a subwoofer is usually an integral attribute of a home theater.  With this device it is possible to achieve amazing sound quality, watching a movie turns into a real adventure.  From dynamic and realistic sound you can get a lot of pleasure! </p><p>  Those motorists who like to listen to high-quality and loud music install in the car subs.  A few years ago, the most powerful subwoofer did not produce more than 1 kilowatt, but some companies are constantly developing more powerful amplifiers, and in 2007 an <span>amplifier for a subwoofer</span> was registered <span>, the</span> power of which broke all records - 20 kilowatts!  It would seem that the achievement was fixed, verified, you can calm down on this, but there was a group of people who wanted to set power records.  Tens of thousands of dollars were spent on the purchase of equipment, and as a result, a New Yorker installed a real speaker station in his van, capable of squeezing 60 kilowatts!  The fact that it was the most powerful subwoofer in the world can be judged by the fact that a few seconds after turning on the glass, the cars scattered to smithereens, and after a few moments the car just fell apart from a crazy vibration. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the driver does not have the goal of setting world records using the speaker system in his car, do not put a subwoofer too powerful, few people listen to loud music all the time - this is fraught with hearing problems and nerves.  In addition, similar, very powerful devices are not cheap, and car enthusiasts adhere to the unspoken rule: the cost of acoustics should not exceed 20% of the cost of the car.  That is, if your ‚Äúiron horse‚Äù costs 50 thousand dollars, it is not too rational to spend more than 10 thousand dollars on acoustics. </p><p>  The most powerful home subwoofer </p><p>  When you watch your favorite movie, the sound can greatly enhance the effect of what you see, especially if it is a high-quality sound.  Thunder or explosions will play absolutely real if you purchase a powerful subwoofer.  In addition, subwoofers are able to improve the sound as a whole by removing the bulk of the load from the cinema speakers. </p><p>  Subwoofers on the market mainly produce sounds from 30 to 150 Hz.  If desired, you can find a wider range, but the question arises whether the buyer needs a too powerful subwoofer. </p><p>  Firstly, its price will be an order of magnitude higher than that of less powerful "brothers";  secondly, for the human ear, higher or <span>lower frequencies</span> will not be so comfortable for perception.  That is, when purchasing a subwoofer for a home theater, you should not choose a wider range subwoofer.  Another thing when it comes to equipment for a recording studio or other professional purposes. </p><p>  Thus, when choosing a speaker system for a home or a car, it is, first of all, necessary to decide for what purposes you will use the equipment, and, of course, how much you can spend on it. </p>
