This is the place that everyone should visit who is fascinated by mystical stories, legends and secrets.  In addition, the incredible beauty, wonderful mountain air and views from the top of Boyko Mountain in Crimea are worth it to be seen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nat-geo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mystical Mount Boyko" class="if uuid-2749883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2749883.jpg"></div><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  The slopes of the Boyko massif are quite steep, the central part forms a rather flat plateau-shaped plateau, which is overgrown with dense forest.  The flat peak in Crimea is somewhat similar to a pasture, perhaps this is precisely what its name came from.  On some maps of the Middle Ages, the mountain range was designated as the "Venerable Singing", which is translated from the ancient Iranian language as a pasture.  There is another version of the origin of the name.  During the Middle Ages, such mountain meadows were a great place for walking and sheltering livestock. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mountain-race.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flat peak of mount Boyko" class="if uuid-2749885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2749885.jpg"></div><p>  According to another version, the name of the mountain comes from the word ‚ÄúBiyuk-kaya‚Äù, which is translated from Turkic as ‚Äúbig mountain‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to Boyko Mountain in Crimea? </h2><p>  The Boyko massif is located in the Bakhchisarai district.  Boyko is the northern part of one of the interesting sights of Crimea - Ai-Petri Mountains. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.5555291" data-lng="33.95608990000005" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/8/9/8/7898.png"></div><p>  From Bakhchisarai to the mountain range there are regular buses and fixed-route taxis.  Mount Boyko is located nearby the village - the village of Sokolinoe, which can be reached directly by bus from Sevastopol. </p><p>  Also, reaching the village of Happy and reaching the Grand Canyon, tourists get to the place from which the hiking trail begins, leading to Mount Boyko in Crimea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fountravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The road to Mount Boyko" class="if uuid-2749891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2749891.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical data </h2><p>  According to research, in ancient times there were six settlements on the plateau that existed from the 9th to the 15th centuries.  The Cathedral of the Savior, the ruins of which can still be seen to this day, was the center of the medieval state of Taurica. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the invasion of the Khazar Kaganate in Crimea, defensive walls were erected on the mountain to protect local residents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="topwar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortress walls" class="if uuid-2749892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2749892.jpg"></div><p>  The last state that existed on Mount Boyko in Crimea was the state of Theodoro, which was destroyed during the capture by the Turks. </p><h2>  Legends </h2><p>  One legend dates back to the 15th century.  During this period, Boykin fortress walls were under siege by the Turks.  The legend tells of the miller of Procopius, who worried about the safety of his mill, which stood on a mountain river near Boyko.  In order to get out of the besieged city in order to check the safety of his property, the miller used a secret passage.  Along the way, he was caught by the Turks and gave them the whereabouts of a secret passage into the city, after which he was killed.  The Turks infiltrated the plateau and killed all the locals, destroying the once strong state.  Since then, a flat peak in the Crimea has become uninhabited. </p><p>  Other legends are even more mystical and incredible. </p><p>  The most unusual is the legend of the Golden Cradle, which is depicted on the coat of arms of the <span>Principality of Theodoro.</span>  According to many researchers, the golden cradle is nothing more than the most famous Christian artifact in the world - the Holy Grail.  According to legend, the cup with the blood of Christ is hidden in one of the caves on Mount Boyko and is protected by mountain spirits that will guard the shrine until the people who inhabit the Principality of Theodoro are reborn. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that one of the seekers of the Holy Grail on Mount Boyko in Crimea was Adolf Hitler. </p><p>  On the western slope of Mount Boyko there are caves.  Their visit is usually not included in any route in the Crimea, and few people know about their existence.  You can get into them only with the help of special equipment climbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="graal.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caves in Boyko Mountain" class="if uuid-2749904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2749904.jpg"></div><p>  According to some legends, ancient people live in these caves, who are in a state of lethargic sleep and guard the sacred relic hidden in their depths. </p><p>  Residents of villages located near Mount Boyko in the Crimea, believe that it has an adverse effect on the human mind and try to bypass it.  It is said that during the archaeological expeditions that took place on the mountain, many members of the research group showed poor health and severe headaches.  One of the expeditions ended with one of the members of the group losing his mind, and therefore the search for the mysterious Crimean Shambhala had to be stopped.  The reports of all who participated in this expedition have the status of "secret" and are stored in secret archives. </p><p>  A mystical incident occurred during the years of World War II.  19 people climbed the mountain in search of the most valuable antiquities.  The searches had to be stopped ahead of schedule, because some time after their start something happened that made the Germans immediately descend from the flat peak in Crimea.  5 people from the group went missing, while the rest managed to take away a heavy box, the contents of which remained a secret. </p><p>  Particularly mysterious is the "Runic Maze", formed from cracks and crevices in the stone, which resemble ancient letters.  There are no hiking trails and trodden paths, it is very easy to get lost in this place, so you must definitely take a compass or climb along with a qualified guide, who not only knows these places like the back of his hand, but also tells a lot of secrets and legends, enveloped Mount Boyko. </p><h2>  Mount Boyko - a place of power </h2><p>  A dense cloud of myths and legends overhanging Boyko Mountain allows calling this place Crimean Shambhala.  According to eyewitnesses, UFOs constantly appear over the mountain.  Trees growing on the territory of the mountain range have curved trunks in a bizarre shape, which indicates the unique energy of this place. </p><p>  Some are sure that there is a portal on Mount Boyko that leads to parallel worlds. </p><h2>  Climbing </h2><p>  The road to Mount Boyko originates at the village of Bogatyr near a small picturesque lake.  This is the easiest and fastest route to the top.  The path runs along a trampled path under beech trees.  During the journey, only sounds of nature are heard: the birds singing, the rustle of leaves underfoot, the sound of the water of a mountain river.  Having crossed the road, tourists fall on a perfectly flat plateau, from which incredible views of the forest distances open up - a spectacle, breathtaking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="a-ur.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Views from Mount Boyko" class="if uuid-2749915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2749915.jpg"></div><p>  Going down from the mountain to the Makhuldur pass, you can see the ruins of the Cathedral of the Savior. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Small tourists who were not afraid to climb such an interesting sights of the Crimea as Mount Boyko unanimously say that this is a place that must be visited.
