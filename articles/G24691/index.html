  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Methodology of history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The theory and methodology of history is a system of principles, procedures and techniques for the use and formation of methods of historical study.  This system is characterized by a rather complex structure in terms of manifestation and content.  The methodology of studying history has in many cases opposing approaches to research.  Moreover, the differences between the methods are determined by the differences associated with the comprehension, understanding, worldview of researchers, as well as the conditions of their individual and social life. </p><p>  The development methodology of history has gone through three stages: </p><ol><li>  The classical stage is characterized by a clear contrast between the object and the subject of cognition.  At this stage, the <span>historical process</span> is understood as completely ‚Äútransparent‚Äù to the subject, it is authentic and absolutely visible exclusively by rational techniques of the human mind.  In connection with these provisions, a conviction is created in the omnipotence of science, an idealization is formed in the scientific reflection of reality, a belief in the possibility of transforming the reality of history according to a purposeful, rational, planned type, faith in historical progress.  Thus, it becomes possible to establish things in a reasonable manner, based on a scientific understanding of what is happening. </li><li>  The methodology of history passed to the non-classical stage in European consciousness in the second half of the 19th century, and in the Russian - at the end of the 20th century.  This stage is characterized by the loss of unanimity in the orientation toward trouble-free and universal scientific means, science as a whole, with adequate and exhaustive knowledge of the process and its transformation into ‚Äúsmart‚Äù from ‚Äúunreasonable‚Äù with the achievement for all people of ‚Äúa kingdom of freedom, reason and happiness‚Äù.  The whole variety of directions and concepts that includes the methodology of history at this stage with a certain conventionality is divided into two streams: high-tech (Soviet Marxist) and more scientific (based on the philosophical principles of life. </li></ol><p>  Being opposite and mutually exclusive in the process of approval and construction, the above-described currents are less likely to be exclusive, exclusive exclusive research.  Along with this, the fundamental paradigms of historical consciousness are changing.  At the non-classical stage, thinking undergoes significant transformations. </p><p>  Thus, the modern post-nonclassical methodology of history is formed as a clearly expressed synergistic (jointly formed effort of God and man), multidimensional, non-linear, pluralistic structure. </p><p>  The specifics of the system are determined by such questions as: </p><p>  - subject; </p><p>  - the boundaries and possibilities of comprehension of historical reality; </p><p>  - the range of applicability and features of the ratio of rational, scientific, discursive and intuitive (unscientific) forms, methods, means of understanding the process; </p><p>  - the role and place of understanding and clarification of the scientific study of historical reality and its empathy. </p><p>  Of fundamental importance is given to the fact that at the post-nonclassical stage there is a very different understanding of historical reality itself.  In this case, both the traditional interpretation of it as an objective and unified, independent of the consciousness and will of the subject of the natural-historical process with a global nature is applied, as well as an explanation of individual human existence as a holistic authentic form in historical being.  Moreover, the nature of understanding the subject determines the structure of the methodology of history and the way it is involved in the process of historical research. </p>
