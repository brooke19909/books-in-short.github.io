  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Leipzig: photo, review, description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Leipzig is a city known around the world for its fairs and universities.  Already in the late Middle Ages, it became the center of printing and retained this status until the outbreak of World War II.  The best years of Johann Sebastian Bach passed in this city.  Not one of the attractions of Leipzig is associated with the name of the great composer. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Leipzig was founded around the 10th century.  The first mention of it is found in the chronicle of Titmar of Merseburg.  The first university was founded here in the 15th century. </p><p>  The Thirty Years War, which led to significant destruction and reduced the population by a third, became a severe blow to this city - in 1642 only 12 thousand people lived here. </p><p>  By the middle of the 17th century, Leipzig became the center of the Enlightenment in Germany.  And in 1646, the future mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz was born in this city.  The 18th century is a quiet period in the history of Leipzig.  The welfare of the city residents has significantly improved, which is reflected in the architectural appearance - luxurious baroque buildings, trading houses have appeared.  In the XVIII century, there was a rapid cultural, economic and scientific upsurge. </p><p>  At different times, great writers, composers, and artists lived in this city.  By the way, Goethe's student years passed in Leipzig. </p><p>  In 1813, fierce battles unfolded in the vicinity of the city, which went down in history under the name "Battle of the Nations."  This happened in October.  And eight months before the battle, the future composer and conductor Richard Wagner appeared in a house of a humble official on one of the streets of this city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sights of Leipzig: </p><ul><li>  Church of St. Thomas. </li><li>  Gewandhouse. </li><li>  Old Town Hall. </li><li>  Old stock exchange. </li><li>  New Town Hall. </li><li>  Church of St. Nicholas. </li><li>  Monument to the Battle of the Nations. </li><li>  Memorial Russian Church. </li><li>  Auerbach cellar. </li><li>  Cafe ‚ÄúTsum Arab Coffee Baum‚Äù. </li><li>  Leipzig Zoo. </li><li>  Schiller House Museum. </li><li>  Golizsky palace. </li><li>  Alte Vaage. </li></ul><p>  Barthels hoff, Webers hoff do not belong to the sights of Leipzig.  These are centrally located restaurants. </p><h2>  Church of St. Thomas </h2><p>  This is one of the most famous sights of Leipzig and the second most important temple in the city.  The church gained worldwide fame thanks to Bach: the composer lived for many years in Leipzig and served as cantor in this temple. </p><p>  Church of St. Thomas was founded in the XV century.  There is a legend according to which at the beginning of the 13th century the famous poet and musician in Leipzig donated the relics of the holy Apostle Thomas brought from India to the monastery.  Hence the name of the <span>temple.</span>  <span>The church was</span> rebuilt more than once.  At the last restoration, it was given a late Gothic style.  In 1496 the church was consecrated, and forty years later a tower was built, which in 1702, like the main building, was rebuilt.  Today this tower has a height of 68 meters. </p><p>  St. Thomas Church is a landmark in Leipzig that you must visit.  The point is not only that it is an interesting architectural monument.  In the XVI century, an important historical event took place here: in 1539, on one of the Christian holidays, Martin Luther himself served. </p><p>  This attraction the city of Leipzig is of great interest to fans of classical music - for almost thirty years, Johann Sebastian Bach led the church choir.  At the beginning of the 20th century, a monument to the composer was erected near the walls of the church.  In 1949, the remains of Johann Sebastian Bach, discovered in a cemetery at the Church of St. John, were buried near the walls of this temple. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Near the church is a museum dedicated to the work of Bach.  It is located in a historic building called the Bosehouse.  The sights of Leipzig associated with the work of Johann Sebastian Bach are especially loved by tourists.  So, since the mid-80s, the museum was visited by more than 800 thousand people. </p><p>  In December 1943, the building was slightly damaged by an air attack.  On the walls today you can see traces of the war years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotelfriend.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. Thomas" class="if uuid-2445556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2445556.jpg"></div><h2>  Gewandhouse </h2><p>  This attraction of Leipzig is also associated with classical music.  In Germany there is no concert hall more than Gewandhaus.  The building is named after the famous orchestra.  It was discovered in 1981.  Gewandhouse is located on Augustus Square, but was originally located in Copper Lane.  Built at the end of the 15th century, it was first used as a Zeichhaus.  Then, on the second floor, cloth-makers, cloth dealers, settled down.  In the middle of the 18th century, orchestras began to give concerts here.  Gewandhaus became famous throughout Germany.  In the XX century it was moved to a new place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jensgerber.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gewandhaus Leipzig" class="if uuid-2445557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2445557.jpg"></div><h2>  Old Town Hall </h2><p>  This attraction of Leipzig - a city of Germany, rich in ancient architectural ensembles, is located on the Market Square.  The building was built in the middle of the XVI century.  Like other medieval buildings, the Old Town Hall underwent multiple restoration.  The last reconstruction was carried out at the beginning of the XX century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A feature of the Old Town Hall is the asymmetric location of the tower.  Above this tower there is a through passage that connects the Market Square with the neighboring street.  It is decorated with fountains, which are full sculptural compositions.  The Old Town Hall is one of the few surviving works of Renaissance architecture.  Until 1909, the city government met in this building.  After - in the New Town Hall, which is described below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="de.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old town hall" class="if uuid-2445558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2445558.jpg"></div><h2>  Old exchange </h2><p>  It is impossible to walk past this building, made in a bizarre, almost festive style.  The Old Stock Exchange is one of the baroque buildings located in the historic center of Leipzig.  Located on Naschmarkt Square, not far from the Old Town Hall.  In the 17-19 centuries, the commodity exchange was located here. </p><p>  The building was erected at the behest of the Leipzig merchants.  In the second half of the 19th century, the construction was significantly expanded and restored.  Famous architects of those times worked on the building.  In the middle of the XIX century, a new building was built for merchants and entrepreneurs.  And the former, from now on, the townspeople called the Old Exchange. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old exchange" class="if uuid-2445560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2445560.jpg"></div><h2>  New town hall </h2><p>  Here is the city government of Leipzig.  The New Town Hall was built at the end of the 19th century.  Earlier in its place was the castle of Pleisenburg.  Many interesting buildings appeared at the end of the XIX century.  After all, it was then that intensive industrialization began.  Leipzig has become one of the largest cities in eastern Germany.  The construction of modern buildings has begun.  The old town hall is a medieval building, and therefore the city government was moved to a building that meets the spirit of the times. </p><p>  Almost 150 years have passed since the opening of the New Town Hall.  Today this building belongs to historical monuments.  The Town Hall was built in an eclectic style, fashionable for the end of the XIX century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travels-in-germany.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.travels-in-germany.com/2014/07/where-to-go-for-weekend-5-leipzig.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="new town hall" class="if uuid-2445562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2445562.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of St. Nicholas </h2><p>  When this building was built, it is not known exactly.  Around the XII century.  Today it is one of the most famous church buildings in Leipzig.  Most often, tourists visit, perhaps, only the temple associated with the work of Bach.  The Church of St. Nicholas is an example of a classic style in architecture.  It got its modern look at the end of the 18th century, after a major restoration, led by city architect Johann Daute. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. Nicholas" class="if uuid-2445563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2445563.jpg"></div><h2>  Monument ‚ÄúBattle of the Peoples‚Äù </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of Leipzig is dedicated to the famous battle.  In October 1813, a coalition of Austrians, Russians, Prussians, and Swedes defeated the French army.  The battle, which was the largest before the First World War, took place in the vicinity of Leipzig. </p><p>  This attraction is the most massive monument in Europe.  The creation of the monument was discussed in the first half of the 19th century.  But until the end of the century, serious plans for the implementation of such a monument did not appear.  In 1898, the architect Bruno Schmitz prepared a drawing.  In the same year, the construction of the monument began.  The grand opening took place a hundred years after the battle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument ‚ÄúBattle of the Peoples‚Äù" class="if uuid-2445564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2445564.jpg"></div><h2>  Memorial Russian Church </h2><p>  The first information about the Orthodox church in Leipzig dates from the middle of the 18th century.  Then the city already had a Greek church.  The abbot decided to arrange a separate church and turned to St. Petersburg.  But the Holy Synod did not support the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfounding an Orthodox church in Leipzig.  The fact is that at that time in this German city the Russian community was small.  The second church was opened in 1751.  It is known that among the parishioners there was also the illegitimate son of Catherine II Alexei Bobrinsky. </p><p>  The modern church, which can be seen in the photo below, was opened at the beginning of the 20th century with donations collected in Russia and Germany.  The memorial Russian church is open in memory of the peoples who died in the Battle. </p><p>  The architects took the Ascension Church in Kolomenskoye as a model.  The church is built in the style of stone tents.  Its height is 55 meters.  On the apse is the icon ‚ÄúLord Almighty‚Äù.  The bells for the Memorial Russian Church in Leipzig were cast at the Olovyanishnikov factory in Yaroslavl.  It is noteworthy that as the material used guns that participated in the battle of 1813. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fotos.sc" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Memorial Russian Church" class="if uuid-2445565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2445565.jpg"></div><h2>  Schiller House Museum </h2><p>  This building was built in 1717 in the village of Goles, near Leipzig.  A modest peasant house would never have become a tourist attraction, but in 1785 <span>Friedrich Schiller</span> spent several months here <span>.</span>  Moreover, it was in this house that he worked on the writing of Don Carlos.  In 1841, a memorial plaque was installed.  Then the Schiller Society of Leipzig was founded in the building.  In 1848, a museum was opened dedicated to a German writer. </p><h2>  Golizsky palace </h2><p>  This mansion is located in the vicinity of Leipzig.  The attraction is visited by tourists from different countries.  In addition, a variety of theater and concert performances are held in the Goliz Palace.  The mansion was built in 1756 on the site of two peasant farmsteads. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about the sights of Leipzig </h2><p>  The architectural monuments described above are included in the standard excursion program.  Tourists visit the monument "Battle of the Nations", then go to the church of St. Thomas.  There are many fans of Bach in the 21st century, as evidenced by fresh flowers on the grave of the great composer.  In the temple, according to reviews of tourists, an unusual atmosphere reigns.  Man, crossing the threshold of the Church of St. Thomas, as if he was in that distant era.  After all, it was here that Bach once played his works on the organ. </p><p>  Leipzig is an unusually beautiful city.  There are almost no cars on its streets.  Special tunnels have been created for cars; they do not drive around the city center.  Leipzig has long been considered a center not only cultural, but also commercial.  Experts recommend visiting the passage located in the city center.  Next to it is a small cafe, in which, according to legend, Goethe sometimes visited.  Here, the poet once heard a story that inspired him to create a post.  Near the cafe there are sculptural compositions depicting the heroes of Goethe's work. </p><p>  According to reviews, there are a huge number of small cozy cafes in Leipzig.  This is due not only to the influx of tourists, but also to the fact that most of the locals prefer to dine outside the house.  Tourists respond only positively about traveling through the old German city.  The sights of Leipzig do not leave anyone indifferent. </p>
