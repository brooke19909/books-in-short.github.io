They are suitable for housewives and those who just like to sit in a chair, talking with a good friend, drinking tea. </p><p>  This article describes all the popular Dekt phones, which have recently become frequently purchased. </p><h2>  Gigaset s810 </h2><p>  This phone model is considered budget and quite good in its price category.  It has an impressive design made in a classic style.  It will also be useful for young parents, because the phone is equipped with the built-in "Baby Monitor" function.  Notebook holds up to 500 numbers.  In addition to all the advantages of this technique, there is such an option as an accelerated set of any nine contacts.  They can be entered into the phone‚Äôs memory, and then by pressing a single key to call the number.  Moreover, the device is able to send messages and connect to other equipment using the bluetooth module.  The device can wake a person in the morning, thanks to the "alarm" option.  Few Dekt phones have a similar feature. </p><p>  The main advantages: a capacious contact book, it is possible to load your tunes into the device‚Äôs memory, up to 6 different handsets are connected to the technology base. </p><p>  Of the minuses, consumers distinguish only editing contacts through Outlook, other methods are not provided. </p><p>  Average cost: 1200 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phones dect" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1569697.jpg" width="500"></div>

Dekt is a telephone that has received a huge amount of positive reviews.  High rank Gigaset S810 assigned consumers.  Consider its merits. </p><p>  The keys are comfortable, the handset lies perfectly in the hand.  The display is nice, the fonts and text size are optimal.  In standby mode, you can turn off the radio exchange between the base and the phone itself.  The menu is intuitive.  Charging takes place via a mini USB port.  In addition to melodies, you can download photos and pictures to your phone.  There are only three megabytes of memory, but they are enough for convenient use of the device.  The screen is much better than many other phones in this price category. </p><p>  What do consumers consider cons?  Firstly, the impossibility of another way to edit contacts, as through Outlook.  Secondly, the absence of subscriber groups. </p><h2>  Philips M881 </h2><p>  This model received a lot of attention because of its interesting appearance, but its cost is much higher than the above.  However, the price is justified.  Philips M881 is able to accommodate up to 250 numbers in the phone book.  She will appreciate the opportunity to create a conference call.  The speakers are quite loud, so much so that some consumers consider this a drawback.  The battery is medium power, you can talk in a row for 18 hours, after which you will have to connect to the charger.  In general, we can say that under an interesting design a "very nice" filling is "hidden".  Especially considering that the batteries of Dekt-phones are not always pleasing with their power. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Advantages of the device: capacious battery, convenient shape of the tube (curved), pleasant appearance. </p><p>  Cons: few tunes, can not be fixed in an upright position. </p><p>  Average price: 6 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phones Panasonic Dekt" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1569709.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Philips M881 Reviews </h2><p>  Consider the virtues that consumers talk about in their reviews.  The buttons are easy to press.  The mass is impressive, but it lies comfortably in the hand.  Appearance is noticed by all consumers, this is the first thing that attracts the attention of each person.  The menu is understandable, difficulties with its development do not arise.  A telephone can be put on a base without difficulty, in any position (with a deviation to the right or left), it ‚Äúsees‚Äù it.  Some note that the design, made in dark shades, is more masculine.  The speakerphone quality is excellent.  It is even compared to iPhone, but Philips Dekt phones win in this competition.  Build quality is excellent, plastic feels nice to the touch.  In the kit, the manufacturer even gives a napkin for caring for the phone. </p><p>  Unfortunately, with such an abundance of advantages, the device also has negative sides.  It cannot be attached in an upright position; the tube will constantly fall.  When the answering machine is activated, the phone does not broadcast the caller‚Äôs speech, which can be attributed to significant shortcomings.  It‚Äôs really possible to buy only a black version of the device, since other color solutions were not intended by the manufacturer.  Due to the fact that the battery is its own design, you will have to spend extra money to replace it.  Universal options are not provided.  Like many Dekt phones, this one does not have a good cable length. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best dekt phone" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1569710.jpg" width="600"></div>

The brand‚Äôs reputation makes itself felt, because the device really exceeded all expectations.  Color display.  Buttons are pressed quite easily.  It should be noted that not all Panasonic Dekt phones boast such keys.  The menu is convenient, it will not be difficult to deal with it.  The melodies are pleasant to hear.  You can save about 20 in the phone‚Äôs memory. It takes a long time to charge, especially if you use the device several times a day without talking too long.  Caller ID is much faster than some other models from the same manufacturer. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings - low-quality plastic.  On a smooth surface, the phone is quite unstable, it is easy to push it.  The buttons are too convex.  The font is not suitable for people with vision problems.  For special reasons that are difficult to find out, the volume drops during a conversation.  Either this is a problem in the software, or in the keys; it is easy to press them with your ear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phones dekt models" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1569776.jpg" width="547"></div>

    <h2>  Communication radius </h2><p>  In this paragraph, we consider one of the important issues.  They are asked by many consumers.  How to increase the distance to the "Dekt" -phone?  The answer is simple: purchase additional repeaters.  However, in many ways they lose to the cable.  The fact is that sometimes it will be cheaper to lay it, than for every second room to buy repeaters (relevant for large private houses). </p>
