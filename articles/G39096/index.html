After all, this activity extremely calms the nervous system.  In addition, it makes it possible to create exclusive fashion items to your liking.  And so it‚Äôs a sin to hide - things made by oneself are relatively cheaper in material terms than purchased ones. </p><p>  One of the simplest gizmos in a women's wardrobe, which a needlewoman who has just learned the basics of this science - mittens can create.  <span>Knitting mittens with</span> knitting needles is available even to a very young craftswoman. </p><p>  Usually experienced knitters use either two or five knitting needles for work.  <span>Knitting mittens with</span> knitting needles for beginners involves working on two knitting needles.  To make this model you will need yarn (from 60 to 70 grams) and two number 2 knitting needles. And, of course, you need to be patient and assiduous. </p><p>  But the simplest knitting mittens on two knitting needles is variable.  The main difficulty here is tying the thumb.  First, you can consider the option when the craftswoman knits this detail on two knitting needles. </p><p>  To complete this model, you need to dial 24 loops and knit 5-6 cm with any rubber band - either 1X1 or 2X2.  Then you should go to knitting facial.  In general, if you plan to knit mittens with knitting needles with a pattern on the back of the mitten, you should turn on the yarn of a different color during the manufacture of this part, or, during knitting, perform a three-dimensional pattern with your chosen knitting.  But since we are talking about inexperienced needlewomen, it is suggested that you simply embroider the pattern later or sew pompons, appliqu√©s, beads or bows on the mitten ‚Äî anyone who has enough imagination. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is necessary to increase the width of knitting by 1 loop on one side, where the <span>thumb</span> will be located.  So you need to tie the mittens to the place where the thumb begins.  Now comes the difficulty of tying a finger. </p><p>  It is made in this way: in the interval between the second and third loops, a yarn is made on the front side of the knitting.  The <span>wrong</span> side is knitted according to the pattern, the crochet is also knitted with the <span>wrong loop.</span>  In the next row before the yarn, three loops are obtained, and then the yarn is made again.  According to this scheme, you should knit until the knitting reaches the fold of the thumb, that is, to its inner base.  Now the craftswoman removes the finger loops on an additional knitting needle, and even better - fastens it on a <span>safety pin</span> so that the loops do not come off. </p><p>  Now <span>knitting mittens with needles</span> continues according to the old pattern to the tip of the little finger.  Here you should begin to make out the rounding of the mitten.  To do this, in each row on both sides should reduce the width of knitting by 1 loop.  When 1 loop remains, the thread breaks and stretches into this loop, forming a nodule. </p><p>  Now you should take care of tying the thumb.  Make it easy!  Simply, the loops left to wait for their turn on the pin are removed on the knitting needle and the finger is knitted to the middle of the nail, after which 1 loop loosens on both sides.  As soon as 1 loop remains on the knitting needle, the thread must be cut off and tied in a knot on this last loop so that the knitting does not open. </p><p>  After 4 such parts are made (two for the back of the mittens and two for the inside, so the two parts must be ‚Äúmirrored‚Äù by the other two at the location of the finger), it is time to stitch the product.  You can carefully sew both halves with a knitting stitch so that it is not noticeable at all.  But some prefer the opposite to emphasize the seam, crocheting the stitching place with a contrasting thread. </p><p>  After knitting, do not forget to stretch things and dry by laying out the finished products carefully on a flat surface so that the knitwear does not deform.  And after drying, rather put on self-bindings on your hands - and march into the street, boast of a new thing in front of girlfriends, let them be envious! </p>
