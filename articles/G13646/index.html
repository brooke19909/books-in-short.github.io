    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  This hotel complex is located in Sharjah.  Historically, this city was one of the richest in the entire region.

Now it is the third largest metropolis in all the Emirates. </p><p>  The city of Sharjah is located on the shores of the Persian Gulf, near Dubai and Ajman.  Accordingly, the airport can be reached from here quickly, which is a plus in terms of location.  Yes, and Dubai with Ajman is interesting to many to see.  From Swiss Belhotel Sharjah 4 * you can get anywhere, because there is a well-developed transport connection. </p><p>  But, of course, the most important thing is the proximity to the sea.  You can walk to the beach in just a few minutes.

    <h2>  What else is available at the hotel? </h2><p>  Swiss Belhotel Sharjah 4 * (United Arab Emirates, Sharjah) provides truly diverse services.  But there is not enough entertainment.  However, this does not bother anyone, since all the most interesting is located outside the hotel and is quite close to museums, shopping centers, shops, entertainment complexes and much more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel itself has an outdoor swimming pool with a sun terrace and a gym with all the simulators that are necessary for full physical activity.  There is also a small wellness center at the hotel, where you can take time for Ayurvedic and cosmetic procedures, or just take a steam bath in the sauna.  In general, there is not much entertainment, but they are.  Mostly people spend time on the beaches.  And there is everything - the opportunity to do water sports, go kayaking or canoeing, or diving from the slides. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In the Swiss Belhotel Sharjah 4 * (United Arab Emirates, Sharjah) there are two establishments inviting guests.  The first is a 24-hour restaurant, known as Al Dar.  There guests can enjoy delicious aromatic dishes of <span>Arabic cuisine.</span>  And the second is the Lobby Caf√©, which serves freshly squeezed juices, fresh juices, coffee, tea and pastries. </p><p>  As people who were here say, they will not be able to stay hungry.  Breakfast is good, there is everything - scrambled eggs, omelettes (especially hearty ones in which they put mushrooms and cheese), boiled eggs, lots of fruits, side dishes, sausages, and even porridge.  Interestingly, the restaurant opens at 6:30.  And for breakfast you can come by this time.  This is especially appealing to those who do not like to sleep on vacation and want to start an active entertainment program in the morning. </p><p>  Near the hotel there are restaurants and cafes.  In which, by the way, a rather interesting system operates.  The visitor pays for the second course, but the price includes the first course, salad and bread.  In local institutions pretty cheap drinks, which also can not but rejoice. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The only thing that is not in the Swiss Belhotel Sharjah 4 * (Sharjah) is alcohol.  This is because the hotel is located in the emirate where strong drinks are prohibited for sale by a sheikh.  It is also forbidden to store and import alcohol there.  But for the sake of tourists, a compromise law was introduced - guests of the emirate can bring two liters of strong alcohol and the same amount of weak alcohol to Sharjah.  And then drink it in the room, if you want.  If you want, you can go to Ajman.  There is a large amount of alcohol, but very expensive. </p><p>  In general, in Sharjah you can try a lot of everything delicious, including in the hotel restaurant.  Shish kebabs, delicious aromatic dumplings, seafood soups, kvass without yeast and air cakes - this is just a small list of delights that you can taste while relaxing on the emirate. </p>

    <h2>  About accommodation and booking </h2><p>  This topic should also be noted when speaking about Swiss Belhotel Sharjah.  The description of the hotel and its prices inspire a lot of people to come here.  So the nuances regarding booking and accommodation should be aware. </p><p>  Check-in is here from 14:00, and check-out lasts until noon.  The hotel can accommodate with children.  If there are two of them, and they are both under 12 years old, then they will not have to pay extra.  Babies under 2 years old will be provided with a cradle. </p><p>  For older guests who arrived with guests, you will need to pay 75 dirhams for each night (this is about 1285 rubles). </p><p>  There is one more important nuance.  Local legislation did not establish a very convenient law, according to which couples who are not married are not allowed to live in one room.  Lovers without a certificate confirming their legal relationship will not be populated.  In addition, you will need to provide your valid passports or other identification cards. </p><p>  Also, when making a reservation, debit cards are not accepted.  Only credit cards.  Fortunately, the accommodation facility accepts ‚ÄúVisa‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaster Card‚Äù, ‚ÄúAmerican Express‚Äù, ‚ÄúDiners Club‚Äù and JCB - you will need to indicate the data of any card when making an application for booking an apartment.  But then a debit card can be paid upon arrival.  By the way, a certain amount of money can be blocked on the credit card account.  But this is only until guests arrive at the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Travel tips </h2><p>  People who already had a rest in Swiss Belhotel Sharjah (ex. Sharjah Rotana 4 *) often give recommendations to those who are just going to go here on vacation.  And some tips are pretty helpful. </p><p>  Firstly, it is better to take an English phrasebook with you or to memorize a few basic phrases.  Since the reception practically do not speak Russian.  This is confirmed by all the reviews left about Swiss Belhotel Sharjah 4 *. </p><p>  When checking in, it is better to ask for the highest floor.  There are only 18 of them, but you should not worry about the climbs - naturally, there is an elevator.  And best of all, indicate the wishes regarding the location of the room when booking.  Everything is simple here - the higher the apartments are, the quieter there.  And the noise of the road will not be heard.  Although, all rooms are soundproofed. </p><p>  By the way, using early booking, you can get a discount.  Here they are quite often, especially in winter or autumn.  The influx of tourists outside the season is small, so the administration is trying to attract guests with discounts and promotions.  The prices here are already quite modest, but the opportunity to save can not but rejoice. </p><p>  It is better to close the windows at night.  If it is a pity - turn on the air conditioning.  Because at about 5-6 in the morning in a mosque nearby, morning prayer begins, and it can be heard in the whole district.  This may disturb sleep. </p><p>  You should definitely climb to the top of the famous skyscraper in Dubai called the Burj Khalifa.  Its height is 828 meters!  And the tourists who were here say that it is better to buy a ticket in advance, through the online service.  Firstly, it will be cheaper.  Secondly, you can choose the best time yourself.  And, by the way, excursions should be booked at Swiss Belhotel Sharjah 4 *.  Reviews confirm - there are quite low prices for guests. </p><p>  If you need cheap, but good souvenirs and gifts, then you need to leave the hotel, turn left, and walk a bit.  After 5-7 minutes, you will be able to go to the Day to Day store, where you can find everything - starting with clothes and magnets, ending with washing powder and shampoos. </p><p>  And inexpensive foods, food and drinks can be found in Carrefour supermarkets.  They are located in large shopping centers.  The surest option is a trip to Dubai Deira City.  Why go there?  Because every day a free bus goes from the hotel there.  And there you can buy a lot of everything for a fairly small amount of money.  Carrefour, one might say, is the Arabic version of Auchan in choice, variety and price. </p>

    <h2>  What else do visitors say? </h2><p>  Swiss Belhotel Sharjah has a good rating.  Many people like this complex.  Which is not surprising, because here they are very modest, as for the UAE, prices, a decent level of service and comfortable rooms.  There is also a beach nearby Swiss Belhotel Sharjah.  Of course, not in the immediate vicinity, but close by.  Moreover, there is also a free bus to it. </p><p>  The hotel also has excellent staff, which no one forgets to mention.  All are smiling, good-natured, friendly.  Many say that they were met with tasty treats upon arrival. </p><p>  The maids are cleaning every day, changing towels, making the bed.  And also replenish stocks of cream, coffee, tea and bottled water, completely free.  They also put new bottles with soap, gel, shampoos, lotions, balms, creams and other hygiene products. </p><p>  Room service here is not in words.  They bring everything quickly - you don‚Äôt have to wait.  And the restaurant is also great service.
