    <h2>  What reviews can be found? </h2><p>  But no matter how sweetly and fabulously the companies advertised resorts, in particular Meridian 4 * (Bulgaria), reviews from experienced vacationers will always be in demand and useful.  They will show the ‚Äúinside out‚Äù of the service without embellishment and exaggeration.  Of course, it is worth considering both individual tastes and the nature of tourists.  However, the overall impression of most travelers is usually a determining factor when choosing.  As for the Meridian Hotel specifically, the reviews here have been quite controversial.  It is worth to read more with the arguments of vacationers. </p><h2>  pros </h2><ul><li>  The advantages of the hotel were related to a convenient location.  Sunny Beach has long been famous for its beauty and entertainment.  It is here that everyone can find something for themselves to taste, and all this is provided at fairly affordable prices.  As for the hotel itself, the administration and staff seemed to many guests welcoming, executive and competent.  Upon arrival, tourists are quickly accommodated according to their reservation. </li><li>  The hotel is quite large.  But, despite the full occupancy of the rooms, there is no fuss.  The mode is rather measured, as relies on the resort. </li><li>  The appearance of the hotel, a well-groomed territory with a park, where it is very convenient to walk with children and just relax after a busy sunny day, also make a good impression. </li><li>  External majesty is consistent with the interior.  Luxurious furniture, original layout and furnishings - everything in the hotel is aimed at pleasantly surprising guests and making them want to return to this cosiness and harmony again and again. </li><li>  According to the unified opinion of tourists, the hotel‚Äôs signature cuisine deserves great gratitude and delight.  The dishes are exquisite, incredibly tasty, fresh products.  The menu is very diverse and suits people with different culinary orientations.  In addition, the restaurant is located on the top floor of the hotel, so it offers gorgeous views of the sea and coast.  This brings a romantic touch to sunny vacations and gives relaxation and peace of mind. </li><li>  Entertainment programs many found saturated for themselves.  Here couples and children can relax and have a noisy company of friends and business people who are forced to combine work and leisure.  Women especially appreciated tanning beds and beauty services.  It is noteworthy that while they receive beauty procedures, children can be left in the playroom, not to worry about their safety. </li><li>  The animation by the pool seemed fascinating to both children and adults.  However, the program is designed more for the summer period.  On cooler days, other activities can be found on site.  For example, play tennis or billiards, take a steam bath in the sauna and take a massage. </li><li>  A significant advantage was also the close distance to the sea.  Just five minutes walk - and the gentle golden sand is already meeting new lovers of the sun and water activities. </li><li>  I liked the close proximity of the hotel to a large supermarket. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  In general, the hotel service is rated at a solid "4".  Meridian, whose reviews were mostly quite positive, also receives not very good feedback from skeptics: </p><ul><li>  For example, many Russian tourists were put in an uncomfortable position by the language barrier, since the staff practically does not speak Russian.  For foreign guests and people who speak English, this nuance did not fall into the category of shortcomings. </li><li>  Despite the fact that some vacationers noted the friendliness of the staff, others, on the contrary, noted a boorish attitude.  Here, perhaps, we should talk about a clash of characters. </li><li>  It‚Äôs sad, but true: some vacationers recorded cases of non-compliance with hotel rules for cleaning rooms and changing linen and towels.  Several maids are assigned to each floor.  Perhaps this situation has become an example of neglect of staff responsibilities.  Do not like the plumbing in the rooms.  In particular, the bathtub was small and uncomfortable. </li><li>  Tourists who, for whatever reason, cannot leave their pets at home, were very disappointed with the ban on their placement in the hotel.  On the one hand, such a rule should work to maintain cleanliness and sanitary standards, on the other hand, some vacationers regarded this as discrimination. </li><li>  Significantly tarnished the reputation of the hotel and cases of theft from the rooms.  Of course, this is an unpleasant fact.  However, the administration has its own decision on this - a paid safe and a left-luggage office. </li><li>  It seemed inappropriate to some tourists that they pay for such trifles as placing on a sun lounger by the pool or finding a child on the playground. </li><li>  The beach is not the property of the hotel, so you have to pay for any services here (sun loungers, awnings, toilet). </li></ul><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Of course, you cannot please all the guests.  But experts believe that the range of services and the situation at the Meridian hotel are quite consistent with their category.  And inadequate room service is the problem of working with staff.  The hotel administration regularly monitors the reviews of its guests on travel sites and forums, making appropriate adjustments to the service.  At least that's what managers write and tourists confirm every year. </p>
