There are sandy beaches, and the picturesque sea, and amazing culture, and rich nightlife, and extremely cheap shopping.  Thanks to the Schengen visa, tourists resting here can easily visit, for example, France.  Rest here is a little more expensive than in Turkey or Bulgaria, popular with Russian tourists.  If you want to save on vacation, then you should pay attention to the hotel Garbi Park ("Garby Park") 3 *.  But is it worth it to relax here? </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  For tourists, the hotel opened its doors in 1970.  On its territory there is a five-story building, which housed 250 rooms.  Since the Garbi Park Lloret Hotel is a three-star complex, you should not count on a luxurious reception.  The rooms here are modest but comfortable and recently renovated.  Their last restoration was carried out in 2013.  The hotel staff does not speak Russian, but it understands English and French well.  The complex provides accommodation for children of all ages, including infants.  Unfortunately, pets are not allowed here even at an additional cost. </p>

    <h2>  Catering: bars, restaurants and local cuisine </h2><p>  The tourist complex Garbi Park Lloret Hotel 3 * does not offer its tourists an all-inclusive system.  There are many restaurants, caf√©s and bars around the hotel that serve local cuisine at low prices.  Most of the tourists living here spend a lot of time in the city, and therefore prefer to dine there.  If you want to save, then buy business lunches.  This is a great way to eat inexpensively and tasty.  Arriving in Spain, you should definitely try "tapeo" (a variety of snacks), seafood pilaf and dried pork.  Also do not miss the famous Catalan wines. </p>

But hotel guests can visit the water park, which is located in one of the neighboring hotels.  Guests of the complex receive a good discount on visits.  There is also a mini club at the hotel.

    <h2>  Opinions of tourists: disadvantages </h2><p>  But the guests who rested at Garbi Park Lloret Hotel 3 *, leave negative reviews.  In their opinion, the most significant disadvantages are: </p><ul><li>  Poor soundproofing in the rooms.  You can even hear the usual conversations of neighbors. </li><li>  The noise from the street.  It is worth taking a room overlooking the pool, it is usually much quieter there. </li><li>  Poor and monotonous breakfasts. </li><li>  The hotel has a lot of young people who make noise day and night.  And since the soundproofing in the hotel is terrible, it is impossible to fall asleep from their screams. </li><li>  There are a lot of people on the beach, among whom you can meet nudists. </li></ul><h2>  Draw conclusions </h2><p>  After reading the description of the Garbi Park 3 * hotel and reviews about it, we can conclude that this is a good complex for the price it offers.  Particular attention should be paid to young people and people who love outdoor activities.  Families with children and older couples should look for another place, otherwise the vacation can be spoiled by noisy neighbors or drunk teenagers who walk at night on the streets of the city. </p>
