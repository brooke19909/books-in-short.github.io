However, the reality is that sometimes life presents unexpected and very unpleasant surprises, and relaxation turns into a real test.  For example, on the way to the beach, you tripped and <span>broke your leg.</span>  In this case, you will need emergency medical care.  But the services of a doctor to a foreign citizen are far from free and cost a lot of money.  Therefore, reasonable tourists, before heading "over the hill", prefer to visit a reliable insurance company and use the services it offers. </p><h2>  ETS - insurance company </h2><p>  Today in the Russian Federation, CAS ‚ÄúEuropean Travel Insurance‚Äù is the only company specializing in <span>travel insurance.</span>  Over the years of its existence, the company managed to fall in love with millions of devoted Russian tourists.  "European Travel Insurance" is one of twenty members of the so-called ETI group.  The offices of the insurance companies that make up European Travel Insurance are located in the capitals of many European countries and have been operating successfully for many years.  The 100% owner of ETS shares is the Munich Reinsurance Group.  In Moscow, the CJSC "ETS" began its activities in 2006. </p>

    <h2>  The history of the emergence and formation of the CJSC "ETC" </h2><p>  The origins of the European Travel Insurance Company are the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Hungarian Max von Engel, which arose due to one interesting incident that happened to him in 1905.  On one of the hot summer evenings, he, along with his son, was waiting for 15 years on the platform platform of Lucerne train departure.  Suddenly, a spark suddenly fell out of the locomotive‚Äôs pipe, falling directly onto Engel‚Äôs suitcase.  Fortunately, the suitcase was safe and sound.  But it could have happened otherwise: it could have caught fire, and you could say goodbye to important documents, personal belongings, souvenirs.  And who would answer for this?  And after all, the fire at the station is not the only nuisance that can happen to travelers.  It was this idea that Engel visited at that moment.  He thought: ‚ÄúIt would be nice for people to have the opportunity to insure their luggage.‚Äù  Engel shared this reasoning with his friend, the head of the Munich Reinsurance Society, Karl von Thieme.  The result of this was the opening on May 9, 1907 of the European Joint-Stock Company of Luggage Insurance.  More than a hundred years have passed since then, however, the European Travel Insurance company continues to take care of travelers and considers this its priority. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="european travel insurance" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22327/477202.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <p>  Tourists can take out insurance for both short and long trips.  As part of short-term travel insurance, OPTIMA, Standard Plus, and Sports Risk are in place.  With regard to long-term travel insurance, the European Travel Insurance company offers tourists the Multi Trip program and the equally well-known Business Trip program. </p><p>  The duration of the Business Trip program is one year.  A tourist can travel an unlimited number of times, however, the period of one trip should not exceed 91 days.  The problem with limiting the duration of the trip disappears by itself if the tourist gives preference to the Multi Trip program.  In this case, the client of CJSC "ETS" has the opportunity to independently determine the length of stay in a foreign country. </p><h2>  ETS: customer reviews </h2><p>  Like any other company, people at various forums discuss European Travel Insurance.  Customer reviews are overwhelmingly positive.  Satisfied customers do not tire of thanking the ETS insurance company for the high level of service, the liberal prices for the services offered, as well as for timely assistance and the full fulfillment of their duties at the time the insured event occurs. </p>
