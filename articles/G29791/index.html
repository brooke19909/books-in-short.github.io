Comparison of these devices is a fairly popular topic of discussion.  And this is taking into account the fact that the devices entered the market almost 3 years ago, and today more modern models of gadgets from Apple have appeared.  However, many are interested in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus.  A comparison of the models will be presented later.  In addition, the characteristics of other gadgets will be affected. </p><h2>  Device Screen Size </h2><p>  This is probably the most important difference between the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus.  Comparing the diagonals of device displays was a very popular discussion at the time when the gadgets were first introduced.  It is worth noting that the screens of both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus are larger than those of the predecessor model - 5s.  Such innovation was also the subject of not only controversy, but also criticism, since Apple to some extent moved away from its own standards.  Despite this, soon even the most fastidious users accepted such changes and were generally satisfied. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 6 vs iphone 6 plus comparison" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41646/1727644.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Regarding the changes - Apple simply adapted to market trends, as most of the flagships of other manufacturers began to be equipped with screens that are much larger than the iPhone, which could entice some potential buyers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now back to the size of the displays.  iPhone 6 received a screen with a diagonal of 4.7 inches, and the diagonal of the 6 plus version is 5.5 inches.  Visually, the plus version looks much larger. </p><h2>  Compare iPhone 6 and 6 plus cameras </h2><p>  According to their technical characteristics, they are almost identical.  If you do not delve deeply into terms and specifications that are obscure to the average user, then we can say that both devices have an 8-megapixel camera that allows you to take high-quality photos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="comparison iphone 6 and 6 plus" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41646/1727643.jpg" width="225"></div>

    <p>  However, the iPhone 6 plus has the advantage, namely, the function of optical image stabilization, which allows you to improve the quality of photos taken during movement (for example, eliminating the negative effects of ripple and blur). </p><p>  The front camera, which is used for video calls and selfies, is the same for both gadgets.  It turns out that comparing the iPhone 6 and 6 plus in terms of photo quality makes little sense, but a larger smartphone still has a slight advantage. </p><h2>  Other technical features </h2><p>  Both smartphones have the same processors and are controlled by the same iOS operating system.  The latter itself is updated to a more current version, respectively, there are no differences between the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 6 vs 6 plus comparison" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41646/1727641.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Comparison of devices is possible according to one more sign, namely - battery charge capacity.  The plus version due to its size has received a more capacious battery, which allows you to use the device without recharging much longer.  Under certain conditions, the service life is almost doubled.  For example, if the smartphone is in talk mode (about 11.5 hours and 23.0, respectively). </p><p>  With more active use, the operating time increases not so significantly, but still.  Power consumption is also affected by screen size. </p><h2>  Compare iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6s plus </h2><p>  How do the above devices differ from newer <span>Apple models?</span>  <span>iPhone</span> 6 plus vs 6s plus - comparing two "big" smartphones is much more appropriate, because the appearance of one such device from Apple heralded a whole line in the future.  By tradition, the version with the prefix ‚Äús‚Äù has undergone significant technical changes. </p><p>  The new iPhone received a more powerful processor, an improved camera, as well as a number of other differences.  Accordingly, the newer device has better performance parameters, which affects the operation of some applications, in particular games.  In addition, the quality of photographs has improved.  The changes also affected the front camera - it became larger, which positively affects the pictures. </p><p>  In addition, the device has an improved LTE communication module;  the latter provides high-speed Internet access.  The maximum data processing speed has almost doubled.  However, not every user will be able to notice this for several reasons.  Firstly, the previous smartphone had fairly fast Internet access;  secondly, much will depend on the telecom operator, as well as the geographic location of its subscriber. </p><p>  The size and characteristics of the display along with the technical features of the battery remained unchanged.  The latter retained the same charge capacity and power consumption specifications.  It turns out that the operating time without recharging the iPhone 6s plus is similar to its predecessor - 6 plus. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Another important point to compare is the price of the devices.  It makes no sense to indicate the exact prices for gadgets, as they have changed and continue to change over time.  However, there is a trend, the essence of which is that the plus version models are more expensive on average by 15-25% of the price of a regular iPhone.  Also, the cost of devices increases depending on the amount of its memory and, of course, on novelty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 6 plus vs 6s plus comparison" class="if" height="239" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41646/1727654.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Summing up, we can safely say that the reader has learned in detail about the differences between the iPhone 6 vs 6 plus.  A comparison of these devices showed that the differences between them are minimal, and the emphasis is on the screen size.  Apparently it was assumed that some users would want a large iPhone.  However, Apple did not fail: there is a demand for all their smartphones that are on sale. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="comparison of iphone 6 and 6 plus cameras" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41646/1727645.jpg" width="384"></div>

    <p>  The policy of the company is such that the interests of all users were taken into account, and later iPhone SE went on sale, which has dimensions similar to version 5s, namely, a screen with a diagonal of 4 inches.  The device is quite interesting, since its technical characteristics are similar to the iPhone 6s and 6s plus, except for the display.  As a result, Apple breathed new life into a device with a classic design. </p>
