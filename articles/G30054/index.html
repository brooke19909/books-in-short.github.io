Although he received the unofficial title of one of the main resort centers of our country more than half a century ago, the popularity of this health resort increased sharply after the 2014 Winter Olympics.  In preparation for this grand sporting event, many objects were built in the city, which today have become recognized sights of Sochi.  Photos with the names of these modern architectural masterpieces, as well as cultural, historical and natural monuments located in and around the city, can be seen on many tourist avenues that advertise our country abroad.  This article will talk about some of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sailonboard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi port" class="if uuid-2395045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2395045.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical monuments </h2><p>  The ancient sights of Sochi are few.  However, among them there are many interesting objects.  It: </p><ul><li>  Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  The church was built in 1904 on the site of an old wooden one.  In the Soviet period, the rector of the temple was shot, and he himself fell into desolation.  Only in the early 2000s, the restoration of the shrine began.  Today, the church, located in the Adler district at ul.  Afipskaya, 2, appears before the Orthodox believers in all its glory.  Especially noteworthy is its interior decoration, made with the money of the Greek community of the city. </li></ul><ul><li>  Observation tower on Mount Akhun.  This monument of federal significance was built in the mid 30s of the last century.  The initiative came from Joseph Stalin himself, who ordered the restoration of the Circassian observation tower, which had collapsed from time to time.  Since no one remembered what she looked like, the architect S. Vorobyev developed a project for the construction in the Ottoman style.  Immediately after that, in just 101 days, a powerful 30-meter tower was erected, which became one of Sochi's most famous historical architectural sights.  From its observation deck, one of the best views of the resort city and its surroundings opens.  The height of the mountain is 663 m above sea level.  Climbing the observation tower is recommended in clear weather.  Due to the high altitude at which the point of view is located, on cloudy days, tourists may literally be above the clouds and not see the magnificent landscape for which this tour was started. </li></ul><ul><li>  <span>Volkonsky dolmen.</span>  In the vicinity of Sochi there are many monuments of the Bronze and Iron Ages.  Among them, the Volkonsky dolmen is especially famous.  It is the only structure of this type in the world, completely carved in a sandstone rock.  The monument to the most ancient civilization that existed in these parts 5-6 millennia ago is located near the village of Volkonka, not far from the highway connecting Sochi with Novorossiysk. </li></ul><h2>  Zoos &amp; Aquariums </h2><p>  The most famous attractions of Sochi of this type are: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Adler Dolphinarium, located at ul.  Lenin, 219. </li><li>  Zoo complex "Laura" (Krasnaya Polyana).  In its spacious enclosures you can see lynxes, rare sika deer, miniature roe deer, jackals, wolves and foxes.  There, tourists can watch wild boars, alpine goats, chamois, as well as Kuban and Dagestan tours, bison, vultures, waterfowl, badgers, raccoon dogs, raccoons and marten. </li><li>  Adler Aquarium.  Tourists who visited this attraction in Sochi, as a rule, leave the most enthusiastic reviews about the underwater tunnel, a walk through which allows you to see fish and marine animals in all their glory and at close range. </li><li>  Adler Monkey Nursery (village of Vesyoloye, 177 Mira St.).  According to Darwin, these cute animals are our closest relatives.  Perhaps that is why the photos of Sochi's attractions, where they live in spacious enclosures, are of great interest to tourists.  In total, 3,500 primates live in the nursery.  Visitors can purchase sliced ‚Äã‚Äãfruit bags and feed the primates. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.themeparx.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi amusement park" class="if uuid-2395048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2395048.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical museums </h2><p>  Such attractions of the city of Sochi are little advertised.
