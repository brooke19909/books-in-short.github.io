So, many praise the food at Caesars Resort.  It is very diverse and tasty.  Most tourists appreciated the fact that local chefs are not addicted to adding pepper and other seasonings to dishes, which is a sin in many Turkish hotels.  In short, it‚Äôs impossible to stay hungry here.  But experienced tourists recommend, whenever possible, to come at the beginning of lunch or dinner, so that later you do not stand in line for food. </p><p>  The location of the hotel also made a good impression on vacationers - near streets with lots of shops, bars and nightclubs.  If you do not want to spend the evening in your room, there is where to go.  Pleased many and the hotel's own beach.  Here you can always find free sunbeds.  It is wonderful that the beach is sandy and always clean. </p>

    <p>  As for the shortcomings, the complaints of our compatriots were caused by not very high-quality cleaning of the rooms and a rare change of bed linen and towels.  And this despite the regularly abandoned tip. </p><p>  Also, some tourists from Russia and other CIS countries, especially those who had previously vacationed in Alanya and Antalya, were a little bewildered due to the fact that the hotel staff did not speak Russian.  However, in English it is quite possible to explain.  This is due to the fact that the main contingent of holidaymakers at the hotel is represented by local residents, while there are few Russian-speaking tourists here.  Therefore, when explaining with staff, certain difficulties may arise. </p><p>  The rest of the hotel made a favorable impression on vacationers.  Many of those who visited here would recommend the hotel to their friends and relatives. </p><h2>  The cost of living in a hotel </h2><p>  As for the prices for accommodation in the hotel we are considering, then on average a seven-day vacation will cost you 45-50 thousand rubles (per person).  The cost of the tour includes both hotel accommodation and flight from Moscow. </p>
