And Oludeniz twenty years ago was generally known only to individual tourists who are not afraid to spend the night in tents.  Since then, much has changed, and hotels have begun to be erected in large numbers in this paradise.  But pine forests and beaches with soft beige sand have not disappeared.  Moreover, Oludeniz was very timely declared by the Turkish government a conservation area.  There are only three dozen hotels.  And Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4 * is one of them.  In this article we describe all the advantages and possible disadvantages of this hotel.  We will also indicate the approximate cost of tours to <span>Oludeniz (Turkey).</span>  We built our story exclusively on the reviews of tourists.  And according to Bucking, the rating of this hotel is 8.3 points out of ten possible. </p>

    <h2>  Oludeniz: resort features </h2><p>  Already one location of the Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4 * hotel in the conservation area sets up the most complete immersion in the virgin and beautiful nature of this region.  But do not think that you, as Robinsons, have all the rest to be entertained only by seeing the sunsets and watching the life of turtles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Oludeniz is the capital of paragliding.  Near the resort rises Mount Babadag, which is famous for ascending air currents that are favorable for parachute gliding.  Every year, competitions and demonstrations by specialists in this sport are held in Oludeniz.  You can also take a chance and jump from the top of the cliff (1960 meters above sea level) with a parachute. </p><p>  The name "Oludeniz" literally translates as "Dead Sea".  But this name does not have the same meaning as a lake in Israel.  Oludeniz Bay is teeming with fish and shellfish.  It is just separated from the open sea by a sand spit.  Because of this, there are no storms in the bay, and there is always a "dead" calm.  For this, Oludeniz is very fond of divers.  After all, the water there is very clear.  Oludeniz satisfies the desires of both beach vacationers and those tourists who crave a holiday full of excursions to interesting places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2113476.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Location of the hotel Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4 * (Turkey) </h2><p>  Oludeniz stretched along its bay, like a silver edging of a blue horseshoe.  The main street of the resort runs along the second line.  It is on this avenue that the hotel we are describing is located.  Reviews claim that street noise in the walls of the hotel is not heard.  But guests can enjoy all the advantages of such an arrangement.  The main street is full of shops, bars, restaurants.  There are bus stops dolmushi right there.  Thus, you can quickly and seamlessly go to Fethiye (this city is located fifteen kilometers northwest of Oludeniz).  The nearest airport is Dalaman.  But independent tourists do not need to puzzle over how to get to the hotel from the air harbor.  After all, if you have booked a hotel room, the transfer from and to the airport is supposed to be free of charge.  Literally two hundred meters, that is, five minutes, you will need to go from the gate of the hotel to the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4 * (Turkey) Oludeniz" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2113484.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The hotel business in Oludeniz began to develop relatively recently.  Land in the village was cheap.  This allowed hoteliers to buy large plots.  But because the territory of local hotels - and Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4 * is no exception - rather big.  Inside, in Liberty 4 * everything is decorated as in a botanical garden.  The hotel consists of small white villas with wrought-iron balconies.  Between them curl paths among the lush Mediterranean greenery.  The territory is very shady, pleasant - this is noted by all the "summer" tourists.  From the restaurant with an outdoor terrace you can exit through the flowered corridor directly to the promenade.  The hotel has three swimming pools for adults.  They are interconnected and have different depths.  Reviews of those who do not know how to swim, thankfully note this.  For babies there is a separate small (0.40 m) tank with the warmest, like fresh milk, water.  There is another pool for adults - relaxation.  There is silence and calm, music does not rattle. </p><h2>  Where guests are accommodated </h2><p>  The Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4 * hotel has only two categories of rooms.  Moreover, they are not particularly different in area.  All rooms (reviews in this regard are solidary) are very spacious and bright.  But the standards are older.  Many tourists have found that they should have been repaired long ago.  But the furniture in them is new.  Superior - these are beautiful cozy bedrooms and spacious bathrooms.  Everything in them - and decoration, and furniture, and plumbing - shines with novelty.  Liberty is a whole hotel chain, and it holds the bar for service and rooms high. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for the choice of rooms, ask for a second or third floor in the villas.  These rooms are bright, spacious, with a beautiful and cozy balcony.  The ground floor is also good, but may be obscured by shrubs or trees growing near the window.  The view from the balconies is wonderful - the high ones approaching close to the shore of the mountain.  Parachutes soaring in the sky add fabulousness to the landscape. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2113479.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  And what about the rooms? </h2><p>  Standards are unlocked with a simple key, superior - with an electronic card.  The rooms of the Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4 * (Oludeniz) on the ground floor also have nice balconies, but these rooms are suitable for people who have difficulty walking up the stairs.  As expected in hotels with four stars, the bedrooms have air conditioning and TVs connected to a satellite dish. </p><p>  The standards are old-style appliances, the superior rooms are new.  In this case, the surcharge for upgrading the category (if this is done not at the travel agency, but directly at the hotel) is only about 475 rubles per day.  What will change for that kind of money?  Instead of a balcony, you will have a spacious loggia.  The plasma TV and split system will please you, and the bathroom has an isolated shower.  Spacious wardrobe with numerous coat hanger and drawers.  And the Superior Room itself is much more spacious than the standard.  But with regard to beds, bedding, a safe, cosmetics and towels, in the apartments of both categories these services are the same. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4 * (Turkey) Oludeniz" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2113477.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Unlike most Turkish hotels, the Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4 * hotel does not work on the All Inclusive system.  His concept is half board, or rather breakfast and dinner.  Tourists claim that such food was completely suitable for them.  Instead of the number of dishes offered, the restaurant offers their high quality.  From the reviews it becomes clear that the hotel is fed like in the top a la carte restaurant, awarded with Michelin stars. </p><p>  Of course, all meals are held in a free buffet mode.  But what dishes are served there!  Grilled meat, roasted lamb, whole turkey, seabass and other fish - all this could be tasted almost every night.  The names of dishes are duplicated in four languages, including Russian.  Breakfasts were more or less standard, although even here the chefs pleased with new dishes.  But the dinners were often thematic - Turkish, Jordanian, Balkan, etc. There were always at least two kinds of soups. </p><p>  The restaurant in the hotel has a lounge (air-conditioned) and a spacious terrace.  Outdoors, cooks grill, bake rolls and gozleme.  Reading reviews of Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4 *, you understand that desserts are simply amazing.  Moreover, there are not only Turkish sweets (halva, baklava, Turkish delight and others).  Tourists report in their reports about Viennese pastries melting in their mouths, French air desserts, pies and cakes.  From fruits they give both cherries and strawberries.  But drinks at dinner are paid separately.  But there is no need to carry a wallet with you to a restaurant.  Tourists report that the cost of drinking is recorded on the room and paid at the time of eviction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4 Oludeniz" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2113474.jpg"></div>

The beach closest to the hotel is called the Blue Lagoon.  He is pebble.  Tourists recommend sand lovers to go to the spit.  But entrance to the beach of the reserve is paid.  As, however, and sun loungers with umbrellas.  The hotel has an extensive swimming pool and one more - "relaxation" or "16+".  You cannot come to the last with your children, and music does not play there.  Beach towels are provided at the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Liberty Hotels Oludeniz 4 tours" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2113478.jpg"></div>
