Every year millions of tourists come here to get in touch with the culture of the East, as well as to see luxury that is not found anywhere else in the world.  Here you can also make a grandiose shopping.  In addition, the Emirates are one of the popular tourist destinations for the purpose of beach holidays, especially in winter.  Of course, most tourists go to Dubai, but there are other emirates where it is very comfortable and interesting, for example, <span>Sharjah.</span>  <span>Sharjah</span> Rayan Hotel 4 * is an excellent hotel that is suitable for those who want to get maximum comfort, but at a reasonable price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rayan hotel 4" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1459899.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Sharjah Anti-Dubai </h2><p>  This emirate is the opposite of the capital of world shopping.  This is a completely "dry" emirate with strict morals.  It is forbidden to drink alcohol, wearing frank outfits, cheeky behavior, etc. There are even non-smoking hotels, for example, Rayan <span>Hotel Sharjah 4 *.</span>  <span>Sharjah</span> is rich in its excursion program, and those who come here know about it and are ready to deny themselves some unhealthy pleasures for this.  Sharjah is the cultural capital of the country.  There are many unique museums, theaters and galleries, a visit to which will bring you a lot of positive emotions and will restore the picture of the past.  Beautiful and noteworthy are modern architecture, skyscrapers, a futuristic picture of the city, original fountains, and, of course, the eastern market - a world of wonders.  By the way, Sharjah borders on Dubai and, if you wish, you can reach the capital of shopping in a matter of minutes.  As for natural resources, this is the only emirate that is located on the shores of both the Persian and the Gulf of Oman, by the way, the latter belongs to the Indian Ocean basin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General overview of hotels Sharjah </h2><p>  Here, in comparison with Dubai, there are much fewer hotels.  Only 12 are coastal: 9 on the shores of the Persian Gulf and 3 on the Khaled Gulf.  All other hotels are urban, and the aforementioned Rayan Hotel Sharjah 4 * (UAE / Sharjah) applies to them.  However, tourists can always have a fruitful time on the beach of any of the hotels with access to the sea.  In addition, there are many inexpensive hotels in Sharjah that have pretty good service, especially considering the price-quality ratio.  Nevertheless, the most popular are still 4-star hotels such as Rayan Hotel 4 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rayan hotel sharjah 4" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1459897.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  The reception at the Ryan Hotel is open around the clock, which means that if your plane takes you to Sharjah at night, you won‚Äôt have to spend the night in the lobby waiting for the start of the working day.  A friendly receptionist will immediately check you out and escort you to your room.  The hotel also has a currency exchange office for Arab dirhams, which is very convenient if you want to go shopping on the next day upon arrival.  By the way, the hotel itself has a souvenir kiosk, although if you want to buy something substantial - equipment or some piece of clothing, such as a fur coat - then a giant shopping center is a 10-minute walk away. </p><p>  Returning to the list of services at the hotel, I would like to add that it is very convenient to organize various conferences, seminars, symposia, etc. For this, there is a modern business center and a conference hall, which, if necessary, turns into a banquet hall.  It is very convenient for organizing a gala dinner.  The hotel has a free car park, car rental and a tour desk where you can buy various sightseeing tours.  In addition, the hotel has dry cleaning and laundry services, ironing services, etc. </p><h2>  Service for children </h2><p>  Children under 2 years stay at the hotel for free.  For younger guests, the following services are offered: </p><ul><li>  Babysitting service.  If you want to have a pleasant evening, and taking children with you is undesirable, then you can always order a nanny.  If she is lucky, she will speak Russian, and then your child will be shrouded in not only care, but also have an interesting time. </li><li>  Cot.  If you indicate that you need a crib when making a tour or booking a room, the administration will make sure that you find it in your room immediately upon arrival.  If you have not made a reservation, then this can be done at checkout. </li><li>  Children's menu.  In the hotel‚Äôs kitchen, experienced chefs prepare meals taking into account the fact that they will be eaten by small guests.  In addition, parents can agree with the kitchen on the preparation of certain dishes. </li></ul><h2>  Hotel compliments </h2><p>  As in most UAE hotels, the administration of the Ryan Hotel has provided several compliments for guests.  And the first of them is intended for newlyweds who have arrived at the hotel to celebrate their honeymoon.  Upon arrival in the room they will be waiting there ... no, not a bottle of champagne, because in Sharjah - dry law, but a beautiful compact cake.  The same compliment is given to those on birthday. </p><h2>  Rayan Hotel Sharjah 4 *: reviews and ratings of tourists </h2><p>  If you read the comments of tourists who have already visited this hotel, it immediately becomes clear that this hotel is rather good than bad.  And it all starts with the staff.  Tourists say that all the hotel staff are very friendly.  They are very responsible for their duties, cleaning is carried out carefully, they never forget to refresh towels, change linen, etc. According to the stories of tourists, there are no minibars in the rooms, and there is only a refrigerator where you can store purchased drinks and food. </p><p>  There is dissatisfaction with the scarcity of television channels.  However, do not forget that you are in an Arab country, and Rayan Hotel 4 * is no exception.  The reviews also say that from the side of the neighboring mosque several times a day there are calls for the beginning of prayer (prayer).  However, this is a normal occurrence for this country, and this must be reconciled.  And tourists complain about the not very convenient location of the hotel.  We are talking about its remoteness from the coast.  Guests have to take a taxi to the beach.  Of course, this is not very convenient. </p>
