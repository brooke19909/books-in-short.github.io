    <p>  From time immemorial, the Pomeranian coast has attracted people interested in fishing and fur trade.  Those who constantly lived here and mastered all the wisdom of fishing or hunting were called Pomors.  In past times, special fishing spots were set up on the White Sea coast.  Here the Pomors lived with their families in season, and such a farm called Tonya was called.  Initially, the fishing sites did not belong to anyone and were distributed annually by random lot.  Over time, the most profitable tones began to be sold at auctions.  Traditionally, a fishing farm consists of a complex of residential and farm buildings necessary for fishing and storage of fish.  Tonya Tetrina was officially mentioned in documents from the 15th century, but there is reason to believe that it was founded back in the 12th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The work of life of A.

He once worked as the director of a museum in Umba.  Today, the main project of Alexander Borisovich is Tonya.  This unique ethnographic camp site has been carrying out its full-fledged activity since 2000.  Its owner has done significant work: almost all buildings are modern.  They were erected in those places where they stood earlier, in full accordance with Pomeranian traditions.  Alexander Borisovich is helped in everything by his son - Dmitry Komarov.  Tonya Tetrina is not the only museum of its kind in the area, but it differs significantly from all others.  This is not just a tourist attraction, but a real fishing fishing farm.  The hosts live here almost constantly and warmly welcome guests.  At the same time, the atmosphere and conditions in tone completely correspond to the first half of the 20th century.

There is a traditional fishing house, a summer house, a bathhouse, a barn and some other buildings.  When going on a trip, keep in mind that mobile phones in this area are practically not caught, there is no electricity here either.  But there are incredibly beautiful landscapes and hospitable hosts, as well as several interesting local attractions.  "Tonya Tetrina" is an ethnographic museum and tourist base.  At the same time, the complex can accommodate only nine guests.  Many tourists manage to negotiate with the owner about the campsite in the immediate vicinity of the farm.  Guests are offered traditional Pomeranian treats, fishing, bath treatments and even spa therapy.  And, of course, excursions and intimate conversations, because it is for their sake that most tourists come here.

Fish are caught here with the same nets as a hundred years ago.  To go to sea using traditional carbases.  In the barn are barrels of various sizes for the preservation and transportation of fish, as well as other no less entertaining devices for the main industry.  The hosts love to talk near a steaming samovar, over cups of fragrant herbal tea.  The local menu deserves special attention.

In the Middle Ages, before the advent of Pomors, Lopari lived on these lands.  "Tonya Tetrina" - a museum in which their traditional camp has been restored.  Here you can see the bizarre dugout houses, which are called the "vezha", the Kuwax tents and even the stone altar.  Lopari did not live at all like the Pomors.  The main responsibility of their men was hunting or fishing.  Women were left alone for a long time, while men went fishing.  Each housewife was able not only to follow the children and perform small household duties, but also to repair the house and do any hard ‚Äúmale‚Äù (according to modern women) work.  A chapel of Varlaam of Keretsky was built on the outskirts of Tony.  This shrine holds a map raised from the sunken Kursk submarine.  There is also a military museum on the farm.  The owners found in some places fragments of uniforms of soldiers and some other items related to the war.  In the forest, not far from Tony, you can see the wreckage of the A-20Zh Boston plane that crashed on June 5, 1944.

Do not be afraid to do something wrong, the owners will tell you everything.  Local stories and customs are interesting.  On the territory of Tony you can see a lot of karbase, on which for a long time no one goes to sea.  This is one of the local traditions: boats not suitable for sailing are not customary to destroy here.  They are left on the shore, where they calmly live their life.  Near the local chapel you can see a single cross.  And this is not someone‚Äôs grave, but another interesting tradition of Pomerania.  If something bad happened to the fishermen at sea, they vowed to put an end to this business upon arrival home.  In the event of a safe return to shore, such promises have always been fulfilled.  Alexander Borisovich says that if you move along the coast, you will notice many such votive crosses.  Fishermen who have honored such traditions have lived in this area for centuries.

This place is for lovers of eco-tourism, not demanding of domestic conditions.  Officially, A. B. Komarov calls his museum either a hotel or a camp site.  A fixed fee is taken from guests for accommodation here: 750-850 rubles per day.  But, even staying here, you should understand that you are visiting.  Not very fond of the host of casual travelers.  We advise you to start planning this unusual excursion with an acquaintance with Alexander Borisovich and coordination of the date of visit.  Remember, this is a private property, not a municipal museum.  Moreover, from time to time the farm remains unattended and does not accept guests.  During communication with the owner, you can find out where Tonya Tetrina is located, how to get there better.  Be prepared for the fact that the roads in this area have never been paved.  Most chances to successfully get to the farm with drivers of sports jeeps.  Tonya is located 29 kilometers from the village of Umba.  The nearest cities are Monchegorsk and Kandalaksha.  You cannot travel on such trips without a navigator.  The "Tonya Tetrina" coordinates have the following: 66 ¬∞ 33'59 "N; 34 ¬∞ 40'45" E.
