If you travel often and take your pet on trips, then, of course, it is better to invest in a good mobile home.  For example, the proposed plastic containers are best suited for travel.  But if your cat rarely gets out into the street to carry it, then the bag can be made independently.  So you will save your budget and design yourself.  How to sew a carrying bag for a <span>cat?</span>  <span>Patterns</span> and tips can be found in this article. </p><h2>  Choose material to carry </h2><p>  When choosing a fabric, it is worth starting from what time the pet house will use the house.  Ideally, it is better to make several carry bags for the cat.  Each season has its own travel apartments. </p><p>  For summer cat travel, take a closer look at the dense but breathing fabrics.  These include jeans, raincoat fabric and the like.  Make sure that the pet does not get bored on the trip.  To do this, make a window so that he admires the surroundings.  Any transparent fabric or mosquito net will do. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pet-travel-corner.myshopify.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="carrying bag for cat" class="if uuid-3165545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106515/3165545.jpg"></div><p>  For winter trips, warmer material is needed.  Pay attention to the fleece.  A mesh is also necessary, but care should be taken to ensure that it can be tightly closed and that it does not release heat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is not necessary to buy new material to make fabric carrying bags for cats.  It is quite possible to use an old jacket or bag.  Of these, the main parts for carrying should be made.  All you need to purchase for sewing: finishing fabric, zippers and insulation. </p><p>  The bottom of the carry must be hard.  It is necessary for the cat to feel comfortable during movement due to the stability of its position.  For the foundation, use the materials with the appropriate stiffness: plastic, plywood or fiberboard.  You can make the bottom cardboard.  However, it will not last long.  Under the weight of the cat, the cardboard will begin to bend, and eventually the carrying will become worthless. </p><h2>  What tools are useful for sewing? </h2><p>  To make a carrying bag for a cat with your own hands, you need to stock up on some materials: </p><div class="photo" data-original="jimenezphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a bag carrying a cat pattern" class="if uuid-3165581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106515/3165581.jpg"></div><ul><li>  First of all, these are fabrics.  Choose them based on the above criteria.  Remember that two types of fabrics are needed: the main and the lining. </li><li>  Foam for softness. </li><li>  Lightning.  There may be several.  The amount of zippers in the bag will depend on the selected pattern. </li><li>  A piece of plywood or plastic to strengthen the bottom. </li><li>  Sewing machine. </li><li>  Non-woven base for reinforcing seams. </li><li>  Mosquito net to protect the viewing window. </li><li>  Pens.  They can be taken from your old bag. </li></ul><h2>  Take measurements from a cat </h2><p>  This is the main and indispensable condition.  To create a comfortable do-it-yourself carrying bag for a cat, you need to know some sizes of your pet.  In particular, the length and height of the animal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The length of a cat is measured from the inside of the forepaw to the tail.  Growth - from the paw to the neck.  The length and height of the container are determined. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cat sizes" class="if uuid-3165704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106515/3165704.jpg"></div><p>  The dimensions of the carrying bag need to be made comfortable for the cat.  This means that the pet should be freely located in his house for travel: to be able to turn around, stand up to his full height.  To create comfortable conditions for the animal, multiply by 1.5 by the marked measurements (length and height of carrying). </p><h2>  Semicircular Carrying Bag </h2><p>  When constructing this pattern, only three details are used.  In a simplified version - two.  It consists of a pattern of the front and rear walls, the bottom and two sides. </p><p>  In order to sew a carry bag for a cat with your own hands, you will need the materials listed above.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  dense fabric that holds its shape, it is better to use several types (frame, lining and decorative); </li><li>  for bottom stiffness - plywood, cardboard or a sheet of plastic; </li><li>  foam rubber; </li><li>  lightning; </li><li>  a pen; </li><li>  mesh to protect the window. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself semicircular carry bag for cat" class="if uuid-3165571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106515/3165571.jpg"></div><p>  How to sew a semicircular shipping container? </p><ol><li>  Cut the main parts from the lining and frame fabric.  Insert soft material (foam) between the sides.  Make the bottom stiff: that is, put plastic or plywood between the lining and the frame fabric. </li><li>  The size of the sides should correspond to the measurement "cat height" plus five centimeters.  Otherwise, the animal will rest against the top of the bag. </li><li>  Sweep the details.  Sew the sides to the bottom. </li><li>  Decorate a window from a mosquito net. </li><li>  Take a zipper to the top of either of the two sides. </li><li>  Cut the front and back of the carrier from a single piece of cloth in the shape of a rectangle. </li><li>  Sew a pen in the middle. </li><li>  Sew the parts on a typewriter.  First stitch the part where the lightning is.  After the rest. </li></ol><h2>  Long Handle Bag </h2><p>  In the photo you see that the pattern of this carrying is simple and unpretentious.  Sewing it is very easy.  The photo shows a detailed diagram with the necessary notation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="cat carry bag" class="if uuid-3165611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106515/3165611.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Cut out a piece of paper web of the required part size. </li><li>  Overlay the pattern on the main and lining fabrics and foam.  Cut them with allowance for seams. </li><li>  Sew the sides on two types of fabric.  Put foam inside. </li><li>  Stitch the bottom of the bag to the sidewall (main fabric). </li><li>  Repeat with the same lined parts. </li><li>  Between the main and lining fabrics, lay foam rubber. </li><li>  Sweep the side seam. </li><li>  The zipper will be located on the top of the bag.  Sew it. </li><li>  Make pens as long as you see fit. </li><li>  Sew them. </li></ol><h2>  Bag with four zippers </h2><p>  The calculation is for a medium sized cat.  To make such a carry, you will need the following: </p><ul><li>  one square meter of the main and lining fabric, foam rubber (you can use synthetic winterizer instead); </li><li>  four lightnings; </li><li>  Velcro </li><li>  plywood measuring 20 by 40 cm; </li><li>  mesh - 45 by 20 cm; </li><li>  pens. </li></ul><p>  Let's consider step by step how to sew a DIY carrying bag for cats on a pattern.  She will be with a lot of lightning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="cat carrying bag with 4 zippers" class="if uuid-3165687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106515/3165687.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Enlarge to the desired size the pattern proposed in the photo.  For convenience, places for each lightning are marked on it with different colors. </li><li>  Fold the main and lining fabrics together. </li><li>  Prepare the parts for the paper pattern.  Cut them with allowance for seams in one centimeter. </li><li>  Open the back pocket. </li><li>  Do the same with foam rubber. </li><li>  Carefully cut a hole for the window on the fabrics. </li><li>  Make a window from a mosquito net.  The size is indicated on the photo.  Do not forget about seam allowances. </li><li>  Fix the bottom with hard material: plywood or cardboard. </li><li>  Sweep the parts and sew them on a typewriter. </li><li>  Now you need to do lightning.  The photo shows how they need to be sewn.  Zippers should be closed from carrying angles. </li><li>  Stitch the top valve of the container to the transverse part of the bag.  In the photo this place is marked with a cross.  Zippers 4 and 5 should fasten the valve. </li><li>  Sew on the handle on top.  The carrying bag is ready! </li></ol><h2>  Decorate a cat house for travel </h2><p>  After you finish making the bag for your pet, you can, imagining, decorate it.  For decoration using different elements.  Rhinestones, beads, threads, beads, applique, fur are suitable.  It all depends on your imagination and desire. </p><h2>  How to make a cat friends with a new bag?  Some tips </h2><p>  A cat is an animal with a wayward character.  And it may well turn out that the bag you made with love and care will be rejected by the pet.  The first option is to force the cat to climb into the carrier by force.  However, this will become a serious stress for the animal.  In addition, your hands will be scratched.  What to do in this case? </p><div class="photo" data-original="moodlepadoodle.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="carrying for cat" class="if uuid-3165549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106515/3165549.jpg"></div><p>  A cat should be "introduced" to a self-made carrying bag.  She should be associated with the pet with something positive and calm.  A cat needs a few days to get used to her moving house. </p><h2>  Which shape of bag do you prefer? </h2><p>  Above were presented several options for patterns of transfers.  Each of them is easy to sew.  When choosing a form, you should be guided by your preferences.  A self-sewn carrying bag for a cat on long handles will allow you to carry it on your shoulder.  Hands will remain free.  Carrying a semicircular shape is more suitable for cats of medium-sized breeds.  A large number of zippers on the bag will allow you to get a picky pet from any direction.  The choice ultimately is yours! </p>
