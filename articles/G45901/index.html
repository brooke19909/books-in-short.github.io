    <p>  It seemed that this time everything would work out, but it turned out differently.  The morning after the banquet dedicated to the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the October Revolution, in Stalin's apartment, apart from the owner, were Voroshilov, Molotov and a doctor.  The Secretary General‚Äôs wife was dead, she was lying, clutching her <span>brother‚Äôs gift</span> in her hand <span>, a</span> small pistol, from which one could only shoot herself.  Thus ended the biography of Nadezhda Alliluyeva, the second Stalinist wife and youngest daughter in the family of old Bolsheviks. </p><p>  Her character was very tough.  People who knew Hope closely were even divided in opinions about who he was firmer and more decisive - from a husband or wife.  Nadezhda's parents, party members Olga Evgenievna and Sergey Yakovlevich, were even against this marriage, knowing the features of their daughter's uncompromising disposition.  The twenty-two-year-old <span>age difference</span> did not bother them, but they strongly doubted that she could become a good wife for such a prominent party leader as Stalin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The biography of Nadezhda Alliluyeva showed that they were mistaken, she tried very hard to surround her husband with care, but it was also true that she did not make any fundamental concessions. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, this married couple was connected by <span>true love.</span>  The feeling of the young girl arose immediately, as soon as she saw Joseph who arrived from exile in 1917.  She was only 16, but she had no doubts, here he is her chosen one.  They got married a year later. </p><p>  The lack of traditional <span>family education,</span> which suffered the son of a drinking shoemaker, could not but affect the relationship between the spouses.  Stalin was rude, but this wife forgave him.  After the birth of his son Vasily in 1921, the husband insisted on house-building orders in the house, in his opinion, the woman should be limited to housekeeping and raising a child.  But not the one, as they say, attacked. </p>

    <p>  A career biography of Nadezhda Alliluyeva began in the Lenin Secretariat, where she worked after completing the typists' courses.  It seemed that this should be beneficial for the secretary in charge of personnel matters, because information about what was happening in the Kremlin could come to him directly from his wife.  But she stubbornly did not want to share it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During one of the "purges", Nadezhda Alliluyeva was among those expelled from the party.  Her biography could have been different if not for the intercession of Lenin himself. </p><p>  Then there was study.  Only the rector of the Promacademy knew that the student stubbornly ‚Äúnibbles the granite of science‚Äù in the educational institution he leads.  From conversations with people living in the usual conditions for Soviet people, she began to understand how monstrous the consequences of the policy pursued by her husband towards the peasantry and the whole people.  They argued a lot, and his wife called Stalin ‚Äúyou‚Äù, referring to him by his first name, which simply infuriated him. </p>

    <p>  Despite the huge ideological contradictions, the biography of Nadezhda Alliluyeva was replenished with a new fact, happy for every woman, she was again preparing for motherhood.  Daughter Svetlana was born in 1926. </p><p>  The leader‚Äôs wife‚Äôs health was poor.  She suffered from constant headaches, from which she had to be treated abroad.  The disease progressed, and many explained the temper of the character by this disease. </p><p>  Looking at the photo of Nadezhda Alliluyeva, it‚Äôs hard not to succumb to the charm of the kindness of the face and the softness of its lines.  Appearance can be deceiving, this woman did not give in to the most powerful tyrant on the planet, boldly telling him in the face what others, seemingly ‚Äúunbending Bolsheviks‚Äù were afraid to say.  Stalin, being an outstanding person, would not tolerate mediocrity next to him, but his strong-willed wife also constantly annoyed him.  He regarded her suicide as a personal betrayal.  The fact that he loved his wife is also beyond doubt. </p><p>  In the difficult years of the war, he came to her grave.  At night, so that, except for the chief of security, no one knows ... </p>
