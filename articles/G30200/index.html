    <h2>  Where is the village Dolzhanskaya? </h2><p>  Of course, travelers are primarily interested in questions about where this cozy town is located.  And in order to enjoy all the delights of a beach holiday, you will need to go to the Krasnodar Territory.  Dolzhanskaya stanitsa is located near the base of the <span>Long Spit</span> and is part of a nature reserve.  This is actually an amazing place.  Despite the fact that the population of the town is only 8 thousand people, it has something to offer its guests.  In particular, sandy and shell beaches, which stretch for 20 kilometers, will delight any, even the most fastidious traveler. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A brief history of the area </h2><p>  If you are looking for an interesting vacation destination with a rich history, then Yeisk is perfect for you.  Dolzhanskaya village was founded by the Don and Zaporozhye Cossacks.  After Russia occupied the territory of the Zaporizhzhya Sich in 1775, immigrants from there began to move to the lower reaches of the Kuban River.  Of course, by that time small Cossack settlements of Staroderevyankovsky and Staroshcherbinovsky smoking areas already existed here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="debtor private sector" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2369/464236.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Dolzhanskaya village was founded in 1848.  By the way, at first she was called Long - in honor of the scythe, which is located nearby.  The modern name stuck a little later.  By the way, settlements began to form below, closer to the sea, since it was easiest to dig wells here.  And along the spit were fishing artels. </p><p>  Today, the village of Dolzhanskaya <span>(Yeisk district)</span> is a popular resort place that is in demand among those who want to relax on the beach. </p><h2>  Description of climate and environmental conditions </h2><p>  This territory is characterized by a temperate continental climate, which is an undoubted advantage.  The air temperature here rarely exceeds 25 degrees.  Even in August, when it gets really hot, the air is softened by the soft sea breeze.  That is why it is easy to acclimatize here even to those people who are accustomed to a colder climate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another advantage is the <span>coast of the Sea of ​​Azov.</span>  Spacious beaches of pure soft sand or shells await you here.  Descent to the sea is convenient, and even children can have a great time in shallow water.  By the way, the water here heats up pretty quickly.  In addition, the reserve is covered with forests and parks - there is even a zone planted with pine trees, thanks to which even the air here has healing properties.  If you are interested in what the village of Dolzhanskaya is, recreation, reviews of tourists, then first of all you should know that this place is just perfect for wellness.  After all, near the coast there are many medical centers and resorts. </p>
