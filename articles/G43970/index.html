Ligurian coast of Italy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most popular tourist destinations in Russia and throughout the post-Soviet space is Italy.  The coast of this country is directed in different directions of the world, and each has its own unique features.  It is best to have a preliminary idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthem before starting the journey. </p><h2>  Italy.  Coast and Islands </h2><p>  In many ways, Italy is simply unique.  It is not so easy to find another country in the world in which the rich cultural and historical heritage and natural and recreational resources are equally well combined.  It is such a rare combination of different circumstances that Italy attracts people to.  Its coasts provide an opportunity for a wonderful <span>beach holiday,</span> and the architectural and historical heritage of cities and towns allows everyone who is on the Apennine Peninsula to personally join the cultural heritage of European civilization.  On the whole continent, it is Italy that holds the unconditional primacy over the total length of the coastline.  The coast of this country stretches from the Balkans in the east to <span>the French</span> Riviera <span>.</span>  Their total length exceeds seven and a half thousand kilometers.  This figure includes not only the coast of the <span>Apennine Peninsula.</span>  It also includes the coastline of such major islands as Sicily and Sardinia, as well as smaller archipelagos, on which a number of famous beach resorts are located. </p>

    <h2>  Direction selection </h2><p>  Often you hear the question of where the most beautiful beaches of Italy are.  This question is close to rhetorical, since everyone is free to put their understanding into the concept of what is good and beautiful.  But each section of the Italian coast has its own formed circle of fans who prefer these places to any others.  Holidays on the Italian coast varies in price parameters in a fairly wide range.  And it gives a chance to choose.  It is interesting to note that Italians themselves prefer to relax on the north coast of their country.  As a rule, they are very demanding customers, and they make rather high demands on the level of service.  Therefore, they choose the aristocratic resorts of the northern part of the province of Tuscany. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  In the east </h2><p>  The Adriatic coast of Italy is one of the most popular destinations for beach tourism throughout continental Europe.  Many people from different countries annually make their choice in favor of these places.  And it is quite justified.  Aristocratic beach resorts here have been around for centuries.  Their main advantage should be attributed to the wide sandy beaches, gently sloping under the water.  This creates a comfortable swimming area, even at a considerable distance from the coast.  This part of the coast, stretching from Raven to Pesaro, is often referred to as the <span>"Italian Riviera".</span> </p><p>  According to price parameters, the Adriatic coast of Italy is one of the most affordable.  Everyone can choose apartments here in accordance with the level of their capabilities - from luxurious luxury hotels to small family-type coastal hotels.  The resort villages of the coast do not have clear boundaries and smoothly move from one to another.  The most famous of them are Riccione, Rimini, Milano Marittima, Gabicce Mare and Pesaro. </p>

    <h2>  Ligurian coast of Italy </h2><p>  No less popular resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãpan-European importance is the Mediterranean coast, which is a direct continuation of the <span>French Riviera.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Often this stretch of coastline, administratively belonging to the province of Liguria, is called the "Italian Riviera".  The Ligurian coast of Italy is one of the most significant beach resorts in the world tourist hierarchy.  Geographic names such as San Remo, Allacio, Diano Marina are known to all.  They have long and habitually set the level of world standards in the field of beach holidays.  The coastal service infrastructure here is designed to receive a large number of vacationers and successfully copes with its task. </p><p>  The Ligurian coast of Italy is located at approximately the same latitude with the Adriatic.  This provides not only the similarity of climatic parameters between two neighboring regions of the Apennine Peninsula, but also ensures their equal transport accessibility for tourists.  And also puts these two areas in conditions of natural economic competition.  And this cannot but have a favorable effect on the level of service and prices. </p>

    <h2>  Tyrrhenian coast </h2><p>  Otherwise, this hundred-kilometer stretch of the coast of the southern Italian province of Calabria is called the Lazio Riviera.  This direction is not so actively visited by tourists, and in this circumstance considerable advantages already lie.  The price level on the Tyrrhenian coast is lower in relation to the Adriatic and Liguria, and living conditions can be chosen at your discretion.  The beach season on the <span>Tyrrhenian Sea coast</span> lasts from early May to November, and the weather during this period is sunny.  Those who happened to relax in southern Italy, respond to the time spent here extremely positively. </p><h2>  Amalfi Coast </h2><p>  One of the most unusual and expressive resort areas is located less than a hundred kilometers from Naples.  The Amalfi Coast is a very narrow strip of land, sandwiched between steep mountain slopes, descending ledges to the Gulf of Salerno.  These beaches are not so easy to reach, and perhaps that is why they are classified as aristocratic and bohemian.  The vivid visual expressiveness of these places over the centuries has attracted European poets and artists.  And to the number of trunk this tourist destination can not be attributed.  It is for those who consider themselves to be favorites.  It should be noted that at least minimal climbing skills are necessary for a safe living in these places.  The slopes are too steep here. </p>

    <h2>  Sicily </h2><p>  It is not difficult to guess what the inhabitants of Sicily answer the question of where the best coasts of Italy are located.  Where else if not on their favorite island?  And they are not so exaggerating.  <span>The beaches of Sicily are</span> really excellent in every way, and the season lasts until late autumn.  And this island is attractive not only for a beach holiday.  He attracted people for centuries.  Its rich culture and history has incorporated a lot of things from antiquity to the harsh realities depicted in the novels of <span>Mario Puzo</span> about the Sicilian mafia.  Sicily should be visited at least once in a lifetime. </p>

    <h2>  Sardinia </h2><p>  The most peripheral of all the coasts of Italy is the coastline of the island of Sardinia.  And in this remoteness lies a lot of positive aspects.  From the mainland you can get here both by air and by sea.  But this requires a certain amount of time and involves additional costs.  That is why the beaches of Sardinia are not so crowded even in the midst of the tourist season.  By the way, in environmental terms, Sardinia is one of the most prosperous Italian provinces, and this is noticeable on its beaches even with the naked eye.  Those who value cleanliness, peace and privacy more than anything else should include this remote coast in their travel itinerary.  The service and tourist infrastructure of the island are not inferior to the pan-European standards of beach holidays. </p>
