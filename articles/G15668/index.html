    <h2>  Ancient India and China </h2><p>  In Indian beliefs, a certain god corresponded to every known celestial body.  Like many ancient peoples, the Indians were not monotheists - the names of many outlandish and amazing entities that Indian mythology is so rich in have come down to us.  Saturn, like other <span>celestial bodies,</span> personified one of the oldest and most powerful Indian gods - Shan.  This disgusting ruler was portrayed riding a large black bird - a crow or a kite.  For the earth observer, one of the slowest celestial bodies is Saturn.  The mythology of India very opportunely conveyed the slowness and old age of Shani. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="indian mythology saturn" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1222015.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ancient Egypt </h2><p>  This celestial luminary and ancient Egyptian astronomers did not ignore.  <span>The Egyptian mythology of the</span> planet Saturn designates this celestial body as the hypostasis of the <span>god Horus.</span>  The Egyptians portrayed him as a creature with a human body and a bull or falcon head.  In Egypt, Horus was valued very highly - according to legend, it was he who ruled the kingdom of the living, was a brave and fair ruler. </p><h2>  Ancient Greece </h2><p>  In ancient Greece, the <span>planet Saturn was</span> identified with the titan Kronos.  According to legend, the ancient Kronos at the dawn of time ruled the world.  But the Moira predicted to him that one of the children of Kronos would overthrow him and become the supreme god himself.  Therefore, Kronos ate his offspring.  This continued until his wife decided to save her son, and brought to Kronos, instead of the baby Zeus, an oblong stone wrapped in swaddling clothes.  Kronos did not make out the substitution and swallowed the stone.  This was the beginning of its end.  Growing up Zeus overthrew Kronos and himself became the king of the gods.  Kronos forever lost power on Olympus. </p><p>  The ancient Greeks did not like Kronos, did not build monuments to him, considering him a murderer and a devourer of children.  But in ancient Rome, a completely different fate awaited him. </p><h2>  Ancient Rome </h2><p>  On the <span>Apennine Peninsula, an</span> ancient planet was first given the name Saturn known to us.  The mythology associated with it is in many ways similar to the ancient Greek version.  But the Romans treated Saturn with respect.  According to their beliefs, after the overthrow from Olympus, Saturn came to sunny Italian land and began to rule people along with Janus.  He taught people agriculture and gardening, showed how to grow grapes and get wine.  He was revered by the Romans as the ruler of the "Golden Age" in which there were no rich and poor, and all were healthy and young.  One of the names of the territory of the ancient Romans is Saturn. </p><p>  Mythology connects people and gods through various sacraments and ceremonies.  One of the most ancient Roman temples, built in 497 BC, was dedicated to this ancient deity.  According to custom, the state treasury was kept in the <span>temples of Saturn</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Saturn mythology" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1222022.jpg" width="538"></div>  In addition, Saturn was dedicated to a big holiday held in early December - Saturnalia.  At this time, the servants and gentlemen changed places, everyone exchanged gifts and had fun.  These festivities were seen as a memory of the golden age of abundance, equality and freedom.  The celebration lasted about a week.  Despite such a relaxed veneration of Saturn, on ancient Roman frescoes this titan was portrayed as an evil, harsh and rather greedy old man.  All his wealth was earned by hard work, and he was not going to share with others.  It was believed that people living at the expense of their own labor, be sure to be heard and rewarded by Saturn.
