It is difficult to imagine that 40 years ago, on the site of giant modern megalopolises, there was a desert and tent camps.  Today, the most fashionable hotels with excellent service tuned to the smallest detail, the most luxurious shopping and entertainment complexes, magnificent beaches, etc. are concentrated here. Vacation in the Emirates is a dream of many Russians.  After all, everyone wants to see with their own eyes the tallest building in the world or the largest "singing" fountain, relax in one of the seven-star hotels, etc. However, not everyone is in a hurry to fulfill their dream and go to one of the seven Arab Emirates, because they think that it will take too much money.  However, this is not entirely true, and if you wish, you can find a tour at very affordable prices.  Of course, in this case the hotel will not be seven-, but 5- or 4-star, but quite decent, with developed infrastructure and excellent service.  So, for example, if you go to the Oceanic Khorfakkan Resort &amp; SPA 4 * (Fujairah), which is also located on the Indian Ocean coast, you can relax in comfort and luxury for only 5000-10 000 rubles per day (per room). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oceanic khorfakkan resort spa" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/510761.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Which resort to choose? </h2><p>  The best resorts in the United Arab Emirates are Dubai, Ajman, Abu Dhabi, Fujairah and Sharjah.  However, if you are not accommodating a large sum or want to save money, then you should not go to the first three of the above, since the prices for accommodation and services there are quite high.  But in Sharjah or Fujairah, you can find budget accommodation.  The Oceanic Khorfakkan Resort &amp; SPA Fujairah immediately comes to mind.  Its name implies that it is located in the Fujairah region, but this is not true, since the Korfakkan beach is part of the Sharjah emirate.  Why does this confusion arise?  Perhaps because the city closest to the hotel, also with an international airport, is Fujairah.  From it to the hotel is only 20 km, while to Sharjah - more than 100 km.  But there is another reason.  Sharjah is the emirate in which the most strict morals and a complete ban on the use of alcoholic beverages, even beer, reign.  Apparently, it is because of this that travel agencies do not advertise the location of this hotel in Sharjah.  Indeed, in the emirate, the use of alcoholic beverages and the wearing of explicit swimwear in public places (with the exception of private beaches and hotel swimming pool areas) is prohibited.  The Oceanic Khorfakkan Resort &amp; SPA has its own beach area 50 meters from the building, so there are practically no problems with the dress code.  However, the issue of drinking remains open.  In a word, choosing <span>the Oceanic Resort</span> &amp; SPA Khorfakkan hotel, you get a wonderful vacation on one of the secluded beaches of the Indian Ocean at a very reasonable price, but you lose the opportunity to spend evenings with a glass of whiskey and even a glass of beer, comfortably sitting in a bar or pub. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oceanic khorfakkan resort spa 4 khorfakkan" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/510756.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here you can find many museums and carefully protected architectural monuments.  Fans of antiquity and history should definitely visit Sharjah.  In addition, this emirate has access to the snow-white shores of the Indian Ocean, and this, of course, is the biggest plus when choosing the hotel Oceanic Khorfakkan Resort &amp; SPA 4 * (Khorfakkan / Sharjah).  Another advantage of the hotel, and the resort as a whole, is the solitude from the hustle and bustle of the city.  It is almost always quiet and comfortable.  And the Korfakkan beach, on which the hotel is located, is perfectly equipped for families.  As you can see, Sharjah is the antipode of Dubai.  There is no bustling nightlife here, and, as noted above, alcohol is prohibited, there are no hookahs, public bathing suits are not allowed on public beaches, etc. Therefore, our advice to tourists who cannot imagine their vacation without all this is to not buy tour in Oceanic Khorfakkan Resort &amp; SPA 4 *, or in the evenings go for entertainment in nearby Fujairah.  Here manners are freer, and the attitude towards alcohol is more tolerant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oceanic khorfakkan resort spa 4" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/510760.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to get to the hotel "Oceanic"? </h2><p>  As you already understood, the closest to the Korfakkan beach, on which the Oceanic Khorfakkan Resort &amp; SPA 4 * hotel is located, is the international airport of Fujairah.  However, most flights from Russia to this city are irregular in nature, so before buying a tour, make inquiries about whether there is a necessary flight for this period?  Otherwise, you have to go to Dubai.  Between both Russian capitals and this Arab metropolis, planes of the UAE's main carrier, Emirates Airlines, fly daily.  But residents of Yekaterinburg, Samara, Kazan, Ufa, the Ministry of Water, <span>Volgograd, Rostov-on-Don</span> and Krasnodar can use the services of Flydubai airline.  If you bought a tour to the Oceanic Khorfakkan Resort &amp; SPA (UAE) and previously agreed on a transfer, then upon arrival you will be met at the airport and taken to the very door of the hotel in a comfortable car.  If you did not take care of this before arriving in the UAE, you can take a taxi (for $ 10-20 from Fujairah Airport and about $ 100 from Dubai).  In addition, you can pre-book a car ($ 30 / day), and he will be waiting for you at the airport.  To drive a car in the territory of the emirates, you will need <span>an international driving license.</span>  Do not forget to bring them with you. </p><h2>  Oceanic Khorfakkan Resort &amp; SPA 4 * (Khorfakkan): general description </h2><p>  This hotel consists of one seven-story building and several villas.  The complex was founded at the end of the last millennium, however, in 2009, reconstruction began there, which ended in 2013.  The hotel covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãfive thousand square meters.  Most rooms overlook the ocean, while the other overlook the mountains and the garden.  On the top floor of the hotel is a spa center.  It occupies an extensive bright room with many huge windows overlooking the ocean and mountains.  By the way, the glass elevator in the hotel also provides guests with the opportunity on the slopes and ascents to admire the expanses of the sea and to experience delight and reverence for the power of the endless Indian Ocean.  Near the hotel there is a promenade, where, of course, it is nice to stroll in the evenings, as well as many playgrounds for children's games. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oceanic khorfakkan resort spa 4 fujairah" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/510755.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Room Description and Service </h2><p>  All rooms at Oceanic Khorfakkan Resort &amp; SPA are modernly furnished and equipped with air conditioning, plasma televisions with satellite channels, audio and video equipment, refrigerator, safe, direct dial telephone, tea and coffee making facilities, a magnificent bathroom with all necessary toiletries and bath accessories.  Unfortunately, there are no balconies in the rooms, but there are huge <span>panoramic windows.</span>  Nevertheless, many tourists in their reviews consider this feature of the hotel to be its minuses.  It is no secret that many vacationers like to settle in the evenings on the balcony and watch the sunset and the surf.  But as pluses, they note a daily thorough cleaning and a change of bed linen and towels.  In addition, tourists can use the services of a concierge service and even hire a secretary.  For a surcharge, you can ask to bring breakfast, lunch or dinner to your room, as well as order dessert or snacks at any time of the day.  Since it is advisable not to use tap water here, tourists are given 2 bottles of purified water daily.  By placing in the room, tourists find a plate with exotic fruits, which pleasantly surprises them and creates a positive attitude.  Almost all travelers mention this in their reviews.  A trifle, but very pleasant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oceanic khorfakkan resort spa uae" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/510759.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Oceanic Khorfakkan Resort &amp; SPA has five separate food areas.  Guests are offered a choice of two <span>types of food:</span> BB (breakfast only) and HB (half board: breakfast and dinner).  The main restaurant is Al Murjan.  Here, in the mornings, a buffet is served, and in the evenings - dinner - by reservation from the menu, and to the sounds of the "live" blues.  At lunchtime, you can also make a paid order.  The second area is Oceanic Cafe.  It serves dessert as well as light snacks.  Pool bar "Amway" is the third food zone.  Its menu is quite varied.  At the lounge bar in the lobby, "Al Divan Thea Lounge," you can enjoy a refreshing drink.  There is another outdoor restaurant on site, serving all kinds of snacks, desserts and drinks.  Tourists who have already visited this hotel do not advise guests who choose the type of BB food to have dinner in the hotel restaurant, since it is very expensive, for example, from 200-300 dirhams, while in restaurants located on the waterfront, you can dine for only 80 dirhams. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and service at the hotel </h2><p>  Around the hotel is a beautiful garden.  In front of the original building of the Oceanic Khorfakkan Resort &amp; SPA (photo in the article) there is a huge swimming pool overlooking the ocean.  It is especially beautiful here at night, when the backlight turns on.  The hotel is designed for conferences, seminars and forums.  The participants are offered a beautifully equipped conference room Al Dana Ballroom for 1000 people, meeting rooms, a business center, free Internet both on the hotel premises and on the beach.  The complex has shops, including souvenir shops.  The lobby is incredibly large (1000 m2) and serves free coffee with dates.  For celebrations (anniversaries, weddings, etc.) there is a huge banquet hall, although hardly any of the Russian tourists dreams of a "dry" celebration.  For currency exchange, the hotel has an exchange service, and there is also an ATM.  For guests there is also dry cleaning, laundry, ironing, and shoe shine.  There is also a medical center, however, if necessary, the doctor can be called to the patient‚Äôs room.  You can rent a car at the hotel and book excursions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oceanic khorfakkan resort spa reviews" class="if" height="467" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/510758.jpg" width="477"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><p>  For fans of sports entertainment in the complex there are two floodlit tennis courts, billiards, a heated pool.  Three kilometers from the hotel are superb golf courses.  There is no animation program at the Oceanic Hotel, even for children.  For them, the hotel has a children's pool with slides, a playground and a games room.  For a fee, you can hire a babysitter for the evening or, for example, for a while if your mother wants to visit the SPA center.  As already noted, it is located on the top floor of the hotel.  There is also a health club.  The following services await tourists here: saunas (dry and aromatic with steam), a gym, an Ayurvedic center, massage, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oceanic khorfakkan resort spa photo" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/510753.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The beach at the Oceanic Hotel is simply gorgeous: snow-white sand, many comfortable sun loungers with umbrellas, towels and mattresses - all this is free.  In addition, twice a <span>day, tourists</span> bring plastic boxes with ice, towels, a bottle of water, Coca-Cola and fruit.  It is all also provided for free.  That's the service!  This is not even found in 5-star hotels in Cyprus, Turkey or Egypt.  It is no coincidence that vacationers in their reviews write only positive comments about the service in this Arabian hotel.  Numerous water activities, including diving and snorkeling, are also available at the beach. </p><h2>  Oceanic Khorfakkan Resort &amp; SPA: traveler reviews and ratings </h2><p>  As noted above, in the reviews of guests of the hotel "Oceanic", left on the tourism forums, there are practically no negative comments.  Tourists are satisfied with the cuisine, the level of service, and the internal structure of the hotel.  Young people are unhappy that the hotel does not have animation or other entertainment.  But do not forget that this is Sharjah - the most "closed" of the Arab Emirates.  In addition, some annoying lack of balconies and space for drying clothes.  In principle, the hotel has a laundry room, and the administration did not think that tourists can wash and dry their clothes on their own.  In everything else, everyone is happy with everything here.  So if you are not afraid of the dry law, you can safely go to the Oceanic Resort &amp; SPA (Khorfakkan) on the ocean coast. </p>
