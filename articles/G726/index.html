The Pinnacle Grand Jomtien Resort SPA was no exception.  Reviews note the following: </p><ul><li>  Near the hotel there is practically no entertainment and other infrastructure; </li><li>  the water in the main pool is too warm, which creates an unpleasant feeling of ‚Äústickiness‚Äù; </li><li>  inflated prices for transfer services; </li><li>  the quality of cleaning is poor; </li><li>  on the days of arrival of tourists from China, the hotel turns into a noisy hive (it is good that they rest only a couple of days, otherwise the vacation would be ruined); </li><li>  in the territory and in the rooms a huge number of mosquitoes; </li><li>  the beach is not cleaned well enough, which is why there are a lot of algae and garbage on the shore; </li><li>  too noisy air conditioning, which interferes with sleep (and if you turn it off, it will be very stuffy); </li><li>  the hotel restaurants have very expensive food (apparently, this is due to the distance from the city); </li><li>  there are a lot of insects in the rooms, there are even ticks (be sure to inform the staff so that they can carry out sanitization); </li><li>  weak internet signal in the bungalow (fortunately, the mobile network from local operators is not so expensive); </li><li>  locals walk dogs on the beach, and hotel staff do not interfere with this; </li><li>  uncomfortable hard pillows; </li><li>  in the early morning (around 6:00) on the beach, charging begins, which is accompanied by too loud music; </li><li>  next to the hotel there is a swamp that looks ugly and also gives off an unpleasant odor (fortunately, work is underway to drain it and ennoble it); </li><li>  you should not lose or throw away bottles from drinking water, because they are reusable (otherwise you will have to pay a fine); </li><li>  during cleaning, the maids absolutely do not pay attention to the balcony;  when the hotel is fully loaded, sunbeds on the beach will not be enough for everyone; </li><li>  it‚Äôs very inconvenient that the cleaning is done after dinner (at this time I want to relax in the room, but have to walk in order not to interfere with the maid); </li><li>  the pool closes at 19:00, so you won‚Äôt be able to enjoy night swimming; </li><li>  outsiders can enter the hotel territory (with the exception of the cottage zone, which is only accessible by card). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The most diverse opinions can be heard about the Pinnacle Grand Jomtien Resort SPA.  The rating and reviews allow us to conclude that the impression mainly depends on the purpose of the trip.  If you like noisy and vibrant entertainment, then you are definitely not here.  Nevertheless, if you are tired of the hustle and bustle of the city, this hotel will be the perfect place to relax.  The remoteness from the central part of the city will make your vacation calm and serene (however, get ready for overpriced prices for food and essentials).  True, during the days of arrival of Chinese tourists, you will not find in a quiet corner. </p><p>  The biggest advantage of the hotel is its luxurious garden.  It occupies almost the entire territory.  Spreading baobabs, tropical palm trees, flowering shrubs, walking paths, artificial ponds, benches - all this pleases the eye and promotes relaxation.  But on the beach, unfortunately, not everything is so joyful.  From afar, everything is very beautiful and civilized, but upon closer inspection, you will notice a huge amount of garbage that is just buried in the sand.  And one more "fat" minus is a lot of strangers in the territory. </p><p>  Despite all the shortcomings, a rather positive impression is formed about the rest in this hotel.  The main reason is a qualified and friendly staff that quickly responds to requests and comments of guests, and is also ready to meet any situation.  Of course, the cleaning is lame, but this is not so important, given all the positive aspects. </p>
