To open the device, you just need to click on one of the buttons.  The device has a huge number of different functions.  You can start the list with the camera, continue with communication modules (such as infrared and Bluetooth) and end with support for microSD memory cards. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2>

    <p>  Two color screens are built into the device at once.  One is internal, the second, respectively, is external.  The first has a good color rendering, the number of colors is 16 million.  Nevertheless, certain remarks are made with respect to this component.  For example, if the screen is dirty, it will be difficult to clean it.  One of the most important shortcomings, by the way, is the weak battery for the Nokia 6131 phone. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  There are no reasons to rejoice at the huge number of design designs.  In fact, the device is made in this regard quite modestly.  It has averaged dimensions.  The Nokia 6131 case also will not please anything, it is made in a standard form.  At least some original painting is missing.  If you give an unambiguous description of the phone, then this is a real <span>"workhorse".</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Let's look at the official website of the Finnish company, we will find the corresponding product using the navigation menu.  What will we see in the description of the phone?  Light and thin device, supposedly equipped with a soft coating.  This should have a positive effect on usability. </p><p>  Well, we will be objective.  Obviously, the language will not turn the device light or thin.  But also to call the device "shovel" also will not succeed.  Again, you can recall the average dimensions and dimensions.  But the words about a special soft coating quite have a certain basis.  But even here, the Finnish company acted in a proven way by performing a soft coating of soft-touch plastic.  In any case, at present, Nokia has a sufficient number of competitors who use similar material to cover their devices.  So there is nothing extraordinary in this. </p><p>  If we compare 6131, for example, with some models of Motorola, we will see that the quality of soft-touch plastic ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù clearly loses.  However, comparing models solely by this criterion is biased.  Because you must not forget about functionality.  What device do you think a person will choose: more comfortable to touch or more functional?  99.9 percent prefer the latter. </p><h2>  Color scheme </h2>

    <p>  Nokia 6131 phones are delivered to the corresponding market in rather boring colors.  Which, in principle, is consistent with the definition of ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù, which we ‚Äústuck‚Äù to the device almost at the very beginning of the article.  However, it should be noted that there is one very interesting saying.  As they say, there are no comrades for the taste and color.  And that is precisely why we cannot exclude the possibility that someone will like this design and color scheme. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, there are other color combinations, but the most popular, according to statistics, has become a strict combination (or tuxedo) of white and black.  But taking a closer look, we notice that white is actually not white, but silver.  There is no need to talk about charm, of course.  In this design, the device is more like the role of a device for a business person, a sort of James Bond. </p><h2>  Designer add-ons </h2>

    <p>  The manufacturers and specialists of the Finnish company no worse understood us that the lack of color schemes would adversely affect the sales of the device.  That is why they took action.  Somewhat asymmetric, not in the vein in which it should, but still.  So what exactly is it all about?  In order to answer this question, take a look at the bottom of the device. </p><p>  Here we will see the protruding element.  And it just can be called one of the distinguishing features of the 6131 model. </p><h2>  Buying Tips </h2>

    <p>  Before purchasing this unit, think carefully and weigh your decision three times.  Open the phone, twist in different planes.  Imagine working with him daily.  Is it convenient to hold it in your hands, use it?  You can read the forums and ask the owners of this device.  The Finnish manufacturer of mobile phones, of course, knows a lot about design.  However, the 6131 is clearly not the case. </p><h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  It, of course, is made on a mechanical basis, but there are some nuances.  So, in the center of absolutely each of the keys there is a slight elevation.  In general, the key sticks out in the center.  And on this peculiar elevation some designations are applied.  Such a move was made by the developers of the phone for a reason.  This adds convenience to use.  The rest should be noted not only the practicality of the keyboard model 6131, but also its beauty. </p><h2>  Controls: Left </h2><p>  On the left side we can see a paired volume control button (it is also simply called a rocker).  At first glance it‚Äôs hard to believe that this is a separate control.  This is indicated only by the arrows on the buttons.  And so the element would look just as part of the design. </p><h2>  Right side </h2><p>  On the right side is <span>the</span> camera <span>control button</span> .  If you press it briefly, photography will begin.  If you press the button for a long time, the video recording starts.  There is also a phone lock button.  This is a tradition, as they say.  Well, the Finnish company decided to diversify it by executing the lock button as a separate control. </p><h2>  Disclosure button </h2><p>  This element is perhaps the most interesting in the design of model 6131. ‚Äã‚ÄãWe can say that this is a kind of highlight of the device.  There will be no accidental disclosure, since it is quite tight.  At the same time, discomfort during use is also not observed.  The basis of the button (or rather, the automatic opening function) is a spring.  She cocked when closing the device.  That is why shutting down the phone will be more difficult than opening it. </p><p>  When the user presses the shutter release button, the spring is released by force and pushes the apparatus cover up.  Of course, the phone will not jump out of the user's hands, since the power of disclosure is not so great.  However, this technology has a downside.  More specifically, the phone is not fully disclosed at certain angles.  There is simply not enough energy to open the lid.  Therefore, you can finally fold it back with your hand.  But you can open the device in the old fashioned way, just because of this, you should not bother with a button and automatic opening. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  As we said earlier, the main drawback of the device is the battery for the Nokia 6131 Silver phone.  And then what is in the list of advantages of the device?  One of the points may well be called a phone display.  The Finns in this regard remained true to themselves.  The basis of the screen is a TFT-type matrix.  It supports 16 million colors.  The screen resolution is modest, compared with the devices of the present - only 320 by 240 pixels.  But we are talking specifically about the phone, not the smartphone, so everything is in order. </p><p>  A feature of the display of the 6131 is the lack of a protective glass.  The user with his gaze instantly rests against an ordinary liquid crystal matrix.  A similar method is used in the manufacture of laptops.  This feature has some practical help.  More specifically, the lack of a protective glass allows you to fully use the functionality of the screen and convey the saturation of the color gamut. </p>
