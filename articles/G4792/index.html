    <p>  <span>Geographical coordinates of the</span> city: latitude: 47 ° 05'03 N, longitude: 37 ° 33'12 E  To determine where Mariupol is located on the map, it is necessary to highlight the Donetsk region on the territory of Ukraine, where this large industrial center is located on the northern coast of Azov.  Mariupol Square - 166.0 km², with a suburban area - 244.0 km².  Under development is 106.0 km², green areas occupy more than 80 km².  In the area, the predominant type of soil is solonetzic chernozem.  A significant amount of groundwater causes frequent landslides. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is the climate of the area where Mariupol is located? </h2><p>  Proximity to the sea determined the weather conditions corresponding to the temperate continental zone.  The summer period is long and hot with frequent droughts and dry winds.  The winter season is quite short and mild with thaws and regular fogs.  The average rainfall per year is 420 mm. </p><p>  The agro-climatic conditions in the region are favorable for farmers growing heat-loving agricultural plants with a long vegetative period.  The predominant crops are sunflower and gourds.  In recent years, viticulture is a promising and rapidly developing area among farmers.  However, the insufficient water resources in this area served as an impetus for the use of fresh ponds and reservoirs for the needs of urban and suburban residents and to meet the needs of the industrial sector. </p><p>  The territory where the city of Mariupol is located belongs to the Priazovka recreation zone of the Donetsk region.  Frequent breezes on the Azov coast made this area attractive for tourists and those who want to get better.  The abundance of sunny days, clean sea air, saturated with ozone, sodium chloride, iodine and bromine, served as factors for the construction and development of the infrastructure of numerous sanatoriums, dispensaries and recreation centers.  Heat on the coast is easily tolerated thanks to natural ventilation with refreshing breezes. </p><p>  The advantage of this area is a long period for quality rest: from mid-May to early October.  During this period, the average daily temperature is 15 ° C.  Swimming in the sea is possible from June to September, when coastal waters warm up to an average of 25 ° C. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  History and Modernity </h2><p>  The city has been counting its years since 1778, when the district settlement Pavlovsk was founded in this area, renamed Mariupol in 1779. </p>

    <p>  Many historians and local historians provide evidence of earlier use of these lands by man.  In the area where Mariupol is located, archaeologists discovered the sites of ancient people, whose age is at least 10 thousand years.  In 1930, the Mariupol burial ground was excavated, dating from the late Neolithic.  In the territory of the modern city, mounds were built by tribes in the copper-bronze era, whose age is approximately 5 thousand years.  There are traces of the stay of Scythian-Sarmatian tribes.  A settlement of farmers existed here about 1 thousand years ago. </p><p>  XVI century  It was marked by the appearance on the northern coast of the Sea of ​​Azov, where Mariupol is located, the wintering of the glorious Zaporozhye Cossacks.  Their main industries were fishing and hunting.  In the XVIII century, the Zaporozhye Cossacks erected a guard post at the mouth of the Kalmius River, which served to protect against attacks by the Crimean Tatars. </p><p>  1780 - the year known for the resettlement of the Greeks of the Orthodox religion from the <span>Crimean Khanate</span> to the territory where Mariupol is located <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main occupations of the city's residents were leather dressing, candle making, fat melting, brick, tile and lime production.  The population used windmills and <span>watermills.</span>  Crafts were developed here, blacksmith and cooper craftsmanship reached their heyday.  The dominant activity was trade. </p><p>  The Crimean War caused considerable damage to Mariupol: port enemy structures and part of residential quarters were destroyed by the enemy, and it became impossible to deliver goods to neighboring countries and cities of the Azov coast. </p><p>  The impetus for the revival of the city, its industrial and cultural growth, was the construction in 1882 of the railway, which connected it with the Donbass and with the whole country. </p>
