    <p>  1. Through the Internet.  So the option “Bonus payment“ Thank you from Sberbank “MTS” is quite simply connected.  The Internet makes it possible to do this without leaving home.  You just need to be registered in your account.  We enter our page, find the “Thank you” tab, select “Activation”.  Next, fill out information about yourself, read the rules and agree with them.  A message will come with the code that needs to be confirmed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. At any ATM.  We insert the card into the ATM, enter the PIN code.  In the main menu, click on the item “Bonus Program”.  Following the prompts, indicate your number and wait for the message. </p><p>  3. Using a mobile bank.  To do this, we need a phone.  We send a short message to the number 900: the word THANKS and - after the space - the last four digits of your card number (note: we write the word in capital letters).  You will receive a code that we copy and send to the same number.  It is interesting that payment for MTS services with "Thank you from Sberbank" bonuses is carried out by any card. </p><p>  4. Through an online call.  You apply to a special unit of the organization, where each call and each appeal is processed.  We dial 900, press the send call key, wait for the operator’s response and notify him that we want to activate the service.  The assistant will tell you how long it will take to connect the service and from when you can use the service. </p><p>  Important information: unfortunately, it is impossible to top up your phone balance completely free of charge.  Bonuses can be paid only ninety-nine percent, and the rest is debited from the card account.  Example: we transfer a thousand rubles - ten rubles leaves in the form of a commission, and 990 is credited to the account. </p><p>  Now you know how to pay with MTS "Thanks from Sberbank" bonuses. </p><h2>  Some restrictions on using the program </h2>

    <p>  Checking the account balance is necessary: ​​payment by MTS "Sberbank" bonuses is made by MTS provided that there are at least five hundred bonuses.  So, there are several ways to check accumulative funds: Sberbank mobile application;  sending a message to a standard number (paid message);  using Sberbank online;  at the terminal or at the ATM. </p><p>  On the main page you can see three main tabs - these are “Games”, “Mobile Phone” and “Internet”.  We click on "Mobile Phone" and from the proposed operators we select our own.  Next, in the on-screen menu, you will be asked to replenish the balance in four ways (we are currently interested in “Paying with bonuses").  The next step will be to enter a phone number and determine the amount topped up, then click "Next."  After checking all the data, select "Pay".  We see a new window with spaces to fill in the data.  We enter them correctly, check and make payment.  Usually you don’t have to wait long, everything happens very quickly (this is a huge plus).  By the way, note that the replenishment process also takes a little time.  Then check the bonus account. </p><p>  Thus, the payment of bonuses “Thank you from Sberbank” MTS saves you time. </p><h2>  Frequently Asked Questions and Answers </h2><p>  1. What kind of services can I pay for with my bonuses from Sberbank? </p><p>  - Unfortunately or fortunately, you spend them only on the services of the MTS mobile company. </p><p>  2. I want to transfer points to the account quickly.  Is it possible? </p><p>  - All bonuses are credited immediately after you confirm the data you fill in, so you won’t have to wait. </p><p>  3. Please tell us in more detail where you receive a payment confirmation. </p><p>  - You enter personal data, fill out forms.  In one of the forms it will be necessary to fill out a field with an email address: all information about the payment and confirmation will be sent by email.  If for some reason you did not provide your email address, it will be impossible to receive a receipt. </p><p>  4. I changed my personal account - I want to get my accumulated bonuses.  Help! </p><p>  - Unfortunately, this is unrealistic to fulfill.  Since bonuses are only a discount on various services, you cannot transfer it to another account. </p><p>  5. Can I see the entire history of my payments? </p><p>  - Oh sure.  This information can be found in your account. </p><p>  6. What if suddenly I don’t have enough money to pay? </p><p>  - It's okay: the system will inform you about it.  It is worth noting that the bonuses will remain in place. </p><p>  7.
