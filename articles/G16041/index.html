However, not everyone knows that his bay was formed due to two capes: Tonkoy and Tolstoy.  They got their names because of external signs.  We‚Äôll talk about the popular recreation area, which is famous for Gelendzhik - Thin Cape.  Reviews about this place tourists leave very diverse.  But more on that later.  After all, few people know where this place is.  The thin cape in Gelendzhik is considered the most northern point of the bay.  It is located between the Blue Bay and the Cape Thick.  Those who wish to reach the central part of the city will have to cover a distance of 6 kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gelendzhik thin cape reviews" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/161363.jpg" width="431"></div>

    <p>  The first thing that attracts tourists here is fishing.  After all, Gelendzhik, the Thin Cape, is considered the meeting place for fishermen.  Responses of vacationers indicate that here you can carry out both classic fishing with a fishing rod or spinning from the pier, or achieve a big catch by going out on a private boat to the sea.  In addition, you can get skills in catching shrimp and mussels. </p><p>  In spring, various competitions are held here, the main of which is swimming.  The distance starts from Cape Thin and ends at Cape Thick.  If someone thinks that this is nothing, then it should be noted that the distance is 1800 meters, which is not so small. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thin cape gelendzhik" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/161364.jpg" width="500"></div>
