    <p>  If the property is completely destroyed, there is a full repayment of the loan.  Partial damage is also compensated.  The amount of coverage is set individually. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  The conditions for providing insurance vary by company.  Not all policies are accepted by the bank.  It is important that he is suitable for all requirements of the lender.  Sberbank works with firms that cover common risks.  This allows you to be sure of a refund. </p><p>  On the website of Sberbank you can find a list of companies issuing insurance.  In this case, the creditor should not impose insurers with whom a contract has been concluded.  The client can independently choose a company. </p><h2>  Features of the policy </h2><p>  Before mortgage insurance is issued at Sberbank, you need to pay attention to important aspects: </p><ul><li>  coverage amount - under the standard contract, an amount equivalent to the loan with overpayment is assumed; </li><li>  the size of the company's premium - Sberbank borrowers are offered a single rate - 0.15% of the housing price; </li><li>  policy validity period - usually equal to the term of the contract; </li><li>  prolongation conditions - some firms increase interest rates after 1 day; </li><li>  early repayment - usually insurance premiums are returned when the loan is paid prematurely.  If this information is not in the contract, then it may be difficult to return. </li></ul><p>  Insurance should be issued only if all the conditions for it are satisfied.  It is advisable to read the rules of several companies in order to choose the appropriate one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What is necessary? </h2><p>  What is required for apartment insurance for Sberbank?  Mortgages with this service are issued together.  To get a policy, you need a passport, a loan agreement, a certificate with an estimate of the value of the object.  The last 2 documents set the price of the policy.

    <p>  There is a choice of 2 options: </p><ul><li>  the policy is bought for the entire cost of the apartment; </li><li>  the policy is purchased for the amount to be given to the bank. </li></ul><p>  The average rate is 0.225% of the loan amount.  For example, real estate costs 3 million rubles, the first payment was 1 million rubles, and the policy is bought for the amount of the debt, then insurance for a mortgage in Sberbank will cost 4,500 rubles.  The cost of the document is about the same in other institutions. </p><p>  The policy is valid for 1 year.  When it expires, it is possible to use the extension or execution of a new document in another company.  It is acquired by making an annual contribution.  There are no benefits in insurance. </p><h2>  Return </h2><p>  The borrower has the right to refund payments made for a time exceeding the term of the mortgage.  There are some subtleties in this question: </p><ul><li>  if the policy is valid for 11 months or more, the whole amount is returned; </li><li>  if the loan is repaid, and the policy is valid for another half of the term, the client receives half the insurance premium; </li><li>  if most of the policy has passed, then returning funds does not make sense. </li></ul><p>  How to return Sberbank mortgage insurance?  It is necessary to submit an application, attaching to it a bank statement on the absence of debt.  Refunds can also be issued for life and health insurance. </p><h2>  Life and health insurance </h2><p>  <span>Life insurance</span> for a mortgage in Sberbank is not a mandatory requirement.  But usually employees insist on the design of services to reduce the risks of non-payment of debt.  If you do not take out insurance, then the rate rises by 1%. </p>

    <p>  Life insurance for a mortgage in Sberbank involves the imposition of an additional financial burden, more than compulsory property insurance.  But because of its advantages, the service is considered to be in demand. </p><h2>  What is life and health insurance for? </h2><p>  The policy guarantees reimbursement to the bank in case of loss of health and death.  Since a mortgage is issued for a long period, Sberbank protects itself from such risks.  For a client, the policy is considered a guarantee that in accidents his loan obligations will not be transferred to guarantors and relatives, as the debt is repaid by the insurance company. </p><p>  If the borrower is temporarily incapacitated, his loan is also paid by the company.  If you refuse to make such a service, the rate increases.  The list of risks may include: </p><ul><li>  death; </li><li>  disability; </li><li>  job loss. </li></ul><p>  Sberbank Insurance operates under the following programs: </p><ul><li>  standard program - 1.99%; </li><li>  health and job loss - 2.9%; </li><li>  independent choice of parameters - 2.5%. </li></ul><h2>  Title insurance </h2><p>  Sberbank offers <span>title insurance,</span> which includes property rights insurance.  If a client paying a mortgage for a home loses the rights to it, then the insurer assumes all material obligations to pay the debt. </p>

    <p>  To apply for a mortgage, you need a passport, application form, ownership, certificate of registration of law.  You also need an expert opinion on the assessment and value of the object, cadastral and technical passport of the object.  Along with the registration of a mortgage, an insurance contract is drawn up.  But if home insurance is mandatory, then life and health are chosen at the request of the borrower.  With these services, material costs increase.  Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider whether there will be material opportunities to pay for such services. </p>
