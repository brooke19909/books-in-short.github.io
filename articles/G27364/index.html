    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Dzhanhot is a small farm located near Gelendzhik, at the mouth of the Hotetsay River.  Administratively, it is part of the Divnomorsk okrug.  Usually only 300 people live there.  However, during the tourist season, the population increases tenfold.  Every year more and more people come there.  Tourists are attracted to these places by stories about the beauties of local nature, heard from friends and acquaintances, as well as reviews of those who have already managed to visit these places. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The village of Dzhanhot was founded by a prominent Russian economist and historian F. Shcherbin.  At the end of the year before last, he bought 110 acres of land in these places and built a house.  Guests from both capitals began to come to him often.  Over time, they acquired plots there and began to build cottages.  As a result, a resort village was formed over several years. </p><p>  Shcherbin also became the founder of <span>Gelendzhik winemaking.</span>  For several decades, he conducted experiments with local fruits and plants, trying to get new varieties with the best taste.  To this day, in the Dzhanhot (Krasnodar Territory), the historian‚Äôs house has been preserved, in which 8 families currently live. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, writer V. Korolenko lived in the village on short visits, who settled his sick brother in one of the dachas.  At the same time, Greek and Armenian families began to come there, fleeing the massacre of the Christian population, organized by the then Turkish government. </p>

    <h2>  Natural features </h2><p>  Khanhot farm <span>in the Krasnodar Territory</span> is an oasis of environmental well-being.  In its vicinity, nature has been preserved in its virgin state.  There are no industrial enterprises, and the air is clean of exhaust gases.  This unusual situation is due to the fact that the territory of Janhot began to be populated only 110-120 years ago.  Until that time, there were only a few manors with a population of less than 100 people, so there was no one to damage the local nature. </p><p>  The riches of Dzhanhot are forests, where <span>pines of Pitsunda</span> and Crimean species grow <span>nearby</span> .  This combination is unique and is not found anywhere else in the world. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the ecosystem of the village of Dzhanhot of the Krasnodar Territory is currently under threat due to the strong influx of tourists and industrialists.  In addition, it is highly likely that in the coming years he may lose his unique appearance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Who needs a vacation in Janhot </h2><p>  From year to year, those who come to these places come who want to hide for a while from civilization and spend their holidays in harmony and unity with nature.  In Janhot, both families with children and people of advanced age will enjoy it. </p><p>  Recently, young people began to come there, who are looking for budget vacation options and believe that the main thing during the holidays is the clean sea and a convenient beach, rather than discos and bars that you can visit at home. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Janhot cannot offer vacationers such beach activities as a banana ride or parachute flying.  However, tourists will not have to get bored there either.  In particular, you can take a walk on ... BTR.  What is not extreme? </p><p>  Such a unique tour will allow you to see waterfalls, dolmens and enjoy the views of the Caucasus Range.  In addition, a walk program includes swimming in mountain rivers and tasting great local wines. </p><p>  And of course, the main entertainment of Janhot is the local beach, which is notable for its cleanliness, as well as the lack of merchants and crowds. </p><p>  In addition, tourists will have the opportunity to dive, since the coast of the resort has all the opportunities for this.  In particular, there are several diving schools where they can prepare tourists for underwater travel in the shortest possible time. </p><p>  Extreme sports enthusiasts can also try snorkelling.  This dangerous entertainment consists in short diving with a snorkel, mask and fins.  If you wish, you can also rent a camera and carry out underwater shooting. </p><p>  Vacationers will also be able to hike in Praskoveevka.  It will allow you to enjoy the local flavor and arrange a tourist photo shoot on the background of the Caucasus Mountains. </p><p>  Never made horse riding?  Then, having reached Praskoveevka, do not miss the opportunity to take a few riding lessons! </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Tourists coming to Janhot can see the famous Sail Rock.  It is located 5 km from the farm, and you can get to it just on foot.  Young people who are fond of mountaineering, try to necessarily conquer this vertical peak.  However, remember that this is insanely dangerous. </p><p>  Just 1 km from Dzhanhot is the Blue Abyss.  There you can see black sheer cliffs reflected in the sea, which creates the effect of an abyss.  far at the foot of the rocks you can see the beach, nicknamed Black because of the special small pebbles. </p><p>  Another attraction of Janhot is the House of V. Korolenko.  Next to him, you can see 2 Lebanese cedars planted with his hand, which are more than 100 years old. </p>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Those who have already visited the Big Gelendzhik resort, as a rule, retain the best impressions of such a trip.  In particular, vacationer reviews about Janhot are rarely negative.  Most positive comments are made on the local nature and beaches.  In addition, tourists note low prices in hotels.  As for the shortcomings noticed by vacationers, they usually relate to the lack of entertainment. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to Dzhanhot (Krasnodar Territory) in various ways.  For example, by bus from the Gelendzhik bus station - from here you can get a direct flight to the resort in 40-50 minutes. </p><p>  A faster and more comfortable option is a taxi ride.  However, it will be expensive, especially if you use the services of private traders. </p><p>  Those who like sea travel can be advised to board a pleasure boat departing from the seaport of Gelendzhik.  Such a walk will allow you to enjoy the views of the coast. </p><p>  Riding a bike is also an interesting option to get to Janhot.  However, it will give pleasure only if you are confident in your abilities and have the proper sports training. </p>
