    <h2>  Relevance of the issue </h2><p>  When creating products, materials, semi-finished products and raw materials are converted into finished products.  In this case, three components are used: implements of production, subject and labor.  With the help of the first, a person changes the shape of an object, its physico-chemical characteristics, appearance, location.  Production tools are used to control the manufacturing process of the product, in the implementation of other measures.  Together, all operations form the activities of the enterprise.  Thus, the content of the labor process includes personnel operations necessary for a reasonable change in the subject.  Moreover, the effectiveness of operations depends on various factors.  Among them are the nature of the production process, the specifics of the task, and the degree of human participation in its implementation. </p><h2>  Product manufacturing features </h2><p>  In the course of working activities, materials, raw materials and semi-finished products are transformed into products ready for use / consumption.  This is carried out with the participation or under the control of a person.  In practice, the following classification of production processes is adopted: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The main ones.  Their purpose is to manufacture goods for the market. </li><li>  Auxiliary.  These, for example, include transport, repair operations.  They ensure the normal operation of the enterprise. </li></ol><p>  The classification of <span>production processes</span> is of substantial practical importance.  Any of them can be viewed from two sides.  First of all, production processes are complexes of changes that occur with objects.  At the same time, they are a set of actions of employees aimed at obtaining a finished product.  In the first case, we are talking about technological, and in the second - about the labor process. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="classification of production processes" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1413250.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Categories of Operations </h2><p>  Technological processes are classified by: </p><ul><li>  degree of continuity; </li><li>  source of energy; </li><li>  method of exposure to the subject. </li></ul><p>  Depending on the energy source, active and passive operations are distinguished.  The latter are considered natural and do not require additional energy, converted by man to influence the object.  An example of a passive operation is the cooling of a metal under normal conditions.  Active processes occur with the direct impact of either a person on an object or a <span>means of labor</span> set in motion by energy transformed by a worker.  Technological operations can be continuous or discrete.  In the first case, the <span>technological process</span> does not stop during the period of loading materials, issuing products, during control measures.  Accordingly, the second category is characterized by the presence of breaks.  Depending on the method of influencing the object and the type of equipment used, the technological process can be hardware or mechanical.  The latter is carried out by the employee manually or with the help of machines, machine tools, etc. In this process, the subject is subjected to mechanical stress.  As a result of it, there is a change in the shape, position, size of the object.  Hardware processes involve exposure to thermal energy, chemical reactions, biological elements, or radiation.  Such operations take place in chambers, furnaces, vessels, bathtubs, etc. As a result, a product is obtained that may differ from the starting material by its chemical properties, state of aggregation, and structure.  Hardware operations are most often used in the food, metallurgical, microbiological, and chemical industries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Labor Process Research </h2><p>  All technological operations in enterprises are carried out with the participation of man.  In industrial conditions, the labor process is the work of personnel aimed at converting certain resources into specific products.  Its key features are: </p><ul><li>  energy and time costs; </li><li>  the usefulness of the results; </li><li>  income; </li><li>  degree of satisfaction with the performance of functions. </li></ul><p>  The essence of the activity is determined by the totality of operations and staff movements that are required to complete all stages.  The organization of labor processes should provide: </p><ul><li>  receiving tasks; </li><li>  informational and material training; </li><li>  direct participation in the conversion of raw materials into finished products, according to technology; </li><li>  delivery of the result. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Specificity </h2><p>  The labor process and its rationalization are ensured by the methods used to perform certain operations that contribute to reducing physical activity, creating convenience in carrying out activities, and eliminating unnecessary and repeated actions.  The applied methods also facilitate control and accounting measures.  The classification, content and composition of labor processes are closely related to the technology used in the enterprise.  In this regard, the effectiveness of the activity will depend not only on its immediate executor.  Equally important is the design of the equipment used, <span>technological equipment, the</span> organization of labor processes and jobs.  These elements play an increasing role in modern conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Features of work </h2><p>  The labor process, the principles of its organization are considered one of the fundamental elements of any enterprise.  In the context of automation and mechanization, the requirements for the quality of activities of personnel performing maintenance of equipment are significantly increased.  This is due to the fact that the efficiency of the enterprise will depend on this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="organization of labor processes and jobs" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1413252.jpg" width="548"></div>

    <h2>  Classification of labor processes: scheme, table </h2><p>  The structure of the activity depends on the assignment, the technology used and the logistics.  To study its diversity, a classification of labor processes is carried out.  Different types of activities are grouped according to specific characteristics.  Depending on the objectives of the study, certain criteria are selected that characterize the labor process and its organization.  The classification of staff activities can be carried out by: </p><ul><li>  features of the raw materials used in chemical, metal and woodworking operations, and others; </li><li>  executable functions (classification of labor processes in this case provides for the division into basic, servicing, management operations); </li><li>  type of production: it can be mass, serial, individual (single); </li><li>  the nature and content of operations: they can be processing, thermal, mining, physico-chemical and so on; </li><li>  the form of organization of labor activity: it can be individual, subject-closed, collective; </li><li>  frequency and duration. </li></ul><p>  The basic information is presented in the table below. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="207"><p>  <strong>Signs</strong> </p></td><td valign="top" width="272"><p>  <strong>Categories</strong> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="207"><p>  Product and Item Character </p></td><td valign="top" width="272"><ul><li>  material energy </li><li>  informational </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="207"><p>  Functions Performed </p></td><td valign="top" width="272"><ul><li>  creation of products in the main workshops </li><li>  production output at auxiliary sites </li><li>  <span>maintenance of workplaces</span> and equipment </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="207"><p>  Personnel involvement in subject matter exposure </p></td><td valign="top" width="272"><ul><li>  manual processes </li><li>  machine-manual </li><li>  fully mechanized </li><li>  automated </li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Depending on the purpose of the products, the activities of personnel are divided into auxiliary and main.  Such a classification of labor processes influences the choice of standards for employees, the methods of their establishment.  It also affects the choice of methods for creating the necessary conditions for people to carry out their professional activities.  The classification of labor processes is also carried out depending on the degree of staff participation in them.  Manual operations are performed manually or using non-mechanized tools.  For example, it can be staining a workpiece with a brush.  Manual mechanized operations are performed using more complex tools.  For example, it can be drilling holes with an electric drill.  Machine-manual operations are performed by mechanisms involving the employee.  In this case, the specialist makes certain efforts to control the elements of the equipment.  Machine operations include processes that are performed on machines and other units.  In these cases, the employee‚Äôs participation is limited solely to equipment management.  Automated processes are called processes that are performed by machines, the movement of the working bodies of which, as well as control is carried out according to a given program using computers.  The tasks of the employee are reduced to monitoring the progress of operations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="classification content and composition of labor processes" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1413254.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Product and Item Character </h2><p>  There is a classification of labor processes, in which operations are divided into information and material energy.  In the latter case, the product and the subject of professional activity is a substance (parts, materials, raw materials) or energy (hydraulic, thermal, electric).  Accordingly, such labor processes are characteristic of workers.  The product and item in the first case is information.  It can be design, technological, economic.  Information operations are carried out by employees (specialists). </p><h2>  The specifics of creating conditions for activities </h2><p>  One of the key components of the organization of labor in the company is the improvement of planning and the improvement of the maintenance of existing jobs.  This is necessary to create the conditions for high-quality and high-performance operations at the lowest possible physical cost.  Jobs - the primary link in the structure of the enterprise.  Each of them is a zone of application of physical and mental efforts of a person.  The workplace should be equipped with the necessary tools used to accomplish the tasks one or more subjects.  It determines the conditions for the implementation of activities (difficult, normal, harmful), modes of rest and employment, the nature of operations (monotonous, diverse, and so on). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="labor process principles of its organization" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1413255.jpg" width="454"></div>

    <h2>  Key areas of administration </h2><p>  The workplace acts as one of the most important categories studied in the framework of control theory.  This is due to the fact that the area in which a person performs his professional tasks has a direct impact on the effectiveness of the activity.  In turn, the effectiveness of personnel management and the enterprise as a whole depends on it.  In the process of organizing workplaces, the following tasks are solved: </p><ul><li>  optimal use of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe enterprise; </li><li>  rational location within a limited area of ‚Äã‚Äãall elements of the workplace; </li><li>  creating convenient and comfortable conditions for employees; </li><li>  prevention of negative impact on people of internal and external factors; </li><li>  uninterrupted high-quality service of each workplace, ensuring the rhythmic, continuous and synchronous functioning of the sites. </li></ul><h2>  Administration Goal </h2><p>  At workplaces, a combination of the components of the labor process takes place: means, subject and direct efforts of employees.  The main objective of the administration is the functional placement of elements to reduce temporary and physical losses.  Particular attention is paid to ensuring safety when equipping workplaces.  Competent management is characterized by an adequate rationale for rationing professional activities.  This is achieved if standards are developed: </p><ul><li>  experienced professionals; </li><li>  according to the recommended method; </li><li>  using labor standards. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Time analysis </h2><p>  It is necessary to establish adequate standards.  The analysis is carried out in accordance with the classification of time spent by employees.  The criteria may include: </p><ul><li>  direct physical efforts of staff; </li><li>  subject of activity; </li><li>  equipment. </li></ul><p>  Working time is a measure of labor costs. </p><h2>  The importance of site maintenance and provision </h2><p>  In the workplace, timely delivery of raw materials, tools and materials, repair and adjustment of equipment should be established.  An integrated system for providing plots is created and implemented at enterprises.  It provides: </p><ul><li>  preparation and delivery of planned tasks to personnel and distribution of operations; </li><li>  tooling; </li><li>  equipment setup; </li><li>  energy supply, overhaul maintenance of devices and installations; </li><li>  current repair and maintenance of equipment; </li><li>  quality control of tools and objects of labor; </li><li>  acceptance of finished products to warehouses. </li></ul><h2>  Certification </h2><p>  It allows you to find jobs that do not meet modern requirements, which use low-skilled hard, manual labor or tasks are carried out in dangerous conditions for the employee.  All deficiencies identified during the certification should be eliminated as soon as possible.  Bringing jobs in line with modern requirements is the responsibility of managers.  Implementation allows to improve and optimize the activities of enterprises. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Labor processes and their classification are the basis of any enterprise.  In modern conditions, with the ever-growing role of automation, the requirements for quality and speed of operations are growing.  In the framework of management activities, models for optimizing the workspace are developed and implemented, morally and physically worn out equipment is eliminated. </p>
