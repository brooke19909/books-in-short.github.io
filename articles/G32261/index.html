    <h2>  Technical features of units </h2><p>  <span>The starting and charging device for a car</span> differs from charging devices with high-current-carrying elements, which are capable of ensuring reliable and durable operation of the device.  Early models of such mechanisms contained a transformer that negatively affected the electronics of the car.  This forced users to disconnect the circuit supplying the on-board electronics before starting.  Modern devices are built on inverters, which replaced the transformers (now there is no need to turn off the on-board systems), respectively, the dimensions of such launchers and chargers have also been reduced.  Devices are also available where microprocessors are used instead of inverters, which optimize the charging process, monitor battery status and ensure battery safety. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="start charger for car" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/321775.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pre-chargers protect on-board systems from polarity reversal, overheating, short circuit.  In addition, the <span>battery recovery</span> mode and the shutdown of the mechanism when fully charged are also protective functions of the device in question.  All this helps to simplify operation and increase vehicle safety. </p><h2>  How to choose a launcher and charger? </h2><p>  This question is asked by many novice motorists.  Let's see what you need to focus on when choosing such a device. </p><p>  First, you need to decide if you need an apparatus to start the power unit or a simple charger?  After all, the price of launchers is much higher.  If you have already decided, then consider how to choose a launcher and charger.  The next step is to determine the capacity of the <span>battery</span> that the device will have to charge.  The device must have a workload greater than this parameter.  For example, if the battery capacity is 170 Ah, then the selected device should have a rated current of 18 A and above.  Most passenger cars are equipped with batteries with capacities from 55 to 70 A. However, when choosing a starter-charging device, one must take into account that such a device can serve its owner for more than a dozen years, therefore it is recommended to choose the power of the device with a margin, in case the car owner changes the car on an SUV or a minibus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="start charger for battery" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/321778.jpg" width="600"></div>  The batteries of such vehicles are already characterized by a larger capacity.  Accordingly, if the charge is bought back-to-back, they will have to change it.

      <p></p>
    <p>  Next, you need to determine the type of device: which is better to purchase - with autonomous power or network?  ‚ÄúAutonomos‚Äù are able to work even in the field, as they are equipped with a powerful battery, but the mains supply voltage is 220 V. Also, when choosing starters, you need to know that they are available for both 12-volt and 24-volt batteries. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We examined how to choose a launcher-charger, but it is worth remembering that these devices work with large rated currents (more than 100 A), which is quite dangerous.  When using such an apparatus, it is necessary to observe safety rules and adhere to the manufacturer's recommendations.  This will allow you to successfully operate the device and help to avoid injuries and breakdowns of automotive electronics. </p>
