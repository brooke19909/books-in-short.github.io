    <h2>  A Brief History of Probusinessbank </h2><p>  Probusinessbank is one of the largest Russian banks in the Russian Federation, part of the Life Financial Group.  The time of its creation falls on not so distant 1993.  Since its opening, this financial institution has specialized exclusively in servicing and lending to private and corporate clients. </p><h2>  Probusinessbank: revoked the license, where to pay the loan? </h2><p>  Unexpectedly for all its clients, Probusinessbank announced protracted financial problems and possible bankruptcy.  In August 2015, this information was confirmed by representatives of the Central Bank of Russia.  At the same time, persons authorized by the regulator arrived at the bank building, where they conducted a global audit, as a result of which the organization lost its license. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The official statement of the regulator said that the reason for the withdrawal of a license from a credit institution was the conduct of a high-risk financial policy.  According to preliminary data, it was associated with the investment of cash savings in low-quality assets.  As a result, the reserve cash reserve of the organization could not withstand the financial risks that arose, and the bank was on the verge of bankruptcy.  We will tell further about where to pay a loan from Probusinessbank to those citizens who previously took a loan from him. </p><h2>  Problems with borrowed funds: what to do? </h2><p>  The bankruptcy of Probusinessbank was a real shock for individuals and other clients of a financial institution who had previously obtained a loan here.  Many of them were simply at a loss, not knowing where to turn, to whom, and now what to do with paying the loan.  What to do in such situations? </p><p>  Firstly, when depriving a bank of a license, you should not panic.  All financial issues will be resolved sooner or later.  Secondly, it is better not to choose a position of expectation.  To clarify the situation of loans, you must contact the competent authorities.  So, information about banks that have been transferred the right to accept cash payments, including loans, are indicated on the official page of the Central Bank, the Arbitration Court and the Deposit Insurance Agency.  In total, such data appears approximately 10-14 days after the license is revoked.  Here's what you need to do if you have questions due to the fact that Probusinessbank is closed.  Where to pay a loan? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Which banks to apply for loan repayment? </h2><p>  According to a message that appeared on the official page of the <span>Deposit Insurance Agency on</span> September 14, 2015, it is possible to pay loans of the former Probusinessbank in all branches of Russian Capital Bank. </p><p>  So, if you don‚Äôt know where to pay a loan from Probusinessbank, pay attention to the addresses of the Russian Capital bank branches presented below. </p>

    <h2>  Why not delay with paying a loan? </h2><p>  So, "Probusinessbank" is closed.  Where to pay the loan now?  This question is of interest to many borrowers.  They often ask him the provisional administration of a bankrupt bank.  But only people who are engaged in solving completely different questions can answer you something like: ‚ÄúSo far no one knows anything.  As soon as something clears up, we will contact you. ‚Äù </p><p>  Hearing this, most borrowers with a calm soul will go home and begin to expect a call from the bank.  However, such an expectation can lead to the completely opposite effect.  A typical situation looks like this.  Suppose, a day before the license was revoked, the client filed an overdraft at the bank, then they promised him the details of the subsequent payment of the loan.  That's just the message the borrower received only after a year and a half, and in the form of a claim indicating the amount of debt, interest and penalties accrued for the period of delay. </p><p>  That is why you should not wait for the weather by the sea.  It is better to stay in the center of events, track all the news related to the <span>closure of the bank</span> and its future fate, as well as receive information from official sources. </p>
