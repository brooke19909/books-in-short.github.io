    <h2>  Options, design and ergonomics </h2><p>  Something unusual in terms of configuration, this device does not stand out.  Even a complete 2 GB memory card is not provided in it.  A similar situation with a protective sticker on the front of the gadget and case.  All this will have to be bought additionally.  Otherwise, this is a familiar set that includes: </p><ul><li>  The smartphone itself. </li><li>  The battery is based on lithium-ion technology and a capacity of 1500 mA / h. </li><li>  A modest entry-level stereo headset. </li><li>  MicroUSB-YUSB standard cord. </li><li>  <span>Warranty card</span> and <span>user</span> manual. </li></ul><p>  In the appearance of the device, the features of the L-series of smartphones from LG of the first generation are easily recognizable: the characteristic edging of the device‚Äôs outer edges is made of plastic, but it looks like metal, right angles.  In this regard, the second generation gadget of this series - LG Optimus L5 II is very different from it.  Owner reviews <strong> </strong>  produce rounded corners.  So the device fits better in the hand and it is much easier to hold.  But you can get used to these right angles on the case and work successfully.  The back cover is made of corrugated plastic with a matte finish.  In the lower right, the earpiece is displayed on it, and in the upper right corner is a camera with a flash.  The lock button is displayed on the upper edge.  On the lower side there is a conversational microphone and a microUSB port.  On the right side are the volume buttons of the device.  Despite the impressive display diagonal of 4 inches and the presence of right angles on the case, the smartphone is easily and simply located in the hand.  At the same time, you can control it even with one hand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware resources </h2><p>  LG Optimus L5 is based on Qualcomm's entry-level processor MCM7225A.  It consists of the 1st core of the A5 architecture, which in peak mode can produce 800 MHz.  This CPU is supplemented by the Adreno 200 graphic accelerator.  512 MB of RAM are installed in it, and the built-in drive has a capacity of 2 GB.  There is also a slot for installing external drives with a maximum capacity of 32 GB.  The screen, as noted earlier, is 4 inches.  Its resolution is 320 x 480. It is based on TFT technology, which is outdated today.  In general, we can say that this is a great entry-level smartphone.  With most tasks to date, he can easily cope.  An exception in this regard are the most demanding 3-dimensional games. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Smartphone LG Optimus L5 is equipped with just one camera, which is located on the back of the gadget.  It is based on a rather modest 5 MP matrix.  The quality of the photo is very mediocre, but you can‚Äôt expect more from a device of this class.  There is also a LED flash and autofocus, but this does not allow to obtain high-quality images.  The situation with the video is even worse.  The videos are recorded in VGA format, i.e. in 640 x 480 format. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Battery and autonomy </h2><p>  The capacity of a standard battery is 1540 mA / h.  Now take into account that the device uses a single-core processor, and the screen diagonal is only 4 inches.  As a result, we get 2-3 days of battery life on a single charge.  This is subject to fairly intensive use of the device.  But if you further reduce the brightness of the display and consume battery life to a minimum, then you can ‚Äústretch‚Äù one charge for 5 days, which is an excellent indicator for a device of this class. </p><h2>  Software environment </h2><p>  The LG Optimus L5 has an operating system such as Android.  Moreover, the rather old version is 4.0.  In principle, one should not expect more on such a device.  Moreover, the smartphone has been on sale for a long time and updates on it no longer appear.  So you have to be content with what is already there.  The indisputable advantage of the smartphone is the proprietary shell Optimus UI.  It contains a number of useful utilities and widgets, the main of which is Quick Memo.  With its help, you can write important information to your smartphone at any time, including during a conversation.  For the rest, the set of software is quite standard: programs for social services, utilities from Google, and, of course, standard calculator, calendar, and more. </p>

    <h2>  Information exchange </h2><p>  A large set of communications with this smart phone.  Among them are the following: </p><ul><li>  Full support for mobile networks GSM and UMTS.  This allows you to make calls.  Receive and send SMS and MMS.  It is also possible to obtain information from the global web.  In the first case, the speed of its receipt is rather modest - 0.5 Mbit / s at best, but in the case of UMTS this value can reach 15 Mbit / s, which allows you to download files of any size. </li><li>  Another high-speed way to transmit information in any volume is Wai Fai.  In this case, the maximum speed increases several times and amounts to 150 Mbps.  The only drawback of this method, unlike UMTS, is its small radius of action. </li><li>  Korean engineers did not forget about bluetooth.  This <span>method of transmitting information</span> allows you <span>to transfer</span> small-sized files to exactly the same smartphones or mobile phones. </li><li>  The last important component of a wireless communications system is the FSS.  With its help, you can easily turn this modest entry-level smartphone into a full-fledged navigator. </li></ul><p>  Now about the set of wired methods of <span>transmitting information,</span> which is similar in the 2-SIM version of this smartphone - LG Optimus L5 DUAL.  Owner reviews distinguish two of them: </p><ul><li>  MicroUSB solves two problems at once.  The first one is to charge the battery, and the second is the exchange of data with a stationary personal computer or laptop. </li><li>  A 3.5 mm jack allows you to output audio messages to any external speakers.  For example, headphones or speakers. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews and price for the device </h2><p>  And now about the practical experience of operating the LG Optimus L5.  Owner reviews - this is the material that allows you to most accurately determine the strengths and weaknesses of any device.  So, the advantages of this model are: </p><ul><li>  Design. </li><li>  Stable software. </li><li>  Low cost (for an apparatus of this class). </li></ul><p>  But he has only one minus: the screen is built on a matrix with outdated technology - ‚ÄúTFT‚Äù.  Of course, I would like to see it already ‚ÄúIPS‚Äù, but at the time of the release of the gadget about this you could only dream of. </p>

    <h2>  And what do we end up with? </h2><p>  The LG Optimus L5 is the perfect smartphone for everyday use.  This is an ordinary ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù, which can easily cope with almost any task.  At the same time, it has good autonomy, and the battery life is significantly higher than that of more modern similar devices.  In general, at a very affordable price of <span>$ 100,</span> you get a device by a renowned manufacturer, in which everything is there for comfortable work for every day. </p>
