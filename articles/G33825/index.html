Nothing like this.  It‚Äôs worth a little straining your imagination and thinking about how you can create.  As a result, you will be able to create an image from improvised materials.  But what if inspiration does not come?  Then read the article and look for a solution to the problem of creativity in it. </p><h2>  We complement the jumpsuit with attributes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/323977766937070507/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monkey costume details" class="if uuid-2236392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2236392.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way to gather a son or daughter for a matinee is to complement the look with suitable accessories.  Of course, they will also have to work on their creation, but still it will not be as time-consuming as the manufacture of a full-fledged monkey costume.  How to create an outfit for a matinee? </p><p>  Dress your child in a brown jumpsuit.  If this is not available, then it is permissible to replace it with matching trousers and a jacket.  The girl can be dressed in a brown dress.  And everyday clothes should be supplemented with ears and tail.  How to make them?  Let's start with the ears. </p><p>  To make them, you need a bezel, thread fabric and scissors.  We take the brown material and cut 4 large semicircles from it.  From the body tissue, 2 smaller semicircular parts should be cut out.  Now you need to sew large brown blanks to the rim.  Insert a cardboard inside each ear so that the parts do not hang.  Sew bodily to brown blanks.  Now you need to make a tail.  We cut out two long ovals from brown fabric, sew them together and stuff them.  Sew on the tail is required to the body pad, which will serve as a belt.  We complement clothes with these accessories, and the image of the monkey is ready. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Costume for the girl </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY monkey costume" class="if uuid-2236394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2236394.jpg"></div><p>  In such an outfit, it is quite possible to go on a holiday or matinee.  New Year's monkey costume consists of a swimsuit, hat, skirt and tail.  We will begin to create an image by decorating existing clothing.  On a brown swimsuit, an oval should be laid out with rhinestones or sequins.  This will be the abdomen of the monkey.  It‚Äôs worth picking a pack for this, but if you don‚Äôt have one, you can get by with a regular brown miniskirt. </p><p>  The costume of the monkey must be supplemented with a tail.  In this version, it should also be sewn from two long ovals, but it is not worth stuffing the product.  But the end of the tail can be decorated, for example, by tying a bow to it.  The hardest part about making a monkey costume is creating a hat.  It needs to be cut in the likeness of a knight's helmet in two parts.  Only instead of a visor in the front should a cutout be made with a heart.  We sew the product and attach ears to it, which will consist of brown circles sewn together, with a core made of cardboard.  Hands can be clad in mitts or gloves. </p><h2>  Suit for boy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New year monkey costume" class="if uuid-2236419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2236419.jpg"></div><p>  If you do not want to think about the image for the matinee for a long time, the outfit is quite possible to build from existing clothing.  Do-it-yourself <span>monkey</span> costume is made from brown pants and a body t-shirt.  True, one and the other element of the wardrobe will have to be slightly modernized.  An oval should be sewn to the shirt, which will symbolize the abdomen, and a tail should be attached to the pants.  Now the matter is left to the small - you need to find the mask.  If neither you nor your neighbors have it, then you will have to draw this element of the costume by hand.  We depict on the cardboard a funny face, paint it and attach an elastic band to the cheeks. </p>
