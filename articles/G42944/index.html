True, thanks to him, humanity was able to stop Hitler and his fascism.  Although Joseph Vissarionovich himself was no different from his rival.  But, by the way, our article is not about Hitler, and not about the character or psychological portrait of Stalin.  Today we will talk about the cottages of this ruler.  At one time, he possessed 78 such facilities throughout the Soviet Union.  In most of them, he never was.  Joseph Stalin was very fond of the Caucasus, perhaps that is why he had as many as five summer cottages in Abkhazia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stalin's cottage in Abkhazia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/475573.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Common features </h2><p>  Stalin's cottage in Abkhazia is not one building, but houses in Sukhumi, in M√ºsser, in New Athos, on the Cold River and on Lake Ritsa.  All buildings are very similar to each other.  The difference between them is small, and they were built according to the same architectural designs. </p><p>  The most popular among tourists is Stalin's cottage in Abkhazia.  This is a building located on the shores of <span>Lake Ritsa.</span>  By the way, this is the highest mountain building of Mr. Joseph.  Each of the five residences of the leader has several small bedrooms.  Koba suffered from agoraphobia, so the rooms were small, and there were many.  Dzhugashvili did not belong to tall people, and therefore all beds for cottages were made to order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The ceilings and walls of the houses are finished with walnut, boxwood and Karelian birch.  Since Joseph Vissarionovich did not feel much addiction to luxury, there were no decorations in the interior of his houses in Abkhazia.  But on the other hand, every Stalin's dacha in Abkhazia boasts a meeting room and billiards.  Residences, which are located in the capital of the country, in New Athos and on Ritsa, were built by the Germans who were captured.  These same people were involved in the installation of captured thermos bathtubs. </p><h2>  Cottage on the Cold River </h2>

The cold river, Stalin's dacha (Abkhazia) amaze with its calm and silence.  Here you can‚Äôt help but admire the <span>banana palm trees</span> and roses, the views that open onto the Black Sea.  After a day spent in the scorching sun, you can cool down a bit in the main house of the architectural ensemble, which has dim lighting and a cool hall.  Having walked a little deeper into it, you can find the living room destination.  All of it is decorated with wood, and of the furniture there is a <span>coffee table,</span> an old black piano, armchairs and a soft sofa.

Its walls, as in the previous room, are decorated with warm wood.  On the ground floor of the cottage there are three double rooms, equipped with all necessary amenities. </p><p>  The second floor of the cottage is another guest room, as well as a couple of double bedrooms - Green and Red.  So they were called because it is these colors that are predominant in the decoration of walls and furniture.  Stalin's dacha in <span>Abkhazia (Cold River)</span> was visited 20 times by its sovereign. </p><h2>  Where his women lived </h2><p>  Stalin, though cruel, was a man.  Therefore, women were one of his passions.  He preferred 18-20-year-old opera singers, and therefore at the dacha on the Cold River, he equipped rooms for them.  There were two such bedrooms that were never under guard.  They had a separate entrance and exit directly to the street.  Mistresses Koba did not have the right to go beyond their two rooms, so they could not see the rest of the dacha's surroundings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dacha Stalin Lake Ritsa Abkhazia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/475571.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Silver and plain rooms </h2><p>  Silver was the first bedroom for the beloved women of the leader.  The room got its name due to the fact that its walls are covered with Karelian birch.  And when sunlight enters this room, it seems that it is made of silver.  Karelian birch itself is a rather expensive material.  In the time of Stalin, one kilogram of such a tree at a price was equal to the same amount of gold.  Unfortunately, the pieces of furniture that were in the silver bedroom of that time were not preserved. </p><p>  The walls of the second bedchamber are treated with an ordinary nut.  The patterns on it deserve attention: the image consists of two almost identical parts, for the sake of which almost three hundred trees were destroyed. </p><h2>  Cottage on Lake Ritsa </h2><p>  On one of the shores of this magical lake is another cottage of the former party leader.  This house for the Generalissimo was built in 1947.  At the end of the 30s of the last century, a hunting lodge was located in the same place.  It was used by the local party elite.  But at the end of the war, the house was demolished, and in its place grew a large cottage of Stalin in Abkhazia, a photo of which can be considered in our article.  The building was disguised very carefully: the house itself was painted green, so it became invisible from the air, and so that it could not be seen from the opposite side of the Ritsa either, lindens were planted in front of it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="excursion to the cottage Stalin Abkhazia" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/475570.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main purpose of this summer residence was to rest Joseph Vissarionovich.  Therefore, there is no study.  At Ritsa, he was just resting; there was no question of any work.  The cottage was guarded by three thousand guards and barbed wire, which consisted of ten rows.  The territory itself is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãone hundred hectares.  There was also a house in which the head of security was located and there was a large sauna.  Not far from Dairy Falls, a special kitchen was equipped where dishes were prepared for Koba.  How many times Dzhugashvili has stayed here is not known for certain.  Stalin's cottage (Lake Ritsa, Abkhazia) became a neighbor of the residence of Nikita Khrushchev, who did not want to use the apartments of his predecessor and built himself another house, not far from Stalin. </p><h2>  Modern times </h2><p>  Stalin's dachas in Abkhazia today serve as excursion exhibits and residences of the president of the country.  If you decide to go on an excursion to Lake Ritsa, you can spend the night in the house where the great leader once lived.  True, this will require the permission of the head of state. </p><p>  Stalin's cottage in Abkhazia is five rooms, designed for two people.  There is everything you need for a good rest: earthenware baths in which the water stays warm for several hours, elegant furniture, carpeting.  <span>Finnish sauna,</span> billiards, pleasure boat, pool, catamarans and other attributes of luxury are at the service of tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cold river dacha stalin abkhazia" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/475569.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An excursion to the cottage of Stalin (Abkhazia) and accommodation for one person will cost $ 20-50.  This is the price for one day, and it depends on a particular room.  And if you just want to inspect Joseph‚Äôs summer house, you‚Äôll have to lay out 150-200 ‚Äúwooden‚Äù from one person. </p>
