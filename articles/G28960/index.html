    <p>  He received an excellent education, knew several languages, including Greek.  Even the ancient Romans considered it important to know this language for further education.  All scientific, philosophical and spiritual knowledge of that time was open to those who understood Greek language and writing.  In history lessons at school, one can often hear the question: "Give a description of the policy of Vladimir Monomakh."  The article is devoted to the answer to it. </p><h2>  The beginning of the reign </h2><p>  In the early years, Vladimir Vsevolodovich reigned in Rostov, then in Smolensk, Chernihiv, Pereyaslavl.  His authority in political life was undeniable.  He was an ardent opponent of fratricidal strife between the princes.  To answer the question: ‚ÄúGive a description of the policy of Vladimir Monomakh,‚Äù you should carefully study the events of the Lyubetsk Congress of Princes. </p><p>  It was Vladimir who initiated this congress in Lubicz in 1097, the purpose of which was to stop the strife between the princes and come to a common agreement on which of them belongs.  He led the fight against strife all his life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Policy Description </h2><p>  In addition to princely strife, Vladimir Monomakh considered the Polovtsians to be the main enemy of Russia.  It was he who managed to stabilize the nomads and establish a peaceful life in the state for thirty years. </p>

    <p>  Many disasters fell on the share of Russia of that time, the prince could not fight with them.  Such catastrophic events and phenomena include: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  earthquakes; </li><li>  drought </li><li>  floods (often in Novgorod); </li><li>  fires (the fire in Kiev in 1124, which lasted two days and exterminated the entire Podil and part of the Upper City, turned out to be especially destructive); </li><li>  <span>invasion of locusts</span> (in the south). </li></ul><p>  To streamline the life of people, the prince updated the "Russian Truth."  After its additions, it was renamed the "Charter of Vladimir Monomakh."  It included clauses on the terms of a cash loan, according to which a single percentage of payments on debt was established.  This allowed ordinary people (ordinary soldiers, smerds, purchases) to avoid the threat of becoming slaves for debts.  At the same time, the document protected the boyars, merchants, combatants, money-lenders, clergy from popular uprisings. </p><p>  Despite the desire for unity, the domestic policy of Vladimir Monomakh did not provide for the destruction of the specific order.  For centuries, it was believed that the prince should unite in his hands as much land as possible for himself and his children. </p><h2>  Child education </h2><p>  <span>Vladimir Monomakh, whose domestic policy</span> was not limited only to the fight against strife, is represented by literary activity.  One of the works, which became famous for the prince, was his <span>"Teaching children."</span>  It is a clear example of his mind, well-readness, literacy, piety.  In it, he convinces his children to live in peace.  He gives them his instructions. </p><p>  Instructions by Vladimir Monomakh: </p><ul><li>  honor God most of all; </li><li>  in war, rely only on yourself, not on the governor; </li><li>  do not be lazy; </li><li>  love your wives, but do not let them have power over you; </li><li>  monitor justice; </li><li>  honor people - the elderly as fathers, and the young as brothers; </li><li>  read the ambassadors and guests with gifts or treats, as they will tell the world about you; </li><li>  Do not forget your knowledge and learn everything new. </li></ul><p>  The work itself is studied by contemporaries as an outstanding literary monument.  It is also used as a historical document, which allows you to understand the features of Russian medieval life, its way of life, <span>moral values.</span>  Acquaintance with the work will allow students and schoolchildren to cope with the task: "Give a description of the policy of Vladimir Monomakh." </p><h2>  Last way </h2><p>  The prince lived for 74 years.  His last days on Earth were connected with the affairs of the state.  He made a trip to his native Pereyaslavl, where he was going to observe the completion of the construction of the church of Boris and Gleb. </p>

    <p>  After death, his body was transported to Kiev and buried the remains in <span>St. Sophia Cathedral</span> next to his father.  The chronicler narrates that all the people cried about him, because he considered him "a brotherly lover, a pauper and a kind sufferer beyond the Russian land." </p><h2>  The legend of the Monomakh hat </h2><p>  If they ask: ‚ÄúGive a description of the policy of Vladimir Monomakh,‚Äù it is worth mentioning an interesting legend.  It consists in the fact that when the Prince of Kiev went to Byzantium, the emperor sent him symbols of power (regalia) to meet him.  The ambassadors gave him a gift, which consisted of many precious and sacred objects: </p><ul><li>  a wooden cross with a particle of the crucifix on which Christ was executed; </li><li>  a carnelian cup, which belonged to the emperor Augustus Caesar; </li><li>  golden barmas (shoulders) decorated with precious stones; </li><li>  a chain of Arabian gold; </li><li>  royal crown. </li></ul>

    <p>  It was the crown that they began to call the <span>Monomakh hat.</span>  She was crowned on the throne of subsequent kings to Peter the Great.  Modern experts have found a discrepancy in this legend, since the crown consists of parts that date back to the 14th century. </p><p>  However, the legend proves that Russia was considered the successor of Constantinople (Constantinople).  It is not yet decided to refute such conclusions, partly due to the wise policy of Vladimir Vsevolodovich. </p>
