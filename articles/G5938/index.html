    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Such an institution as the Hotel Basilica (Kazan) is quite popular.  Traveler reviews contain the following positive comments: </p><ul><li><p>  good hearty breakfasts with lots of services; </p></li><li><p>  the main attractions of the city center can be reached on foot; </p></li><li><p>  very nice, polite staff who are trying in every way to please the guests; </p></li><li><p>  the hotel is located in a very beautiful place surrounded by beautiful buildings and Muslim mosques; </p></li><li><p>  thanks to good noise isolation, sounds from corridors or neighboring rooms will not interfere with you; </p></li><li><p>  pleased with the presence of a courtyard with benches and a playground where you can have a good time. </p></li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Accommodation in this hotel is characterized by the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li><p>  Urgent repairs are required in the bathrooms in the rooms offered by the Hotel Basilica (Kazan).  Photos taken by tourists show mold and peeling plaster. </p></li><li><p>  After taking a shower, all the water is on the floor. </p></li><li><p>  Maids do not wash floors under the beds. </p></li><li><p>  Due to poor ventilation, condensation is collected on the pipes and walls in the bathroom. </p></li><li><p>  There is no elevator in the hotel, which is very problematic for those guests who live on the upper floors. </p></li><li><p>  Torn bedding (but pay tribute to its cleanliness). </p></li><li><p>  There are old mattresses on the beds, the springs from which hurt their backs. </p></li><li><p>  Permanent confusion with the reservation (if you book a room through third-party resources, and not through the official website). </p></li><li><p>  There are no mosquito nets on the windows, and therefore if you want to ventilate the room, a lot of insects will fly into your room. </p></li><li><p>  Due to the fact that there are no curtains on the windows, in the summer the sun shines through the glass strongly. </p></li><li><p>  Internet too slow. </p></li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Hotel "Basilica" is a fairly popular accommodation option for guests of Kazan.  This hotel has long been loved by tourists because of its convenient location and reasonable prices for accommodation.  The establishment is a 15-minute walk from the central part of the city, where the main attractions are concentrated.  In addition, there is a public transport stop nearby, which is why you can quickly get to any place you need.  The area in which the hotel is located is also quite beautiful due to the concentration of historical buildings and mosques. </p><p>  If we talk about the interior of the hotel, then at first glance everything looks pretty decent.  But upon closer inspection, you will notice that the repair is done superficially.  In many rooms you can find peeling plaster, stains on the walls and other unpleasant moments.  In addition, bed mattresses require replacement.  One of the most serious problems is the bathroom.  Not only will a flood form on the floor after taking a shower, but condensation will also collect on the walls due to ventilation problems.  Nevertheless, if you do not plan to stay in a room for a long time, then you can close your eyes to these shortcomings. </p><p>  The food prices in the restaurant are overpriced.  I am glad that breakfast does not have to be included in the price, so you can find some alternative.  Within walking distance there are many cafes and restaurants, in which the prices are lower and the quality of the dishes is much better.  It is worth paying special attention to those institutions in which local residents go.  You can taste delicious Tatar food in them quite inexpensively. </p><p>  Thus, we can say that the hotel "Basilica" will be a good accommodation option for those who are looking for affordable housing in the central part of the city and do not pay attention to some inconveniences.  If you are determined to spend whole days exploring the sights of Kazan or being at work, then most likely you will not notice many shortcomings (lack of an elevator, spots on the walls, washed clothes, etc.).  But for a long stay, it is worth looking for a more comfortable option (possibly for a higher price). </p>
