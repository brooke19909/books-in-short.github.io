Carnival in Rio de Janeiro</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Far and very colorful is the South American country of Brazil.  Rio de Janeiro is the main city of this country, which is considered the second capital and concurrently the largest resort center on the entire east coast of South America.  Its name is literally translated into Russian as ‚ÄúJanuary River‚Äù.  It was in this month, many centuries ago, the famous navigator Gaspard de Lemouche approached such distant shores.  Sailing through the bay, he thought it was a river.  Since then, the name has taken root in this region and has become the world standard for summer, fun and bright colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brazil rio de janeiro" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/384912.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How far is Brazil from us? </h2><p>  Rio de Janeiro is a metropolis to which direct flights do not fly from any city in Russia.  Therefore, everyone who wants to relax there will have to make at least one transplant, or even two.  A more economical option is to stop in Sao Paulo, from where planes depart for domestic flights to Rio every few hours.  Such a trip will take you just an extra hour of time, and finance will cost no more than $ 70.  You can also fly through Miami, but in this case you will have to settle many nuances associated with visas and other documents, because you will also cross the US border.  And, of course, America as a state will require a much higher fee for flight services than Brazil.  Rio de Janeiro, paradoxically, is a city where you can relax cheaply, but in order to get to it, you need to pay a considerable amount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="carnival in rio de janeiro" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/385275.jpg?1398794988124" width="424"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Visa ... is it necessary for a trip to Rio? </h2><p>  Since recently, Russian tourists traveling abroad have become much more accessible than in the past decades, the visa issue is now much more acute.  Today, far from every state you can just get there like that, just to relax for one or two weeks.  It is necessary to provide the embassy with a lot of pieces of paper, certificates and permits, and only then you can get the long-awaited visa, which will allow you to see a new corner of the World.  Much simpler conditions for domestic travelers were provided by sunny Brazil.  Rio de Janeiro can be visited only with a passport, return tickets and a document confirming the reservation of a hotel room.  You can stay in the territory of this state for 90 days every six months. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of brazil rio de janeiro" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/385276.jpg?1398795017046" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climate that allows sunbathing year-round </h2><p>  The weather in Rio de Janeiro is a real find for lovers of summer, which never ends.  It is always sunny and hot, both in winter and in summer, especially since there is not much difference between these seasons.  Since the metropolis is located in the southern hemisphere of our planet, winter here always has higher temperature indicators, and summer pleases locals with cool evenings and a fresh ocean breeze.  The hottest month in Rio is January.  The temperature rises above day 30, the oceanic bay warms up to 26-27 degrees.  A gradual decline in such heat begins in April-May, and in summer the daytime temperature does not exceed 27 Celsius.  Also in summer, the wind rises here, which forms waves ideal for windsurfing.  That is why the second <span>capital of Brazil</span> - Rio de Janeiro - is a resort city in which you can perfectly relax at any time of the year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rio de janeiro brazil carnival" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/385278.jpg?1398795059511" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What if you just arrived in Rio? </h2><p>  The first thing that every tourist who finds himself in an unfamiliar city is supposed to do is get to the hotel.  To do this, you can use public transport, namely - by bus, because here they are a dime a dozen.  In order to get into the salon, you just need to wave your hand, and the driver will stop, and he will drop you off where you ask.  Public transport in the metropolis is very comfortable, and the fare is worth nothing.  Buses run in almost all areas of the city, including the narrowest streets, and, as a rule, they do not have to wait long.  Also, the resort capital of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro is full of private taxis.  Quickly and with a breeze, the driver will take you to the hotel and will be extremely grateful if you leave him a tip.  As in a restaurant, subtract ten percent of the amount on the counter and give it to the driver. </p><h2>  Hotel centers of the resort capital of Brazil </h2><p>  A separate topic for all travelers are the hotels of Rio de Janeiro.  Brazil, in principle, is an inexpensive country in which you do not have to leave a fortune just to have a human rest.  However, in Rio, the cost of temporary residence is fabulously overpriced.  The best hotel complexes are erected along the most famous coast of Copacabana, where it is always fun and noisy.  Living in such an area, you will be aware of all the events, do not miss a single party and you can make a bunch of new acquaintances.  A quieter, but no less expensive and chic place to relax is the Ipanema coast.  Here, citizens of the United States, Europe, some Russians prefer to relax.  It is also worth remembering that in the winter months, prices in all hotels increase several times in connection with the New Year and the Carnival. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rio de janeiro map" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/384916.jpg?1398773014246" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Local cuisine and its features </h2><p>  Special culinary traditions boasts the metropolis of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).  Photos of many culinary masterpieces repeatedly flickered in front of us on blue screens, but their recipes and even taste remained a big secret for us.  Going to the east coast in the South Atlantic, you can finally taste all this, and perhaps learn how to cook it yourself.  Since slaves from Africa have been exiled to Brazil over the centuries, the state has become a stronghold of Arab and European traditions, supplemented by the customs of local Indians.  Therefore, the "name" dish of Rio is feijoada, which consists of beans, smoked meats, spices and many other components.  You can taste this miracle in any restaurant in the city, and everywhere it will have its own special, different flavor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in rio de janeiro" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/384920.jpg" width="559"></div>

    <h2>  Other gastronomic benefits of Rio </h2><p>  In addition to the unique cuisine, which has incorporated a synthesis of the traditions of the East, Europe and the <span>wild tribes of the</span> Amazon, local drinks also deserve special applause.  The resort and very warm Brazilian capital of Rio de Janeiro is a storehouse of various wines, both dry, which will be an excellent addition to a meat dinner, and sweet, nutmeg, which will continue your enjoyment of any dessert.  This drink is served here in restaurants, and can also be purchased at local stores.  An important place in Brazilian culture is coffee, which is simply masterly brewed here.  Even in the beach cafe, where everyone comes, you will cook these fragrant grains so that you never forget their aroma.  Do not forget also that in Brazil they still prepare first-class beer.  Locals prefer the brand Brama, a drink that is moderately frothy and very pleasant to taste.  Well, the "alcoholic symbol" of Rio and the whole of Brazil is Cachasa.  This is a high-speed drink that is comparable to Mexican tequila. </p><h2>  Attractions of the resort capital </h2><p>  Explore and comprehend the secrets of this city in a few days you definitely will not succeed.  There is almost everything here: museums, and ancient squares, and buildings in the <span>colonial style,</span> and places for outdoor activities.  If you decide to walk all of Rio de Janeiro, a map is the first thing you need.  You can buy it at any kiosk or store, both in Portuguese and in English.  As a rule, hiking starts with the noisy <span>beaches of Copacabana,</span> where there are cafes, discotheques, shops, and even botanical zones.  At night, a market opens here, where you can buy everything from spices to jewelry.  In the old part of the city you will find colonial buildings adjoined by sculptural masterpieces telling the history of the city and the country.  On the outskirts of the city there are favelas - slums in which poor people live and mainly the Rio mafia.  By all means, climb the mountain, to Jesus, who for many centuries has kept this wonderful city from adversity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rio de janeiro brazil map" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/384913.jpg?1398773115583" width="292"></div>

    <h2>  New Year and Carnival - the main events of the country </h2><p>  Almost every inhabitant of the planet knows very well what the city of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) looks like on New Year's Eve.  The carnival, which takes place here, gathers not only all the inhabitants of the metropolis on the streets, but also tourists from all over the world.  They come here in advance in order to at least look out of the corner of their eyes at the most colorful and noisy action that has ever existed in the world.  According to the rules, this holiday should be held 40 days before Easter, in honor of the beginning of Lent.  It is, as it were, a symbol of farewell to carnal pleasures, the last day when you can eat meat and perform incendiary dances.  However, the <span>Carnival in Rio de Janeiro</span> always coincides with the date of the New Year, which allows you to combine two such significant holidays.  In this city, this celebration is the day of the national samba dance, and during it the best choreographic achievements of the year, as well as the most unique and colorful costumes, are demonstrated. </p><h2>  What exactly happens on this holiday? </h2><p>  In fact, preparations for the celebration begin a few days before it begins.  The jury, which includes not only local choreographers, but also foreigners, selects dance groups that demonstrate the best skills in the art of performing samba.  The chosen ones get to the final, that is, to the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, where the one and only winner is also determined.  Nevertheless, all those dancers who qualify for this finale are, in fact, considered the best, as we can say that they represent their country in the international arena.  Every year, for everyone who takes part in this action, costumes are made that are used only once.  After the Carnival, decorations and clothes are simply thrown into a landfill, and the city is immersed in its daily affairs and worries, and the dancers will increase their strength to show the best results a year later. </p><h2>  What to remember if you want to get to the Carnival </h2><p>  During the main <span>dance competition of the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãand the whole country, prices for housing, food, and travel are instantly raised.  First of all, tourists have problems finding a hotel.  Therefore, it is worth booking a place for a month, or even earlier, along with plane tickets.  Do not forget also that only all hotels rent out rooms only for a four-day package.  Therefore, if you want to stay in Rio for only two days, you still have to pay, as in four days.  It is recommended that you buy tickets for the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro in advance so that you can take the most comfortable places from which everything will be visible.  And then this competition, which takes place throughout the night, and is accompanied by a parade of beautiful scenery and costumes, will be remembered by you for many years.  Finally, it is worth noting that during the celebration of this celebration, many locals leave the city.  Therefore, on the streets you will come across a mass of tourists who have come here from all over the world.  Remember that each person has his own mentality and his own outlook on life, so it is not recommended to enter into a dispute.  Also, during the Carnival in Rio, more frequent acts of crime, so be careful not to wander into the favelas. </p><h2>  Horizons not to be forgotten </h2><p>  With full confidence, we can say that the real eighth wonder of the world is the city of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).  A map of the world places it far from our lands, on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, but it is still worth getting to it and exploring it.  Despite the fact that Europeans brought their religion and traditions here, local charm and mystery remained on these lands.  And in addition to those monuments that were left in Rio by different eras, natural wealth deserves special attention.  It is enough to climb the Sugar Loaf to see the endless horizon, in which the sky and the ocean, clouds and blue waters merge. </p>
