You can talk endlessly about the benefits of such a vacation: it is fresh air, new impressions, and physical activity.  Going to the mountains, it‚Äôs not at all necessary to get ready to climb the gentle slopes.  After all, relaxing in the mountains is so diverse that it can satisfy almost any tourist: as they say, for every taste and budget. </p><p>  By the way, in order to enjoy the beautiful nature, leisure and sports in the mountains, there is no need to prepare a tidy sum and passport: in Russia there are many wonderful places that allow you to fully admire the high-mountain landscapes.  One of the most popular places for lovers of relaxation in the mountains is Mount Elbrus. </p><h2>  Why is it worth going to Elbrus by car? </h2><p>  Traveling with your own transport is best for such a trip.  Why?  Everything is quite simple.  Of course, airplanes and trains do not fly to the foot of Elbrus.  When you get to the city, which has an airport or a railway station, in any case you have to look for a car to get to the foot of the mountain, and then to the tourist base on its slope. </p><p>  Of course, Elbrus is very popular with tourists, and transport goes there daily.  But you must admit: it is easier to get to Elbrus by car than to plan a route taking into account transfers.  In addition, choosing a car, you do not have to wait for the time to send the transport and be afraid to miss your bus, you do not have to drag the suitcase from one place to another. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the way to Elbrus there are several small towns and villages with interesting traditions and cultural monuments, the population of which is happy to welcome tourists.  In addition, the road runs through very picturesque places.  Most likely, you will often want to stop and take a picture or consider an interesting place you met along the way.  Therefore, it is most convenient to go to Elbrus by car - so you definitely won‚Äôt miss anything interesting! </p><h2>  Cons of a car trip </h2><p>  It would be wrong to say that the road to Elbrus by car is a pleasant and easy pastime.  When setting off on your car, be prepared to face the minuses associated with this type of travel. </p><p>  You should always have an experienced driver who is able to navigate in difficult traffic situations and is ready to spend most of the day driving.  Traveling by car always requires tourists to be more focused and independent.  Soberly assess your capabilities and leave yourself time for rest and sleep.  Think about it: are you ready for such a trip?  Perhaps it would be better to limit yourself to a tourist trip to Elbrus and spend a vacation at sea? </p><h2>  What you need to know in advance </h2><div class="photo" data-original="galina-lukas.ru" data-author=":  , "><img alt="Lifts Elbrus" class="if uuid-2779244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2779244.jpg?1556533039"></div><p>  Get directions in advance and find out where hotels, cafes and gas stations are.  Check out reviews of hotels and cafes.  Even if you do not plan to sleep on the road or plan to spend the night in a car, choose the options for an overnight stay in case of force majeure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You will have to get to tourist bases on Elbrus by car along the serpentine.  Be mentally prepared to ride along a winding mountain road.  By the way, according to the stories of tourists, local youth will not be averse to arrange small races with you on a mountain road.  Remember that such bravado is dangerous even in ordinary urban conditions! </p><p>  Stock up on non-perishable foods and water in advance in case you feel like eating and drinking during the trip and the closest store is closed. </p><p>  Decide where you will sleep.  Experienced tourists are advised to stay overnight (in case you do not want to sleep in the hotel) in well-lit and secure places - for example, in parking lots near gas stations. </p><p>  Choose places that you definitely need to call on the way to Elbrus.  By car moving, you decide where and how much you can stay! </p><p>  Experienced tourists warn that there are a lot of traffic police posts on the border areas of Karachay-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria, and the cars for checking are stopped quite often.  Be prepared for the fact that during the trip you will go through the process of checking documents several times. </p><p>  According to local residents, it is better to refuel at stations of well-known networks.  Small local gas stations can sell low-quality fuel. </p><p>  Many tourists complain that they misplanned their time and regret that they could not stay longer in Elbrus.  Based on the reviews, the optimal time to travel to Elbrus by car is 10-14 days. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Do you know where Elbrus is?  If you are going to Elbrus by car, knowing that he is "somewhere in the Caucasus" will be clearly not enough.  The mountain is located on the border of two republics: Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay-Cherkessia and is an extinct volcano.  The closest thing is to get to Elbrus from Pyatigorsk - from there the path to the foot of the mountain takes from 100 to 150 km. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Stock up on maps of the surroundings in advance and see on the navigator how to get to Elbrus by car. </p><h2>  Clothing selection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="russia.travel" data-author=": "><img alt="Climbing Elbrus" class="if uuid-2779246" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2779246.jpg?1556533039"></div><p>  Since the weather in the mountains changes with special frequency, do not forget to bring both warm and summer clothes.  Going for a walk, take three types of things with you: summer, warm, and windproof.  By combining them, you can spend your holidays as comfortably as possible.  As for shoes, you should not take winter boots and boots with you.  It will be enough sports sneakers.  According to experienced travelers, in this shoe you will not be cold, despite the fact that in the mountains you will be surrounded by centuries-old hats of snow. </p><h2>  Local population </h2><p>  So, we figured out how to get to Elbrus by car and what to take on a trip.  An important question remains: how to behave with the local population?  A lot of different rumors are circulating about the North Caucasus and there are many stereotypes.  But do not be afraid: the population of Elbrus region is very positive about tourists.  All that is required of you is a good mood, banal politeness and respect for another culture. </p><h2>  How to plan a budget </h2><p>  A trip to Elbrus by car, according to reviews, is not too expensive.  Most of the money goes to car fuel and food.  You can calculate in advance how much money will be spent on gasoline by looking at the cards, what distance you will have to cover.  Keep in mind that a trip to Elbrus in terms of fuel will be more expensive than a descent from it, due to the fact that more gas will be spent on the climb. </p><p>  According to tourists, about 8 thousand are spent on food for a week for three.  But here everything is very individual and depends on where and how you will eat. </p><p>  Not much money will be spent on toll roads - about 1000 rubles. </p><p>  Souvenirs will cost one and a half to two thousand. </p><h2>  When is the best time to go? </h2><p>  According to reviews, the summer season is the most suitable for a holiday in Elbrus region.  At this time of the year at the foot of the mountain is a real hot summer with all its charms, and winter and eternal snow reign on the peaks.  The temperature on the slopes of Elbrus can drop to zero degrees and a little lower.  However, due to the hot sun and snow, the cold is almost not felt. </p><p>  But going to Elbrus by car in the summer, it is worth considering that the Krasnodar Territory is crowded with tourists at this time of year.  Therefore, it is likely that on the way to Elbrus you will lose time in traffic jams.  Experienced tourists are advised to plan their route in such a way as to pass through the places with the largest number of cars at night. </p><h2>  Interesting places on the way to Elbrus </h2><p>  Traveling by car involves complete freedom of movement.  Therefore, you need to decide in advance where you would like to go on the way to the treasured mountain.  In addition to the fact that you will follow the road laid in a valley between the picturesque mountains, you will also find several beautiful and interesting tourist places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotokto.ru" data-author=": "><img alt="mountain river Baksan" class="if uuid-2779240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2779240.jpg?1556533039"></div><p>  The road to Elbrus begins in front of the village of Baksan and moves along the river of the same name.  It is a cold and fast mountain river surrounded by incredibly beautiful slopes and trees.  Behind the bridge over the river you will find the first attraction - a monument to the conquerors of Elbrus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krabov.net" data-author=": "><img alt="Tyrnyauz city" class="if uuid-2779238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2779238.jpg?1556533039"></div><p>  30 km to Elbrus, the ghost town of Tyrnyauz will be waiting for you.  Once, in Soviet times, the town was built and developed due to the work of the tungsten plant there.  But the USSR ceased to exist, and the factory closed.  People, in search of work and a better life, left the city.  There are only abandoned apartment buildings, surrounded by beautiful nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pyatigorskgid.ru" data-author=": "><img alt="Polyana Narzanov" class="if uuid-2779239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2779239.jpg?1556533039"></div><p>  You can visit the Glade of Narzanov, where you can collect water from mineral springs, have a snack and buy souvenirs. </p><p>  Of interest to tourists is the village of Terskol, which is now a cozy place for inexpensive accommodation for guests of the Elbrus region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turisticum.ru" data-author=": "><img alt="Lifts Chebet" class="if uuid-2779243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2779243.jpg?1556533039"></div><p>  Elbrus would not have been himself if it had not been adjacent to Mount Cheget, complementing its grandeur and beauty.  Translated, "Cheget" means "in the shade."  Of course, Elbrus eclipses Cheget with its beauty and grandeur, but from this mountain the most beautiful view of Elbrus opens.  Local guides advise you to climb it first in order to acclimatize and get used to the pressure in the mountains. </p><p>  The last attraction on the way to Elbrus is the glade of Azau.  Here you can rent a room, buy souvenirs and, finally, park your car and buy a ticket for the cable car to Elbrus! </p><h2>  Where to stay in the mountains </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tramp.datapunk.ru" data-author=": "><img alt="Polyana Azau" class="if uuid-2779252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2779252.jpg?1556533039"></div><p>  The closest thing will be to stay on the glade of Azau or on the Cheget glade.  The second remotest option will be hotels in the village of Terskol.  And finally, the <span>village of Elbrus,</span> located a little further away, but still located conveniently for tourists, is ready to offer several hotels with rooms for every taste and budget. </p><h2>  Things to do on Elbrus </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.risk.ru" data-author=": "><img alt="Elbrus - Snowboard" class="if uuid-2779241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2779241.jpg?1556533039"></div><p>  Elbrus, first of all, is a ski resort.  Therefore, entertainment here corresponds to this status.  You can go skiing and snowboarding, rent a snowmobile or go hiking or a trip to the mountains. </p><p>  If active recreation does not bring you pleasure, you can relax in the <span>restaurants, cafes</span> and bars of Elbrus, sunbathe and take photos against the backdrop of dazzlingly beautiful landscapes. </p>
