    <h2>  General concept </h2><p>  Sexism is a worldview that is the exact opposite of the feminist movement.  In the latter, gender equality is considered the main one.  Sexism is, more simply, a clear separation between rights according to gender.  Sometimes such a worldview can be expressed in the form of misogony (hatred of ladies) or misandria (rejection of men).  A person holding such views is a sexist.  The worldview under consideration usually manifests itself in two forms, in particular male and female chauvinism. </p><h2>  Manifestations in society </h2><p>  The followers of the movement are characterized by <span>gender discrimination.</span>  Every day a person is faced with various prejudices.  If someone does not agree with the established framework, then society will react to it disapprovingly or simply will not understand it.  This is the gender policy inherent in the movement in question.  Some of the prejudices relate more to the <span>weaker sex,</span> others to the stronger. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="problems of discrimination against women" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/451510.jpg" width="555"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Stereotypes about men </h2><p>  The representative of the stronger sex is the earner, so he should bring the main income to the family.  He also has the obligation to pay for joint entertainment with the chosen one. </p><p>  In the case of the birth of a child, a man must provide for him, even if he does not want to.  This also applies to those moments when a woman became pregnant specially, resorting to deceiving a partner. </p><p>  In terms of sexual relations, men have more freedom.  It is considered normal that he may have sexual intercourse before marriage and outside of it.  In society, it is accepted that a man should be the first to get acquainted with a woman, dominate everything.  This also applies to sexual contact. </p><p>  Men are not in vain called the "strong" gender.  They must be self-confident, have an imperious character and some degree of aggressiveness.  There are some purely "male" educational institutions.  Such until 2008 were Suvorov schools, in which only young men were accepted.  The same applies to conscription.  The male segment of the population is obligated.  Accordingly, in educational institutions, the load standards are significantly higher. </p><p>  Representatives of the stronger sex should take off their hats when entering certain rooms, such as a church, or when a hymn is played.  Physically, men are considered stronger. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gender policy" class="if" height="238" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/451511.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Problems of discrimination against women </h2><p>  Most often, the fairer sex only plays the role of a sexual object without rights.  Accordingly, there can be no obligations to her.  It is often believed that a woman should not have fun during sex.  For a man, she is just a matter of satisfying her needs.  In some countries, women are circumcised.  They remove the main erogenous zones (for example, the clitoris and labia minora).  A woman will be condemned if she has <span>sexual relations</span> before marriage or has several partners.  In a relationship, a woman should not be the first to get acquainted, make decisions.  It should be weak, submissive and softer. </p><p>  In countries where abortion is permitted, the last word always remains with the woman.  Male opinion often does not solve anything. </p><p>  In the household sphere, cooking, washing, cleaning, etc. are purely female responsibilities. </p><p>  The same applies to the fact that children are raised mainly by the mother only.  She is granted maternity leave to care for her child, as well as sick leave if she becomes ill.  In the event of a divorce, children are almost always left with a woman.  Often such a decision is made, despite its financial and <span>social status.</span> </p><p>  Not all countries have the right to vote.  Some states do not apply the death penalty or life imprisonment to women.  They can receive packages in unlimited quantities.  And the <span>verdicts of the court</span> in relation to them are more loyal.  There are countries where women are more severely punished for their misconduct. </p><p>  In some countries, the fairer sex can not even serve in the army voluntarily.  The load standards in educational institutions are much lower for them than for men. </p><p>  In churches and at some events, women should be with their heads covered. </p><h2>  Gender discrimination in the labor market </h2>

    <p>  Nowadays, there is some division of professions depending on the gender of the person.  There is a ban (or disapproval from others) on the right to engage in a certain type of activity by gender.  The stronger sex is almost always higher earnings.  This is especially true for professions in which only men work. </p><p>  Ladies have lower paid jobs.  This is manifested even in areas where both women and men can be involved.  The difference in their wages may be from 16% or more.  Those professions that are considered female are also paid less. </p><p>  Sexism is a phenomenon that often manifests itself to women quite harshly.  In particular, this concerns the inability to build a career and climb the ranks to higher posts.  This attitude to women is defined by the American term <span>"glass ceiling".</span>  Men retire later than women, although the life expectancy of the stronger sex is usually less. </p><p>  Some beliefs related to men are by no means the machinations of women or feminists.  It is interesting that many of the restrictions are spelled out in laws that create state bodies, where mainly representatives of the stronger sex work.  Some scholars believe that these stereotypes are a consequence of patriarchy.  Moreover, they limit both women and men. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gender discrimination in the labor market" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/451513.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Opposite movements </h2><p>  Sexism is, of course, not the only, although fairly persistent current in society.  There are directions whose followers oppose established stereotypes.  Anti-sexist movements are prevalent mainly in Western countries.  These include: </p><ol><li>  Left-wing political movements. </li><li>  "Informal" movements (hippies, anarchists, etc.). </li></ol><p>  But sexism still does not lose ground, and in some places strengthens them ... </p>
