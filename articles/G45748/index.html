It should be noted that overall the hotel complex was pleasant to travelers.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><p>  So, as for the rooms, our compatriots found them very comfortable and well decorated.  Many of them were surprised when they learned that the hotel was already about forty years old.  Thanks to several large-scale reconstructions, he looks very good.  The furniture in the rooms is almost new and comfortable, all the equipment works well.  Even if there are some problems, say, with air conditioning, then the masters fix them very quickly. </p><p>  Our compatriots also liked the territory <span>of the Corfu</span> Louis Kerkyra Golf 4 * <span>hotel</span> .  She is very big and green.  There is a mass of secluded places where you can spend time in peace and quiet.  The pool, according to tourists, is also very good.  Sun loungers near him are always in sufficient quantity, so that vacationers do not have to occupy them early in the morning. </p><p>  As for the sea and the beach, here our compatriots had a number of complaints.  So, most tourists expected to see a large sandy beach.  In fact, the beach was really very spacious, but it was a grassy lawn.  As it turned out, this is a normal occurrence in Corfu.  Entry into the water is sandy and gentle.  But at the very edge of the water, algae often accumulate, which hotel staff do not have time to clean.  This gives some bathing discomfort.  Otherwise, the beach and the sea here are very clean and pleasant. </p><p>  Travelers appreciated the food at the Luis Kerkyra Golf hotel complex.  So, some are sure that the dishes he offered were no worse than in five-star hotels.  Many travelers in their reviews note the variety of food: a lot of meat, fish, seafood, various salads, snacks, vegetables, fruits, and desserts.  The hotel chefs never went too far with seasonings, so that most of the dishes could well be eaten by children. </p><p>  The staff of the hotel complex left an extremely pleasant experience with our compatriots.  So, the maids conscientiously perform their <span>duties, the waiters</span> always smile, quickly clean the dirty dishes and deliver drinks, and the administrators are very friendly and ready to help in all matters.  The only minor drawback for tourists from Russia and other CIS countries was the fact that almost all hotel staff do not understand Russian.  However, remembering the basic school curriculum of English or German, you can explain without problems. </p>
