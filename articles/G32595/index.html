    <p>  The political regime is the way in which the <span>political system</span> in a state functions.  The methods that exercise power in the country are manifested here, the measure of people's participation in <span>political life is</span> characterized <span>,</span> and also, which is very painful in this topic, is general political freedom in a particular society. </p><p>  The totalitarian regime is, first of all, integrity, totality of control.  All aspects of society are controlled by the government, absolute coherence in the choice of the political direction between society and the government is flourishing (in fact, because the former does not have the right to choose), which makes the state look solid, not fragmented by the diversity of opinions and positions. </p><p>  The Sophocles expression: ‚ÄúSilence is a sign of consent‚Äù is a natural position for totalitarian regimes, even in cases where outside opinions are not voiced, not because they do not exist, but because they are not allowed to express.  No wonder this saying arose in the state, which was the first in the world to accept the antagonist of the totalitarian regime - democracy. </p><p>  <strong>History and main features</strong> </p><p>  A totalitarian political regime is a phenomenon that first appeared in Italy.  D. Amendola described exactly the system established by Mussolini, with which the <span>Italian fascists</span> hastily agreed and even popularized the concept. </p><p>  The totalitarian political regime has a number of signs: </p><ul><li>  Absolute control over society. </li><li>  Power takes on a centralized form and is in the hands of a small number of people. </li><li>  Increased power control of citizens. </li><li>  Policy advocacy is present in all areas of activity. </li><li>  The only party in power that does not allow the formation of a new one with a different ideology. </li><li>  Total ideologization of the population. </li><li>  Highlighting your race. </li><li>  Mass media censorship. </li><li>  Refusal of traditions under the pretext of striving for a new one, which, allegedly, is much better than the present reality or the recent past. </li><li>  The desire to remove the boundaries between the individual, civil society and the state. </li></ul><p>  The most prominent representatives of totalitarian regimes are Nazi Germany, the USSR of the Stalin period and fascist Italy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Totalitarian Political Regime and Communism</strong> </p><p>  Totalitarianism clearly manifested itself in three forms: communism, fascism, and national socialism.  The ideas of communism were partially realized with the formation of the USSR.  Here, the social regime is presented, first of all, in the form of equality.  It had to reach global proportions and be economic, social, ideological.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcommunism was first formulated in the writings of <span>Friedrich Engels</span> and Karl Marx, and Vladimir Lenin took upon himself the attempt to implement it. </p><p>  Communism is characterized by all the features of a totalitarian system, including the emphasis on racial features and unity, albeit somewhat veiled: "a single Soviet people."  Since the goal of totalitarianism is to replace everything with itself, then religion is in this series.  At that time it was forbidden to visit churches and temples, and the icons were replaced with posters of Lenin and then Stalin, who continued and tightened this already inhumane system. </p><p>  <strong>Totalitarian Political Regime and Fascism</strong> </p><p>  Here, Italy, where <span>Benito Mussolini</span> dominated <span>,</span> who introduced this way, was a vivid example. </p><p>  The easiest way to organize fascist totalitarianism in countries that are experiencing an economic crisis is what a separate group of Italians took advantage of in the 1920s-40s. </p><p>  The radical division of society into "higher" and "lower" is clearly expressed here, which contradicts the ideas of communism. </p><p>  Fascism is characterized by traditionalism, expressed in the acceptance of tradition as one of the main values, as well as aggressive militarism and leaderism.  Mussolini was indeed a leader, always made fiery emotional speech, introduced strict censorship and supported Germany in its military, as well as other equally immoral actions, which led to his death.  He was supported by <span>Winston Churchill,</span> considering him a great politician. </p><p>  <strong>Totalitarian Political Regime and National Socialism</strong> </p><p>  Another form of totalitarianism is National Socialism, or, more simply, Nazism.  Germany distinguished itself in this field, whose people granted the right of power to Adolf Hitler in 1920, who managed to combine anti-Semitism, racism and fascism in their crazy ideology.  Here, totalitarianism is based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe racial characteristics of the nation <span>(social Darwinism),</span> which is strangely intertwined with the liberation of living space in Eastern Europe for its race (although there were not so many Germans, and in the Nazi interpretation of it, that they could not fit in Germany) ;  also because of this ideology, the mass extermination of the representatives of the Jewish nation was realized, because A. Hitler thought that they were trying to take over the world and their appearance bears the traits of inferiority.  These are very ephemeral theories, at present, scientists are inclined to believe that this was not a goal, but a means, a fictitious motive, motivated by an unbridled desire for power, which is based on the psychological problems of the former Fuhrer. </p><p>  National Socialism, fortunately, ceased to exist in such a global manifestation, and the modern world rejects its ideas and directions, considering this phenomenon a great mistake of history. </p>
