It worries a lot of people, as these two types of appliances are increasingly appearing in the kitchens of modern hostesses.  It is worth noting that there are a number of tasks that are common for the mentioned units: saving time, facilitating labor in the kitchen, maximizing the preservation of nutrients in food.  But there are still differences. </p>

    <h2>  Double boiler and slow cooker: complete set </h2><p>  A double boiler is a piece of household electrical equipment designed for steaming.  It includes a base, a pallet and a basket.  The basis in this case is the base where the electric heater and the water tank are located.  Baskets, which are usually several, are plastic containers having a perforated bottom.  They are set on top of each other.  The upper basket can be tightly closed with a lid.  Condensation is collected in the pan.  To understand the difference between double boiler and multicooker, it is necessary to consider the design of both types of devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The multicooker includes a housing with a heating element, an integrated microprocessor, a container in which food is cooked, a steam valve, a steam cooking container, a hermetically sealed lid.  As you can see, there are a few more components. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Slow cooker pressure cooker" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/304318.jpg" width="401"></div>  The principle of operation of units </h2><p>  To finally understand the difference between double boiler and multicooker, consider the principle of operation of both types of kitchen appliances.  In the first case, cooking is done by cooking, frying, baking, stewing and grilling.  Many models have a built-in mode for baking, pilaf, as well as other cereal dishes.  At the same time, any slow cooker allows you to cook steamed dishes.  Now about the second type.  A double boiler involves the use of steam for processing products.  So, you can cook fresh food or warm up ready-made meals.  Some models are equipped with a blender. </p><p>  The cooking process in both devices is very slow, but the steamers cope with the task assigned to them a little faster.  <span>The rated power of the</span> devices is usually the same, but the slow cooker will consume more energy, since the processes in it are slower.  A double boiler usually weighs 1.3-1.6 kilograms, and its competitor is about three.  Both units have the same dimensions, but the first can be folded compactly if necessary, and for a multicooker it is worth taking a stationary place.  So it will be more convenient to operate. </p><h2>  <span>Slow cooker, pressure cooker,</span> double boiler: advantages of using </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Slow cooker" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2710/303995.jpg" width="500"></div>  In dishes that are steamed, all useful substances are stored, however, while several dishes are in the double boiler at the same time, their smells are mixed.  A slow cooker allows you to get food that is comparable in quality to that obtained in a Russian oven as a result of cooking.  Its advantages are the availability of program management, as well as multifunctionality.  In a pressure cooker, you can cook a meal several times faster than in other devices, but it requires constant supervision.  A double boiler allows you to simultaneously perform several tasks.  You can prepare baby food and sterilize bottles.
