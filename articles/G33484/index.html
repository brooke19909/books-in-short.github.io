Loans to individuals at Sberbank</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, residents of the post-Soviet space suffer from low pensions and wages.  All this leads to the fact that most people prefer or are forced to take loans from banks.  Of course, a loan helps to cope with most difficulties or simply allows you to purchase your favorite item in a shorter time.  However, taking one loan, citizens often face the fact that they do not have the opportunity to pay monthly installments, as was stated in the contract. </p>

    <p>  In this case, many are wondering whether it is possible to take two loans at once from Sberbank.  The fact is that this bank is considered the most popular credit institution in Russia.  This is not surprising, because it really exists on the market for many years and during this time has gained a solid reputation. </p><h2>  Is it possible to take several loans in one bank </h2><p>  Indeed, this practice exists, and it operates in almost all self-respecting credit institutions.  If we talk about Sberbank, then this is a completely standard situation when a client takes out loans for the purchase of household appliances, and at the same time draws up a mortgage. </p><p>  In addition, in most of these organizations, when applying for more than two loans, the client automatically becomes a regular partner of the bank.  At the same time, you can apply for, for example, a loan for a year at Sberbank and a mortgage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Can I get several consumer loans in one bank? </h2><p>  Sometimes it turns out that a person simply does not have the opportunity to repay the previous loan, and in this case he is simply forced to take on a new debt.  Of course, no one wants to change the bank for this or contact a dubious organization, where the overpayment will be much higher. </p>

    <p>  Loans from Sberbank, conditions, interest rates and numerous programs allow you to simultaneously receive several cash amounts.  To do this, you need to contact the bank branch, draw up documents, after which the application will be considered and, most likely, the organization will make a positive decision. </p><p>  First of all, the positive or negative moment may be affected by the fact that payments on the previous loan were regularly paid.  That is why you should not reach the last moment.  If we talk about obtaining a loan at Sberbank, then it is worth paying all payments.  It is best to arrange a second loan before penalties for the previous debt appeared. </p><p>  In the process of considering the application, the bank usually pays attention to the size of the client’s income.  A second loan can be obtained if the amount of loan payments per month does not exceed 20% of the citizen's salary.  If the percentage ratio is higher, the likelihood that the borrower will receive funds is slightly reduced.  In addition, the bank always pays attention to the credit history.  If before that a client took loans from other organizations or from Sberbank itself, but did not make payments on time, then there is a huge risk that it will be refused to receive funds.  Therefore, when applying for a loan to individuals at Sberbank, it is recommended to hurry. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Can I get a loan in different organizations </h2><p>  Sometimes it turns out that the client’s credit history is not “clean” and it says that the borrower was a malicious non-payer.  In this case, re-obtaining a loan from Sberbank or any other organization becomes impossible. </p>

    <p>  Many believe that if in this case you turn to another credit company, then everything can be started from scratch.  In fact, this is not so, since each bank has access to a common database of debtors. </p><p>  Knowing how many loans can be taken from Sberbank, or rather, that money can be obtained in any amount, it is worth considering the conditions of the bank.  There are several of them. </p><h2>  Surety loans </h2><p>  The minimum loan amount to individuals at Sberbank will depend on how many people act as guarantors of cash payments.  If only one of his friends or relatives is ready to stand up for the borrower, then the loan amount will be from 45 to 300 thousand rubles.  It doesn’t matter in what currency the loan will be issued.  If there are more than two guarantors, then in this case the borrower can count on receiving funds in the amount of 300 to 750 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Emergency loan </h2><p>  In this case, we are talking about a loan at Sberbank for a year or a shorter period of time.  This is an ongoing program, according to which the borrower can receive up to 750 thousand rubles.  However, there is no need to provide material support.  However, in some situations it may be required.  This happens if the borrower's parameters (for example, salary level) do not meet the requirements of the credit institution. </p>

    <h2>  Mixed Collateral Loans </h2><p>  There are several categories of this program.  However, varieties may vary depending on the specific situation.  The amount, maturity and interest rate are determined individually.  In this case, the financial capabilities of the applicant are necessarily taken into account. </p><p>  Speaking about how many loans can be taken from Sberbank, it is worth considering the types of collateral, knowing which, you can successfully receive large amounts of cash: </p><ul><li>  Surety from a citizen of the Russian Federation.  In this case, the guarantor must provide information about his own source of income.  In this case, the age of the voucher does not matter. </li><li>  Surety from the organization.  In this case, you can invite your employer as a guarantor. </li><li>  Property as collateral.  In this case, the apartment or other living space may act as additional security. </li><li>  Houses or apartments under construction in buildings at the same stage. </li><li>  Car. </li><li>  Values.  In this case, jewelry, securities, gold bars, etc. may be used as collateral. </li></ul>

    <h2>  What documents are needed to get a loan </h2><p>  Regardless of the category of the loan and how many loans can be borrowed from Sberbank, potential customers must provide an internal passport of the Russian Federation and the same documents of guarantors.  You also need to prepare a completed application, as well as a certificate confirming the amount of income. </p><p>  If a pensioner applies for a loan, then he also needs to provide a document that will contain information about the amount of his pension. </p><h2>  Disbursement of funds </h2><p>  There are several ways to get cash.  The most popular are cash.  In this case, you can get a loan exclusively in Russian rubles. </p><p>  If the client is already a cardholder, but he has a personal bank account, then the money can be transferred to him. </p>

    <p>  It is also worth paying attention to the possibility of obtaining a credit card. </p><h2>  Features of lending </h2><p>  In addition to how many loans can be borrowed from Sberbank, it is worth paying attention to the fact that if the borrower is a registered resident of Moscow, then he has the right to receive funds in the amount of at least 45 thousand rubles.  For customers living in other regions, the minimum amount is reduced to 15 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The maximum loan size depends on several indicators.  First of all, types of obtaining a loan are considered.  The largest sums of money are received on mortgage lending or on opening your own business. </p>
