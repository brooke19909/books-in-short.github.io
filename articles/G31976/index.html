    <h2>  From the history of the city </h2><p>  It was in the middle of the eleventh century that an important trade route passed through the Kamenka River, on the banks of which the city was built.  In the distant times of Yuri Dolgorukov, Suzdal became the capital of the Grand Duchy of Rostov-Suzdal.  In these places the white-stone architecture of the north-east of Russia was born - in 1152 in the village of Kideksha (Dolgorukov's residence), the magnificent church of Gleb and Boris was built. </p><p>  Under Andrei Bogolyubsky (the son of Yuri Dolgorukov), Vladimir became the capital, and the principality itself began to be called Vladimir-Suzdal.  In the mid-14th century, the status of the capital, but of the <span>Suzdal-Novgorod Principality,</span> returned to the city <span>.</span>  During the Mongol-Tatar invasion, Suzdal was practically destroyed - burned and plundered.  Most of the townspeople were captured.  However, the city was reborn again and already in the middle of the 15th century entered the principality of Moscow.  At the same time, it became the cultural, craft and religious center of Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Monasteries </h2><p>  In the riverine district of Suzdal, on the Kamenka River, there is a female <span>Pokrovsky monastery.</span>  It was built at the beginning of the 14th century.  In the 16th century, women of noble families and even queens were exiled here.  Here they lived out their lives, nobody needed and forgotten by everyone, behind the high and strong monastery walls.  Today it is an operating monastery.  Its center, undoubtedly, is the Intercession Cathedral.  Its main shrines are unique icons and sewing. </p>

    <h2>  Vasilievsky monastery </h2><p>  It was built in the 13th century and was an outpost of the city fortress on the road from the <span>Suzdal Kremlin</span> to Kideksha.  Residents of the city from generation to generation pass the legend that this monastery was erected in honor of Vladimir the Red Sun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Suzdal Kremlin </h2><p>  It is difficult to imagine the sights of Suzdal without this structure.  Although rather it is a complex of ancient architectural monuments.  Entrance to the territory is free, and for visiting museums located here, you need to pay 40-50 rubles.  They work daily, except Tuesday, from 10 to 18 hours. </p>

    <h2>  Museum of Wooden Architecture </h2><p>  Sights of Suzdal are, first of all, monuments of wooden architecture.  At the place where the museum is located today, the Dmitrievsky Monastery was not preserved to this day.  The most valuable exhibits of wooden buildings of the 18-19th centuries from various villages of the Vladimir region were brought here.  So this open-air museum appeared with the Voskresenskaya and Preobrazhenskaya churches, real huts of peasants, rams, barns, and windmills.  The cost of a ticket to this museum is 220 rubles. </p><h2>  Bishops' Chambers </h2><p>  The history of the city is inextricably linked with the life of Metropolitan Hilarion, who ruled the flock of the city for twenty-six years.  Before that, he had been a monk for thirty years.  He was very pious, in every possible way helped destitute and simply unfortunate people.  Any parishioner could turn to him with a request or for advice.  Metropolitan Hilarion lived in the old chambers, but distinguished guests often visited in Suzdal, whom there was nowhere to receive.  Therefore, in the 15th century, not far from the Nativity Cathedral, the new Bishops' Chambers were rebuilt with the Annunciation refectory church and the cross hall.  Kremlin buildings with the help of many galleries and secret passages combined. </p>

    <p>  The new Bishops' chambers are very unusual in their layout.  Harmonious and clear lines blend perfectly with the luxury of decoration and decoration.  The chambers of the palace are spacious and bright.  Here, each detail takes its own place reserved only for it. </p><h2>  Cathedral of the Nativity </h2><p>  It is better for everyone who has arrived in the city for the first time to see the sights of Suzdal from this particular monument.  The cathedral was built in 1148. </p><p>  During the next raid of the Kazan Khan (1445), the cathedral burned, its arches collapsed.  Only in 1530, Tsar Vasily the Third ordered to dismantle the upper part of the cathedral and build on a new one.  Instead of three chapters, five were set.  It is in this form that the cathedral has survived to our time. </p><h2>  Assumption Church </h2><p>  In the 17th century, near the Ilyinsky Tower, which has not been preserved to this day, in the eastern part of the Kremlin, the Assumption Church was built.  It is decorated with a tented bell tower and the aisle of Nikon and Sergius of Radonezh, an elegant fence and turret pillars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="suzdal sights reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/468649.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 1926, a political isolator was located on the territory of the Savior-Euthymius Monastery.  The leadership of this institution "for construction needs" needed a brick.  Before V.I.  Romanovsky, the first director of the Suzdal Museum of Local Lore, faced the most difficult question of which church to give up for destruction - the Assumption or the Afanasyevskaya.  Romanovsky was well aware that his refusal to promote and resolve the "political issue" would inevitably lead to arrest.  After long and painful hesitations, a simpler Afanasyev church was chosen.  However, quite a bit of time passed, and the Assumption Church saved by him suffered a sad fate.  For the same "building needs", the bell tower and chapel were destroyed, which were never restored. </p><p>  This building is somewhat out of the traditional Suzdal style in architecture.  Rather, it is made in the style of Naryshkinsky or Moscow Baroque.  Its delicate and graceful decor, a two-story high drum and a small wide dome are the main features of this style.  It should be noted that he did not take root on Suzdal land. </p><h2>  Monastery of Saint Euthymius </h2><p>  It is located in the north of Suzdal, on the banks of Kamenka.  Built in 1352 by the Prince of Suzdal-Nizhny Novgorod Boris Konstantinovich.  Reliable fortress wall with a length of 1160 meters was built in 1660.  He was assigned the role of a fortress designed to protect the city from enemies.  In the seventeenth century, new fortress walls appeared on the monastery, on which defensive towers appeared.  Spaso-Euthymius Monastery is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p><p>  Today there is a museum in which there are exhibitions and utility services.  Several times a day, visitors to the monastery have the opportunity to hear a bewitching chime.  Entrance to the monastery is paid.  To inspect the territory, you must buy an entrance ticket worth seventy rubles.  You can visit the tour daily, except Monday, from 10 to 18 hours.  Here lies Prince Dmitry Pozharsky. </p>

    <h2>  A trip to Suzdal.  Sights, reviews of tourists </h2><p>  We can safely say that there is no such person on Earth who, having once been in this city, would regret the time spent or the money spent.  Reviews of tourists who once stepped on this ancient land, delighted.  Impressions of the sights seen remain in the memory for a long time. </p><p>  It should be noted that all guests of Suzdal note not only the value of the museum city, but also the hospitality, warmth and sensitivity of the townspeople.  In this regard, foreign tourists are most struck, who are unaware of how completely strangers can so joyfully meet them, proudly show their unique city.  Probably, many of them at this moment are thinking about the mystery of the Russian soul. </p>
