When did the emergence of ancient civilizations?  How did the ancients live?  Many of the stories that were true, already seem to us a fiction - so long ago.  Believe it or not, but now we will be transported to the 4th millennium BC.  and find out who the Sumerians are. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient civilizations" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15562/214378.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  So what happened in such a long time?  On the banks of the rivers settlements began to emerge, which were built around temple complexes.  <span>Sumerian civilization</span> settled in Mesopotamia.  Where did they come from, what was their language and many more questions still have no answer.  By the way, their language is not like any of the other languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world. </p><p>  The ruler was the main person in the state.  He personified not only earthly power, but also performed the will of the gods.  Therefore, the people unconditionally obeyed him, even if he did not agree - is it possible to argue with higher powers?  The temple around which the city was built was also the main public place where important government actions took place, and all the wealth of the city was accumulated here. </p>

Of course, there could not be warm feelings for the invaders, and therefore such agreements were not reliable.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Sumerians believed that the appearance of the gods is humanoid.  Their images were compared with various celestial bodies and planets.  It is worth noting that it was the Sumerians who first began to engage in astronomy, discovered various planets, learned how their change affects people.  Thanks to this, initiates could predict the fate of people and assume what would happen in the future. </p>

The most ancient civilizations influenced modern architecture, as some modern buildings are somewhat similar to the ancient ones.  People worshiped not one god, but several, i.e.  polytheism existed.  One of the rulers temporarily managed to force the people to worship a single god, but since this did not suit many, after the death of the lord, the Sumerians again returned to faith in several gods.

    <p>  The culture was highly developed.  The most ancient civilizations appreciated medicine, mathematics, literature and many other arts that were held in high esteem and constantly studied, and therefore the Sumerians cannot be called uneducated or wild.  Libraries and schools helped people to be knowledgeable, so the people of the long past were smart and understood a lot in the events around them. </p><p>  The legacy of ancient civilizations, namely the Sumerians, is very rich.  Many clay tablets have been found that still cannot be deciphered.  A huge number of sciences and teachings appeared in the Sumerian days, and we still use them.  The system of modern writing is also taken from this wise people.  In general, it is possible to list the skills of the Sumerians for a very long time, since they were surprisingly highly developed and possessed many secrets of their crafts.  It is hoped that soon all of their letters will be unraveled, so that the oldest civilizations will unveil before us the veil of their secrets. </p>
