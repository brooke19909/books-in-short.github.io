    <p>  First of all, travelers are interested in the question of exactly where the Marriott Beach Resort 5 * hotel is located.  Hurghada, or rather, the picturesque coast of the Red Sea - it was here that a large five-star hotel complex was built.  By the way, its location can be considered very successful.  For example, the distance to the old city is only 8 km - it is easy to overcome it by taxi or bus, and in this part of the resort there really is something to do.  About 5 km away is the center of Sakkala.  The distance to the international airport is also quite small at 4 km - the hotel guests do not have to worry about the long journey. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel complex "Marriott" (Egypt): territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  The large hotel occupies a rather impressive territory, which faces directly to the sea.
