    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel in question is located north of the city, on the Red Sea coast.  The city center is 20 kilometers away.  There is no special infrastructure in the vicinity of the hotel, so most tourists leave the Blue Reef Hotel and Resort not only to go on an excursion.  True, there is a supermarket across the street from the hotel, where you can buy everything you need if necessary.  As for the distance from the airports, the distance to the air harbor of Marsa Alam is 40 kilometers, and Hurghada - 277 kilometers.  Therefore, when booking a tour, be sure to ask where exactly you will fly.  And if possible, it is better to stay at the Marsa Alam airport, because in this case it will take you half an hour to get to the hotel.  It takes at least three hours to get to the hotel from Hurghada's air harbor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue reef hotel and resort 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1147517.jpg" width="600"></div>
