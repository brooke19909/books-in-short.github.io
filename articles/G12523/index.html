  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Amsterdam: photos and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A unique city with an intricate system of canals successfully combines modernity and centuries-old traditions.  The charming capital of the Netherlands holds many monuments that will appeal to tourists.  It combines the amazing beauty of nature, the luxury of ancient architecture and tolerance for human vices. </p><h2>  A city grown from a fishing village </h2><p>  The vibrant Amsterdam, whose attractions carry over to past eras, has a special energy.  It attracts millions of travelers seeking to get acquainted with the city, destroying all stereotypes and giving a breath of freedom. </p><p>  The first mention of the Dutch pearl dates back to 1275.  At that time, she was just a small fishing village, grown on the banks of the Amstel River.  Residents built a dam to prevent flooding, and gradually the settlement turned into a port city, with 90 islands separated by canals. </p><h2>  The modern capital of the Netherlands </h2><p>  And now Amsterdam, the sights of which deserve a detailed story, is a densely populated European city that has retained the charm of the Middle Ages.  More than 750 thousand people of 175 nationalities coexist on its territory.  The local population prefers to live on houseboats, moored along the promenades.  In such dwellings, more like barges, there is electricity, gas, sewage.  A true tourist paradise attracts vacationers from many different countries, because you can come here several times and always find something interesting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinpopular.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tourist Mecca - Amsterdam" class="if uuid-2328445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2328445.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions - an ideal option for exploring the city </h2><p>  It is simply impossible to get acquainted with the main attractions of <span>Amsterdam in one day</span> .  For guests visiting it for the first time, it makes sense to start with a sightseeing tour of the capital, lasting two hours.  Tourists will travel to memorable places on a comfortable bus, and everyone will be able to get off at any stop, and then again continue an exciting journey on the same ticket. </p><p>  However, the most impressive way to get to know the amazing city is a waterway cruise that spans the historic center.  Excursions differ in time and route, and a tour of the monuments is accompanied by explanations of the guide, and a glass of sparkling wine.  If local residents prefer to travel around the tourist center on bicycles, then foreigners choose cruises through numerous channels.  You can‚Äôt assume that you got acquainted with the city if you were not on boat excursions that take place both day and night. </p><p>  Surrounded by water, it is compact in size, and in just a few hours you can swim past the main attractions of Amsterdam, connecting the heritage of different eras.  A canal cruise inspires tourists so much that they rent private boats and embark on their own journey, becoming a captain exploring the waterways. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Foreigners love to walk, because a busy city is a wonderful place for such walks, and you can get to the objects of mass pilgrimage of tourists by public transport.  It is best to purchase a city guide that will offer you to follow a special route or build your own, choosing the most interesting places. </p><h2>  Amsterdam main square </h2><p>  Acquaintance with the historical center, where the main attractions of Amsterdam, preserved from the Middle Ages, are concentrated, begins with Dam Square, where it is always crowded.  It was here that Northern Venice was born.  For more than seven centuries, it has been the heart of the Dutch capital.  Derived from the word "dam" (dam), it appeared on the very spot where the inhabitants erected an embankment that regulates water flows and protects the territory from the elements.  Once upon a time, houses on the square were built of wood, but after numerous fires in the 13th century, they began to be built of stone.  Architectural works of various eras and styles look very harmonious, and it is interesting to watch how historical objects combine with multi-colored windows of fashion boutiques. </p><h2>  Royal Palace </h2><p>  A rectangle connecting two old streets, Dam Square is always full of tourists.  Here is the Royal Palace - its main building and the main attraction of Amsterdam (photos and description are presented in the article). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.enjoyourholiday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Palace on Dam Square" class="if uuid-2328458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2328458.jpg"></div><p>  The architectural miracle that appeared in the XVII century, stands on wooden stilts that do not allow a three-story building, decorated with allegorical figures, to descend into the swamp.  Built from yellow sandstone, it looks dark because the porous material has absorbed a lot of dust over several centuries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  New church </h2><p>  One of the most iconic buildings, which are a religious attraction of Amsterdam (photo can be seen below), was built over 70 years.  Numerous fires completely destroyed the church dedicated to Saints Catherine and Mary.  And it was restored for a long time.  Made in the Gothic style, it is famous for its beautiful altar and multi-colored stained-glass windows that cause admiration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.patrimonia.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New Church in Dam Square" class="if uuid-2328476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2328476.jpg"></div><p>  In the temple, the monarchs of the Netherlands are married and crowned, but services are no longer held here.  But everyone will be able to attend concerts of organ music. </p><h2>  Obelisk dedicated to the victims of the Second World War </h2><p>  In the square rises a national monument - an obelisk 22 meters high.  Glorifying the heroes who died during the Second World War, it is lined with calcareous tuff of a snow-white shade.  The attraction of Amsterdam, the photo of which guests are sure to take, evokes mixed feelings.  The stele is decorated with bas-reliefs depicting male figures chained to each other, symbolizing the suffering of the people, and dogs howling at their feet - devotion and despair.  The monument is crowned with a sculpture of a woman holding a child and surrounded by pigeons.  She personifies victory and a new life, as well as liberation from fascist oppression. </p><h2>  Sights of Amsterdam: where to go and what to see? </h2><p>  Dam Square gained fame thanks to a curious museum located on its territory.  Appearing in the XV century, it allows you to meet with the most famous people of not only modernity, but also of past eras. </p><p>  <span>Madame Tussauds</span> Wax Museum <span>,</span> divided into several thematic zones, is a unique exhibition that contains amazing life-size exhibits.  Persons of royal blood, pop divas, popular movie stars, great politicians are waiting for visitors who are happy to take pictures with celebrities.  And the latest technologies used in the institution will make any visit interactive.  Such a reliable image of famous people of all times and eras is a real shock. </p><h2>  City of Contrasts </h2><p>  The city of Amsterdam, the sights of which made its appearance unique, is limited by territorial space.  Man conquered the land from the sea, and the abundance of water determined the architectural originality: there are almost no high-rise buildings, and only the pointed spiers of the churches rise above the capital of the Netherlands. </p><p>  In fact, it is a city of contrasts: here art connoisseurs and freedom-loving hippies, adoring dope, peacefully coexist.  This is a respectable and at the same time liberated city, where drugs are sold, gay marriage and prostitution are allowed.  It is no coincidence that for many people Amsterdam (Netherlands), whose sights reflect its cultural and historical development, is associated with forbidden pleasures. </p><h2>  Coffee Shops </h2><p>  Here, from an early time, trade was more important than religious beliefs and ideology.  The authorities of the city of emigrants decided to control these areas of life, and not to let them go into the shadows.  As practice has shown, drug-related crimes in the Netherlands are several times less than in Europe.  The law does not punish the use and possession of marijuana and hashish, and their sale is carried out in special institutions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iamaileen.com" data-author=": Aileen Adalid, "><img itemprop="image" alt="coffee shops of Amsterdam" class="if uuid-2328436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2328436.jpg"></div><p>  Young people from other countries hurry to coffee shops where you can smoke weed.  At coffeeshop, only soft drugs are sold, and the appearance of "heavy" is excluded.  Just one complaint from neighbors about the violation of public order is enough, as an institution can be closed without the right to obtain a new license. </p><p>  In coffee shops, they don‚Äôt sell alcohol, and the bartender weighs weed on the scales.  Those who are not eighteen years old will not be sold.  Most establishments close at midnight, and only a few work until three in the morning. </p><h2>  Red light district </h2><p>  One of the most popular attractions of Amsterdam is the Red Light District, which is the most vile place on earth for moral guardians.  Tourists visiting the area should know that they have their own rules: you can‚Äôt take pictures or shoot videos, otherwise you may lose your expensive camera.  The obligatory point of the excursion program attracts crowds of visitors who dream of touching the Dutch exotic. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages, a small settlement turned into a large trading port.  Dozens of ships went sailing, and the sailors who went ashore longed for female love.  At that time, all the inhabitants walked along the dark streets, illuminating the path with lanterns.  Residents were outraged by dirty harassment and wanted to protect their daughters and wives from harassment.  Authorities ordered prostitutes to use red-tinted lights, the brightest and most visible from afar. </p><p>  In the XVI century, the administration allocates a separate quarter to the priestesses of love, and taxes all jobs.  Moths do not wander the streets in search of customers, and they themselves come to them at the appointed place.  Women who have the right to do business pay taxes on entrepreneurial activity. </p><h2>  Showcase love </h2><p>  The naked ladies behind the glass, sitting at the ajar windows, do not pay any attention to the guests, but are engaged in their own lives.  If the window is covered with a curtain, then this means that the place is already taken and it is worth knocking on another.  Such a trade in love was called the "shop window".  Someone comes here out of pure interest, and someone wants to relax to the fullest in order to appreciate the taste of forbidden love. </p><div class="photo" data-original="redlightdistricttours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Red light district" class="if uuid-2328481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2328481.jpg"></div><p>  Most often, tourists fill the embankment in the evening, but the lantern does not light up over many windows because the girl worked her shift during the day.  Already no one is surprised that there are a lot of women among those who seek love for money.  Those who want to use the intimate services know that between the Rembrandt Square and the river embankment there are windows of men of the love profession, taking 150 euros for one session. </p><h2>  Exotic Landmark Issues </h2><p>  In recent years, residents of Amsterdam (Netherlands), whose attractions are of great interest, are opposed to the quarter where you can buy love.  They take offense at tourists seeking here only because they are attracted to sexual experiments, and not to the mass of architectural monuments. </p><p>  The city authorities are planning to reduce the number of brothels to a minimum by revoking their licenses.  And they even want to completely change the appearance of the remarkable quarter, which brings more than $ 100 million to the city‚Äôs treasury.  Whatever it was, but it plays an important role in the economy of not only Amsterdam, but the whole country. </p><h2>  Interesting museums </h2><p>  After visiting the unusual sights of Amsterdam (the description is presented in the article), you can go to the erotic museum, located in the same quarter.  Visitors will not see anything lecherous, but hypocrites are better off staying at home.  In addition, minors are not allowed to enter here. </p><p>  Expositions occupying four floors tell about love, and you can easily trace how the ideas of human beauty have changed over the centuries.  There are figurines from Ancient Rome and Egypt, fragrant oils from Mesopotamia, many erotic photographs and modern devices are presented.  Excursions are always informative and interesting. </p><p>  The doors to the curious museum of the <span>canals of Amsterdam,</span> which are the hallmark of the city <span>,</span> are open for everyone.  Tourists will be able to go on an interactive tour that does not replace a real walk.  It is during a smooth glide on the water surface that guests breathing in the smell of a damp tree are imbued with the unique atmosphere of a noisy city. </p><h2>  Royal flower park </h2><p>  Tourist Mecca for many is associated not only with bridges and canals, but also with tulips.  Therefore, once here, you must visit the royal flower park, whose gardens are known even outside the country.  The beautiful Keukenhof is one of the main attractions of Amsterdam.  A city in the Netherlands boasts huge plantations where you can find the rarest varieties of bulb plants.  Some tulips cost as much as an expensive car. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.costerdiamonds.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Keukenhof Park" class="if uuid-2328485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2328485.jpg"></div><p>  During flowering, a wonderful park is visited by more than a million people who are eager to see with their own eyes what previously had to be read in magazines. </p><h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists about Amsterdam, the sights of which reflect its diversity, are full of enthusiasm.  Travelers agree on one thing: this city was created for entertainment, not for living. </p><p>  Guests are advised to rent a bicycle to get acquainted with the main monuments, because some of them are hidden in the most hidden corners.  As vacationers admit, cute houses, tilted in different directions, immediately attract attention.  Since the tourist paradise was erected in a swampy area, all structures were built on stilts, which rotted over time, and houses were skewed. </p><p>  Of course, Amsterdam cannot be imagined without a network of picturesque canals forming concentric belts around a settlement.  This seems surprising, but longboats and boats moored off the coast are a haven for local residents, as housing has always been a big problem.  More recently, floating hotels on the water appeared in the city, which began to enjoy unprecedented success, since living in them is much cheaper than standing on land. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinpopular.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The beauty of Amsterdam" class="if uuid-2328492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2328492.jpg"></div><p>  A unique kaleidoscope city with an unusual atmosphere captivates with its beauty at first sight.  The sights of Amsterdam (reviews of tourists only confirm this) are becoming a subject of admiration.  They attract guests from many different countries, and whatever the purpose of the trip of travelers, some monuments must be seen. </p>
