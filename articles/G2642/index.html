Do not believe it!  Although the city on <span>the Weser River is</span> small, it is extremely interesting from a tourist point of view.  Let's talk about the sights of Bremen.  Photos and descriptions of the most interesting are presented in this material. </p><h2>  Bremen Town Hall </h2><p>  Going on a mini-journey through Bremen is best from the very heart of the city - from the Market Square.  The thing is that several must see are located here at once - objects that every tourist should visit.  First of all, <span>it is the town hall.</span>  Looking here, you can not only get acquainted with the magnificent interiors in the halls where important meetings and meetings were held before, but also taste over six hundred varieties of wines.  By the way, the most aged drink stored in the cellars of the Bremen Town Hall dates back to 1723. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bremen-tourism.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bremen Town Hall" class="if uuid-2316532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2316532.jpg"></div><p>  This building was erected in 1405-1410.  Exactly two centuries later, a large-scale reconstruction began here.  Moreover, this did not happen because during this time the building collapsed.  It simply seemed to the local authorities that the town hall looked too modest.  The appearance that this object took in the early 1600s has been preserved to this day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the Bremen Town Hall almost miraculously survived during the Second World War.  Today, this landmark of Bremen is open to visitors.  You can just take a walk, or you can look into the restaurant, which is located here. </p><h2>  Bremen Theater </h2><p>  Want to pass an evening or two in Bremen?  Pay attention to the city theater.  The uniqueness of this place lies in the fact that you can visit both the classical opera or ballet, as well as watch musicals and dramas.  In addition, the theater hosts concerts of jazz music and <span>poetry evenings.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livekritik.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bremen Theater" class="if uuid-2316535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2316535.jpg"></div><p>  The history of this landmark of Bremen began in 1914.  The snow-white building cannot be confused with any other city institution.  <span>The Melpomene Temple is</span> built in the best traditions of the classical style, its main entrance is decorated with tall columns.  During the Second World War, the Bremen Theater was badly damaged, and therefore it was repeatedly reconstructed.  Recent work took place here in the early 2000s.  Then the builders raised the roof, columns were installed in front of the entrance.  At the same time, the auditorium was enlarged.  Today it is capable of simultaneously accommodating 800 people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Museums Botcherstrasse </h2><p>  These sights of Bremen (Germany) are located in the city center, on the street of the same name, which is famous for its unique ornamental brick architecture.  The common word ‚Äúmuseums‚Äù, of course, means the museum of Ludwig Roselius, the museum of Paula Moderson-Becker.  The latter, by the way, can be called the first museum in the world that is dedicated to the works of a female artist.  Paula Moderson-Becker died at 31, but at that time she had already managed to create about 750 paintings and more than a thousand drawings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paula Moderson-Becker Museum" class="if uuid-2316540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2316540.jpg"></div><p>  In the house of Roselius, built in the Renaissance style, the museum was opened in 1928.  Here you can see collections of objects of Northern European decorative and applied art: there are carpets, wallpapers, household items, furniture.  All these items provide an opportunity to get acquainted with the lifestyle of the middle class in Northern Germany.  In addition, there are valuable sculptures and paintings of the Middle Ages, made in the Baroque and Renaissance. </p><h2>  Museum "Universum" </h2><p>  This attraction in Bremen is a huge scientific center, which has gathered under the roof about 2.5 hundred interactive exhibits that are able to show the most vivid and unique phenomena occurring in the human body, on our planet and even in space.  Interactive stations located in this museum simulate tornadoes, earthquakes, demonstrate the work of all human senses.  Here you can learn more about space. </p><div class="photo" data-original="universum-bremen.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum &quot;Universum&quot;" class="if uuid-2316544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2316544.jpg"></div><p>  The special popularity of the Universum Museum can be explained by the fact that here you can not only view exhibits, but also conduct various experiments.  It was opened in 2000 and for more than 17 years has been turning ordinary excursions into fascinating travels.  This attraction of Bremen even attracts attention with its external appearance: the shape of the building resembles some kind of futuristic whale, and therefore it, like a magnet, attracts foreigners. </p><h2>  Monument to the Bremen Town Musicians </h2><p>  Probably there is not a single tourist who was in the city on the Weser River and did not take a photo next to the heroes of the popular fairy tale of the Brothers Grimm.  The landmark of Bremen (pictured) is located on the market square.  City guests call it a symbol of the city.  This is a kind of pyramid of characters standing on top of each other: a dog stands on a donkey, a cat on a dog, and a rooster on the top.  There are so many people who want to take a picture against the background of wandering musicians that there is always a crowd of people next to the monument, sometimes even a queue forms here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bremen-tourismus.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the Bremen Town Musicians" class="if uuid-2316546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2316546.jpg"></div><p>  The monument appeared on the streets of the city in 1951, its author is the famous German sculptor Gerhard Marx.  There is a tradition, compliance with which can fulfill any desire, tourists say: you need to hold both donkey legs with your hands and rub them a little.  Judging by how badly the limbs of the Bremen musician are worn out, this tradition is observed by a large number of city guests.  By the way, you need to hold your hands precisely on the two legs of the animal, otherwise you can hear the phrase that is established in Bremen: "One" donkey "greets another." </p><h2>  Saint Paul's Cathedral </h2><p>  What to see in Bremen?  The attraction, which is located on a place favorable from a tourist point of view and is able to tell a centuries-old history, is St. Peter's Basilica.  Its construction began in the 9th century.  Then the construction was dragged on for four hundred years.  It was in this form that the monastery existed for a very long time.  The first reconstruction was needed only in the 19th century.  The second time, large-scale work was carried out here after the Second World War. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bremen-tourism.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saint Paul's Cathedral" class="if uuid-2316548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2316548.jpg"></div><p>  A regular excursion includes an inspection of the interior of the cathedral.  If you wish, you can climb to the observation deck.  Tourists note - for this you will have to overcome 265 steps along a narrow staircase located in the south tower.  In addition, visitors have the opportunity to see about 120 species of various plants that are mentioned in the Bible!  If you do not have any prejudices regarding mummified bodies, we recommend that you look into the crypt located in the cathedral. </p><h2>  Art Museum </h2><p>  Among the most interesting objects that guests of the city should visit is the art museum, also called Kunsthalle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.burgdame.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Art Museum of Bremen" class="if uuid-2316549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43958/2316549.jpg"></div><p>  This museum is located on the Cultural Mile, not far from the Old Town.  The collection presents the work of Monet and Manet, Cezanne, van Gogh.  The history of this place began in 1823.  Then an art society appeared in the city, which included more than 30 businessmen and art lovers.  Over the course of ten years, they managed to assemble a collection of four and a half thousand works.  In 1847, the construction of the building for the museum began in Bremen; it was completed two years later.  During the Second World War, the gallery was closed, and in 1942 an incendiary bomb hit the museum.  Then six halls were destroyed at once.  After that, it was decided to evacuate the surviving exhibits.  At the end of the war, enormous restoration work took place, and the paintings and sculptures were returned to the museum. </p>
