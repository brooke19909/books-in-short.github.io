Adults and children of all ages love this element of the holiday, which with one look evokes a good high spirits.  And while some, in anticipation of a festive event, turn to special companies to prepare for the holidays, others, on the contrary, prefer to arrange the event on their own.  However, if you buy and inflate the balls does not seem something excessive, then creating a beautiful composition from them does not always work.  In today's article, we will share <span>how to make a garland</span> of balls that will delight everyone gathered. </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  Before you get to work, you need to determine exactly what in the end you want to do.  The first is the color scheme.  It is usually selected in accordance with the overall decor and style of the event.  For a garland, it is better to choose from two or more colors of balls.  The best and brightest solutions are usually garlands of two colors of different contrasts.  Red and white.  Burgundy and green.  Blue and black. </p><p>  The second is the size of the balls.  Decide what you want to achieve from the garland.  If you need something noticeable, airy and voluminous, then feel free to choose large balloons for work.  If you need to make an exquisite decoration and emphasize the elegance of the decor, then small balls are more suitable.  However, most often for garland both sizes are used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.car-realtor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wedding decorations" class="if uuid-2412274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2412274.jpg"></div><h2>  Learning to perform the Quartet </h2><p>  The first thing to learn is the so-called four of the balls.  Learning how to do it, you can easily begin to perform garlands of varying degrees of complexity.  To do this, inflate four identical balls and pair them with each other at the tips.  And then tie the pairs together.  You should get a "cross" or in another way a "four". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sadtohappyproject.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="four of balls" class="if uuid-2412290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2412290.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a garland </h2><p>  After the color scheme is chosen and the balloons are prepared, it's time to learn how to make a garland of balloons with your own hands.  Step-by-step instructions will help you: </p><ol><li>  Make thin fishing line and narrow tape.  The fishing line will serve as some basis for our garland.  And adhesive tape will strengthen the balls on it more firmly. </li><li>  Divide the balls into pairs and tie one with the other with ponytails.  You can use a thread for this purpose. </li><li>  Take the fishing line and cut off the length of the intended garland, adding one meter on each side.  This is necessary in order to have a garland for what. </li><li>  Twist around it two pairs of balls to get a "four".  Next, fix the balls with tape. </li><li>  Gradually increase the design of the garland, tightly moving each new ‚Äúfour‚Äù balls to the existing ones.  After each fix, check if your work is harmonious. </li><li>  When stringing balls, you need to adhere to a checkerboard pattern in their location. </li><li>  After finishing work, twist the fishing line several times, for greater structural strength. </li><li>  If desired, you can decorate the ends of the garland with paper or rain brushes.  Or attach one ball on each side of the opposite size. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="prettylittlepartyshop.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bright garland" class="if uuid-2412235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2412235.jpg"></div><p>  Following all the steps in turn, in the end you will get a garland of balls with a pattern of "spiral".  If you want a striped garland, then each "four" should consist of balls of the same color.  Alternating two or more colors, you will get a bright and unusual decoration. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Larger Garlands </h2><p>  If you need a garland of balls of larger diameter and size, then, following the above instructions, you can create a garland by taking not two pairs of connected balls, but three or five pairs.  Then the garland will be wider. </p><p>  If the fishing line is not suitable as a frame because of its subtlety, then it can be replaced with a thicker base.  For example, a tourniquet or thick wire. </p><h2>  What can be done from a garland? </h2><p>  There are a large number of options for how to use a garland of balls.  Here are some examples of this decor: </p><ul><li>  Car.  Often, cars intended for a wedding celebration are decorated with garlands, attaching them to the hood. </li><li>  Walls.  A universal way to decorate a room is to decorate the walls.  And garlands are the best suited for this occasion. </li><li>  Figures.  In honor of the birthday of a child or a loved one, you can make an increased number indicating the age of the birthday person. </li><li>  Arch.  A great way to emphasize a specific place in a gala hall.  For example, on the wedding day it is a table of the newlyweds.  Or a wedding arch.  And on your birthday - a table with a birthday cake or a table for arranging gifts. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestballoonscork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ball arch" class="if uuid-2412252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2412252.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Stairs.  Beautifully decorated stair railing will add solemnity and mood to guests, starting from the entrance. </li></ul><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  In order for your garland of balloons to turn out exactly the way you conceived it for yourself, remember a few recommendations: </p><ul><li>  So that the garland does not sag or does not fall off at all, adhere to the rule: no more than 50 cm between the fixation points. </li><li>  If the event is planned on the street, then the weather can present an unpleasant surprise and blow the garland away with the wind.  To prevent this from happening, string the "fours" as tightly as possible to each other so that the garland at the end is elastic and even solid. </li><li>  So that one of the guests does not accidentally touch one of the balls, bursting it, place the garland above the average height of those present. </li><li>  To ensure that the resulting pattern does not deteriorate over time, use as many fixation points to the fishing line or other base as possible. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.balloonpresents.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="minnie mouse balls" class="if uuid-2412319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2412319.jpg"></div><ul><li>  If the balloons are filled with helium, the garland should be expanded in a horizontal position.  And if by air, then in the vertical. </li><li>  For a small room, do not use a garland of large balls.  Choose medium and small. </li></ul><p>  Try different options and colors.  Your loved ones will certainly appreciate your efforts! </p>
