Every year, many hotels here hospitably open the doors for vacationers, sometimes offering the most unexpected entertainment and services.  Forest Park hotel is one of the most popular services.

    <h2>  Location and surroundings </h2><p>  In the north of Greece is the peninsula of Halkidiki, which has an unusual shape, visually resembling a three-finger hand.  The western section was called Kassandra.  It is here that the three-star Forest Park Hotel is located.  It took an advantageous place on a green hill with a gorgeous view of the bays and the boundless sea, between the two resort villages of Kriopigi (1.5 km) and Kallithea (2.5 km). </p><p>  The surrounding area is devoid of city bustle and noise.  Around the hotel are concentrated coniferous forests and thickets of thyme.  Therefore, tourists who come here are immersed in an atmosphere of complete harmony, silence, fresh, pleasantly intoxicating air and unity with nature.  If soon such a landscape will bore guests, they can go to the neighboring village of Kallithea, famous for its abundance of entertainment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The climate on the Greek peninsula is mild.  The influx of tourists is mainly recorded during the summer season.  The average air temperature in the period from June to August is approximately 25-27 degrees.  However, there are especially hot days (up to 37 degrees).  Autumn on Halkidiki is more like the beginning of summer, so September and October are also a great time to relax here.  Temperatures range between 21 and 23 degrees. </p><p>  The upper layers of the sea begin to warm up in the spring, so by the tourist season it becomes welcoming and affectionate.  And on hot days it literally saves vacationers with pleasant coolness and light breezes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Forest Park hotel 3" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1409163.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Forest Park hotel, Halkidiki in general, is an ideal place for a wellness holiday with children.  This is facilitated by the gentle climate, sea air and the amazing vegetation of the peninsula.  The hotel has an outdoor freshwater pool with sun loungers and umbrellas resting next to it.  It is located just below the hotel building, so the administration provides a poolside bar with a friendly and timely service for snacks and drinks. </p><p>  Once a week, a Greek evening is held at the hotel, which demonstrates the warm hospitality and hospitality of the owners of the Forest Park hotel.  Kassandra throughout its territory on such evenings prepares programs for guests with Greek music, dancing, famous wines and culinary delights.  In a word, it treats everyone with what the Greek culture can please. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  For younger tourists, a children's section of the pool is provided.  There is no venue, but if you want to organize a holiday, there are animators.  Also, for children, a fascinating walk through the pine forest or playing in the property‚Äôs garden, which is the property of the hotel, can be useful. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The second beach line, on which the Forest Park hotel 3 * (Halkidiki) is located, is not equipped with modern attractions.  Therefore, here you can enjoy the freshness of sea breezes and the whisper of splashing waves.  The distance from the hotel to the seashore is 250 m. Sand and pebble beach for a fee provides the necessary sun loungers, awnings, mattresses, etc. Changing rooms and a toilet also work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Forest Park hotel 3 Halkidiki" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1409165.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Forest Park hotel 3 * is a budget vacation option.  The service has an official site, which presents the whole variety of services, entertainment, menus in the restaurant and bars.  The gallery presented by the administration of Forest Park hotel is noteworthy for acquaintance.  Photos detail the decor of the rooms, as well as the prices for them.  Of course, the cost is changing relative to the season.  The highest are in July and August. </p><p>  The approximate range in figures is from 42 to 46 euros per double room (per day).  This price includes meals (breakfast and dinner) and the right to use all the amenities of the service.  You can contact the hotel by phone numbers or by letter on the site itself.  In this case, vacationers themselves book tickets, and administrations send a flight number to arrange a transfer from the airport to the hotel. </p><p>  However, you can use the services of travel agencies, which will take on all organizational issues.  But the ticket in this case will be a little more expensive. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  It is difficult to guess how the Forest Park hotel 3 * will actually appear in reality.  Greece, Halkidiki in particular, always receives rather flattering reviews not only about cultural and natural resources, but also about its service.  However, in this country it is quite contrasting.  Therefore, people tend to trust the opinions of those who have already seen the inside of a certain service and are ready to share useful information.  As for the Forest Park hotel, reviews about it as a three-star hotel are quite controversial.  And they are largely justified by the human factor.  After all, the psychology of any Russian tourist is designed so that when traveling to Europe, I want to get into absolute comfort and enjoy European, elite service.  But in reality it often happens differently, which naturally causes discontent. </p><p>  We will get acquainted with the opinions of Russian travelers who have already visited the Forest Park hotel and weigh the pros and cons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Forest Park hotel Halkidiki" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1409167.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  pros </h2><ul><li>  Tourists attributed the incredibly picturesque nature, well-groomed territory and the hospitality of the hotel staff to the unique advantages of the Greek service on the Halkidiki peninsula.  All employees speak Russian, so there is no difficulty in understanding each other. </li><li>  At the airport, guests are greeted by a comfortable bus that quickly delivers passengers to their seats.  Since the hotel is located on a hill, vehicles cannot drive close to it.  Therefore, to lift the suitcases, guests are greeted either by friendly guides or hotel service staff.  Accommodation by numbers also occurs without delay. </li><li>  Despite the fact that the Forest Park hotel 3 * (Greece) is considered a mini-hotel, it occupies a rather large area.  Inside there is a lot of space, the rooms are quite free and not constrained by an abundance of furniture.  Everything is furnished economically, but tastefully.  There are no touches emphasizing luxury, respectability.  But on the other hand, laconicism of style with light tones of decoration and modest furniture create coziness and harmony.  Tourists note the cleanliness of the rooms and the surrounding area. </li><li>  Breakfasts and dinners offered by the service are delicious, fresh, nutritious, but without frills.  Lunch is paid separately, or you can buy what you need at a minimarket and take it with you to the beach.  The cocktail menu in the bars is varied, aimed at children and adults. </li><li>  The pool is located just below the restaurant.  Water in it changes daily, sunbeds and umbrellas are free.  But it was invented rather for those who do not want to go down to the sea.  Since the beach, which is surrounded by pine trees, was especially emotionally and positively evaluated.  White sand, sometimes pebbles - a magnificent and free foot massage.  The bottom is sandy, smooth entrance to the sea.  On the shore there is a rental of sunbeds and umbrellas for 7 euros.  However, tourists with a savvy mind, having decided to save money, buy mats in a minimarket and relax in the shade of trees. </li><li>  Forest Park hotel - a secluded corner, literally divorced from the usual noisy civilization.  Here you will not find nightclubs and entertainment centers.  But they are 2.5 kilometers from the hotel.  You can get to the place on foot for half an hour, or by taxi.  Entertainment for every taste offers the village of Kallithea.  But you should stock up on several hundred euros, since all the pleasures are paid.  According to reviews, for example, entrance to a night club costs about 8-10 euros.  The hotel has guides who can book an excursion to the nearest cities of the Halkidiki peninsula (Meteora and Thessaloniki), walk through the ancient ruins and get acquainted with the history of Greece. </li><li>  And finally, the biggest plus, which most tourists agreed with, is affordable prices for all hotel services. </li></ul><h2>  Minuses </h2><ul><li>  Despite the bright advertising with a detailed, long list of services, there are no animations for children at Forest Park hotel 3 *.  Although, according to experts, it should not be.  This is consistent with the category of three stars. </li><li>  Some tourists did not like the location of the beach.  Although the distance to it is only 250 meters, it is necessary to overcome it in the descent from the hill on which the hotel is located.  And even if steps down are easily overcome, the rise after a day full of swimming and sunshine guarantees some difficulties. </li><li>  Downstairs, not far from the hotel runs a busy highway.  There are no traffic lights, no pedestrian crossings, or a speed bump.  Sometimes tourists need to switch sides.  To do this, you literally have to cross the track.  Also, accidents often occur on this stretch of road near the hotel.  Therefore, staff does not recommend letting go of children.  And at the same time, she is not trying to solve the problem. </li><li>  For people resting in a hotel in high season, a good minus was good audibility in the rooms.  Tourists who visited the hotel in June or September noted a small number of guests, which were very pleased. </li></ul><h2>  Summary </h2>

Halkidiki, Kassandra in particular, is officially a resort area, but, apparently, is very peculiar.  Of course, advertising resources provide a lot of truthful information.  But sometimes it is slightly exaggerated.  Therefore, going to Greece in the Forest Park hotel, you should immediately carefully think everything over, weigh and be prepared for certain roughnesses so that they do not spoil the long-awaited vacation.
