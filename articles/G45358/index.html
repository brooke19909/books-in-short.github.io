    <p>  Sviyazhsk passed from a military fortress to the status of a county town in the 16th century.  In the XVIII-XIX centuries, it becomes a monastery town.  Sviyazhsk is considered the first Christian city in the Kazan region.  The island was constantly under construction.  Monasteries, temples, bell towers were erected.  In the period of the XIX-XX centuries, stone and wooden construction were widely used, which has survived to this day. </p><p>  The period of revolution for the city was tragic: churches were closed, prisons and hospitals for the mentally ill were created from them.  As a result of the construction of the Kuibyshev reservoir in the middle of the 20th year, the city was on an island.  Now Sviyazhsk is a rural settlement. </p><h2>  Rebirth </h2><p>  The history of the past - ruined houses, temples, lack of roads, <span>social problems</span> - turned the island into a ghost.  So that the city did not die completely and did not sink into oblivion, it was required to breathe new life into it and fill it with power.  It was necessary to restore and restore the temples, needed strength for the construction. </p>
