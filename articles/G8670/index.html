What to do if SMS is not sent?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  So, today we will talk with you about why SMS is not sent from the phone.  In addition, we will try to understand what may be the reason for such behavior, and also learn how to correct the situation for the better.  Indeed, sometimes this is done quite easily.  Let's get down to exploring our current issue as soon as possible. </p><h2>  Phone settings </h2><p>  So, it is worth starting with the most likely scenario.  If you do not receive SMS ("Beeline", "MTS" or any other operator), you will have to pay attention to the settings of your phone.  Maybe there is a ban on receiving / transmitting data.  In other words, a lock. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Why SMS is not sent from the phone" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/853205.jpg" width="448"></div>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  As a rule, you can correct the situation by changing the settings.  Usually they are in the "Communication" or "Network" section.  If you do not know how to deal with your gadget and configure it, then contact a specialized service for help.  There you will certainly be helped to solve the problem.  Only there are a number of rather interesting cases when SMS from the phone is not sent.  Let's get to know them as soon as possible, and also learn how to correct the situation. </p><h2>  Network settings </h2><p>  Here is one more reason for problems with sending messages.  In fact, this particular scenario is most likely.  Especially if you just inserted a new SIM card into your phone.  Of course, we are talking about network settings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, for example, if you bought and inserted a Megafon SIM card into your gadget, SMS will not be sent - do not be surprised.  Instead of immediately sending messages, just wait a while.  This applies to any mobile operator.  You should receive special network settings.  Open the message sent by the system, and then save it.  Ultimately, you will see a message about changing settings.  Only after that you can fully use the new SIM card.  Try to see if everything is fine with sending messages.  Not?  Then let's think further, what could be the matter. </p>

    <h2>  Balance </h2><p>  Well, here is another rather interesting and common reason why SMS is not sent from the phone.  Of course, we are talking about the balance of your mobile account. </p><p>  The thing is that if the SIM card does not have enough funds to send or call, then these features will be temporarily blocked for you.  That is, they can call / write you, but you can‚Äôt.  Thus, if you do not send SMS (Beeline, MTS and other operators), then it makes sense to check the balance of the phone. </p><p>  If it is positive, do not rush to rejoice.  In cases where the user has a balance in the ‚Äúplus‚Äù, but there are not enough funds to send a letter, he will also not be able to carry out the idea.  If your phone is in the ‚Äúminus‚Äù, then you just need to top up your account with positive numbers, which will be enough to send SMS and make calls.  As you can see, so far there is nothing difficult.  You already know the main reasons why SMS is not sent (Samsung or any other phone model - it doesn‚Äôt matter).  Now it is worth getting acquainted with other options for the development of events.  In fact, there are still quite a lot of them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  System crashes </h2><p>  Well, now it‚Äôs worth learning about another rather interesting option.  For example, when SMS is not sent to Android.  If you are faced with this situation, then let's try to figure it out. </p>

    <p>  The thing is that quite often new versions and various updates are released on the basis of Android.  Moreover, modern users are literally required to download them.  So, after you perform this action, you may have a problem today.  After all, the cause of everything will be the most common failure. </p><p>  Fortunately, the situation can be rectified quite easily and simply.  It is enough just to return the so-called factory settings to the phone.  That is, by default.  After that, you can resume attempts to work with messages.  Now you know another reason why SMS is not sent from the phone.  But this is far from all.  We continue our conversation, trying to figure out all the possible sources of the problem.  Let‚Äôs see what else could be the matter. </p><h2>  Operator work </h2><p>  Next, we turn to our mobile operator.  For example, to MTS.  Why are not SMS sent to those who use this operator, but others have everything in perfect order? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The thing is that quite often various kinds of work and updates are carried out on communication lines.  That is why you may have today's problem.  If the cellular operator (any) checks the innovation or carries out technical work, then, of course, network failures are possible.  And, as a result, the inability to send messages, as well as making calls. </p>

    <p>  What to do?  Of course, nothing depends on you here.  All you can do is call from any other phone (you can from your home) to your operator and find out what is the matter.  If the matter is in technical works or "updates", then you will be surely informed when the situation is supposedly to return to the previous course.  Otherwise, this scenario is not suitable for you.  You will have to look for other reasons why SMS is not sent from the phone. </p><h2>  Fake </h2><p>  Such reasons are still sufficient.  And there were only those that are extremely simple to understand for any modern user.  Only correction of the situation in some provisions will be very expensive. </p><p>  If you think <span>why SMS is not sent from your phone,</span> then be sure to remember what kind of mobile phone you have.  A fairly common reason for this behavior is the presence of a fake gadget.  This may be a reasonable and deliberate purchase (if you originally went for the "pirated" version of the mobile), or it may be the simplest trick of the buyer. </p><p>  Thus, here you have several options for the development of events.  The first option is when you consciously bought a fake.  In this case, if you have a guarantee for the goods, you can take it to the store where the purchase was made.  There they should help you rectify the situation - repair the purchased model or offer a similar new one.  Unfortunately, many stores selling fakes do not offer any guarantees.  In this case, you just have to buy a new gadget. </p>

    <p>  The second scenario is suitable for those who fell victim to scammers in a normal store.  Contact the place where the purchase was made and declare a fake.  You must replace it with the original gadget that you wanted to purchase.  If employees refuse to correct the situation if they have all the documents confirming the purchase, you can safely go to court.  Quite often, along with the exchange of a gadget in this case, they also compensate <span>moral damage</span> .  But not always so good.  Let's think about why SMS is not sent from a phone that is original and fully configured. </p><h2>  Viruses </h2><p>  And now we will get acquainted with the most common and most unpleasant situation, which can only relate to our current topic.  The thing is that if you suddenly stopped sending SMS from your mobile phone, you will have to think carefully about what kind of documents we downloaded onto our gadget, as well as which website on the Internet we climbed.  After all, it will now be about viruses.  Not about the computer, but about the telephone. </p>

    <p>  This kind of infection, to be honest, is more dangerous than computer.  After all, getting rid of telephone viruses is much more difficult.  With computer, everything is simple - delete the infected file, and the job is done.  But with telephone viruses, you have to try pretty hard. </p><p>  In general, you will have to install an antivirus on your gadget and conduct a scan.  Next - delete everything that is labeled ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù, and then contact specialists for help.  To be honest, if you suspect a <span>virus attack, it is</span> preferable to immediately contact service centers.  It will be very, very difficult to cope with this situation independently. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Well, the time has come to end our conversation.  Today we figured out why SMS is not sent from the phone.  As you can see, there are a lot of possible situations.  And most of them can be defeated on their own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sms not sent" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/853209.jpg"></div>
