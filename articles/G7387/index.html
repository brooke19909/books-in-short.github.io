  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What types of soils exist</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you ask a farmer who adheres to the principles of organic farming about what types of soil exist, he will no doubt answer this question with knowledge of the matter.  Understanding or at least understanding the difference in soils is the basis of its good yields, the correct (read - wise) approach to improving fertility and ultimately the health and well-being of the whole family.  Of course, with the modern technologies of agribusiness, the concept of “soil types” in the fields has partially lost its significance: the industrial method of growing plants is based on fertilizers, growth stimulants, and other auxiliary “chemistry”. </p><p>  Quite a curious fact: despite the importance of land for humans, there is still <span>no</span> single global standard, so in each country the types of soils are interpreted in their own way.  Of course, there were attempts to create a standard - this is the “FAO Classification” and the newer “Soil Resource Base”, but the issue has not been completely resolved.  As an example, we can recall <span>the SI system: it</span> seems to be global, universal, but miles, feet, etc. are still used in many countries. Studying the types of soils in Russia, one may encounter the fact that many still use the outdated classification of the Soviet Union, back in 1977 year of publication.  Few people know that it is based on the work of the Dokuchaev Soil Institute from 1967.  All this despite the fact that already in 2004 a radically updated edition of the New Classification was published. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When classifying soil types, one must understand the difference between the terms “type” and “type”.  So, the type of soil is a classification unit, indicating differences in the severity and intensity of soil formation processes of the site in question, which are the basis for a more general division into genus, subtype and type.  The latter, in turn, is a generalizing unit of classification that determines the sum of properties based on the features of the processes and modes of soil formation.  It also takes into account genetic horizons. </p><p>  So, there are the following types of soil: </p><p>  - Peat bogs.  Very fertile.  The features include the possible subsidence of the level and gradual waterlogging.  <span>Peat bogs,</span> as a rule, give an acid reaction, so this must be taken into account and strive to restore the balance between alkali and acid.  For example, for small areas, lime or ash can be added. </p><p>  - Solonetsy.  The name itself suggests that these soils in large quantities contain salt (the same, food, NaCl).  When the snow melts, it retains moisture for a long time, and after drying it gains excessive strength.  It’s difficult to get a crop without preparation.  Usually, gypsum or lime is added in the first year, and fertilizers (manure) in the second year. </p><p>  - Sandy.  Due to the increased sand content, such soil almost does not retain moisture and does not favor the formation of a layer of humus.  Humus is added (one 10-liter bucket per square meter) and, occasionally, clay that binds the particles. </p><p>  - Clay.  Accumulates moisture, interfering with normal plant growth.  Usually acidified.  Reduce the density by adding humus, turf, acid "quench" lime.  When autumn digging, the beds are left large. </p><p>  The main <span>soil types are</span> represented by a rather extensive list.  This includes chernozems, forest soils, meadow, steppe, sandy, brown, gray, etc. There is a simple folk way to determine the type: you need to take a handful of moist earth (there should be no dirt, no scattering from dryness), roll up a round timber and try to connect the edges "To the bagel."  Rolled up, but crumbles - sandy soil.  It does not roll at all - sand prevails.  Cracked “bagel” - means loam.  Everything ideally rolls and joins - clay soil.  Once again, we draw attention to the fact that such an experiment must be performed at optimal humidity. </p>
