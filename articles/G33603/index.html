This rather high-quality device only in the summer reached the shelves in our country.  I would like to note that this smartphone has become interesting due to a very active and vibrant advertising company.  About the Galaxy Core line, probably only the one who does not hear and does not see at the same time does not know. </p>

    <p>  More than a year has already passed since the release.  I wonder what rating users gave this gadget?  Let's do a little analysis of the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Core, the reviews for which at the moment are pretty different.  And we will draw our conclusions. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The modern mobile device Samsung Galaxy Core, due to its rather high-quality screen, produces an excellent picture.  The diagonal of the TFT-display is 4.3 inches, which is a good indicator for a device of this price category.  The matrix has a resolution of 800x480 pixels.  It is worth noting that on such a screen it is very easy not only to surf the Internet, but also to edit various kinds of documents.  Quite wide viewing angles and the most natural color gamut are not typical for models of this class, but Samsung awarded its Galaxy Core with just such a display.  Having collected all the characteristics of the screen, adding to them a good sensitive sensor and multi-touch, we get almost perfect characteristics, for which it is worth loving this smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy Core gadget has a great advantage over its counterparts precisely because of its high performance.  Naturally, now you can already find quad-core smartphones, but at the time of release the two cores that this gadget had were very distinguished from the usual weak Android phones.  The indicator of each core is 1.2 GHz.  Complete with 1 GB of RAM, they make the smartphone ‚Äúfly‚Äù.  Naturally, Galaxy Core will not pull very strong applications, but full-fledged work with an average level is provided. </p>

    <p>  The built-in memory of 8 GB makes it possible to store video, music and photos.  Naturally, it is not enough for active use.  For this reason, there is also a <span>memory</span> expansion <span>with a microSD card up</span> to 64 GB. </p><p>  The GPU is quite powerful, both on a mid-range device.  You can be sure that jerks and all kinds of ‚Äúlags‚Äù in demanding games will not be found. </p><h2>  Dual SIM Function </h2><p>  The modern mobile device Samsung Galaxy Core does not exclude the possibility of using two SIM cards.  They fully function independently of each other.  Naturally, this solution is pretty good, but it also increases battery consumption, which significantly affects the operating time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The smartphone we are considering has two cameras: the main and front.  The first is also equipped with an LED flash.  <span>The front camera</span> has at its disposal a 0.3 megapixel sensor.  It is not enough to take normal pictures, but for making video calls it‚Äôs enough.  The main camera has a separation capacity of 5 megapixels.  In general, the images from it are normal, but in poor lighting conditions ‚Äúnoise‚Äù and graininess of the image appear.  Naturally, a professional camera is far, but for a mobile multifunctional gadget is pretty good. </p><h2>  Software and operating system </h2><p>  The smartphone Samsung Galaxy Core works under <span>the Android operating system</span> version 4.1.2.  At the time of release, it was the newest version that was used in smartphones.  The charge consumption of this OS version is small and the data processing speed is not impaired. </p>

    <p>  Complete with a smartphone, Google Now and ChatOn services were supplied.  They allow you to quickly search for places and exchange messages with friends.  In addition, I would like to note the following functions: </p><p>  1. Intellectual expectation.  This function easily recognizes the user's eyes and does not allow the system to turn off the screen as long as it looks at it. </p><p>  2. The ‚ÄúIntelligent Alert‚Äù function is also very interesting.  When the owner picks up a smartphone on which there are missed calls or SMS, the program will recognize the movement and notify about the events. </p><p>  3. The camera also has its own unique addition called ‚ÄúThe Best Frame‚Äù.  This utility makes it possible to choose the most clear and high-quality frame from all that were made in the multi-shot mode. </p><p>  And also: voice control, voice blocking, motion control and much more. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  This gadget called Samsung Galaxy Core has a fairly powerful 1800 mAh battery.  Judging by the reviews of the owners, it is quite enough for active use throughout the day.  But due to two simultaneously working SIM-cards, the battery life is slightly reduced. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Shortly after the release of the smartphone in question, a more advanced model called Samsung Galaxy Core 2 appeared. Reviews about it are more flattering.  But at the time when the first model came out, it was one of the best.  This is evidenced by all the characteristics.  In general, in a word - the Samsung Galaxy Core perfectly matches its price category. </p>
