Initially, the city, which was called Lusta, began to grow around Aluston.  At the time of the modern embankment was a marina.  Gradually, Lusta gained great commercial importance. </p><p>  After the conquest of Crimea by the Turks, Alushta ceased to be a trading city and turned into a small settlement on the ruins of a Genoese fortress.  Turkish troops landed here during the Crimean War, and a serious battle took place on the territory of the settlement.  It was in him that the future Field Marshal M. Kutuzov was wounded. </p><p>  Until the end of the 19th century, there was no reason to talk about the existence of the Alushta embankment.  She rebuilt for a long time. </p><p>  Alushta embankment especially changed during the NEP.  There were numerous shops and retail stores, as well as car services offices. </p>

    <p>  A great influence on the appearance of the embankment had a destructive storm, which occurred in the winter at the end of 1940.  And for two and a half years of occupation, this territory was completely empty.  Only after the liberation of Alushta in 1944, people began to actively restore their hometown.  In 1954, the famous rotunda was installed on the embankment, which is now the hallmark of Alushta.  During the construction and design of the embankment, N.D.  Staheev, Russian merchant and philanthropist. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1969, a large section of the embankment was again damaged by a storm.  At the same time, shore protection structures begin to be built here.  Particularly during the storms, part of the embankment of the Worker's (now Professors') corner continued to suffer.  The storm of 2012, which destroyed this site, served as an occasion for its reconstruction as a gift to the city for its 110th anniversary. </p><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  Currently, the embankment of Alushta consists of three parts: central, eastern and western.  The central part is a place where there are always many tourists.  It is in this part that the Rotunda is located.  Nearby is the Seaside Park.  The western part is called the Professor's Corner.  Now it is the newest section of the promenade with beautiful buildings, completely renovated.  Here are the best beaches.  New buildings continue to be built in this area, thanks to which modern Alushta is being transformed. </p>

    <p>  The eastern embankment goes east of the central.  By the 111th birthday of Alushta, this part was reconstructed after 30 years of complete stagnation.  The peculiarity of the city is that it is very quiet and calm along its outskirts, and when approaching the sea, an ever greater revival begins.  This is modern Alushta.  Naberezhnaya Street is always full of tourists' cars, so it‚Äôs quite difficult to park here.  Occasionally, visitors have to leave their cars at the professors' corner, but this is just an excuse to stroll along the entire promenade and enjoy its beauty. </p><h2>  Sea (Alushta) </h2><p>  Most tourists travel to the South Coast to relax at sea.  Alushta is no exception.  There are wide pebble beaches, some of them are reserved for vacationing boarding houses.  There are also free beaches.  The sea here is very clean.  The bottom is flat, there are beaches where the depth increases gradually, where you can have a good rest with the children.  The bottom of the sea is rocky, mostly covered with pebbles. </p><h2>  Embankment, Alushta: Attractions </h2>

    <p>  Modern Alushta is a small but very beautiful and cozy city on the seashore with a rich history.  The main attraction of the city is the promenade.  Alushta literally comes to life in the summer, especially life is boiling on the embankment in the evening.  The incredible beauty of the Crimean coast and the healing sea air make Alushta a favorite vacation spot for many tourists.  Having been here once, I want to come here again and again. </p>
