Since then, the infrastructure of the institution has developed in the direction of relaxation and sports, the number of attractions has remained the same.  For outdoor enthusiasts, a modern gym with a large number of exercise machines is equipped inside the park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the lobby of the building, visitors can experience exotic entertainment like a massage chair or special cocktails.

On the territory of the Aquacenter in Grodno there are various drinking establishments where you can enjoy spending time at lunch.

You can relax in them for a long time and feel real comfort.  The rooms are equipped to all quality standards, and for a group of friends this place will be a great find.  In the pool there are separate lanes for swimming, and the administration can arrange group visits to children.  In this water park in Grodno, prices are reasonable.  An adult will have to pay six rubles for one hour and ten cents for every next minute.  Children under sixteen years of age will be cheaper for exactly one penny for every minute of time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The institution is famous for its size, and a huge number of visitors here can be met extremely rarely.  Some visitors liked the infrastructure with various entertainment and oxygen cocktails.  This is where the positive impressions of visiting the water park end. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="water park lake Grodno" class="if uuid-2409088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2409088.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative in the comments </h2><p>  It is worth noting that this institution, like the Ozerny water park in Grodno, can hardly be called a tourist destination where you can get an adrenaline rush.  A few slides, even a novice will be able to surprise the first half hour.  Visitors should knowingly set themselves up for swimming and relaxation.  In the pools, different water temperatures are recorded, as in the jacuzzi. </p><p>  Some people were dissatisfied with the reception of groups of children and the behavior of the staff.  The pool is impressive in size, but its condition is deteriorating every year.  A massage chair in the lobby can squeeze the client's legs.  There are no sheets in the saunas, which is why visitors have to take them with them. </p><p>  Separate family locker rooms are not provided.  At this, the cons end, and as a result, in the reviews they report that the institution is worth visiting only in order to swim.  Extreme on three slides users will not feel. </p>
