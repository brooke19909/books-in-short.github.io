    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The marble canyon "Ruskeala" (Karelia) began to be developed in the 17th century.  Work in those days was carried out by the Swedes.  Mined marble was used for the construction of foundations and in order to make building lime. </p><p>  On the marble canyon "Ruskeala" paid special attention at the time when palaces and cathedrals began to be erected in St. Petersburg and its environs.  The valuable stone mined in these places was highly appreciated by architects.  Marble slabs were used to decorate their buildings with Montferrand and Rinaldi.  This magnificent stone was lined with Kazan and St. Isaac's Cathedrals, Mikhailovsky Castle, etc. </p><p>  Before the Russo-Finnish War, the quarries where valuable stone was mined were flooded by the Finns.  According to one version, this was done in order to harm the Soviet troops. </p>
