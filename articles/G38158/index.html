The history of the concept of "burgher"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A huge role in the formation of the modern middle class in Western Europe was played by free citizens.  The main engine of reform in the Middle Ages was people living in large settlements, each of whom called himself a ‚Äúburgher‚Äù.  This word later became the universal designation of free and wealthy people living in European cities. </p><h2>  Burgers in the early Middle Ages </h2><p>  In the <span>early Middle Ages, a</span> burgher is a resident of a fortified settlement or living near a cathedral or church.  In those dashing times, churches and churches served not only for worship, but also played the role of the safest place during raids, wars and <span>natural disasters.</span>  Churches and temples were strengthened for greater security, and those who sought protection within their walls, involuntarily became the defenders of the sacred place, the meaning of the word "burgher" gradually transformed - from an ordinary resident of a fortified settlement, he becomes his defender. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Burger is" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/724301.jpg" width="389"></div>

    <h2>  Burger in the High Middle Ages </h2><p>  Since the thirteenth century, the concept of burgherism has spread to all cities of northern and <span>central Europe.</span>  The concept of "burgher" now has a completely different meaning.  The burgher is a member of an economically independent civic class;  a citizen taking part in the management of his city and even the state.  Burgertum unites a middle class society representing the interests of free citizens, merchants, artisans.  The burgher, as a free man, is opposed to a vassal - a dependent person.  As trade relations expanded, <span>more</span> and <span>more cities</span> received city (Magdeburg) law - which means that more citizens had the right to call themselves burghers.  They did not belong either to the plebeian mass or to the old noble families.  Basically, this nascent middle class could become an organized opposition to medieval feudalism and the church. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Who are the burghers" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/724302.jpg" width="305"></div>

    <h2>  Church Confrontation </h2><p>  Under feudalism, the main goal that the burgher set himself was the privileges and liberties of his native city, participation in local self-government.  In addition, the bureaucracy directed its protests against the magnificent and ceremonial Catholic rites.  The burghers, like the bourgeoisie, sought a simple, cheap church with services in a clear language.  Dissatisfaction with the Catholicism of the broad masses of the educated urban population caused the emergence of the famous "95 theses" by <span>Martin Luther.</span>  So there was a Protestant / Lutheran / current in the Christian church. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meaning of the word burgher" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/724304.jpg" width="311"></div>

    <p>  The Reformation movement with the subsequent emergence of a <span>Lutheran church</span> would not have been possible without the participation of burghers.  The burghery gave rise to the bourgeoisie - the third class.  Starting from the XIII century, well-known monuments of art and architecture, perfectly preserved in numerous German cities, will best tell about who these burghers are.  Sponsors and benefactors of scientists, writers and artists, they left a deep mark in history precisely thanks to their support of the outstanding masters of their time. </p>
