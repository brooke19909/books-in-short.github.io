    <h2>  Entertainment and leisure </h2><p>  In order to have a good time, you do not need to linger in the walls of the Marins Park Hotel (Rostov).  Reviews say that the guests here are greeted perfectly, the atmosphere of the hotel is conducive to relaxation, but if the light of a traveler-explorer burns in you, then be sure to go on excursions.  It is unlikely that you will find another such a large city, where the tour desk at the hotel has an equally magnificent selection of tours.  All the surroundings of Rostov are a real fairy tale, so whether you want to know the stone jungle better or if nature attracts you, you will surely find something that you like.  But already returning back, you can lie down in the pool and relax properly. </p><h2>  Hotel Orientation </h2><p>  Each such institution has its own target audience, and usually the living conditions are selected specifically so that it is comfortable for people of this category.  First of all, this is a hotel for adults, it is not aimed at families with children, so there is no entertainment for children.  That is, for the most part, business people and couples without children relax here.  Pets are allowed, which adds another category of visitors to the Marins Park Hotel (Rostov).  Employee reviews tell us that for the most part the hotel is focused on the Russian-speaking population.  The bulk of the staff does not know foreign languages. </p>

At the same time, prices remain reasonably affordable, even the most sophisticated luxury can be rented here for quite reasonable money.  If you are planning a trip to Rostov-on-Don, we recommend that you stay here.  You are guaranteed a good mood and a lot of pleasant experiences.  Surely next time you don‚Äôt have to make a choice, you will pre-book a place in a familiar hotel. </p>
