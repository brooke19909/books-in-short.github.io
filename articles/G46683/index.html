Next, in the smartphone‚Äôs settings, find the line ‚ÄúAbout phone‚Äù, log in and click on ‚ÄúBuild number‚Äù several times until the item ‚ÄúFor Developers‚Äù appears, where you need to go in, check the enabled slider and check the item ‚ÄúFactory unlocks‚Äù.  In the loaded engineering menu, open ‚ÄúBandMod‚Äù and leave ticks on the bands that are used in accordance with the location. </p><h2>  When there is no sound in the "Nokia" button </h2><p>  If the sound of a budget model in a Nokia phone sharply disappears, you should not panic and run to repair it prematurely, investing a lot of money.  This can be done absolutely free.  First, thoroughly check all the sound settings to finally make sure that the sound is ‚Äúcovered‚Äù.  Then turn off the device and disassemble it, getting to the motherboard.  It is likely that oxidation has formed on it, dust has accumulated or dirt has got.  All this needs to be removed with the help of an ordinary toothbrush, which none of the household uses.  At the same time, it does not hurt to clean the case and inaccessible places where particles of dirt easily fall.  Check the sound, if everything recovered, carefully assemble the device and enjoy the music again. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.freeimageslive.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old push-button phones" class="if uuid-2621279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95310/2621279.jpg"></div><h2>  Water is the number one enemy </h2><p>  In the case when the gadget decided to unexpectedly "swim" in the water, after drying and complete cleaning, the sound disappeared, the first thing is to examine all the icons that appeared.  The listening sign in the headphones can stand in the way, even when the headset is turned off.  To return the volume, you need to find and download the SoundAbout application, small in weight, in the Market.  In the installed program, select the "Speaker" options in the "Media Audio" and "Background Call Audio" tabs. </p>
