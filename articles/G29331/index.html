Moreover, it is not known exactly when the desire to possess one or another beautiful thing originated in a person‚Äôs head.  But over time, interest in rare gizmos grew into a real industry that brings multimillion-dollar annual income.  Collectors can be interested in anything: works of art, stamps, old postcards or figurines, for example.  But more often than not, people have a passion for collecting coins.  Numismatists, as they are called, can spend their whole lives searching for a rare coin, and its value in some cases reaches several million dollars at famous auctions.  However, often numismatists select their treasures based not on value, but on historical interest. </p><p>  In this situation, there are no equal Byzantine coins in the world.  At one time, they spread widely around the world thanks to the trade relations of the empire, moreover, throughout the entire existence of Byzantium, they have changed dramatically more than once, acquiring special features and characteristics.  Medieval Byzantine coins are found even on the territory of Russia, so it cannot be said that they are very valuable.  However, their story deserves special attention, which we will devote to them today. </p>

    <h2>  Characteristics of coins from Byzantium </h2><p>  <span>The Byzantine Empire</span> was able to survive for a thousand years, so it is not surprising that more than a hundred different Byzantine coins saw the light during this time interval.  In all their distinguishing features, only specialists who understand it without difficulty, just looking at the found instance, tell its long story. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We can say that the state that arose on the ruins of the Roman Empire, first of all, adopted almost all the features of the former way of life.  This also applied to <span>coin minting,</span> but over time, new money began to change seriously.  Therefore, today every numismatist will be able to name the distinguishing features of Byzantine coins (we will highlight this topic in a separate section of the article). </p><p>  In the empire, coins were made of gold, silver, copper and even bronze.  In each embodiment, the use of a different amount of metal was assumed.  Solid was the main gold coin, which was readily accepted throughout the world.  She participated in the calculations of merchants and was considered the largest.  Half of its value was semissis, and one third was tremissis.  Both coins were also made of gold. </p><p>  From silver craftsmen made miliary.  A smaller option, accounting for half of its total cost, is keratium.  Such Byzantine ancient coins were very popular and were widespread until the beginning of the thirteenth century. </p><p>  Subsequently, all coins of the <span>Byzantine Empire</span> acquired a concave shape.  In this form, they began to be minted in gold and silver.  However, copper Byzantine coins, considered the smallest, have not acquired a similar appearance.  They remained flat until the collapse of the empire.  Byzantine coin-cup is in almost every collection of numismatist with experience. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that initially the coins had an incredibly high metal content.  This made them very valuable and now Byzantine silver coins, for example, very beloved numismatists.  The fact is that over time, mints began to noticeably reduce the amount of metal in their products.  However, the coinage of silver is not so much affected.  Therefore, this option for numismatists today is considered one of the most valuable and interesting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Characteristics of coins of the Byzantine Empire </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the history of the Byzantine coin originates from the collapse of the Roman Empire.  After all, it is precisely this period that experts call a facet that has seriously changed not only the appearance of money, but also the way they were minted.  Therefore, the coins that were in use in Byzantium have clearly distinguishable features that characterize them. </p><p>  If we compare the products of the Byzantine and Roman masters, it becomes clear that the coinage of the second was much rougher, but the portrait similarity of the emperors was more noticeable.  The work of the mint masters was so filigree that the images were recognizable even to residents of other countries.  However, by the end of the empire, masters switched from naturalism only to an approximate transmission of the image.  Such coins are not of great value among numismatists. </p><p>  Another distinguishing feature of Byzantine coinage is sacred iconography.  On the reverse, crosses and other Christian symbols were very often depicted.  Historians argue that this was done to promote religion.  At the same time, sacred symbols emphasized the holiness of the power of emperors and their families.  This approach was to create among the people a certain image of the ruling dynasty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A coin from Byzantium can also be found from portraits of emperors.  They were not always three-dimensional and at different periods of time were carried out according to certain technologies.  For example, until the seventh century, all rulers were minted without a beard.  Subsequently, the portrait became a little different - the emperor began to be depicted waist-high and with a long beard.  If we consider a photo of a Byzantine coin of a later period, it will be noticeable how the image of the ruler has changed.  Mandatory parchment was put into his hands, and a diadem of leaves crowned his head. </p><h2>  Empire <span>Mints</span> : where did it all begin? </h2><p>  You can not talk about the coins of the Byzantine Empire, without mentioning the dynamics of the development of mints.  These institutions were inherited by the new state from the Romans.  Therefore, the first Byzantine money was so similar to those that were in use in the Roman Empire. </p><p>  Initially, mints worked everywhere, but Emperor Anastasius I ordered the closure of most of them.  Only in the newly built Constantinople and Thessaloniki did the minting of money continue in the old way.  At the end of the fifth century, the emperor conducted an extensive reform, which also affected the financial sector.  As a result of the transformations, two more mints were opened.  They were located in Nicodemia and Antioch.  It is noteworthy that around this period of time, a lathe was used to make money.  This significantly affected the appearance of the coins, making them rougher. </p>

    <h2>  The heyday of the empire of Justinian I </h2><p>  This period in the history of Byzantium was marked by the opening of a huge number of mints.  Money was minted not only in the center, but also in the province.  There were more than fourteen such manufactures, and the Byzantines often used those enterprises that were built by other peoples.  Many mints once belonged to the Ostrogoths and were captured by the soldiers of the empire along with the territories. </p><p>  Justinian I forbade most of the industries to mint money from gold.  Only three mints were awarded this privilege.  They were located in Constantinople, Thessaloniki and Catania.  Silver coins could be issued by Carragen and Ravenna, but to all the rest only chasing from bronze was available. </p>

    <h2>  Mint limit </h2><p>  The seventh century was a period of loss in the <span>history of the Byzantine</span> Empire.  It is not surprising that this almost immediately affected the production of money.  The rulers fought a huge number of wars, and most of the battles were lost by the empire.  Therefore, Byzantium lost its territory, and with them mints. </p><p>  To preserve the equipment, Heraclius I ordered the closure of all enterprises in the provinces.  Only mints located near large cities could now mint money.  The only exception was the company in Syracuse, but it was also lost as a result of the attack by the Arabs. </p><p>  Since that time, silver and gold Byzantine coins had the right to issue only the mint in Constantinople.  He was considered the main one and retained his status until the end of the empire.  During different periods of their reign, emperors made attempts to open new mints, but they did not receive a large amount of work and development.  The only one who managed to hold out until the fall of Constantinople and the empire itself was the Kherson mint.  However, he minted only small copper money. </p>

    <h2>  Description of Gold Coins </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that the main Byzantine gold coin was called solid.  Historians believe that it appeared approximate in the first third of the fourth century.  By his appearance, the solid was obliged to strengthen the imperial power and replace the <span>Roman coins that</span> were in use with new ones. </p><p>  Numismatists know that at that time it was difficult to mint money according to a single standard.  Therefore, the parameters of solid may vary insignificantly depending on the time of manufacture and method of production.  On average, a Byzantine gold coin has a weight of four and a half grams and a diameter of twenty-two millimeters.  An oval was adopted as the standard of the form, and the fineness of gold was nine hundred. </p><p>  The obverse of the solid was extremely simple.  Usually it housed a portrait of the emperor with parchment and a diadem, his name was engraved by engravers by the diameter of the coin and decorated with a border.  But the reverse had several manufacturing options.  The very first coins had a portrait of the emperor on both sides.  Later, solidi appeared with Christian crosses and images of saints on the reverse.  Coins are known on which the faces of the holy elders were minted on both sides.  It is noteworthy that all the images were flat and often resembled abstract images. </p><p>  The second most important coin of gold was semissis.  Poor people in their entire lives might not have seen such money.  But in the circles of nobles and merchants, it was very common.  The gold sample in the semissos was identical to solid, and the weight did not exceed two grams.  The diameter of the coin varies between eighteen and twenty two millimeters. </p><p>  The obverse of the semissis resembled solid.  A portrait of the ruler with his name was also always minted here, but on the reverse one could see the Virgin Mary, images of saints or Victory.  Sometimes masters put various inscriptions on the coin.  For example, VICTORIA AVCCC CONOB. </p><p>  Tremissis appeared only in the fifth century and gained great popularity.  Its weight was slightly more than one gram, and the diameter was equal to seventeen millimeters.  Since at one time it was represented by a large number of copies, it does not have much value among collectors. </p><h2>  The value of gold coins in the eyes of numismatists </h2><p>  Byzantine solid is in the collection of almost every numismatist.  The value of the coin varies markedly, it depends on many factors.  First of all, from the state of a particular instance and the time of its manufacture.  But on average, you can buy a gold coin for six hundred dollars, especially rare copies can cost up to one and a half thousand dollars. </p><p>  Semissis costs much less solid, you can get it in your collection by spending only from five hundred to eight hundred dollars. </p>

    <h2>  Silver coins </h2><p>  These coins were very common and had a large number of manufacturing options.  The largest was considered miliary, which several times changed its value in connection with an increase in the amount of silver in it.  The oval shape was adopted as the standard, the diameter of the coin reached twenty-five millimeters, and the weight exceeded four and a half grams.  On the obverse, the milyarisia always minted the profile of the emperor, and the reverse was decorated with Victory with two branches. </p><p>  Half of miliarisia was keratium.  It is considered the most popular and common coin in Byzantium.  She made most of the internal calculations in the country, so many similar copies were issued in the empire.  The appearance of keratia was no different from miliary.  However, the diameter of the coin did not exceed eighteen millimeters. </p><p>  One of the rarest coins is considered a silver hexagram.  It was minted for a short time, although it was very popular among the Byzantines.  Now numismatists are ready to give more than one thousand dollars for a hexagram. </p><p>  The worst surviving silikva to this day.  This coin was issued by the emperor Diocletian, who placed his image on it.  It is noteworthy that despite the fact that the coin belonged to high-grade, its quality left much to be desired.  With the release of the standards often changed, and therefore today you can find in the collections of such money weighing just over one gram and those that exceed three and a half grams. </p><p>  The smallest coin that was used only in large cities of the empire is polysilicon.  Its release required special permission from the main mint. </p><h2>  The cost of silver coins </h2><p>  The most expensive silver coins in our time are militarium and hexagram.  The cost of the first coin reaches five hundred dollars; copies of good quality are sold for one thousand two hundred dollars and are in great demand among collectors. </p><p>  Keratium can be purchased for two hundred dollars, the highest price for which it was purchased, reached five hundred dollars. </p><p>  The cost of silicon and polysilicon ranges from forty to two hundred dollars.  These coins are not considered rare and are often sold in very good condition. </p>

    <h2>  Bronze Coins </h2><p>  Such money was mainly paid by the poor.  The largest coin was considered to be the nummus; it went down in history as a follis.  The most famous of these Byzantine coins is Justinian's follis.  The coin on the one hand had the profile of the emperor, and on the other hand the letter and number were applied.  These designations had their own meaning - the value of money in nummies.  The diameter of the follicle reached forty millimeters, and the weight varied within twenty-two grams.  Such coins were very common, so their cost is low.  They sell for an average of twenty-five dollars. </p><p>  Polfolis and decanumium were in use in different parts of the country.  The first coin was used only in large cities, while the second archaeologists are found throughout the former Byzantine Empire.  At auctions, this <span>antique money</span> can be purchased for fifty dollars. </p><p>  The smallest bronze pentanium coin is found in very poor condition and therefore does not cost more than fifteen dollars. </p>
