    <h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the hotel offers transfers from Male Airport.  The Barefoot Eco Hotel is not very far away.  But in order for the guests to be met, they must inform the administration in advance of the data regarding the flight (in particular, information about departure and arrival). </p><p>  It is worth knowing that on December 24 and 31 the hotel holds gala dinners on the occasion of Christmas and New Year.  But they are paid separately.  $ 90 costs dinner for an adult and 45 for a child. </p><p>  By the way, if guests come with a baby, then they can ask for a crib specially for him.  The administration provides cots, but only one per room.  Even when applying for an apartment reservation, you will need to provide your credit card details.  The hotel accepts American Express, Visa and Master Card. </p><h2>  Guests on vacation </h2><p>  People who have been here assure: the prefix "eco" in the name of the hotel is fully justified.  The hotel is located on the outskirts of a large island, in a quiet and peaceful place, ideal for relaxation.  Everything is clean, new - from towels and sockets to excellent plumbing.  Every little thing in this hotel is thought out.  Relaxing in the apartments is a pleasure. </p><p>  Guests are advised to book villas on the ground floor.  Although, even if you book the easiest option, there will be nothing wrong, the beach is still at arm's length. </p><p>  Rest in this hotel gives only pleasure, even if you do not want to leave its borders.  Guests are happy to work out in the gym on treadmills and exercise bikes, there are bars and other equipment for strength training.  Everything is new and high quality.  There is also an elongated deep pool - very nice and clean, with salty ocean water. </p><p>  The staff is very polite, courteous and simple, unobtrusive.  I am always ready to suggest something, to help solve a problem.  Although practically no one is having them here.  After all, Eco Hotel is a real piece of paradise on Earth. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Finally - a few words about what tourists leave about their rest at The Barefoot Eco Hotel reviews.  They are mostly positive. </p><p>  People who have been here assure that you should go here for at least 10-14 days.  It will be a pity to come back, so it‚Äôs worth ‚Äúgrabbing‚Äù as many impressions as possible during this time.  But you don‚Äôt need to take a lot of things.  Towels are provided in the apartments, and the Maldivians themselves dress modestly and in a beach style. </p><p>  Another nuance, important for many vacationers.  This is the lack of alcohol.  It is prohibited by state law.  But near the hotel, in the lagoon, there is a ‚Äúfloating‚Äù bar on the boat.  There are a large number of different alcoholic drinks and cocktails.  And the atmosphere is pleasant, original. </p><p>  In general, if possible, you definitely need to fly to the <span>Maldives.</span>  The Barefoot Eco Hotel 4 * hotel receives tourists from all over the world all year round.  And the vast majority of guests claim that they would like to return here.  And this suggests that the hotel really corresponds to a high level. </p>
