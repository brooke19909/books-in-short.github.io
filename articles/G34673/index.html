Khitrovskaya Square in Moscow became such an example.  People lived quietly at this place until a tragedy occurred.  The renewed and rebuilt territory was to become a kind of shopping center, but turned into a cloister of <span>social bottom.</span> </p><p>  The city authorities of different time periods changed the layout of the terrain, modified or demolished buildings, but the name still causes mixed feelings among the population.  On the one hand, it is something that resembles the market described at the beginning of the book ‚ÄúThe Story of a Murderer‚Äù by Suskind, on the other hand it is a beautiful square. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  No one could have imagined that Khitrovskaya Square in Moscow would exist.  If not for a sad set of circumstances, then who knows, perhaps, to this day, this territory would remain a kind of <span>sleeping area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe</span> city. </p>

Including burned, and many residential buildings.  Since it was not accepted to keep funds in treasuries or imitations of banks, money was invested in jewelry, real estate or simply kept at home.  After the city was burned, many lost both housing and livelihoods.  Residents of two mansions in the center of the White City of Moscow were no exception.

Thanks to the generosity of the city dweller, Moscow received a beautiful place called Khitrovskaya Square. </p><h2>  Plan of the square and its surroundings </h2><p>  The general plan depicts a square, one side is surrounded by buildings, and the other - trees that would give beauty.  Four "ribs" were named respectively to the cardinal points. </p><p>  South placed on itself shopping arcades and residential compounds.  When Khitrovo died, these buildings were transferred to the new owners, but they have survived to the present day, although slightly modified. </p>

    <p>  First, sellers with portable trays came out before church holidays and during festivities, then permanent tenants began to take up places. </p><p>  Real hell began when a canopy was built over the area.  A labor exchange was located here, and in search of a job, unemployed, runaway peasants from all around began to converge here.  Many remained.  For a couple of years, Khitrovskaya Square has become a haven for the destitute and drinkers.  In a word, if people were looking in Moscow for a place where the social bottom was located, then it was located here. </p><p>  In addition to the dysfunctional contingent, there was also a complete collapse of any infrastructure.  Lack of coverage, robbery and theft flourished in the area.  Locals said that they did not need lanterns, since they would always find their way, but there was nothing for strangers to try. </p>

    <h2>  Soviet period </h2><p>  In 1929, a building was built on this site, which is better known as the Iron, and a grocery store was located there.  Many townspeople lived in apartments, including famous ones, for example, actor Evgeny Morgunov. </p><p>  In the 1920s, Khitrovskaya Square lost a square with rare and valuable varieties of trees.  Of the old plants, only three poplars remained. </p><p>  In the late 30s, the construction of the ‚Äúsculpture house‚Äù, beloved by the locals, began.  At the same time, the school was erected as a substitute for the Conception Monastery. </p><p>  Khitrovskaya Square, the most dangerous once, and its name was lost.  It was renamed Gorkovskaya.  <span>This toponym</span> lasted until the 60s of the XX century.  His appearance is tied to the <span>play "At the Bottom",</span> because they believe that Maxim Gorky came here for inspiration and studied the features of the life of missing people.  But this fact has no documentary evidence. </p>

    <h2>  Reconstruction </h2><p>  The idea to restore the former appearance of the square arose in 1996.  However, only in 2008 the application for restructuring was considered.  The locals were offered a project according to which instead of an Electromechanical college, a <span>multi-storey building</span> intended for offices was to appear.  In addition to the building itself, it was planned to build a large parking lot for five hundred places.  However, this caused outrage among local residents and local historians.  Over 10 thousand signatures were collected, and the historical heritage was defended. </p><p>  Recently, the government granted Khitrovka protection status. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Khitrovskaya Square, a dangerous place in the last century, is returning to its former light image.  People often come here for a walk and look at the legendary places.  Cinema fans represent Morgunov, who often went out into the yard to play ball or wait for a friend. </p><p>  Of particular value are architectural structures, among which - the preserved house of Khitrovo, a profitable estate of Bunin. </p>

    <p>  Among philologists, a <span>literary salon is</span> located in one of the apartments, in which the most famous writers and poets gathered.  L. Kashina, who became the prototype of Anna Snegina, also lived here.  He and Sergei Yesenin were close friends, and the poet often came to stay. </p><h2>  Square myths </h2><p>  Rumor has it that Khitrovskaya Square, once dangerous, also attracted the legendary swindler - Sonya Golden Handle.  It was here that she found her social circle, could practice her skills and learn new things.  According to legend, in one of the houses the girl hid a treasure consisting of looted jewelry, but no one has managed to find it so far.  Lovers of easy money either <span>went crazy</span> or perished under mysterious circumstances. </p><p>  Ghosts are allegedly walking around the streets.  They appeared when the thieves tried to get rich at the expense of the Temple of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  The attackers decided to make a dig, and when they were already under the sanctuary, the building could not stand it and fell right on them.  Since then, their souls roam the streets and scare passersby with requests to pray for another's sin. </p><p>  Another option says that the merchant-fire-burner saw in a dream Nikolai the Miracle Worker, who ordered him to steal and sell the cassock from the statue in order to resume business with this money.  The man listened to him, and the robe after a while was in its original place. </p>
