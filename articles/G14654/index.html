The death of the Soviet actor and economist occurred on December 1, 2011 due to injuries that he received during his fall from a window from the fifth floor, where he lived in his apartment on Stroginsky Boulevard.  There is no doubt that this was a suicide.  This is evidenced by the note that Maxim Kalinin left before committing this act.  In it, the actor argued that no one was to blame, that everything had happened.  He ordered this act to be perceived as a personal desire to leave this world. </p>

    <h2>  Life after a star role </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the role in "The Adventures of Electronics" brought fame, Maxim Nikolayevich was not infected with star disease.  He did not continue his <span>professional activities</span> in the field of cinema.  And it would be very interesting to know how Maxim Kalinin the actor would become.  Films with his participation have already managed to fall in love with the audience.  Probably, his popularity would only grow.  But this was not destined to happen, because he set his priorities not in favor of acting.  In addition to one of the main roles, he played episodic in the series "White Horse" in 1993.  His participation was in the episode Les Miserables.  On this, Maxim Kalinin decided to end his acting career.  Photos of him from the time of shooting in the movie and to the present are very different.  But, nevertheless, looking at this cheerful person, you see him as a born actor.  But all his remaining life in terms of professional activity, he devoted to finance and securities.  By the way, it is worth noting that in this direction he managed to achieve high results. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Labor activity </h2><p>  Throughout his life, Maxim Kalinin has replaced a number of posts.  These changes were due to the growth of him as a specialist in the field to which he decided to devote himself.  Successfully developing, every year he became an increasingly professional employee, which contributed to his career advancement.  In 1991, he began his career as a deputy head of the investment organization Vicar.  For the next two years, he worked as an employee of the Moscow Finance Center in the brokerage department.  From 1992 to 1993, Maxim Kalinin worked as deputy head of technology for Registrar NIKoil OJSC.  In the period from 1994 to 2000, he was CEO at the same company.  Since 2011, Maksim Nikolayevich has been a member of the Board of Directors of OJSC IC Prospect and CJSC New Registrar.  In addition, since 1999 he has been a permanent member of the PARTAD board of directors. </p><h2>  Death versions </h2><p>  In the media there are reports that Maxim Kalinin died due to suicide.  But such options as bringing to a state of suicide or murder are not ruled out.  According to these assumptions, an investigation was conducted.  At the moment, the cause of this act has not been identified.  Difficulties arise due to the fact that on the eve of what happened Maxim Kalinin talked with friends on the phone.  And they did not notice anything unusual.  Also, the wife also talked on the phone with Maxim Kalinin.  They agreed to meet soon.  According to her, in the conversation and tone of her husband she did not reveal anything suspicious.  Kalinin‚Äôs body was found at eleven o‚Äôclock in the evening, and a few hours earlier a conversation took place with his wife, who at that time was with her son in Portugal.  There they have property.  Maxim Nikolaevich confirmed that the plans remain valid and that he will come to them soon.  But this, unfortunately, was never destined to happen. </p>
