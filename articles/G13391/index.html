Bonus Program Overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cashback has gained widespread popularity among many customer loyalty programs.  Card users of Tinkoff Bank JSC may receive remuneration for the money spent.  The credit institution introduced a unique system that combined cashback and the usual bonus program.  In this regard, many users are interested in how and where to spend Bravo points from Tinkoff. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Tinkoff Bank JSC has developed a new <span>loyalty program</span> for its customers.  The participants in this program are the owners of Tinkoff plastic cards.  Points are awarded for purchases made using a card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="finhow.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Profitable bonus program" class="if uuid-2516142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2516142.jpg"></div><p>  Owners get 1 point for spent 100 rubles, so the total number of bonuses is about 1% of the amount spent.  Points are awarded not only for the purchase of goods in stores, but also for making payments through terminals.  This is not to say that the bank provides many options for how to take advantage of Tinkoff Bravo points. </p><h2>  What is not included in the program conditions? </h2><p>  Customers do not receive bonuses for the following operations: </p><ul><li>  replenishment of a plastic card; </li><li>  transfer to another card; </li><li>  cash withdrawal; </li><li>  transactions through a mobile application; </li></ul><p>  The program provides for a restriction regarding the limit for scoring.  For 1 month, the client receives no more than 6,000 conditional bonuses.  In the event that the total amount of purchases exceeds 600,000 rubles, conditional points are burned out.  If the cardholder has spent a not so round amount, then during conversion the points will be rounded down.  When you purchase 402 rubles, the cardholder receives only 4 points.  If a program participant has loan arrears, the bank does not accrue bonuses.  After repayment of the debt, the bank resumes the loyalty program for the client. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="biznes-prost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unique program" class="if uuid-2516145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2516145.jpg"></div><p>  The Bank provides for the accrual of not only ordinary, but also prize points.  Increased bonus units are awarded within the framework of certain special offers - the client can receive up to 20% of the amount of purchases made.  Remember that prize bonuses are also limited in size, since the maximum amount of accruals does not exceed 6,000. The difference from the usual ones is that prize points do not burn out if the limit is exceeded.  A client can accumulate up to 12,000 bonuses per month.  Card users need to know that scoring occurs only when preparing an account statement.  After making a purchase, bonuses are not credited; they are received by cardholders in a month. </p><h2>  Where and how to use bonuses </h2><p>  The question of where to spend Bravo points from Tinkoff is of interest to many customers.  Compensation of credit funds occurs in the ratio of 1 ruble = 1 point.  The user can return the money for purchases made in the last 3 months.  Crediting and writing off bonus points occurs during the day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tinkoffpro.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Profitable program" class="if uuid-2516139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2516139.jpg"></div><p>  Bonus accumulations burn out after 3 years.  If the cardholder wants to pay dinner in a cafe worth 2000 rubles, then the account must have at least 1 point more than the specified amount.  The cardholder can pay with points the entire amount of the purchase.  The program does not provide for partial reimbursement of the cost of purchased goods and services. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Accrual Features </h2><p>  If the bank suspects a client of fraudulent actions or abuse of the program rules, the accumulated points are canceled, and the owner is disconnected without warning.  The following types of points are available: </p><ul><li>  Corrective.  They are used when making any errors related to accrual or write-off. </li><li>  Prize money.  Members earn points by participating in various bank promotions. </li><li>  Transactional.  The charge is for financial transactions using a plastic card. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="ex-hort.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bonuses from the bank" class="if uuid-2516148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2516148.jpg"></div><p>  The ‚ÄúBravo‚Äù bonus program cannot be classified as typical, as the accrual and use of points has a number of features.  Points are recorded to the customers account after making a purchase, but can not be spent and are not displayed in your account.  When generating a statement of payment for a previous purchase, the points will be visible to the cardholder.  After making a minimum payment on statement, the client sees the number of points to use.  If the buyer returns defective goods to the store or cancels payment, the accrued points are debited from the personal account. </p><h2>  Using points </h2><p>  The question of how to use Bravo points from Tinkoff is the main one for interested clients of this credit organization.  Points are a virtual currency, so their value is determined by what can be purchased on them.  The accrued points can be used to compensate for the payment of goods and services that participate in the program.  The Bank has developed certain restrictions and rules that are as follows: </p><ul><li>  cardholders can reimburse the cost only within 90 days from the date of the transaction; </li><li>  Compensation for the full amount of points; </li><li>  for each point the cardholder is charged 1 ruble; </li><li>  points can be used in the absence of card debt. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="gdevzyatdeneg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Profitable program for customers" class="if uuid-2516149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2516149.jpg"></div><p>  You can reimburse the purchase price using a mobile bank.  The user needs to go to a special section "Bravo", which displays a list of completed operations.  Then, the cardholder should choose the necessary operation for compensation and confirm his intention.  After the actions are completed, the total amount of points is deducted from the personal account, and money comes in return.  The question is, what can you spend Bravo points in Tinkoff worries about interested customers.  The loyalty program does not delight customers because it is limited in its capabilities. </p><h2>  How to use points "Bravo" ("Tinkoff")? </h2><p>  Tinkoff Bank JSC declares that it is possible to spend Bravo bonuses on the purchase of train tickets and payment at catering organizations.  Bank Tinkoff JSC receives different reviews from customers, since few people liked this system of bonuses.  Many argue that the program does not guarantee a real opportunity to offset costs.  The Bank provides too narrow a range of services for which it is possible to spend accumulated points, therefore Tinkoff receives negative reviews, since not all customers are satisfied with the quality of the services provided. </p><p>  The inclusion of a particular operation in the bonus program is determined by a special MMS code, which is assigned to organizations depending on the type of activity.  This code is sent to a credit institution, and then the possibility of writing off points is determined, therefore, it is impossible to unequivocally answer the question of where to spend Bravo points from Tinkoff. </p><p>  The credit institution offers customers specialized cards with increased bonuses for the intended use of the card.  The bank's partners include: </p><ul><li>  Mitsubishi.  5% refund is made for payment by card at gas stations. </li><li>  Google Play  Up to 10% of points are made for completed purchases. </li><li>  <span>Yulmart.</span>  <span>Buyers of this network receive a refund of up to 3%.</span> </li></ul><p>  The developed loyalty program of Tinkoff Bank JSC is a unique product that allows you to adapt cashback for a credit card.  Customers can make points their reliable assistant, despite the stringent conditions of use. </p><p>  We hope that our article has provided comprehensive information on where to spend Bravo points from Tinkoff. </p>
