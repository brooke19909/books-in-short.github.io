    <h2>  Neuschwanstein </h2><p>  Today, this castle is considered a symbol of Bavaria.  It is distinguished by grace and sophistication.  Tall, directed to the sky, he represents the personification of elegance.  White stone walls and patterned windows look very attractive.  And upstairs are oval turrets complemented by arched balconies and loopholes. </p><p>  The castle was built in a rather unusual style.  It is not often possible to see a structure combining late Gothic, Romanesque, and Byzantine features.  Only Bavaria can surprise tourists. </p><p>  <span>Munich,</span> whose <span>attractions</span> can be called quite interesting, is still not as attractive to some travelers as Füssen, in the vicinity of which this castle is located.  And there is nothing strange about it.  Munich, of course, has art galleries, museums and temples, but Neuschwanstein surpasses them in many ways. </p><p>  The castle looks great against the backdrop of alpine nature, spread around.  From afar, it seems unreal and, rather, resembles the scenery for a theatrical performance.  This is the most fabulous, delightful of all the castles erected during the life of King Ludwig. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Castle tour </h2><p>  Excursions in Bavaria are very popular with tourists.  It’s always interesting to learn something new.  But the excursion to Neuschwanstein is something completely unusual.  People climb up the asphalt path.  Climbing far enough uphill, they see a suspension bridge extending over the valley.  And below is a waterfall, whose height is 45 meters.  Some tourists prefer to stay half way and not move on.  They definitely lose a lot.  Going a little further, you can get to the place from where a wonderful view of the unusual mountain world surrounding the castle opens. </p><h2>  Linderhof </h2>

    <p>  This beautiful palace was also erected under Ludwig.  The ruler of Bavaria was lucky that he lived to see the time when construction work was completed.  Linderhof, in fact, is a combination of pompous baroque and elegant rococo.  Surprisingly, a huge number of mirrors enclosed in gold frames.  All of them create an interesting effect - the area of ​​rooms visually increases. </p><h2>  Interior decoration </h2><p>  The most talented European artists worked on the interior design of Linderhof.  The walls are decorated with paintings and colorful tapestries.  From visiting the palace remains a lot of impressions.  Some even feel dizzy from the abundance of vases, figures, large porcelain birds and flowers, crystal chandeliers with many candles (but they say that they all never burned at the same time), marble fireplaces.  Bavaria, whose sights are known even outside the country, is a fabulous land where you can experience many unforgettable moments. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Altenstein </h2><p>  The name of this castle is translated as "Old Stone".  It is located in the northern part of the small town of Bad Liebenstein.  The castle was built at the dawn of the Middle Ages, which means it fully lives up to its name. </p><p>  It is no secret that many want to visit Germany, only to see such sights.  There are many tourists here from our country, because at present it is not at all difficult to obtain the visa necessary for the trip.  Bavaria, the sights of which attract many Russians, is always glad to guests, it welcomes them warmly and carries them into its unusual world. </p><h2>  Recovery work </h2><p>  But back to the castle.  Unfortunately, not a single original building of Altenstein has survived to this day.  And there is nothing strange in this, because wars were constantly going on in this territory, and there were also fires.  Surely there were other unfavorable factors that contributed to the destruction of the castle.  But he was restored.  And today this oldest attraction is no longer a fortified citadel, it has turned into a luxurious suburban residence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Altenstein Castle" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/467098.jpg" width="600"></div>  Nowadays, reconstruction works are being carried out here, as a result of which, after a year, the castle should acquire the look characteristic of the late Renaissance.  That was exactly Altenstein in the middle of the 17th century.

    <p>  Bavaria, whose attractions inspire artists and poets, is undoubtedly the best place in the country, but it is recommended to visit Thuringia, where this castle is located.  You can, of course, enjoy the photos, but the impressions will not be so strong. </p><h2>  Park and underground river </h2><p>  The castle, located on the gentle side of the mountain, called Saxe-Meiningen, is also famous for its large park stretching over 160 hectares.  Many are surprised when they find out that a river flows underground in its territory.  Previously, it was on the surface, but as a result of the equipment of the underground tunnel, it unexpectedly changed its course.  Secret passages located under the park were completely flooded. </p><h2>  Reincarnation </h2><p>  Many centuries have passed since the foundation of the castle, and during all this time, not only its appearance has undergone changes.  It is also noteworthy that he constantly moved from one owner to another.  Altenstein survived the time of the Inquisition, feudal feuds and world wars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="excursions in bavaria" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/467100.jpg" width="600"></div>  At different times, it served as a refuge for Protestants, a country residence, a place of detention and even a hospital.  We can say that Altenstein Castle survived several reincarnations.  His fate was not easy.

    <h2>  Altenstein Owners </h2><p>  Among the owners of the castle are such prominent people as Saint Boniface (he was called the German apostle), Thuringian landgraves, knights, electors from Saxony, among whom was Frederick the Wise, famous for his supportive attitude to the celebrated Martin Luther, reformer and Protestant.  The latter, by the way, also lived here for some time, and where the old beech grew, named after him, today there is a monument dedicated to this great man. </p><h2>  Restoration, exhibitions </h2><p>  Do not count how many times Altenstein was destroyed and rebuilt.  Currently, it is considered a historical monument, and at the moment it is undergoing reconstruction work carried out here regularly.  Some rooms have already been restored, and now there are small exhibitions in which everyone can visit.  People are happy that there is an opportunity to visit this stunning architectural complex. </p><p>  Tours are carried out strictly according to the schedule, which tourists are informed in the information desk located near the castle in the premises of the former farm.  When all the necessary work in Altenstein is completed, an extensive memorial and historical complex will begin to work here. </p>

    <h2>  Bad fussing </h2><p>  All cities in Bavaria are very beautiful, living conditions are very good.  Bad Füssing is no exception.  This is a cozy town, which in 1950 was considered a resort.  At that time, the Germans tried to find oil here, but instead found <span>thermal springs.</span>  Since then, residents of Germany and other countries come here to rest.  There are spacious streets, beautiful fountains, green parks and squares.  In a word, this place is rightfully considered the pride of the country.  Despite the small size of the town, there are as many as three large thermal complexes.  Impressive, isn't it?  Everyone chooses where to go - in “Therma-1”, “Johannesbad” or “Therma Europe”.  Judging by the reviews, tourists really like a vacation in Bad Füssing, and they do not regret at all that they visited here. </p><h2>  Kelheim </h2>

    <p>  Many travelers, arriving in Bavaria, prefer to go first to Kelheim.  But this is not because the city attracts them with something.  Just here you can catch a boat next to the old monastery called Veltenburg.  By the way, you will have to swim through the famous Danube Fault. </p><p>  Some inexperienced travelers do not immediately understand what is at stake.  Not everyone has heard of this fault.  What is he like?  In fact, this is part of the Danube, located between Weltenburg and Kelheim.  Its length is 6 kilometers.  Here the Danube flows in a deep narrow gorge, and on top of the water rises the cliff tops, on which magnificent mixed forests grow. </p><p>  If there is a really fantastic place in Germany, then this is undoubtedly Bavaria.  Sights, reviews of which are full of admiring words, are a real magnet for tourists, who are becoming more and more here every year. </p>
