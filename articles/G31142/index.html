This serves as a guarantee that the money will be returned in any case.  Liquid property is real estate, securities, transport.  Upon successful repayment of loans, the burden is removed from the property.  But if the money is not returned, then the bank can sell the property.  The sale of collateral by Sberbank is described in the article. </p><h2>  About the pledge </h2><p>  The guarantee should be liquid property that is transferred to the bank in case of insolvency of the client, violation of the terms of the contract and the schedule for making payments.  A credit institution always uses its right to sell property, since it needs not only to return borrowed money, but also to make a profit. </p>

    <p>  The value of collateral is less than market, which attracts buyers.  This is due to the need to quickly make a profit.  The interests of the borrower are not taken into account.  In Sberbank, most of the property is presented in the form of real estate, since it is it that is provided for mortgages and other loans. </p><h2>  Procedure </h2><p>  Sberbank sells collateral in two cases: </p><ul><li>  based on a court decision; </li><li>  by mutual decision of the lender and the borrower. </li></ul>

It should be borne in mind that this measure is extreme.  First, customers are offered debt restructuring.  With complete insolvency, the bank goes to court.  Things may not come to this if the client has agreed to the voluntary sale of collateral by Sberbank. </p><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  The implementation procedure is carried out by mutual agreement of the debtor and the creditor or on the basis of a court decision, if there is no agreement between the parties.  The borrower has the right not to wait for a court decision and to sell the property on his own, but with the permission of the bank.  Since the pledge implies a ban on registration operations, without the consent of the implementation will be impossible. </p><p>  If the client is insolvent and at the same time cannot pay the debt for restructuring, the bank goes to court.  This is necessary to obtain permission to sell the property.  Usually the court accepts the party of the creditor, and upon receipt of the court order, the bank sells the subject of pledge.  The debtor has 2 or 3 months for the voluntary sale of property, which is much more profitable for him. </p><h2>  Debt coverage </h2><p>  If in a short time the borrower sold a mortgage, for example, real estate, then first he must pay the debt to the creditor.  It turns out that the client independently determines the price of the object, it can be equal to the market price, it is important that the proceeds be enough to fully repay the loan. </p>

    <p>  The acquisition of collateral is beneficial to the buyer.  After all, he has the opportunity to become the owner of liquid assets at a low price.  For example, if you want to buy an apartment through an auction, then you need to select the object that meets the requirements.  Then you should offer the highest price.  After that, there is the possibility of obtaining a mortgage. </p>
