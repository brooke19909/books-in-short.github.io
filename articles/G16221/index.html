Developers are trying to make products as convenient as possible for each user. </p><p>  According to most buyers, this technique copes with all the tasks for a solid "five".  The manufacturer is constantly supplementing the range with new models, using the latest developments.

    <h2>  Briefly about the company </h2><p>  The activities of the Slovenian company began in the 50s.  She made her debut in 1958. The first appliance that went on sale under this brand was a stove.  40 years after its founding, the company significantly expanded its facilities by opening branches in America and in European countries.  All products, including Gorenje vacuum cleaners, began to occupy a leading position in the global market.  Repeatedly Slovenian technology became the winner in various categories.  The experts praised the simplicity of operation, functionality, modern design and, of course, quality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Russia, Ukraine and other countries of the former CIS, the products of this company are in high demand.  The developers have tried to take into account all the needs of customers as much as possible, so for more than 10 years, many prefer only the Slovenian brand. </p><h2>  Distinctive feature - design </h2><p>  Each Gorenie vacuum cleaner has an important distinguishing feature - a stylish and modern design.  Even with a cursory glance at any model of the assortment range, the thoughtful design of the case immediately catches the eye.  Many buyers believe that it is in this criterion that few can compete with Gorenje.  Each owner of a vacuum cleaner of this brand is proud of his purchase. </p><p>  At the first experience of working with the device, it is immediately noticeable how ergonomics are thought out by the developers.  All the forces of the company are devoted to creating not only a beautiful, but also a convenient device that is capable of performing a large number of functions. </p><p>  Choosing a vacuum cleaner of this brand, you can be sure that everything in the house will be at the highest level.  Cleanliness and lack of dust will be an excellent addition to the stylish design of any interior. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner burning" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1942864.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning radius and equipment </h2><p>  All Gorenje vacuum cleaners, regardless of series, are equipped with modern developments.  It is these technical solutions that distinguish products of the Slovenian manufacturer against competitors.  The first thing that users noticed was a rather long power cord.  In some models it reaches 9 m. If the height of the telescopic tube is still added to this length, the cleaning radius will be almost 22 m. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some buyers mistakenly think that with such a cable it is quite difficult to move around the room.  They have doubts - will he not get confused?  Definitely not.  The developers installed a special rewind system on the devices, which works very quickly.  It is thanks to her that it is quite convenient to handle the power cord. </p><p>  What features will the manufacturer still surprise?  To do this, consider a set of components.  In principle, standard accessories are attached to most models: parquet and corner brushes, nozzles for cleaning carpets, upholstery of upholstered furniture.  But so-called technical novelty is attached to some devices.  This is a nozzle with ultraviolet radiation.  It is used to disinfect any surface.  As you know, ultraviolet mercilessly destroys all types of bacteria and other harmful microorganisms. </p><h2>  Features of work and a filtration system </h2><p>  Gorenje vacuum cleaners, which have a capacity of over 1.6 kW, are equipped with a modern soft-start system.  Its task is to prevent engine overload.  This solution can significantly increase the life of the device.  It is also worth paying attention to the suction power.  All devices of this brand have a fairly high rate.  This was achieved through the use of heavy-duty motors and a properly designed air intake system. </p><p>  When describing Gorenje vacuum cleaners, one cannot keep silent about the filtration method used by the manufacturer.  Since the main task of the vacuum cleaner is to absorb dust, the developers had to think about ensuring that it did not go outside with air.  This is what multistage filtering is responsible for.  It uses <span>HEPA filters</span> and carbon <span>filters</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vertical vacuum cleaner gorenje" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1942863.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dust collector </h2><p>  The Gorenie vacuum cleaner can be equipped with both a plastic container and a trash bag.  In modern models, the manufacturer preferred to use these two types of dust collector at the same time.  For example, a HIGIENIC bag holds trash, even the smallest one, while the CLEAN BOX container takes care of hygiene. </p><p>  There is a special indicator on the case of vacuum cleaners.  It lights up if the dust bag is full. </p><h2>  Features of vertical models </h2><p>  Gorenje vertical vacuum cleaner is very convenient to use.  The developers used a cyclone system in such models.  Thanks to her, maintaining cleanliness in the house will be quite simple.  All devices are equipped with batteries, this makes them the most mobile and independent of the mains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaners gorenje reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1942865.jpg" width="500"></div>
