Rating of insurance company "VSK"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many residents of Russia, who first fell into an emergency situation, are wondering whether it is possible to trust the promises of organizations that provide insurance services to the population.  VSK is not the last in the insurers rating, however, disputes over the advisability of contacting one of its representative offices do not subside. </p><h2>  Key options for choosing an insurance company </h2><p>  What should be considered when choosing a company to conclude an insurance contract?  This question is quite complicated not only for beginners, but also for those who have repeatedly come across the insurance industry.  First of all, you need to get answers to the following series of questions: </p><ol><li>  How long has the company been operating in the insurance market? </li><li>  Is the organization reliable enough? </li><li>  What rating (based on data from rating agencies and popular reviews) does the insurer have? </li></ol>

    <p>  The organization‚Äôs activities are universal.  The license obtained by the company allows its employees to insure legal entities and private clients for many types of programs (over 100).  In addition, the organization provides reinsurance services, which distinguishes it from similar organizations in the form of LLC.  VSK (insurance company) today serves over 10 million private customers and more than 125 thousand legal entities. </p><p>  Until 2011, the name ‚ÄúMilitary Insurance Company‚Äù was hidden under the abbreviation ‚ÄúVSK‚Äù.  After the renaming, the institution was listed among domestic insurers as the ‚ÄúAll-Russian Insurance Company‚Äù.  In the same year, it became known about the acquisition of a significant stake in VSK by OSAO RESO-Garantia (25%).  The insurance company includes such legal entities as LLC ‚ÄúVSK-Mercy‚Äù and LLC ‚ÄúVSK-Med‚Äù. </p><p>  In 2012, VSK IJSC crossed the 20-year mark.  According to an assessment conducted in 2002 by the rating agency Expert RA, the organization's activity was rated as A ++, which indicates an extremely high level of reliability.  The company confirms this status throughout all subsequent years of work in the Russian market. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Main advantages </h2><p>  Positive feedback about VSK insurance company allows us to conclude that customers managed to evaluate such moments as: </p><ul><li>  The presence of a huge number of regional representative offices, which makes it possible for the organization‚Äôs employees to provide the population with a full range of insurance services in any fairly large population center of the country, as well as make payments for insured events throughout Russia.  It does not matter where exactly the contract for the provision of insurance services was concluded. </li></ul><ul><li>  A high degree of reliability, systematically confirmed by the rating agency, is a guarantee of timely fulfillment of obligations by the organization for all who apply to VSK JSJSC.  Thanks to a balanced insurance portfolio, sufficient insurance reserves and a risk reinsurance system, the possibility of bankruptcy of an organization is minimized. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Objectivity of company performance assessment </h2><p>  Experts believe that the popular reviews about the VSK insurance company, widely presented on forums and on otzovik sites, are real PR, designed to attract additional customers.  The negative assessment is given to the insurer mainly by competing organizations and customers who inattentively read the terms and conditions of insurance contracts at the time of signing the documentation. </p><p>  Popular reviews are very subjective, as each service provider has both fans and ill-wishers.  In addition, you should not cut all branches of the company and all its employees under one comb.  If a person who insured any risks in the organization encounters the poor work of a particular manager, then a negative review about the company should contain a link to this particular employee (indicating the name of the employee and the location of the VSK unit). </p><p>  It should be noted that, according to customer surveys, the rating of VSK insurance company is rather low - the organization‚Äôs service suits no more than 1/3 of the population familiar with its services.  This fact is quite simple to explain: the insurer is more focused on servicing legal entities, rather than private clients. </p>

    <h2>  Insurance company "VSK": reviews of satisfied customers </h2><p>  Positive assessments of the insurance services provided by this organization are much less common than negative reviews, which is obviously related to the peculiarity of the Russian mentality.  People rarely write reviews of companies whose services suit them.  In reality, there are more clients satisfied with the work of this insurer than it might seem at first glance.  Let's try to find out what moments pleasantly surprised the clients of VSK IJSC: </p><ul><li>  The insurance company (insurance house) prepares documents and disburses funds due quickly and without unnecessary questions, despite the fact that the car that had an accident was purchased on credit.  According to a number of positive feedback from car owners insured in the Moscow Region, the quality of the company's services is at a fairly high level. </li></ul><ul><li>  According to motorists, they are quite satisfied with the service at VSK (insurance company).  The reviews (CASCO) often indicate that company employees timely inspect the car and provide customers with a list of car services that repair cars in an accident.  Despite the long period of payment of compensation, difficulties with the return of funds usually do not arise. </li></ul><ul><li>  Many customers who repeatedly insure their cars at VSK under OSAGO are convinced that the calculation of insurance compensation in the event of any insured event is made in a timely and correct manner.  The amount paid is enough to repair a damaged car. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews about the insurance company "VSK" </h2><p>  Many Russian residents who have already taken advantage of insurance programs of VSK JSJSC note that the company's offices employ incompetent, slow and uninterested employees in attracting new customers.  Workers are sorely lacking.  It takes a very long time to wait for a call from a company employee who promises to call back in the near future.  As a result, customers are forced to figure out the information they need on their own. </p><p>  There are cases when an insurance company refuses to pay money for health insurance due to the fact that this program has allegedly ceased to work.  Moreover, the VHI policy was issued only 2 weeks ago for a period of 12 months.  Money for insurance services is not returned to the client. </p>

    <p>  The analysis showed that the reviews about the company "VSK" are closely related to the assessment of the staff of the institution.  Employees of the All-Russian Insurance Company very often ignore phone calls.  Lacking relevant information, many employees refuse to give advice and send clients for help to other specialists, and those, in turn, to the following.  Instead of customer service, office workers discuss personal issues by phone.  In addition, the following situations occur: </p><ul><li>  VSK employees refuse to insure vehicles manufactured before 2005, citing the fact that they are not supposed to pay for such transactions. </li></ul><ul><li>  Documents provided by clients to the offices of an insurance company are often lost.  Those injured in accidents are forced to collect a package of papers again. </li></ul><ul><li>  The hotline of VSK insurance company does not justify itself.  Customers who call the number indicated in the policy have to call back to the common regional number.  Company employees do not have the habit of introducing themselves to their subscribers.  Not finding the answer to the question of the caller, the operator can hang up. </li></ul><ul><li>  When issuing OSAGO policies, customers are forced to pay for additional services, such as life insurance or property insurance.  In the event of refusal from imposed insurance, company employees tighten the conditions for accepting applications and expand the list of documents provided. </li></ul><ul><li>  When an insured event occurs, the clients of VSK JSIC, who spend their holidays abroad, have to solve their problems on their own. </li></ul><ul><li>  Employees of the company ignore their customers, create queues, and themselves do their current work, for example, draw up policies for previously accepted documents. </li></ul><ul><li>  Communication of VSK personnel with customers often takes place in a rude manner.  Employees of the institution can easily close the office for a technical break without warning visitors waiting in line. </li></ul><p>  Individuals are often unhappy that company offices dealing with resolving situations and compensating for injuries do not work on weekends. </p>

    <h2>  VSK: employee reviews </h2><p>  According to former managers of the institution, work at the VSK insurance company is a kind of lottery.  Formal employment does not guarantee the <span>organization‚Äôs staff</span> the level of earnings that they promised during the interview.  The salary of VSK employees consists of a small salary and a bonus for the implementation of the completed plan. </p><p>  The premium percentage depends on the number of insured customers.  To achieve the desired performance, the employee must have the following qualities: </p><ul><li>  Be able to speak beautifully and convince customers; </li><li>  to be cunning and prudent. </li></ul><p>  According to one of the former employees, IJSC ‚ÄúVSK‚Äù is engaged in servicing only profitable customers.  Everyone who is attracted to work as an insurance manager should be ready to participate in numerous trainings on the sale of insurance products and continuing education courses. </p><h2>  CASCO - one of the most popular insurance products </h2><p>  Many motorists are also interested in the services provided with transport insurance in VSK LLC (insurance company), reviews. </p><p>  CASCO Classic is a multifunctional product developed by the company.
