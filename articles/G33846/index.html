True, the damage was fixed promptly.  The compact placement of all hotel buildings does not cause inconvenience to families with small children.  Restaurant, pools and garden within walking distance.  Visitors noted the high prices of local doctors and the dubious schemes of the proposed treatment. </p><p>  In the high season, the pool was very crowded.  Sometimes queues appeared in the dining room.  Periodically running out of refreshments on the beach.  The positive moments of their stay in olakli were highlighted by the friendly staff, the delicate service, the professionalism of the animation team and the friendliness of the reception staff.  Many vacationers have expressed a desire to return to this hotel. </p>
