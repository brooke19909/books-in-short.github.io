To answer this question, it is enough to carefully study all available methods.  We have collected the necessary material and are ready to help you.  But before you begin to actively use the instructions, you need to understand the purpose of the tariff.  After all, it exists for a reason, although sometimes it can cause a lot of questions about the appropriateness of use.  In fact, everything is clear and simple. </p><h2>  Why do I need a tariff? </h2><p>  Before you find out what tariff is connected to ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù, you need to understand its purpose.  The meaning of the existence of such a service is quite simple - the profitable use of mobile communications.  The tariff offers a whole package of various elements: minutes, additional functions, Internet traffic and much more.  They provide comfortable use of mobile communications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to find out the tariff" class="if uuid-3141518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3141518.jpg"></div><p>  In most cases, using the tariff is beneficial, especially if you study all the details and benefits.  It is possible to switch to standard call rates, but then you will spend much more money.  Therefore, do not refuse to use this service.  And in order for you to be comfortable, we will analyze how to find out which tariff is connected to Tele2 and in what ways it can be done. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Activate the USSD command </h2><p>  The easiest option is a regular telephone command.  To use it, just do the following: </p><ol><li>  Pick up the phone. </li><li>  Go to the section for dialing. </li><li>  Enter the command: * 107 #, press the call button. </li><li>  A window will appear on the phone screen where the necessary information is indicated.  To get details about your service, you can then use the official website or call the support operator. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="This is what the USSD command looks like for tariff information" class="if uuid-3141539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3141539.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, you won‚Äôt need a lot of actions, but you will immediately understand how to find out which tariff is connected to Tele2.  Feel free to use the instructions, and you will succeed.  In the meantime, we will move on to the next method, which is associated with calling the operator. </p><h2>  We call in support </h2><p>  How to find out what tariff plan is on Tele2 using customer support?  To implement this, just use our special instruction: </p><ol><li>  Dial the number 611 on the phone, press the call button. </li><li>  At first, you will hear an answering machine that asks you to perform a series of manipulations. </li><li>  The response of the operator will follow. </li><li>  Explain to him the whole problem (if necessary, provide additional information: full name or keyword). </li><li>  Then he will voice all the information and send the details in the SMS message. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="raovat.alouc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The operator is ready to talk" class="if uuid-3141530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3141530.jpg"></div><p>  This method is effective, but not always convenient.  Although, thanks to this option, you can find out what tariff is connected to ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù on the number of your loved one or friend.  But in this case, you will have to provide additional information: name, passport data or keyword.  If you can not answer the operator, then information will not be given.  Next, we consider the possibility of using the official website of the mobile operator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  We use your personal account </h2><p>  How else to find out what tariff is connected to Tele2?  The third way for this is the personal account of the subscriber.  To use it, just follow a few steps: </p><ol><li>  Launch a browser. </li><li>  Go to the official website of the mobile operator. </li><li>  Use the "Login to My Account" button in the upper right. </li><li>  Enter your mobile number. </li><li>  Expect to receive a text message with a code. </li><li>  Enter the received data. </li><li>  In the window that appears, the necessary information will immediately appear. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Here is the name of your tariff" class="if uuid-3141535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3141535.jpg"></div><p>  There is nothing complicated in this procedure.  Follow all necessary steps carefully.  If you do everything right, you can quickly get the information you need. </p><p>  But it may happen that USSD commands do not work, and the site is unavailable.  In this case, you just have to call the operator and not just request information, but try to find out why it is not possible to use other options.  Sometimes a system crash occurs, and individual subscribers encounter such unpleasant problems. </p><p>  So that they are resolved as soon as possible, you urgently need to contact support and talk about what happened.  Perhaps the problem is individual, but thanks to the call, you will quickly find a solution.  The mobile operator is always open for calls and appreciates each subscriber.  Use these conditions and try to be advanced users. </p>
