This is quite convenient, as it eliminates the need to carry cash, and if you lose, your savings will not be affected.  After all, a bank card can be restored.  It would seem solid advantages.  However, often with cashless payments, the user is asked for a PIN code that must be remembered.  If you forget it, you will not be able to use your own money.  What if this has already happened?  Let's find out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rv-mo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out your pin code of a sberbank bank card" class="if uuid-3190667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3190667.jpg"></div><h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  Before we tell you how to recover the PIN code of a Sberbank card, let's find out what it really is. </p><p>  It must be understood that funds must be reliably protected.  For this reason, when making various transactions, they request a PIN code.  This is usually a combination of several numbers.  Their number varies from four to eight. </p><p>  How to find out your Sberbank bank card PIN?  This information is reported to the client when issuing "plastic."  The PIN code can be transmitted in a sealed envelope or allow the client to choose their own option.  In the latter case, a special device is used, so the selected code does not have to be communicated to a bank employee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For security reasons, only the client should know this information, that is, the PIN code.  Moreover, some organizations recommend remembering the numbers and destroying the envelope.  So that no one can access it.  It is believed that in this case, your savings will be reliably protected, no one outsider will be able to use them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tkdcamp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover pin code of a sberbank card" class="if uuid-3190668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3190668.jpg"></div><h2>  What is it needed for? </h2><p>  It is fair to say that the PIN code is not always requested.  It is not surprising that with prolonged non-use, customers forget this information. </p><p>  For example, when paying for small purchases, transactions are carried out automatically without asking for a PIN code.  However, if the amount exceeds the limit established by the bank, you can not do without entering this information. </p><p>  Also, a PIN code is requested at ATMs when trying to withdraw cash.  If you regularly use this feature, be sure to remember or write down the combination of numbers. </p><p>  But for making an online payment, this information, as a rule, is not required.  In addition, when performing any action, the PIN code is never requested by bank employees.  Be careful not to give information to scammers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="life.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://life.ru/t/%D1%8D%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0/1191731/dyriavyi_plastik_kak_propadaiut_dienghi_s_kart_sbierbanka"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover pin code of a sberbank card methods and options" class="if uuid-3190672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3190672.jpg"></div><h2>  How to remember? </h2><p>  If you remember the information, you will not have to wonder how to find out the PIN code of a Sberbank card if you forgot.  After all, this will not happen to you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, first of all, you need to know that the code should never be indicated on the card itself or stored nearby.  Because in this case, it can become known to attackers who gain access to your money. </p><p>  The easiest way is for those customers who use the same bank card.  However, you must admit that this is relatively rare.  The most common situation is when a client uses plastic cards of several organizations, getting confused in PIN codes.  That is why it is important not only to remember the combination of numbers, but also to ensure its reliable storage. </p><h2>  How to store? </h2><p>  You can record PIN codes, but do not provide any further information.  For example, the cards to which they fit.  Try to securely store such information.  If it is written on paper, keep it out of the reach of others.  If in an electronic file, use a password so that no one gets access to valuable information. </p><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find your pin bank card code of sberbank instruction" class="if uuid-3190674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3190674.jpg"></div><h2>  Do I need to change? </h2><p>  If the bank automatically issued you a PIN code, you can take the opportunity to change it.  This is not necessary at all.  However, you can set a combination of characters that will be easier to remember. </p><p>  However, it is important to understand that the code should not be too simple.  This should not be information that may become known to outsiders.  For example, your date of birth. </p><h2>  What to do if forgot? </h2><p>  How to find out the PIN code of a Sberbank card?  This is the first question a client faces in a similar situation.  It arises for various reasons.  Some customers do not use the card for a long time, and some get confused, using several at once. </p><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how can I find out the pin code of a sberbank bank card if I forgot" class="if uuid-3190675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3190675.jpg"></div><p>  In any case, there is only one question.  How to find out the PIN code of a Sberbank card if I forgot? </p><p>  Do not panic right away.  First of all, try to remember where you have this combination.  If the PIN code is not recorded anywhere, you will have to rely on your own memory. </p><p>  In any case, do not rush to guess the combination of numbers, because after making three incorrect attempts, your card will be blocked for a short time. </p><p>  That is why it is worthwhile to recall in advance some of the most likely options, write them down, and then try to enter information in an ATM.  If the attempts were unsuccessful, you will have to personally contact the bank office. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  How to find out the PIN code of a Sberbank card if I forgot?  Such information is known only to the client.  If your PIN code is not recorded, but you cannot remember it, you will have to perform the following steps. </p><ul><li>  Contact the bank office with a passport.  A codeword is also required. </li><li>  Request a PIN change.  It should be noted right away that this procedure is carried out only with the personal presence of the bank card holder.  This is due to the fact that the code word, unlike the PIN code, may be known to the bank employee. </li><li>  After changing the information, you can use your own card. </li></ul><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt remember the code word, the ways and options, how to recover the PIN code of the Sberbank card, come down to the need to reissue it.  It is worth noting that this procedure is performed for a fee.  However, the cost should be clarified additionally, since it may depend on the type of ‚Äúplastic‚Äù, as well as the reasons for reissue.  As a rule, the cost of this procedure is equal to the cost of annual maintenance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="1ku.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the pincode of a card to sberbank if you forgot" class="if uuid-3190676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3190676.jpg"></div><p>  It should be noted right away that a new card will be produced after a few business days.  At this time, the client can withdraw funds from his own account, presenting the employee identification documents. </p><p>  The instruction on how to find out your PIN code for a Sberbank bank card comes down to trying to remember this information or change it by contacting the bank‚Äôs office and using the code word.

According to customer reviews, you have to expect from a few days to several weeks. </p>
