    <p>  The first among such banks is Sberbank.  Therefore, it is not surprising that many prefer to issue loans here.  Let us consider in more detail what credit rate is in Sberbank today. </p><h2>  Customer requirements </h2><p>  In order to provide the citizen with certain money, the bank must be sure that the person will be able to repay the debt on time.  If all borrowers do not comply with the requirements of the agreement in a timely manner, then over time the credit institution is at risk of bankruptcy.  To prevent this from happening, each client undergoes a thorough check. </p><p>  In this case, citizens must meet a number of requirements.  First of all, a bank employee checks the credit history of the client.  If it contains a lot of negative reviews and comments about the fact that the borrower did not pay the debt on time, then there is a high probability that he will do so in the future.  Therefore, most likely, he will be refused a loan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, only citizens of the Russian Federation aged 25 to 75 years can get a loan.  Among other things, it will be necessary to provide a certificate confirming that the potential client has a permanent job and earnings.  The total length of service over the past 60 months should be at least six months. </p>

    <h2>  What loan programs are available to individuals in 2017? </h2><p>  If we talk about interest <span>rates of Sberbank,</span> it is worth considering that this bank has been on the market for a long time and during this time it provided its customers with collateral and unsecured loans. </p><p>  Consumer <span>loans at Sberbank</span> are divided into 3 categories: </p><ul><li>  <em>Consumer</em> .  In this case, no collateral or financial guarantee is provided.  However, it should be borne in mind that such a program is distinguished by the largest overpayment.  In order to obtain such a loan, it takes the least time and documents from the applicant. </li><li>  <em>Under financial guarantee</em> .  This is a pretty good offer, which is very popular today.  In this case, you can get a pretty decent amount of money without specifying your property as collateral. </li><li>  <em>For military personnel</em> .  There are preferential conditions for NIS participants. </li></ul><p>  For consumer loans, lending rates at Sberbank are really low.  It is worth considering the main programs of the bank, which are more popular. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mortgage programs </h2><p>  In Sberbank, you can get a loan to purchase an apartment or house.

    <p>  Citizens of the Russian Federation can get a loan at a rather low credit rate at Sberbank if they meet the requirements for young families. </p><p>  In addition, you can obtain loans for the construction of a private country house, or apply for a mortgage for the purchase of real estate located outside the city.  There is a military mortgage. </p><p>  Before applying for a mortgage, it is recommended to contact local authorities and clarify what benefits may be provided for a particular case.  Now in Russia there are a huge number of government programs, thanks to which you can get even lower credit rates at Sberbank.  Consider the current proposals in more detail. </p><h2>  Unsecured Programs </h2><p>  Of course, each applicant wants to receive large sums of money, while not mortgaging their property or not bringing guarantors to the bank. </p><p>  Sberbank really has such programs.  In this case, loans are issued exclusively in national currency and for a period not exceeding 60 months. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The minimum loan amount is 15 thousand rubles, and the maximum possible will be equal to 1.5 million. The credit rate at Sberbank is calculated based on the specific situation, and averages from 22% to 26.5%. </p><p>  However, it is worth paying attention to the preferential conditions that customers of the bank can receive.  We are talking about holders of retirement payroll cards.  In this case, the credit rate at Sberbank can be lowered to 17.5 -23.5%. </p><p>  In order to get such a loan, you must provide copies of your passport, work book, as well as a certificate confirming the availability of wages for the last 2 quarters.  After the operators send all the data to the head office, the application will be considered within 3 days. </p><p>  If the holder of a pension or salary card applied to the bank, this period is reduced to a few hours.  In addition, it is enough for such bank customers to provide only their passport. </p><p>  The main advantage of this program is that there is no need for clients to take out life insurance. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about the shortcomings, it is worth highlighting only too long a period for consideration of an application for new customers. </p><h2>  Credit secured by a financial guarantee </h2><p>  If the client has the opportunity to guarantee his solvency, the bank can provide him with the most favorable terms of service.  At the same time, the limit on the amount that the client can receive is 3 million rubles, and the payment term should be no more than 60 months. </p><p>  In this case, the interest rate will be from 21% to 25%.  The situation will also change for the better if the client is already a holder of a salary or pension card.  In this case, the percentage will be reduced to 16.5-22%.  This program is valid for citizens of the Russian Federation aged 18 to 75 years.  To obtain a loan you need all the same documents as in the first case. </p><p>  If we talk about the benefits of this program, then it is worth highlighting a lower annual rate.  In addition, customers do not have to draw up a deposit.  Among the shortcomings, users of this bank did not single out any disadvantages. </p><h2>  Mortgage for secondary housing </h2><p>  In this case, we are talking about liquid real estate, which is sold on the secondary market.  Clients who are citizens of the Russian Federation can receive a loan amount that will be up to 80% of the estimated value of the apartment planned for purchase.  Moreover, the loan agreement is concluded for a period of 360 months, and the rate is from 13.5-20.5%. </p>

    <p>  However, at the same time, the client must take out life and health insurance.  If he refuses to perform this operation, the interest rate increases by 1%.  In order to get this loan, you must provide a standard set of documents.  Also required papers that will confirm the status of the acquired housing. </p><p>  In this case, applications are considered for 7 days.  As an initial advance, you can use the money received for the birth of a child.  At the same time, you can repay the entire loan amount ahead of schedule at any time. </p><p>  In addition, many are interested in Sberbank credit card rates.  This is not surprising, since loans of this type are gaining immense popularity. </p><h2>  Credit cards </h2><p>  With their help, you can pay in stores or withdraw cash from ATMs in the city.  Therefore, each potential bank customer is primarily interested in the possibility of obtaining a card. </p>

    <p>  With the right approach, you don‚Äôt have to overpay anything on the loan.  The fact is that the first 50 days no interest on the loan is charged.  Accordingly, if during this period the client repays his debt, then the interest rate on the credit card of Sberbank will not be charged, respectively, the overpayment will be zero.  The maximum limit for such loans is 600 thousand rubles.  Usually a card is issued for a period of 3 years.  After this time, you can reissue it.  If the client was not able to repay the debt within 50 days, then after this the loan rate will be from 25 to 33% per annum.  It is very profitable today. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Before you find out the interest rate of a Sberbank credit card, you should consult with a bank employee, as the conditions are constantly changing. </p>
