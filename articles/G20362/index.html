    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  For the first time, sailors discovered a bay in the Sea of ​​Japan in 1856.  It was a British ship “Hornet”, so the bay was named after the captain of the ship - the port of Michael Seymour. </p><p>  In 1857, a corvette steamer belonging to the Russian flotilla sailed to the shores of the bay.  The team could not immediately consider the shape, but before sunset the fog had gone, it became clear clearly the border of the bay.  And then the bay was named in honor of St. Olga, Princess of Kievan Rus.  The discovered river was named after Habakkuk's father, and the one that flowed into the bay was Olga. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The next morning, Father Habakkuk set up a cross on the nearest hill, on which the date and names of the discoverers of the bay were inscribed.  In 1858 a military post was already formed here, and Lieutenant Derper N.K. became its first commander. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Village Olga of the Primorsky Territory is a territory assigned to the southern region of the Far North.  The average annual temperature here does not exceed + 6.3 ° C, but the humidity is average, about 66%.  The wind is usually not strong, with an average speed of 4.9 m / s. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure and transport </h2><p>  The village of Olga Primorsky Krai is a small village, but there is everything for a comfortable stay, a hospital, pharmacies and even a museum.  There is a bus connection with the village, although until 1990 it was possible to get to Vladivostok only by plane.  Until 1980, passenger ships regularly called at the port, which is located in Olga Bay.  There is no railway connection with the village, but plans are underway to build a road that will have a station in the village. </p><h2>  Attractions and relaxation </h2><p>  The village of Olga of the Primorsky Territory is a picturesque corner of nature with clean sandy beaches, despite the low average annual temperature.  It will not be hot here, but in the summer season (from June to August) the water temperature warms up to + 22 ° C.  The beaches of the village are located in the bay, where the water warms up much faster than in the sea itself.  There, even in the hottest weather, it does not rise above +16 ° C. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But recreation centers in Olga of the Primorsky Territory are accepted not only by those who wish to bask in the sun and swim.  There is a ski base in the village where you can rent equipment and enjoy plenty of skiing.  There is also an ice rink. </p>

    <h2>  Natural monuments </h2><p>  Literally 12 kilometers from the town of Olga there is the Serafimovskaya cave.  This is a four-tiered cave, with multiple streak formations, 47 meters deep and 380 meters wide.  In the lower tier there is a small lake. </p><p>  One of the attractions of the region’s natural origin is Mokrushinskaya Cave.  It has two tiers and 4 halls, up to 25 meters high and up to 60 lengths. Near the cave entrance there is a well that connects the first and second tiers.  Below, in the first tier there is a small lake.  The total area of ​​the cave is 800 meters, which defines it as the largest in the entire Far East. </p><h2>  Where to live? </h2><p>  There are enough recreation centers and hotels in Olga, Primorsky Krai, to welcome everyone. </p><p>  You can stay at the hotel at Rosmorport, which is located on Rucheynaya Street 11. There are 3 types of rooms, from standard to luxury, although there are only six.  On the territory there is a guarded parking and a bathhouse.  The cost of living is from 2100 rubles. </p><p>  In the village there is a children's camp named after Demyan Mamatov, located on Arsenyev street, 22. If you wish, you can settle with local residents or in nearby villages.  They will not ask much for accommodation, and for a fee they will prepare dinner. </p><p>  Extreme people have the opportunity to settle in a tent, but it is worth remembering that the infrastructure is still poorly developed, so there are no amenities.  The coastal zone of the bay is a recreational place where vacationers and tourists are welcome year-round. </p>
