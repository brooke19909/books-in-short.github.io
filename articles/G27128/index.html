  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Magnetic storms</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Perhaps today there is no such person who does not know that <span>cosmic bodies</span> and the phenomena occurring on them can influence his health. </p><p>  Geomagnetic, or, as we are used to call them, <span>magnetic, storms</span> arise as a result of a perturbation of the <span>geomagnetic field.</span>  The duration of such a process can be from 3-7 hours with minor excitations of the magnetosphere and up to several days in the case of extremely strong waves. </p><p>  At the moment when powerful flares occur on the Sun, outbursts of flows of charged particles occur in interplanetary space, which, when interacting with the <span>Earth‚Äôs</span> magnetic <span>shell,</span> cause disturbances of this very shell.  Magnetic storms significantly affect the life of a person.  During these periods, we experience various kinds of inconvenience.  And they are associated not only with health.  Magnetic storms can disable satellite navigators, radio and telephone communications, can also cause deterioration of electrical appliances, sometimes cause tsunamis and other natural disasters (floods, earthquakes). </p><p>  The effect of <span>magnetic storms</span> on humans </p><p>  The human body with its ability to adapt to any conditions, including meteorological, sometimes even surprises scientists.  As a rule, a completely healthy person never reacts to magnetic storms.  This is due to the fact that adaptive mechanisms in such people work faster and, accordingly, they do not feel geomagnetic changes on themselves.  But what is to be done for that majority of the weather-dependent population (up to 75%), which does not differ in special health? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When the flow of charged particles has not yet reached the Earth‚Äôs magnetic shell, that is, at the very moment of solar flares, some people already experience adverse weather effects (reaction times may vary for different people).  Most often, this manifests itself in the form of migraine, increased blood pressure, <span>poor health,</span> insomnia, and in some cases, exacerbation of chronic diseases. </p><p>  It is almost impossible to avoid the geomagnetic effect, as well as wait it out at home, but you can reduce it a little.  So, doctors advise weather-dependent people, first of all, to reduce physical activity and especially monitor nutrition during magnetic storms, since on such days cholesterol levels increase markedly, you should also refrain from drinking alcohol and heavy foods.  For preventive purposes, in the absence of contraindications, you can take the drug "Aspirin".  Instead of air travel (if possible) it is better for people sensitive to geomagnetic peaks to use land transport, since at an altitude of several thousand meters the effect of magnetic storms only intensifies.  Some doctors, who also practice alternative medicine, suggest strengthening their health with special herbal infusions that enhance our adaptive mechanisms. </p><p>  Sun observation </p><p>  In January 2009, the Coronas-Photon apparatus was successfully launched in the Arkhangelsk region.  A set of space telescopes designed to study the Sun, called "TESIS", was installed on its board.  Magnetic storms with the help of this installation can be monitored in advance and inform the population about the impending disturbances of the geomagnetic field.  As you understand from the foregoing, this is very important and necessary in our time, when there are many more weather-dependent people than some 30-40 years ago. </p><p>  Thanks to TESIS, today we can track magnetic storms in real time, make predictions of geomagnetic changes for a month and monitor the unrest occurring on the Sun. </p><p>  Of course, to some extent this helps a person to cope with the influence of various kinds of cosmic manifestations.  But only constant attention and care for one‚Äôs own health guarantee well-being, and not only during periods of magnetic storms. </p>
