In reality, due to the influence of the environment, such an indicator is currently impossible to achieve.  But in an average home network that has a printer, a computer, two laptops, three smartphones, a TV, several servers, the speed is perfect.  Data exchange is quite fast, the signal easily passes through 5 concrete walls in a three-room apartment.  The TP-LINK Archer C20 reviews fully confirm the network's resilience. </p><p>  According to customer reviews, the signal does not break during the day.  During testing, it was revealed that the router copes well with a large load, it does not overheat and does not turn off.  Among all budget devices, this router can be called the most optimal, as it has balanced software and good functionality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tp link wireless router archer c20 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2122226.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  If someone thinks the design of this device is already familiar, then this is not just.  Before my eyes, an Archer C2 router immediately involuntarily arises, only a little less and a different color.  The case was created in gray, the lid in dark blue. </p><p>  By the way, when working with Tp-Link devices, it is easy to understand what type and price policy a particular model belongs to, only in one color of the case.  As a rule, premium devices are painted in white.  The less expensive ones got a black color, and the budget ones - blue-gray. </p><p>  The design of the described router is the most common.  The manufacturer‚Äôs logo is ‚Äújammed‚Äù, there are activity diodes and antenna connectors.  Ventilation is located on the bottom.  The cover is made of glossy material.  It collects dust fairly quickly, and you need to wipe the device quite carefully.  Plastic easily breaks and is damaged.  In reviews of the TP-LINK Archer C20, it is often written that the device is really very fragile.  The diodes are bright, many users write that if it was possible to reduce the intense cross section or even turn it off completely, the device would look much neater.  The WAN port has two color indicators, so if the Internet disappears, the port will glow orange.  Antennas can be tilted and rotated, but they themselves are non-removable type. </p><h2>  Router Connection </h2><p>  Connecting this router is performed according to the usual and familiar scheme.  First you need to connect it to the mains and turn on using the key.  The successful process will be notified by a lit indicator on the front panel.  Further to the Internet port, that is, to the Internet connector, you need to connect the cable from the provider that provides the network. </p><p>  If you want to make router settings on a network cable by connecting it to a computer or laptop, then you can use it.  It comes with the kit.  With it, you need to connect the computer to the router.  If there is such an opportunity, then it is better to do just that.  This will increase the reliability of the process and, probably, there will be no unpleasant moments in the process of work (in the form of errors and so on).  In reviews of TP-LINK Archer C20 they write that this method is the most optimal. </p><p>  If you want to connect to the router wirelessly, you can do so.  After turning on the device, all devices will immediately detect the access point.  The name is factory.  In order to connect to the received network, you should know the pin code, which is indicated on a piece of paper pasted on the bottom.  It also says the name of the network, which is configured at the factory. </p><h2>  Control Panel Login </h2><p>  To get to the control panel of the router, you need to open a browser on the device that is connected to it.  Next, go to tplinklogin. </p><p>  A special window will open where you need to log in.  Now in a special column should indicate the username (login), then the password.  As a rule, the default word is admin, which should be entered in both columns.  The address for entering the settings, as well as the login and password are indicated on the sticker at the bottom of the router.  In reviews of the TP-LINK Archer C20 router, it is written that even a novice can enter the menu quite easily. </p><p>  After such actions and clicking on the "Login" button, the settings page will immediately open.  There you need to set all the important data. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tp link archer c20 ac750 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2122228.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to connect to the internet? </h2><p>  When configuring each router, you must correctly specify the type of connection.  This will guarantee the correct operation.  In order for the router to connect to the provider, you must specify the appropriate parameters.  As a rule, they are spelled out in the contract.  It is at this stage most often most people encounter problems when devices can connect to the router, but they can‚Äôt work with the Internet.  This is due to incorrect settings.  In reviews of the TP-LINK Archer C20 router, users say that this problem occurs quite often. </p><p>  Before proceeding with the configuration, you need to know the type of network connection.  It is installed by your ISP.  If this is not a dynamic IP, then the user should see a special username and password in the contract.  They are issued by your ISP. </p><p>  In the settings you need to go to the ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù tab, then select the WAN menu.  Here, the first thing to do is select the type of connection.  As we said above, this is often a dynamic IP.  If the provider works with this type, then you do not need to choose anything else.  All parameters will be set by default.  A connection will immediately appear after turning on the router.  The indicator on the device will light blue.  In reviews of the TP-LINK Archer C20 wireless router, users write that using this connection mode is much easier than working with others. </p><p>  The only option that uses dynamic IP, but the Internet does not work, is associated with binding the provider to the MAC address.  In this case, you need to find out all the necessary data and continue the setup. </p><p>  If the connection type is L2TP or PPPoE, then you need to select the connection in the menu, and then set all the parameters that are issued by the provider.  If you have any questions, you can call support or a service center to find out exactly how to fill in the information.  In addition, you can order the service of connecting the router to the network.  The TP-LINK Archer C20 AC750 reviews confirm that for a beginner, calling a specialist is the best solution. </p><p>  There is also a ‚ÄúDefine‚Äù button, which allows the router to choose the type of Internet connection itself.  As a rule, this option works with absolute accuracy. </p><p>  If you can‚Äôt set up the device in any way, then you should still contact your provider and not try to solve the problem yourself.  Otherwise, you can ‚Äúbreak‚Äù the software, after which you will have to take the router for repair. </p><h2>  Wireless and password settings </h2><p>  If the router is dual-band, that is, the one we are describing now, then it can distribute two Wi-Fi networks at once.  One of them operates at a frequency of 2.7, the second - 5 GHz.  If any of these networks is not needed, then you need to go to the "Operating frequencies" tab.  There you can disable one of them, which will not be used.  It is enough to uncheck and save.  According to the reviews on the TP-LINK Archer C20 RU router, both networks work perfectly together. </p><p>  It is possible to make networks workable, for example, on legacy devices to work with a purity of 2.4 gigahertz, on new ones - already with a more modern standard. </p><p>  Next, go to the ‚ÄúWi-Fi network‚Äù tab.  In it, you can change the signal settings.  Here you can specify the number and region in which the router is used.  Settings must be saved. </p><p>  The next step is to set a password on the network.  To do this, go to the tab "Wireless Security".  Further, the parameters must be set exactly as the provider proposes and prescribes in the contract.  That is, enable the recommended option, select the type of authentication, encryption, and only then set the password, which you should invent yourself.  Next, you need to save the settings and be sure to restart the TP-LINK <span>Archer C20</span> WiFi router <span>.</span>  Reviews about the shutdown / on process are good - everything happens pretty quickly. </p><p>  It should be understood that if the user left both networks operational, you will have to set two passwords.  If, before changing the network data, gadgets or other devices were connected, then after changing the password and name, you must reconnect again, indicating new data.  At this stage, changes to the settings of the WiFi wireless network in the TP-LINK Archer C20 (positive reviews about its reception) are coming to an end. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="router tp link archer c20 ru reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2122229.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Change admin password </h2><p>  Immediately after you start using the router, you must change the password from the control panel.  First of all, it is necessary to protect the device.  This can be done in the "System Tools" tab, then in the "Password" submenu.  You should write the old password and username, and then come up with new data.  After that, save the settings. </p><p>  The main thing is not to forget the password, because then it will not work to go to the ‚ÄúControl Panel‚Äù if necessary.  Therefore, you will have to roll back the settings to the factory settings.  This means that you will have to re-configure the TP-LINK Archer C20 RU router (reviews also say this).  After that, you can start using the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tp link archer c20 router reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2122227.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  This router leaves a good impression, which is similar to the sensations of the older model C50.  This device is suitable for ordinary users who purchase their first router, and for those who choose a device that supports standards that are relevant at the moment. </p><p>  If there is a desire to transfer a small network to the 5 GHz band, there is a need to turn on the printer, to create a network storage, then all this can be realized with the help of this router, it is quite suitable for such purposes. </p><p>  The TP-LINK Archer C20 router control panel, reviews of which are good, is presented in Russian, so it will be easy to figure it out.  All the settings that you need to specify for a functioning network will be enough to use the router.  If you want to configure other functions, then you can do it.  However, you must be sure of the data that is entered.  The instructions are both on the official website and on user ones, so if you want to change something, you can always find information about a particular menu. </p>
