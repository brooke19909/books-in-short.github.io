    <p>  It is no secret that modern industrial clusters and the resort infrastructure undergoing their development here coexist with a rather low general sanitary level.  The north of its coastal state of Goa is most adapted to international tourism.  Mostly young people go there, content with modest service, but adoring club nightlife. </p><p>  For a vacation on the "pearl of the English coast" (as Goa has been called since the colonial past), the vast majority of tourists choose two-star hotels that have already proven themselves in the resort business.  For example, such as Sodder s Renton Manor 2 * (India, Goa).  This article is a description of the rest in it, set out based on real reviews from its guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About North Goa </h2><p>  Goa's smallest resort state in India is located approximately in the middle of the west coast of India, washed by the Arabian Sea.  The southern part of the state is less populated and it specializes in a quiet, expensive and respectable vacation.  Among its few hotels, five- and four-star hotel complexes prevail. </p><p>  In another part of the resort state, there are dozens of ‚Äútwos‚Äù and ‚Äútriples‚Äù hotels, including the Renton Manor 2 * we are considering.  North Goa was discovered by the hippies in the 70s, and, perhaps, therefore, since the Beatles it has been characterized by a special energy of freedom, open communication, and the search for opportunities for self-realization.  He has his own, special, well-established image: North Goa can either be loved, understood and accepted as he is, or hated, remaining in the position of mercantilism.  After all, <span>vacation in India is</span> always in tune with the mood of the spa. </p>
