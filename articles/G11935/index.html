There is some truth in this, but not everything is so simple.  The northern part of Goa can provide comfortable accommodation for a respectable audience.  We present to your attention the Royal Boomerang Ashvem Beach 4 * hotel.  We built his review both on the information given by the hotel itself and on the reviews of tourists.  It is noteworthy that until recently, only three stars adorned this hotel.  And the reviews about him were not the best.  Then tourists began to mention a construction site nearby.  But the noise of hammers and equipment did not disturb peace for a short time.  And already this year, reviews radically changed their assessment of the hotel.  Now this is a real ‚Äúfour‚Äù, which also has every right to assign the word ‚Äúspa‚Äù to its name.  The rating at the hotel rose to 6.1 (it used to be three). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Boomerang ashvem 4" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1483444.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is Boomerang Ashvem 4 * located </h2><p>  India, Goa, the northern part of the state, Mandrem, Ashvem beach, near Adjob Temple - this is the original address of this hotel.  However, a huge hotel sign on a high pillar can be seen from afar.  The nearest international airport (Dabolim) will have to overcome sixty kilometers.  Mapusa Bus Station is fifteen kilometers away, and Tivim Railway Station is twenty.  The city of Old Goa, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located sixteen kilometers away.  And the Mandrem resort is two kilometers from the hotel (or half an hour of leisurely walking).  But what is close to the hotel guests, so it is to the coast of the Arabian Sea.  The hotel stands literally on Ashvem Beach.  Goa will also be close to tourists to such attractions of the state of Goa as Fort Chapora.  Nearby is the beautiful Vagator Beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  India, and especially North Goa, makes a shocking impression on the European.  Cows on the streets, their "cakes", garbage ... But the Boomerang Ashvem 4 * hotel looks, according to tourists' reviews, a citadel of cleanliness and order, an oasis of truly comfortable relaxation.  It is worth approaching the reception, as unpleasant impressions dissipate, and you yourself tune in to a carefree pastime.  However, reviews warn, reception staff brilliantly speak only English and Hindi.  So learn languages ‚Äã‚Äãor take a dictionary with you.  The territory that appears to the eyes of the traveler completely dispels his fears that he will be able to spend vacations with cockroaches and in unsanitary conditions.  Everything shines with purity.  Green lawns are carefully trimmed, and hotel buildings (one- and two-story) delight the eye with whiteness.  The last repair took place in 2015.  The rooms have been renovated.  The hotel itself is very small.  Its area is three thousand seven hundred meters.  The hotel consists of two buildings facing each other.  Palm trees grow between them and a beautiful path winds leading to a wonderful beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Boomerang Ashvem 4 (North Goa)" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1482899.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is enhanced by the attention and care of the staff, which perceives the guests as relatives dear to the heart.  The hotel has only forty rooms (previously there were even fewer - twenty).  But this small number of guest rooms has a division into categories.  The cheapest and most demanded is deluxe.  This room type has a garden view, and the sea is visible only from a corner angle.  Superior Deluxe is more spacious and comfortable.  Frontal sea view has a room category called Premium Sea Facing Room.  The pride of the hotel is the suites - ‚ÄúBoomerang Special‚Äù and ‚ÄúHoneimun‚Äù.  The last suite is reserved for the bride and groom who have come to Goa to celebrate their honeymoon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Boomerang Ashvem 4 (India, Ashvem)" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1482897.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What's in the rooms </h2><p>  Hotel Boomerang Ashvem 4 * offers its guests bright and spacious bedrooms, which are en suite with a bathroom.  The decor is very modern.  Especially often, reviews mention lighting - not direct, but coming from color panels.  The room has air conditioning, a flat-screen satellite TV, an extensive safe that can accommodate a laptop, a refrigerator.  Reviews say that the bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a partition made of frosted greenish glass.  This makes the look of the room futuristic.  What vacationers liked was the fact that each guest room adjoins a terrace, where there are two <span>wicker chairs</span> and the same table.  And the inhabitants of the second floor have balconies.  All rooms have fast and free Wi-Fi.  They clean the rooms well, regardless of whether you leave a tip or not. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Boomerang ashvem 4 reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1482898.jpg" width="600"></div>

It can only be found in the chic five-star hotels of South Goa.  There are too many cheap and affordable catering establishments in India.  Therefore, the hotel Boomerang Ashvem 4 * positions itself as a "BB".  This means that breakfast is included in the price.  You can also have lunch and dinner at the hotel, but for a fee.  There is also a bar in the hotel where you can taste a variety of drinks and snacks.  And the restaurant chefs will serve you delicious dishes of European and Indian cuisine.  Breakfast is served on the terrace overlooking the sea in buffet style.  These are standard morning meals.  Different types of eggs, toasts, fruit salad, juice (fresh!), Coffee and tea are put on the tables. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Boomerang Ashvem 4 India Goa" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1482900.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What tourists say about food </h2><p>  Breakfast reviews called somewhat monotonous, but satisfying.  The buffet format allows you to get enough.  The hotel restaurant serves delicious food.  Tourists especially recommended to try seafood.  But the prices in the hotel restaurant are somewhat overpriced, especially in comparison with those that you find in cafes on the street.  However, the Boomerang Ashvem 4 * hotel reviews are called suburban.  So if you do not have a car or a scooter, then you have a small selection of catering establishments.  There is a restaurant at the Sea View Hotel.  In contrast to the hotel described here, there is an excellent pizzeria where the Italian cook works.  They have European quality of service, not too high prices, and you certainly won‚Äôt catch an eating disorder there.  Near the hotel there is a grocery supermarket where you can buy ready-made food (fortunately, there is a refrigerator in the rooms). </p><h2>  Ashvem Beach </h2><p>  But, of course, tourists don‚Äôt go for food to India and North Goa.  The main holiday destination in these parts is the beach and the wonderful warm Arabian Sea.  And in this sense, the Boomerang Ashvem 4 * hotel (North Goa) deserves the most stormy praise.  It stands on the first line of the beautiful Ashvem beach.  This is truly a <span>landmark of North Goa.</span>  The color of the sand may not be as snow-white as in other parts of the state, but it is because of the silt that the river brings, flowing not far into the sea.  On the coast there are volcanic boulders that give the landscape a mystery.  In addition to the warm sea and sandy beach on Ashvem, tourists will find two additional bonuses.  This is not crowded and enchanting sunsets.  The best in Goa - guidebooks say.  And they can be enjoyed without the annoying merchants of all sorts of things, they do not wander on Ashvem.  The beachfront hotel has its own sun loungers and parasols.  But towels do not bother to grab from home.  On the beach there is an opportunity to dine in shekels - institutions right on the beach.  When ordering dishes, you are provided with a table, a sunbed and an umbrella.  So eating delicious dishes will not distract you from a beach holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Boomerang Ashvem 4 Ashvem reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1482901.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists strongly recommend that more often go outside the hotel Boomerang Ashvem 4 *.  North Goa is a very interesting part of the state.  Here, unlike the southern half, you can see the "real India".  However, these places are peculiar, due to the fact that the state was owned by the Portuguese for a long time.  A trip to Old Goa (the city is included in the famous UNESCO World Heritage List) will leave an indelible impression and is guaranteed to fill the memory card in the camera with beautiful pictures.  Tourists praise the excursion to the Dudh Sagar Falls.  In addition to visiting natural attractions, the program includes elephant riding, traffic in the wild jungle, as well as a pilgrimage to the banyan tree, under which some woman often lives in India - a local saint and soothsayer.  As independent excursions, tourists are advised to go to the city of Panjim and the <span>beaches of Morjim</span> and Mandrem. </p><h2>  Hotel Boomerang Ashvem 4 * (Ashvem): reviews of vacationers </h2><p>  Those tourists who visited the hotel in 2016 were satisfied with their vacation.  The territory has become very beautiful, well-groomed.  Electric kettles, a hairdryer and slippers appeared in the rooms.  These amenities allowed the hotel to upgrade its status from three to four stars.  The staff, albeit slow in Indian, is still very welcoming and trying to fulfill all the wishes of the guest.  From the room stock, tourists are advised to choose rooms on the first floor - they have more privacy.  On the second level there is a common balcony, and the stairs leading up are steep and winding.  But the hotel, subject to availability, can be accommodated in the early morning, although the rules stipulate that only from noon.  The hotel has a free luggage storage room where you can put things. </p>
