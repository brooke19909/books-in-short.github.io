What tax benefits do large families have?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Is there any <span>tax exemption for</span> large families in Russia?  This question often arises among the population.  After all, to imagine a family with several children and without a car is very problematic.  A lot of money is spent on a vehicle: maintenance, care, insurance, repair.  All this takes away certain finances.  Many, as many say, are often missing from large families.  The state supports the cells of society with a large number of minor children.  And by all means.  Are there many benefits for the transport tax for large families?  And if so, what are they expressed in?  How are they made out?  How long do they last? </p><h2>  The concept of large families </h2><p>  First you need to understand what a large family is.  Under what conditions can a cell of a society belong to this category?  After all, just families with minor children have no benefits and additional state support is not supposed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax relief for large families" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1438959.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A large family in Russia is considered such after the appearance of 3 babies in it.  Starting from this ‚Äúbar‚Äù, the cell of society as a large one is counted.  And it does not matter, <span>3 children in a family</span> or 10. The main thing is that there should be at least three. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When thinking about whether there is a tax exemption for large families, one should remember: adopted minors are also taken into account.  Just in this case, you have to prove the fact of adoption.  If there are 3 or more children in a cell of a society, then it is considered to be large in Russia. </p><h2>  Is there or not </h2><p>  Is there an <span>exemption</span> in principle <span>from a transport tax for</span> large families?  A moot point.  It is not as easy to answer as it seems.  The thing is that most of the taxes and benefits from the state are set at the regional level.  Therefore, exemption from payment of certain payments is a topic that is decided individually in each region. </p><p>  In other words, exemption from the transport tax of large families in Russia takes place.  But it cannot be said that this bonus is valid throughout the country.  Only in some regions is this possible.  It is recommended to clarify this information directly either in the administration of the city of residence, or in the tax authorities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="large tax exemption for large families" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1438957.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Discounts </h2><p>  Benefits to large families in 2016 regarding transport taxes remain.  No one canceled them.  One thing is for sure: some bonuses from the state are provided to almost all large families. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What is it about?  Citizens are allowed to pay only part of the tax.  In other words, they provide a kind of discount on payment.  It is easy to guess that each region has its own. </p><h2>  Not for everyone and not always </h2><p>  True, the transport tax relief for large families is a rather serious and controversial topic.  It has already been said that in some regions such cells of society are entitled to a full exemption from payment.  And somewhere, people have the right to a kind of discount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="benefits for large families in 2016" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1438960.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Despite this, in some areas (for example, in Krasnoyarsk or Omsk) there are no all transport tax benefits for large families.  This is all due to the small amount of budget financing.  Therefore, as already mentioned, the issue is resolved individually.  It is necessary to clarify on the presence or absence of bonuses from the state in this plan independently. </p><h2>  By request only </h2><p>  If in a particular region there is a privilege on the transport tax for <span>large families (Moscow,</span> for example, provides a discount), then you need to properly arrange it. </p><p>  The main rule to keep in mind is that a ‚Äúbonus‚Äù is issued only through a personally left application.  Just because no one will impose benefits on the population.  You will have to claim your rights.  Only after this, taxes on transport will be levied with the prescribed benefits.  Or a large family will no longer receive payment for transport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  If citizens have the right to the type of benefits being studied, then they must, as has already been said, report this.  But which bodies should I contact?  Here, the population is offered several options for the development of events. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax exemption for large families Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1438955.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Firstly, in some regions, the application of the established form to the MFC can be attributed.  You need to go to the one located at the place of residence of citizens. </p><p>  Secondly, an application <span>for a transport tax exemption</span> can be filed with the tax authorities.  The most common option.  Contact is required either to the authority located at the place of residence / residence of citizens, or at the place of registration of the vehicle. </p><p>  This ends the list of places.  There is no significant difference at the place of circulation.  The main thing is that the family provide a complete list of documents, which is prescribed by law to provide bonuses in relation to the studied payment.  If you do not bring a complete list, you will have to pay a receipt in full until the error is corrected. </p><h2>  About Documents </h2><p>  Documents for transport tax benefits for large families must be provided, as already mentioned, in full.  It is recommended that additional copies be made.  And to come to one of the previously listed bodies with originals and photocopies of papers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what tax benefits do large families have" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1438961.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At the moment, all citizens who have the right to certain bonuses from the state for large families should bring with them: </p><ul><li>  certificate of ownership of a car taxed by payment; </li><li>  applicant's passport; </li><li>  certificate of marriage (or divorce); </li><li>  birth certificates of all children under the age of 18; </li><li>  certificates and extracts indicating the fact of adoption of minors (if any); </li><li>  certificate of a large cell of the company (if any); </li><li>  statement of the established form. </li></ul><p>  Further, all of the above papers are submitted for processing.  If citizens received a payment for paying transport tax, then it will also have to be attached.  You don‚Äôt have to pay anything.  If full exemption from the studied payment is provided, then the account is canceled.  Otherwise, after applying to the MFC or the tax service, the applicants will be issued a new payment. </p><h2>  How much is valid </h2><p>  Some are interested in how much the tax exemption applies to large families.  And is it necessary to submit an application of an established form annually in order to confirm the rights to bonuses from the state behind the cell of society? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="documents for transport tax exemptions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1438958.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Answering these questions is easier than it sounds.  All provided benefits are valid as long as the family has every reason to be considered large.  Every year you do not need to claim your rights.  It is enough to apply only once to the relevant authorities with the previously listed list of securities. </p><p>  Large families end when children reach adulthood or receive emancipation.  If there are 3 minors in the cell, then if at least one of them reaches the age of 18, all benefits will lose their legal basis.  And the family will have to pay the tax for the car in full. </p><h2>  Tax problems </h2><p>  It would seem that there are no special problems.  It is clear that the transport tax is different everywhere.  And issues related to the provision of benefits for large families in this area are resolved individually.  But there is one more problem. </p><p>  Which one, exactly?  It is associated with the interpretation of large families.  In general, as already mentioned, citizens are considered to be large if they have 3 or more minor children brought up.  But in some regions, this ‚Äúbar‚Äù can increase for transport tax benefits.  So even having 3 children does not give a 100% guarantee that you can get a discount on transport tax or completely get rid of it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="application for a transport tax exemption" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1438968.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Benefits of large families </h2><p>  And what are the general <span>benefits for large</span> families in Russia in 2016?  At the moment, you can count on: </p><ul><li>  50% discount on garden fees, utilities; </li><li>  in some cases, the garden is provided free of charge; </li><li>  free meals, textbooks and uniforms for schoolchildren; </li><li>  free use of public transport; </li><li>  children under 6 years of age are provided with medication free of charge; </li><li>  privileges on loans and mortgages; </li><li>  benefits for large families; </li><li>  Once a month you can visit a cultural place in the city for free. </li></ul><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what tax benefits large families have with regard to transport.  This category of persons is eternal beneficiaries.  But they must know about their rights! </p>
