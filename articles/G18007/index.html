You can ride on any track, regardless of which settlement you live in.  The central part of the complex was the town of Ore, which began to develop tourist infrastructure at the end of the 19th century (in 1895 the first hotel was built - “Oregarden”). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The resort is famous for the best ski lift system in Europe, a large number of slopes of different levels (over 120), the length of which is about 89 kilometers.  Trails for beginners ("green" and "blue") are at the foot of the mountains, for more experienced skiers ("red", "black") - in the upper part of the slopes.  Safe ski slopes for children are also available.  There are also the so-called virgin tracks, designed for fans of extreme sports. </p><h2>  Resort Benefits </h2><p>  The advantage of the resort is its location - surrounded by mountains, Auray is protected from strong winds, and the temperature here is often 4-5 degrees higher than in other resorts.  The ski season begins in the first half of November, and lasts until the end of April - beginning of May.  “Scandinavian Alps” - the ski resort Ore is also known by that name.  Sweden can rightfully be proud of it, because every year a huge number of people come here to take a break from everyday hustle and bustle, plunge into the snowy world of the northern beauty, ride on reindeer sledges and taste freshly smoked salmon. </p>

    <p>  The highlight of Ore is the opportunity to contemplate the resort in the light of the evening lights, because four times a week, in the midst of the season, a night lift is activated here, which runs from 18:00 to 21:00.  Therefore, lovers of unusual sensations can, in addition to daytime skiing, try their hand at darker times of the day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Resort infrastructure </h2><p>  Ski resorts in Sweden are notable for their diverse infrastructure, designed for both adults and children. </p>

    <p>  If you are traveling with a child, and you have nowhere to leave him while skiing, you can be calm and feel free to go to the village of Björnen: there is an excellent kindergarten where you can leave your child from 4 years old in the care of English-speaking teachers.  In addition, a special school for beginner skiers will save you from wasting time and effort on teaching your child the wisdom of this sport.  A game uniform and various techniques developed specifically for young skiers will make the learning process entertaining and interesting. </p><p>  What is more remarkable about the ski resort of <span>Auray?</span>  <span>Sweden,</span> including in the villages that make up this complex, practices such a hotel layout in which bunk beds are instead of double beds to save space and heating.  This approach allows you to reduce the cost of living.  Hotels themselves are classified to a greater extent as two- and three-star, which, however, does not prevent receiving a good quality of service from the host. </p><p>  In addition, the "mountain" hotels have an excellent location relative to the slopes, lifts and the center of the resort's boiling life.  When the daylight comes to an end, and the skiers do not know what to do, the so-called après ski comes to the rescue - gatherings in the bar after a busy day.  During après skiing, skiers have fun as they can - they sing songs, dance, play board games, just talk and share experiences. </p><h2>  What is a ski pass? </h2><p>  It is worth noting that an important component of a trip to ski resorts in Sweden (and not only here) is a ski pass - a kind of pass, a subscription that allows you to get on the lift, use the slopes of any level, as well as ride a bus that runs between the villages.  Children under 7 years old with a helmet, the opportunity to ride is free.  Lift pass can be purchased both at the hotel and directly on the ski lifts themselves. </p><p>  If you don’t have your own equipment, you can easily rent it or buy it at special points or shops (in this regard, ski resorts in Sweden do not lag behind other winter holiday destinations) located near hotels or ski lifts.  There is a system according to which you can take equipment in one point (where you start to ride), and pass it in another (where you started skiing) - this is convenient and saves time and effort of skiers. </p><h2>  Sweden ski resorts: Idre Fjell and Funesdalen </h2><p>  Less well-known, but nevertheless worth it to go here, are the resorts Idre Fjell and Funesdalen.  The first of them is located far from the capital of Sweden - almost 500 kilometers.  But here it will be comfortable for beginners of skiing and children.  Cottage villages, located within walking distance from the slopes and lifts, attract guests Idre Fjell cosiness and friendly welcome. </p><p>  The largest sports complex of the Swedish resorts, which has a bowling alley, tennis court, pool, gym, will delight tourists after an active day in the mountains.  Idre Fjell is truly proud of Sweden.  The ski resort circuit diagrams vividly testify to the development and versatility of the tourist structure of the region. </p>

    <h2>  Looking for adventure: Funesdalen </h2><p>  One of the most remote resorts in Sweden - Funesdalen - is located 580 kilometers from Stockholm.  Despite such remoteness, the resort in recent years has attracted an increasing number of vacationers.  Excellent slopes, the best flat trails in the country, excellent snow cover guarantee excellent pastime. </p><p>  Funesdalen consists of three ski centers: Funosdalbergeta, Tyndalen and Ramundbergeta.  From entertainment, such exciting options are presented as <span>helicopter flight</span> to the top of the mountain, from where you need to go down yourself;  ice climbing;  safari on <span>musk bulls</span> and seals.  Agree, classes for sophisticated and thrill-loving guests of the resort. </p><h2>  We are going to Sweden! </h2><p>  Ski tours to Sweden will bring real pleasure to representatives of any country and any age who dream of truly experiencing all the charms and features of the harsh, but such an attractive north. </p>
