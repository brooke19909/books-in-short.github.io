The most active development and construction began in Protaras the last thirty years of the twentieth century.  And now this place has gradually turned into one of the best resort areas of the island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="captain pier hotel apts 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1568756.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The bay we mentioned has one of the best beaches in the entire region.  Tourists can spend the whole day swimming in the calm sea water of the bay and basking in the hot sand.  In Protaras, a promenade with a length of 15 kilometers was built along the coast.  On one side there are shops, cafes and shops, and the second offers stunning views of the sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Resort Climate </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the resort is surrounded by picturesque cliffs, local beaches are almost calm.  Even in winter (January), the temperature here does not drop below +17 degrees, and in the summer, the thermometer rises to 27-30 degrees.  The holiday season begins in early April and lasts until October. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  The most convenient way to get to Protaras from Ayia Napa, the cities are located at a distance of ten kilometers from each other.  You can order a taxi, it will cost inexpensively.  In addition, suburban minibuses and municipal transport run along this route. </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  The best beaches of the resort are located in the area of ​​Fig Bay, which is so named because of the old grove of fig trees located near it.  On the coast, tourists can not only swim and sunbathe, but also engage in water sports.  In spring, shrubs blossom on the coast, and the promenade transforms into a stunningly beautiful alley. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Protaras is an ideal place for children and families, for people who prefer to relax in a quiet place against the backdrop of beautiful nature.  Life proceeds measuredly at the resort, time seems to have stopped here.  Nevertheless, at night there are nightclubs and a disco.  In the evening, an amazing singing fountain works on the embankment, which pleases people with colorful shows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="captain pier hotel cyprus" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1568767.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The city has many interesting places that tourists can visit during breaks between trips to the beach.  In the center of Protaras operates one of the island’s most popular and largest aquariums.  This amazing place will allow you to learn a lot about marine life and at the same time have a great time relaxing and having fun.  In the aquarium you can see about a thousand different marine inhabitants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="captain pier hotel apts 3 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1568769.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the Protars Historical Museum, guests of the island will be able to get acquainted with the ancient history of not only the resort itself, but the entire island.  No less interesting is the fishing village near Protaras called Liopetri.  Once this village was famous for its churches, which were seven in the early twentieth century.  Currently, the number of temples has decreased significantly, but the famous Agios Andronikos church, built in the ninth century, has been preserved.  The construction is known for its unique wall painting. </p><h2>  Captain Pier Hotel Apts 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I certainly want to refer to the reviews of tourists who have already been here.  This complex can be a great option for a budget holiday for those tourists who are going to spend their holidays on such a wonderful island like Cyprus.  Captain Pier Hotel Apts 3 * is best of all for its location.  From the airport to get to the complex is not long.  In addition, the hotel is located next to Partner Bay Beach (50 meters).  It is very convenient for those vacationers who came to the resort precisely for the sake of the beach-sea resort.  The city center can be reached in ten minutes by public transport.  It is not so far, but the hotel is in a fairly quiet place, where there is no noise of vibrant nightlife. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cyprus captain pier hotel apts 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1568758.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The complex has several options for apartments, which are equipped with kitchenettes with utensils and the necessary appliances.  The rooms are new, it is clear that they need repair.  The furniture is also tired, but in good working condition.  In general, the rooms have everything you need for tourists.  Cleaning is done regularly.  The linen and towels in the hotel are new and clean, they are changed quite often, especially with a tip. </p><p>  I would like to pay special attention to reviews on food in the hotel.  According to guests, breakfast in the restaurant is quite monotonous.  Typically, the morning menu consists of scrambled eggs, porridge, toast, jams, ham, vegetables and fruits.  Dinners are more varied, with meat dishes and numerous snacks.  But in the evenings, drinks are not included in the price.  Sometimes small lines appear in a restaurant, but food is always served in sufficient quantities.  The waiters are fast.  In general, the food at the hotel is quite acceptable.  There are cafes and restaurants near the complex, where you can also eat.  Nearby there is a supermarket where you can buy all the necessary products.  This is important because the rooms have kitchens, and therefore you can always cook your own meals. </p><p>  An indisputable advantage of the hotel is its proximity to the beach.  Tourists are very pleased with the sea coast.  The beach has a sand cover and comfortable entry into the water.  The sea in this place is shallow, very convenient for children.  In the bay, the water is always warm and clean.  The best place for kids is simply not to be found. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="captain pier hotel reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1568766.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel staff is friendly, quickly enough serves the guests.  The hotel has a guide offering sightseeing tours.  However, you can see the nearest attractions on your own using public transport.  In addition, you can rent a car, where you can go around the whole island.  Boat trips with fishing or excursions on a pirate ship are very popular among tourists.  Each guest of the hotel can organize their leisure on their own, not hoping for local animation. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Should I recommend the Captain Pier Hotel?  Guest reviews of the complex provide an opportunity to draw some conclusions.  The hotel can be safely classified as a budget institution for unassuming tourists.  But at the same time, the complex has several advantages that allow you to spend a wonderful vacation in it, if you do not pay attention to the minor nuances.  After all, the most important thing is that the hotel is located on the coast of a beautiful bay, and vacationers have an excellent opportunity to relax at sea.  So, the hotel can be advised to non-spoiled guests who are looking for budget options for a vacation. </p>
