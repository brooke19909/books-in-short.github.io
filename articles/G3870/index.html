    <p>  Such air conditioners usually cool up to 8 rooms, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich reaches 200 m <sup>2</sup> .  If you need a multi-split system for 2 rooms, the choice of equipment must be made wisely.  To date, on sale you can find more powerful models that cool houses and cottages with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 2000 m <sup>2</sup> .  However, in this case we are talking about multi-zone air conditioners. </p><h2>  Features of choosing a multi-split system </h2>

With an increase in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room, the power of the unit, fan and heat exchanger increases.  It is also important to consider the requirements for the total power of the external device.  This characteristic refers to the power of the compressor, which in a certain time will be able to convert freon into liquid. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe heat exchanger and fan power should be taken into account first of all, because these parameters provide effective heat removal and airflow.  If you need a multi-split system for 2 rooms, then it is important to consider the ability of the equipment to pump the track.  And indoor units are located at a certain step from an external device.  Here you should take into account the length of the route, which sometimes reaches hundreds of meters.  This indicates that not every air conditioner will be able to pump such distances. </p><h2>  Number of rooms and external factors </h2>

It is important to pay attention also to the fact that, due to the large length of the freon circuit, it is necessary to prefer a more powerful device designed to cool 5 or 6 rooms. </p><p>  When a multi-split system for 2 rooms is selected, it is important to pay attention also to the external characteristics of the devices, this is a matter of taste, design decisions and consumer preferences.  We should not forget about the parameters of the system, the more they are, the more impressive linear dimensions the block will have.  It is sometimes impossible to place fairly powerful blocks on the facade of an apartment building. </p><h2>  Features of the choice of the type of indoor unit </h2>

    <p>  Before making a purchase of a multi-split system, you must also pay attention to the type of indoor unit, it can be: </p><ul><li>  wall mounted; </li><li>  channel; </li><li>  cassette; </li><li>  cantilever. </li></ul><p>  The most popular and familiar to the consumer is the wall block, which is selected in 90% of cases.  However, you can also find the channel device, which is located under the ceiling, which is why it should be installed at the repair stage.  At the same time, hidden installation is achieved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you need air conditioning, a 2-room multi-split system can be considered by you.  It sometimes assumes the presence of a cassette indoor unit, which also provides the possibility of internal installation.  Air is supplied in two or four directions.  The cantilever unit can have one of two versions - subceiling and floor.  In the latter case, we are talking about a design that is installed vertically on the floor and looks like a battery. </p><h2>  Overview of some models of multi-split systems: Mitsubishi Electric MSZ-SF20VAx2 / MXZ-2D42VA </h2>
