  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mamluk Sultanate: briefly on the main milestones</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the medieval Islamic world, warriors raised from slaves were the foundation of the military power of many Muslim armies.  But only the Mamluks were able to turn from slaves into masters and create a powerful Mamluk sultanate (1250-1517), whose borders included the territories of modern Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tsu.ge" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mamluk with a spear" class="if uuid-2489460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51659/2489460.jpg"></div><h2>  Mamluks </h2><p>  The word "Mamluk" is translated from Arabic as "one who owns" or "slave."  The political life of medieval Egypt was characterized by palace intrigues, betrayals, a constant struggle for power, so the caliphs needed selflessly devoted and well-trained military men who were not associated with various clans. </p><p>  The solution was found simple and effective.  Strong slave Turkic and Caucasian boys were bought at slave markets, then professional warriors were made of them.  They lived in barracks, they could be seen only by educators and the caliph.  They studied the basics of Sharia and Islam, learned to write and speak Arabic, the mentors inspired students with reverence for the monarch and blind devotion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mamluk training" class="if uuid-2489463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51659/2489463.jpg"></div><p>  But their main occupation was training in military art, horseback riding, fencing and archery, swimming, wrestling, and spear possession.  The Mamluks were rightly considered the best cavalry military force in the Islamic world.  Moreover, the caliph used them not only in wars, but also to suppress uprisings or intimidate political rivals. </p><h2>  About the Mamluk Sultanate briefly </h2><p>  The gradual exaltation of the Mamluks began under the Sultan Saladin, who ruled in Egypt since 1171.  The brilliant Saladin, who had successfully fought the crusaders, generously granted freedom and land to the Mamelukes who distinguished themselves in battles.  Slaves became lords; by the middle of the thirteenth century, the Mamluk emirs represented until then an impressive political and military force in Egypt that they could take power in the country. </p><p>  The coup occurred in 1250, when the Mamluks overthrew Turkhan Shah and put in his place a man from his midst.  The first sultan of the Mamluk sultanate was Aybek (Aybak) al-Muizz Izz ad-Din.  The Mamluks canceled the transfer of power by inheritance.  Each sultan was selected from the emirs for military merit, valor, intelligence, honesty.  Such a principle made it possible to bring active and capable rulers to power.  This is partly due to the fact that former slaves and strangers (Turks and Circassians) were able to remain at the head of the Mamluk Sultanate and rule the Arab population for more than two and a half centuries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mamluk Armor" class="if uuid-2489464" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51659/2489464.jpg"></div><h2>  Guardians of Islam </h2><p>  The Mamluks seized power at a crucial time for all of Islam.  Waves of crusades rolled from the north to the Middle East, and ruthless Mongol hordes came from the east.  The existence of the Muslim faith was endangered. </p><p>  The Mamluk Sultanate became the only force that was able to rebuff the conquerors.  Around the Mamluks united the whole Islamic world.  In the period from 1260 to 1291, the Mamluks inflicted three defeats on the Mongols and practically ousted the Crusaders from the Middle East, finally putting an end to the major crusades. </p><p>  Military successes made the Mamluk Sultanate the most authoritative state in the Islamic world.  From now on, the rulers of Egypt and Syria were called the "pillars of Islam" and the "defenders of the Faith."  Under the power and protection of the Mamluks were the main Muslim shrines in Medina and Mecca, they led the Hajj and guarded the faithful pilgrims. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mse-msu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Medieval mecca" class="if uuid-2489462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51659/2489462.jpg"></div><h2>  Internal struggle </h2><p>  The Mamluks were divided into two large groups according to ethnicity.  Slave boys from the Caucasus, mainly Circassians, were settled in the barracks, which were in the towers (burjs) of the Cairo citadel, so they were called burjits.  Mamluks from Turkic slaves were brought up on an island located on the Nile, their name "Bahrita" comes from the Arabic word "Bahr" (river). </p><p>  These groups became the founders of two dynasties in the Mamluk Sultanate.  From 1250 to 1382, the Bahrites ruled, but then, through intrigue, a string of coups and conspiracies, power passed to the Burjits.  Ethnic Circassians occupied all leading administrative and military positions, the discontent of Arabs and Turks was quickly and ruthlessly suppressed, which allowed the small Burjits to rule before the Ottomans conquered the Sultanate. </p><h2>  A fall </h2><p>  At the beginning of the sixteenth century, the <span>Ottoman Empire</span> reached the peak of power.  Like most empires, she sought to conquer neighboring territories.  Therefore, her clash with the Mamluk Sultanate, a formidable rival, but weakened by internal conflicts, was inevitable.  The main battle took place in August 1516.  The Mamluks bravely fought with the Ottoman forces, but there were fewer, and most importantly, they were opposed by artillery and selected Janissary infantry. </p><p>  The Mamluk sultan died, the remains of his completely defeated army fled to Egypt.  The Mamluks elected a new sultan and tried to establish a struggle against the Ottomans.  However, in 1517, the <span>Ottoman Empire</span> easily broke the resistance and included the Mamluk Sultanate.  The Mamluks remained landowners for almost three centuries before Napoleon came to Egypt, but almost completely lost their actual power. </p>
