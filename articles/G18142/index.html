They are located in the Pskov, Leningrad, Moscow regions and in the Altai Territory.  They are all different.  Let's look at each of them. </p><h2>  Petrovskoe (Uzskoe) lake </h2><p>  The lake, located in the Pskov region, officially has two names: the first is Uzskoye, the second is Petrovskoye.  The flowing body of water, the coastline is indented, there are many shallow areas overgrown with vegetation.  Refers to the basin of the river.  Ties.  There are practically no beaches.  The bottom is silty.  The shores are very steep, low and sloping.  Many islands and bays are characteristic of such a reservoir as Lake Peter.  Where is it located in the Pskov region?  In the Dedovichi district, between two similar reservoirs: lake.  Gorodnovsky and lake.  Lokno.  Uzskoye occupies 2.3 km <sup>2 of</sup> the Sudom Upland.  The average depth in the pond does not exceed 5 m, but in some places it can reach 10 m. It feeds on precipitation and underground keys. </p><p>  The lake is surrounded by forests and meadows, a little further there are fields for the irrigation of which water from this reservoir is used.  There are practically no tourists here, but there are a lot of fishermen.  This is easy to explain - Petrovsky Lake is rich in aquatic vertebrates.  Along the coast there is pike and perch, bream and bleak - in depth.  Previously, there was a lot of zander, however, due to siltation, its population decreased significantly. </p><p>  There are two settlements in the lake area: the village of Uza (directly on the coast) and the village of Vyshegorod (1.5 km south of the reservoir). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petrovsky lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1365438.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is located in the Pushkinogorsky district.  The dimensions are medium (area - almost 175 hectares).  Refers to the basin of the river.  Soroti.  The pond is shallow, the average does not exceed 2 m. There are pits closer to the center.  The depth in them reaches almost 4 m. It is practically not used for tourism and fishing, since one part of the reservoir is located on the territory of the Mikhailovskoye Museum-Reserve, and the other is a part of Pushkinogorye.  The bottom is mostly muddy, but in some places stones and sand are found.  The banks are gentle, the approaches to the water are steep.  Wetlands are often found.  The pond is surrounded by forests and meadows.  Vegetation under water is well developed, this creates favorable conditions for many species of fish.  In large quantities, bream, roach, pike, perch, etc. are found here. The villages of Petrovskoye and Mikhailovskoye are located near the lake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petrovsky lake where is" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1365439.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Petrovskoye Lake in the Moscow Region </h2><p>  In the suburbs, near the small village of Zarudnya, there is another Petrovsky lake.  This body of water was formed in the floodplain of one of the most significant rivers in Russia - the Oka.  Administratively, the reservoir belongs to the Kolomensky district.  Lake Staritsa is small, has an oval shape.  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãless than one square kilometer (0.6 km <sup>2</sup> ).  The average width of the water area is about 300 m, and its length is up to 3 km.  Although Petrovsky is flowing, there are few fish living here.  In order to catch at least something, you need to know certain places.  And this information is owned only by local residents.  There are practically no visiting fishermen and tourists.  The coastline is unattractive for recreation.  There are absolutely no forests.  But almost all the coast is occupied by different villages, it is worth noting that there are a lot of them in this area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Petrovskoe Lake in the Leningrad Region </h2><p>  Another Petrovsky lake is located in the Leningrad region, or more precisely, in the Priozersky district.  It is separated from the village of the same name by 1.5 km, and from the railway station Petaj√§rvi a little more - 5 km.  The lake occupies a little more than 85 hectares.  It is the source for a small stream, which flows into the Petrovka River.  On the coast there are bases, a camp, some private cottages and arable land.  There is no forest zone, only in some places there are shrubs. </p><p>  Near the southeast coast there is a section of the lake, which is bogged by about 20 m. In summer, the reservoir blooms quite strongly.  This is due to the farm, which constantly pollutes the lake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petrovsky lake photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1365440.jpg" width="500"></div>
