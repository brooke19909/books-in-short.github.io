It is located in the <span>Irkutsk region,</span> its <span>population</span> is about 240 thousand people. </p><h2>  What is famous for Angarsk? </h2><p>  The city has well-developed industrial production.  Here are oil refineries, there are factories that produce household chemicals, polymer products, fertilizers, building materials, nitric acid and ammonium nitrate.  Many city residents work at the large enterprise of the nuclear industry - the Angarsk electrolysis chemical plant.  The product of its production is enriched uranium. </p><p>  The activities of enterprises not only bring revenues to the city budget, but also cause significant damage to its ecology.  The environmental situation in Angarsk is tense, the city has the status of a settlement, occupying one of the places in the ten most environmentally dangerous cities in Russia.  But in spite of everything here they care about the comfort of its inhabitants, they are actively engaged in beautification.  The city has a railway and bus station, 10 km from the city is Irkutsk airport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Angarsk Hotels" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43719/1629541.jpg" width="413"></div>

    <h2>  Angarsk - hotels of the city </h2><p>  A high level of industry allows us to develop the necessary infrastructure, which the guests of the city of Angarsk offer.  Hotels here are represented by a sufficient number - there are more than ten of them.  Other accommodation facilities provide hostel services - hostels, private apartments.  Due to the adverse ecology in the vicinity, tourists practically do not come to Angarsk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Angarsk City Hotels" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43719/1629542.jpg"></div>
