The nearest settlement is the village of Lanshino, Serpukhov district, Moscow region. </p><h2>  How did the quarry form? </h2><p>  Lanshin quarry spreads on the banks of the Oka.  It was formed at the place of limestone mining. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.geocaching.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lanshin quarry, on a cliff" class="if uuid-2242572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46186/2242572.jpg"></div><p>  Since time immemorial, natural stone has been mined manually, in an open way.  In 1954, wheelbarrows were replaced by powerful equipment, and production acquired an industrial scale.  Limestone was loaded onto dump trucks and transported to a crusher.  The crushed stone obtained after processing, as well as crushing waste (sand and flour) were loaded onto barges and sent along the Oka and Volga to their destinations. </p><p>  When it became clear that the main layer of limestone is located directly under the village of Lanshinsky, they stopped mining the stone, stopped deepening the channel of the Oka in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe former quarry.  Now the multi-ton barges do not go to this place, and the quarry itself is gradually overgrown with pine forest and turned into a picturesque place.  The foundation pit stretched for 2 kilometers, around it rocky outcrops in height from 10 to 20 meters remained in some places. </p><p>  The steep walls of the quarry are dotted with cracks, as the mining of limestone by modern miners was carried out using explosives. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="nineoaks-fisheries.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lanshin quarry, fishing" class="if uuid-2242694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46186/2242694.jpg"></div><h2>  Fishing spots on the Oka </h2><p>  Abundance of fish is the main attraction, which is famous for Lanshin quarry.  Fishing in these places is excellent.  And besides, it‚Äôs free, which is rare for the Tula region. </p><p>  In the quarry, any fish that is found in the Oka, famous for fish abundance, is caught.  Throughout the pit walks perch.  There are bream, zander, asp, roach.  In the backwaters under snags, catfish doze.  Especially a lot of pikes here. </p><h2>  Resting-place </h2><p>  Lanshin quarry attracts not only fishing lovers.  In the surrounding forests mushroom pickers love to roam.  They come here just for outdoor recreation: take a walk along the quarry, go down to the water itself, enjoy the sunset.  Overnight stay rarely due to the proximity of the village. </p><p>  Climbing rock outcrops would be a great place for rock climbers and hikers to train.  However, they rarely train here due to the lack of public transport.  Due to the rare arrivals of climbers, no one brings down stones that lie badly.  As a result, the walls for rope lifting are unreliable.  But this is a great opportunity to test your skills in conditions close to natural, when a pebble can fly on top of your head, and the swinging ledge strives to jump out from under your feet.  In such conditions, overhead insurance is required.  An unpleasant surprise for tourists who first go downstairs are sea buckthorn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  They love these places and extreme people.  Motobikers try their equipment here, they arrange safari on jeeps. </p><h2>  We are looking for a quarry on the map </h2><p>  Public transport does not go to a career.  The nearest railway station Priokskaya is 8 km from the quarries, buses go to Lanshino 2 times a day, but the schedule is inconvenient. </p><p>  Oka River on the map - the main landmark for finding a career.  You can get to it by several routes.  One of them leads through the village of Lanshino.  This path is easy to follow on the map, but in practice it‚Äôs rather difficult to get to the quarry through the village due to the steep descent. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-zoom="11" data-type="roadmap" data-lng="37.295335600000044" data-lat="54.8407755"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/4/6/446.png"></div><p>  The most convenient travel option runs through the Career Management.  However, the movement along this path is limited by a barrier, and you need to ask security to let it pass. </p><h2>  How to get there by car? </h2><p>  You can see how to get to the Lanshinsky quarry on the map.  And you can use the oral description of the route. </p><p>  The path to the coveted place of lovers of fishing and relaxing rest lies along the Simferopol highway and is 20-25 kilometers from the exit from it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to the lanshinsky quarry, Simferopol highway" class="if uuid-2242686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46186/2242686.jpg"></div><p>  In more detail, the path looks like this.  Heading to Tula, you need to pass the traffic police post, which is located in front of the Oka, cross the river over the bridge, and then under the flyover, located two kilometers from the bridge. </p><p>  Passing under the overpass, you must sharply turn right to rise to its beginning, then turn to the left exit leading to the descent. </p><p>  After descending from the overpass, the road to Lanshin quarries runs parallel to the floodplain of the river to the railway bridge, next to which is the Zaoksky brick factory. </p><p>  Near the T-junction, where there is a sign for Aleksin, you need to turn right and drive under the railway bridge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="winter-fishing.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bridge near the city of Aleksin" class="if uuid-2242696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46186/2242696.jpg"></div><p>  After 7 kilometers from this place, there is a bus stop near the fork, near which you should turn right along the road leading to the Oka River, and after 1 kilometer from the start of the branch, turn left.  Starting from this place, a field packed road leads directly to the river, and then you need to go along the channel.  The Oka River itself will lead to a career.  On the map, this stretch of path is 2 kilometers. </p><p>  If the traveler accidentally turns left before reaching the quarry, then the road will go around it on the left side and still lead to the cherished place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="inerton.ucoz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lanshin quarry, coast" class="if uuid-2242706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46186/2242706.jpg"></div><h2>  Career Reviews </h2><p>  Lanshin quarry is a favorite place for residents of all three regions: Kaluga, Tula, Moscow.  On the Internet there are a huge number of forums uniting fishermen.  After each trip to the quarry, fishing enthusiasts talk about which fish was caught, which bait, whether it was spinning from the shore, from a boat, a spoon-bait or a freezer.  In winter, the ice fishing season begins, accompanied by a discussion of the thickness of the ice and the number of holes made. </p><p>  The atmosphere of Lanshin quarry is amazing: picturesque nature, abundance of fish, natural conditions for extreme sports.  However, there is a huge problem: the quarry surroundings are used as a dumping ground.  Gradually, the landfill captures an increasingly large territory, threatening to destroy this unique place created by the joint efforts of man and nature. </p>
