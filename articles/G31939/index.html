Girls try to look attractive, competing with each other.  Therefore, the work of makeup artists is more than enough.  If earlier ladies themselves did makeup, and professional make-up artists exclusively did it, now everything has changed.  Many women also want to get flawless makeup, but not everyone knows this art.  As you know, demand creates supply.  Therefore, make-up artists appeared on the services market. </p><h2>  Profession popularity </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.collective-evolution.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much make-up artists get" class="if uuid-2661575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2661575.jpg"></div><p>  The demand for specialists who can do professional makeup is increasing from year to year.  Makeup artists are people who have creative talent and a delicate taste.  Due to the abundance of all kinds of techniques and tools, a professional is able to significantly change the appearance of the client. </p><h2>  Makeup artists are different ... </h2><p>  One common name combines several directions at once: </p><ul><li>  The makeup artist is exclusively engaged in decorative cosmetics.  His task is to gently apply shadows, blush, tone, etc. </li><li>  Makeup artist-stylist provides a wider range of services.  In addition to makeup, he can pick up a hairstyle, accessories, give tips on applying decorative cosmetics. </li><li>  Make-up cosmetologist works not only with decorative, but also with makeup products.  He must be well versed in the types of skin and be able to choose the right tools. </li></ul><h2>  Who can become a makeup artist? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much makeup artists in St. Petersburg get" class="if uuid-2661583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2661583.jpg"></div><p>  In this profession, not only special skills, but also personal qualities are of great importance: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Sociability.  Extroverts are more likely to find and communicate with customers.  Are you burdened by someone else's society, and the need to contact with unfamiliar people turns into a hateful duty?  Perhaps it is worth giving up the career of a makeup artist. </li><li>  Stress resistance.  A make-up specialist constantly has to communicate with people.  Some of them will be capricious and even with a successful result will remain unhappy.  We must not lose our temper and not give up. </li><li>  Appearance.  Clients trust a well-groomed master more than a slobber with sloppy manicure or hair regrowth. </li></ul><h2>  How much do makeup artists get? </h2><p>  This question interests many.  However, a definite answer simply does not exist.  In order to somehow form an impression of the salaries of makeup artists, you need to delve deeper into this topic in more detail. </p><p>  Income depends on: </p><ul><li>  places of work; </li><li>  type of employment; </li><li>  number of customers; </li><li>  cost of services; </li><li>  demand for the master. <div class="photo" data-original="amormagazine.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much makeup artist gets per month" class="if uuid-2661577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2661577.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  How much does a makeup artist receive per month?  The average income of a Russian makeup artist is 36 thousand rubles.  The spread of salaries is from 15 to 60 thousand rubles.  Interestingly, according to statistics, Moscow was not the leader in terms of income.  It is difficult for a makeup artist to earn more than 50 thousand rubles a month.  This is due to the abundance of craftsmen who, in order to attract customers, significantly reduce prices.  Other masters, faced with a lack of orders, are forced to follow the example of their colleagues.  Ultimately, this reduces the income of all makeup artists on the market. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What determines makeup artist‚Äôs income? </h2><p>  Experience and professionalism greatly affect the level of a master‚Äôs salary.  And also the ability to fulfill the requirements of customers, and they can be very difficult, sometimes even specific.  Not every make-up artist is ready to go against his internal esthete and, for example, use incompatible shades in one make-up. </p><p>  In addition, you need to be able to capture the mood of the client.  Someone is set to talk, someone, on the contrary, prefers to remain silent, without distracting the master.  Make-up artist needs to be a little psychologist and sensitively monitor the client‚Äôs mood.  Many women worry.  Especially if you trust the master for the first time or prepare for an important event. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.megadiscountpharma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does a stylist get a makeup artist" class="if uuid-2661581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2661581.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs hard to say how much makeup artists get.  Indeed, in addition to paying for the work done, the client can be generous with tips.  According to some masters, the income can be about 100,000 rubles.  per month and more.  Agree, the amount is very attractive. </p><p>  However, do not rush to envy.  Makeup artists have to constantly buy cosmetics, brushes and other supplies.  All this requires funds that you have to deduct from your own fee. </p><p>  In addition, training for a makeup artist never ends.  In the cosmetics market, there are constantly new items that need to be tracked.  For additional training, you also have to lay a certain budget. </p><h2>  Where do makeup artists work? </h2><p>  Even for a newly made make-up master, there are many vacancies.  Such employees are recruited to beauty salons, photo studios, theaters and television.  If you have experience, you can qualify for participation in professional photo shoots and fashion shows.  Due to the irregular schedule, the work of a makeup artist can be combined with training, permanent employment or a life full of other events. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.viva.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="makeup artist reviews" class="if uuid-2661585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2661585.jpg"></div><p>  Having settled down in <span>a beauty salon</span> or photo studio, you can engage in private practice or undergo training and get an additional skill.  You can not only do makeup, but also engage in the selection of accessories, compiling the entire bow.  Having learned how much a stylist, make-up artist receives, you decide to seriously consider this option.  After all, income can be about 200 thousand rubles.  This largely depends on the number and generosity of customers.  However, the presence of a goal always makes you develop and strive for more. </p><h2>  How much make-up artists get in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Going to makeup courses, future specialists are confident that immediately after receiving the certificate they will quickly find a stable job.  However, not all salons are ready to hire an inexperienced master without a portfolio.  Even if the employer arranges a certificate obtained at the courses of visage, it is not necessary to count immediately on a large income. </p><p>  To get serious experience in the profession, the makeup artist will have to work 1-2 years with a fixed salary of 20-30 thousand rubles.  This period should be regarded as a paid practice.  Serious income should not be expected, because it is work for the future. </p><p>  How much do makeup artists get?

It is curious that Moscow make-up artists can earn even less because of high competition.  However, do not forget about the ability to independently find customers, and not work at a fixed rate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crawlus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does a makeup artist receive in Moscow" class="if uuid-2661579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2661579.jpg"></div><p>  How much do makeup artists get in Moscow?

However, one must be prepared for a subsequent recession and reduction in income. </p><h2>  What do makeup artists think of their work? </h2><p>  Probably, there is not a single profession whose representatives would be completely satisfied.  Reviews of makeup artists are no exception.  Among the shortcomings, for example, noted complex customers and physical activity.
