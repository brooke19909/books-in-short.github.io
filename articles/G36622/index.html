  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a navigator for a car</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When traveling by car in a strange city, the question certainly arises, how to navigate in a completely unfamiliar area?  Here, modern technological advances come to the rescue, namely car navigators, which will help an ordinary person to easily find the right path to their goal.  To do this, you just need to know <span>how to choose a navigator for a car</span> with a combination of good quality and reasonable price. </p><p>  But just buying and installing the navigator will not work, because before choosing and installing you need to know some tricks, which we will now consider. </p><p>  The main thing you need to decide on is what kind of navigator we need.  And how not to make a mistake when choosing from a large number of proposed models? </p><p>  We will not consider the standard in-car navigators and special applications in smartphones.  Here we will talk only about classic PND devices and about which navigator to buy. </p><p>  It is important in which region you plan to use the installed car navigator;  it is from this criterion that the device‚Äôs navigation system will depend. </p><p>  In most cars, these devices are already installed, but, unfortunately, they very often show incorrect information, so there is a need to replace certain software with them.  This will take a long time, and the result obtained is unlikely to please you. </p><p>  When you are faced with the question "How to choose a navigator?", The first thing you need to choose the right navigation system. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The navigation system</span> is the main component of any car navigator.  If you want to go to Europe, for example, in your car, then navigation systems such as iGO or TomTom are best for you.  But, returning home, you will find that they will not work on local roads, so there will be a need to change either the entire software or the set of maps.  In some navigators, an automatic positioning system is built in, and to turn it on, you need to press only one button.  But, unfortunately, this function is not present on all devices of this type. </p><p>  If you are thinking about how to choose a navigator, then you should know that it is important to choose the right <span>graphical interface for you,</span> because the navigator is usually used while the vehicle is moving, and there is no time to configure it.  Therefore, when choosing a device, try to choose such an interface so that the functions you need are at the minimum number of system clicks.  Navigators such as ProGorod and Citigid have a mobile access menu.  The PND hardware should be hidden from the eyes of motorists under a graphic splash screen in order to make navigator control easier and more intuitive. </p><p>  Before <span>choosing a navigator,</span> you need to decide on the <span>screen size of the</span> device.  The modern standard is 4-5 inches, which is ideal for both passenger cars and heavy vehicles.  This range is provided taking into account the fact that the navigator is located on the front panel of the passenger compartment.  For small or sports cars, it is best to choose a diagonal of 3 inches, as it fits well into the interior and will be behind the wheel of the driver. </p><p>  Which <span>navigator is better</span> to buy - simple and practical with an acceptable price or with a beautiful design and cost many times higher?  Choose you.  But in this case, it is better to give preference to the cheapest car navigator.  Such a choice will be due to the fact that expensive models have a complex interface, but in terms of functionality they often absolutely do not differ from their cheaper counterparts. </p>
