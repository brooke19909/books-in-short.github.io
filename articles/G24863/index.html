  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Step-by-step instructions on how to read estimates. Example of estimates for the installation of a split system</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The estimate is part of the working documentation.  It is necessary for any construction, any work.  The estimate determines how much money is required for the construction site.  How many of them are needed for the production of work?  In the article we tried to tell how the estimate is filled out, where to get data for this?  What are indices and ratios?  What is the estimated cost?  Everything is not as complicated as it seems. </p><h2>  How can this article help? </h2><p>  The article will help to understand the issue a little.  Understand the estimates at the initial level.  Here are only general concepts about the composition of the estimates, examples of estimates for installation.  A bit about indices and ratios.  Details on the preparation of estimates for <span>construction and installation works are</span> considered in MDS 81-35.  2001. </p><h2>  Title page </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="First estimate sheet" class="if uuid-2262308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71691/2262308.jpg"></div><p>  Consider how to read the estimates, for example.  The estimate for the installation of the split system (table in the figure below) contains 13 columns.  There are other types of forms, varying in the number of columns.  But the principle is similar everywhere and the information in the graphs is similar.  The position numbers of the text below correspond to the numbers in the picture of an example estimate.  An example of an installation estimate has been prepared for this article and is not tied to any particular object. </p><p>  1. At the top left is a block - ‚ÄúAgreed‚Äù.  It specifies the contractor.  One who does the work.  The organization and data of the head are indicated.  His signature and seal are also placed here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. At the top right is the ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù block containing the position, surname, initials and signature of the customer‚Äôs manager.  The ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù block is also stamped. </p><p>  3. The name of the construction site is the place of work.  In one construction site, several parts of the work can be combined. </p><p>  4. The number of the estimate.  According to regulatory documents, the following numbering procedure has been adopted: </p><ul><li>  first 2 digits - section number of the consolidated estimate; </li><li>  the second and third is the line number in its section; </li><li>  the third and fourth - the number of estimates in this object estimate calculation. </li></ul><p>  In the example, the estimate number is not set.  It is not included in any documentation. </p><p>  5. The name of the object, work and costs.  Description of work indicating the name and address of the object. </p><p>  6. The basis.  On the basis of what was the estimate formed?  This may be a <span>defective sheet,</span> drawing, technical specifications.  We indicate, for example, technical specifications. </p><p>  7. Estimated cost of work.  The amount of the estimate for installation work prescribed in thousands of rubles.  The indication of the amount in thousands of rubles is regulated by MDS 81-35.2001. </p><p>  8. Means for remuneration.  How much should workers theoretically pay? </p><p>  9. Regulatory complexity.  The amount of man-hours excluding downtime required to complete the work. </p><p>  10. Justification of estimated cost.  The estimate of the example is made in current (forecast) prices for the I quarter of 2018 (but there is monthly indexation).  All prices are recorded in 2001 prices, and then, using coefficients, they are converted to prices of the current period.  This method is called basic index. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tabular part of the estimate example of an estimate for the installation of a split system </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="What does the estimate table look like?" class="if uuid-2262320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71691/2262320.jpg"></div><p>  The estimate heading includes the columns: </p><p>  1. Rate number. </p><p>  2. Code and number of the standard.  Indicates in which standards a budget has been drawn up and by what order does this regulatory framework apply.  In this case, the FER reference is used (federal unit building prices).  The numbers in the name of the quotation mean the numbers of: collection - section - pricing tables. </p><p>  3. The name of the work, costs and unit price.  The work itself is described (in the same way as it is written in the price), a price meter (in this case, 1 split system).  Further, in the name of the quotation, coefficients for positions and position indices are prescribed. </p><p>  4. Quantity.  The quantity is affixed, taking into account the rate meter.  In this example, this is one split system. </p><p>  Unit cost (block 1).  This block includes the current base price and its elements. </p><p>  5. Total / remuneration. </p><p>  6. Operation of machines / including remuneration of labor (machinists). </p><p>  7. Materials. </p><p>  Total cost (block 2).  It turns out by multiplying the unit cost by the quantity. </p><p>  8. In total. </p><p>  9. Remuneration. </p><p>  10. Operation of machines / including pay (drivers). </p><p>  11. Materials. </p><p>  Labor costs of workers (block 3), not related to servicing machines, people  hour. </p><p>  12. Per unit. </p><p>  13. In total. </p><p>  There is also a breakdown of estimates into sections.  There are no strict rules.  Logically broken.  The section always summarizes. </p><h2>  What do the numbers in the estimate table mean? </h2><p>  The method of compiling the estimates is the base-index.  Prices in it are indicated at the price level of 2001 and are called basic.  To translate prices into current levels, the base price is multiplied by the index.  Direct prices cannot be immediately transferred to the level of current prices, since there is no index for them.  Indices are for cost elements.  The estimate is made in cost elements. </p><p>  There are four of them: </p><ul><li>  remuneration of workers - OZP; </li><li>  operation of machines - EM; </li><li>  salaries of drivers - ZPM; </li><li>  Cost of materials. </li></ul><p>  Where to look for direct costs in the table: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Direct costs" class="if uuid-2262409" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71691/2262409.jpg"></div><p>  Where in the table to look for cost elements: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Zptrat elements" class="if uuid-2262410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71691/2262410.jpg"></div><p>  As in the norm of FER 20-06-018-04, cost elements are prescribed.  Here you can see which materials are included in the price list and which remained unaccounted for. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.defsmeta.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="FER Values ‚Äã‚Äã20-06-018-04" class="if uuid-2262072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71691/2262072.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, in order to find out the real price of the work, it is necessary to multiply the prices of the cost elements of 2001 by indices and summarize.  If the ‚ÄúMaterials‚Äù column is filled in the quotation, this means that such a quantity of materials sits in the pricing unit.  This can be seen in the example of pricing for the installation of a split system (line No. 1).  There are materials not included in the price.  Then they are called unaccounted for and fit in a separate line (items 3 to 9 of this estimate). </p><h2>  Estimated ratios </h2><p>  In addition to indices, there are coefficients.  They are charged on the elements of unit rates.  Indicated in column 3. The coefficients may be different (for wooden structures, for earthworks, dismantling, for work in winter conditions ...).  All of them can be found in magazines, collections of quotations and in MDS 81-35.2001.  Odds are calculated on the elements of unit rates.  They can be lowering (for example, for dismantling), and increasing (for example, tightness). </p><h2>  Results of the estimate </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Results of the estimate" class="if uuid-2263423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71691/2263423.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of the estimate, all costs are summarized.  In this variant of filling in the estimate, first comes the line of costs in 2001 prices.  Then a line with current prices, where all the price indices are taken into account.  Then comes the column - "Labor." </p><p>  The following two lines: </p><ul><li>  JV (estimated profit). </li><li>  HP (overhead). </li></ul><p>  Odds to them are indicated in the rates.  More information on the calculation of the joint venture can be found in MDS 81-25.2001, and on the calculation of HP from MDS 81-33.2004. </p><p>  Next are the results of the estimate.  Summarizes "Total." </p><p>  After the section "Total" is divided into cost elements. </p><p>  Unexpected expenses are being charged. </p><p>  If there are sections in the estimate, then the results of the estimate are added up from the results of the sections. </p><p>  At the end, the signatures are put and decrypted: </p><p>  Compiled (engineer, full name). </p><p>  Checked (engineer full name). </p>
