His bloody policy led to the outbreak of World War II, the genocide of the Jews and the atrocities of the madmen.  However, the Reich Chancellor of Germany was not a monster from birth, his character and predatory nature formed over the years.  And to understand the causes of this metamorphosis, you need to find out what Hitler was like in his youth. </p>

    <h2>  Adolf's parents </h2><p>  Hitler's father was a certain Alois Schiklgruber - the son of the unmarried servant-cook Maria Anne.  His nationality is a mystery that generates many rumors and theories.  For example, the most radical one says that Adolf Hitler‚Äôs grandfather was a wealthy Jew who secretly slept with his servant.  But historians have no evidence to support this conjecture. </p><p>  As for Aloise, he had to live without a father for a long time.  When the boy was five years old, his mother remarried.  However, the stepfather did not have love either for her or for her son.  Five years later, Maria Anna passed away, after which her husband immediately put his adopted son out the door.  The benefit of the boy was adopted by his brother - Johann Nepomuk Hidler, who later gave him a good condition and Hitler's surname. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that Alois was still that womanizer.  Clara Peltzl - Hitler's mother, became his third wife.  Their union has long been considered vicious, as the young bride was a relative of Alois in the second knee of her adoptive father.  Ultimately, they had to request permission in Rome, after which they were still married. </p>

    <h2>  Adolf's childhood </h2><p>  The future dictator was born in 1889, on April 20.  Hitler Jr.'s birthday was a real holiday for his family.  The reason for this was the poor heredity of Clara, because of which she lost her three previous children.  Later, Adolf sees this as a sign from above.  It was as if the gods themselves favored his birth. </p><p>  In 1892, the head of the family received another promotion at work (Alois was a customs officer), so their family moved to live in the small German town of Passau.  Despite the fact that Adolf lived here for only three years, a love of the German language and people permanently settled in his heart. </p><p>  In the spring of 1895, their family moved again.  This time to a village called Hafeld.  Soon, Adolf went to school, where teachers rated him as a very gifted young man.  However, it‚Äôs more interesting for history that even at this age he was distinguished by his amazing oratory.  Hitler quickly subjugated his class to himself and was considered the main ringleader in it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Baby scars </h2><p>  If we talk about how Hitler was in his youth, then we can not lose sight of the fact that he had to endure a real nightmare in his childhood.  The reason for this was the bad temper of his father, who also drank quite often.  After another shot glass, he began to raise a family with his fists. </p><p>  Most of all, his elder brother (from a previous marriage) and Hitler's mother suffered from his beatings.  They got from their father almost every week.  But, after the eldest son ran away from home, all the anger of Aloise switched to Adolf.  Sometimes Klara even had to close the boy with her body in order to protect him from serious injuries. </p>

    <h2>  Hitler in his youth: dreams, ambitions and disappointments </h2><p>  Adolf Hitler graduated from the school in 1898.  He was the best graduate - the pride of his mother and the hope of his father.  The latter already clearly saw the future of his son, who will continue his work in the customs service.  Adolf himself did not share the plans of the head of the family.  Hitler in his youth with all his heart wanted only one thing - to become an artist. </p><p>  However, arguing with Aloise's fist was futile.  Therefore, the distressed young man was given to study at a real school in Linz.  A similar disposition killed Hitler's desire for knowledge, because of which he proved himself to be a very ordinary student.  The only thing that distinguished him from the crowd was his ability to speak passionately.  It was he who conquered his peers, who, like a flock of sparrows, constantly circled around him. </p><p>  In January 1903, Alois Hitler died.  The management of family affairs passed into the hands of his wife, which, of course, pleased Adolf.  Soon he graduated from a real school, after which he had the opportunity to enter an art institute.  Mother, unlike her father, quickly agreed to allocate money for this venture.  However, in the future, all attempts to enter the Vienna Art Gymnasium will fail for Adolf Hitler. </p><p>  In addition, in 1907, the mother of a young man dies.  For him, this event becomes a real blow that turned his whole world upside down.  After that, he goes into himself for a long time and only after three years finds the strength for further struggle. </p>

    <h2>  Crucial moment </h2><p>  In general, a brief <span>biography of Hitler</span> does not allow us to understand exactly when the young man turned into a real monster.  Only a close examination of his past sheds light on the circumstances of this event.  And according to existing data, this happens between 1911 and 1914. </p><p>  Living in a shelter and earning a living by drawing postcards, Adolf more and more envied the way local Jews live.  After all, it was in their hands that the lion's share of Viennese shops and factories was.  Therefore, it is not surprising that he soon begins to believe that this people is guilty of the poverty of the indigenous population of the country. </p><p>  Hitler's personal life also played an important role in further events.  According to one version, the future Nazi was in love with a Jewish girl who did not accept his feelings.  Such embarrassment further inflamed his hostility towards the Jews, which later turned into fiery hatred of the entire German nation. </p><p>  However, the last straw was his participation in the First World War.  In the heat of battle, he understood one thing - the world can only be changed with fire and sword.  Therefore, after its completion, a completely different stage of his life begins - the path of tyranny and dictatorship. </p>
