    <h2>  Guest house "Aquamarine" (Adler): reviews of residents about the service </h2><p>  The staff of this hotel praises the majority of tourists who have ever rested here.  Hotel guests are polite to their guests.  The administrator in this complex is a very friendly woman, Irina.  She can be approached with any problems associated with being in a hotel, and she will immediately try to solve them.  Irina combines the work of an administrator with the duties of a maid.  Although this hotel is not large in size, she alone cannot be in time everywhere, of course.  Most likely, this is why it is not always too clean in the hotel rooms and in its corridors. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  From the sea, guest house "Aquamarine" (Adler), reviews of which are also good and therefore, is located only about 300 meters.  Guests can reach the beach in just 5 minutes.  With children, walking slowly and through the shops, the journey takes about 15 minutes.  Almost all the beaches in Adler are covered with small pebbles.  Therefore, sunbathing here is actually very convenient.  Some tourists here don‚Äôt even put on shale when bathing. </p>

    <h2>  What you should know about </h2><p>  So, we found out what, in fact, is a guest house "Aquamarine" (prices, description, reviews).  Of course, information about this popular hotel can be found on the websites of many tour operators.  However, reading reviews about the complex and the services it provides, future vacationers should be more careful.  The fact is that it is not too far from this hotel - there is another Aquamarine hotel in Sochi.  She takes guests in a six-story building.  And, although this hotel operates in full board and belongs to the 3 * class, tourists have developed an opinion about it, unfortunately, not as good as about the Aquamarine Adler hotel. </p>
