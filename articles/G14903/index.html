    <p>  The history of the creation of this noble estate dates back to the 16th century.  In this picturesque place at that time there were boyar possessions of Vasily Golovin, who served as governor under Ivan the Terrible.  The owners of the place called Marfino's estate changed frequently: diplomat Vasily Shchelkalov (end of the 16th century), again Golovin (until 1650), duma clerk Semyon Zaborovsky (until 1698), educator of Peter I Prince Boris Golitsyn (died in 1714 g.), and then his son Sergei, who sold the estate to receive funds for paying the debt, Field Marshal Pyotr Saltykov (since 1729) One listing of the names of these people indicates how rich life was in these places, how much " remember ‚Äùthe material monuments that have survived to this day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The estate in Marfino once belonged to Tsar‚Äôs associate Petr Borisovich Golitsyn, and a French park was built on its territory, magnificent mansions were erected, and the construction of a stone church began. </p><p>  When the Saltykovs also carried out a project to create a magnificent garden and park ensemble.  At that time, constructions in the style of classicism were erected.  The highest flowering for Marfino is considered the end of the 18th century. </p><p>  From the beginning of the 19th, idle life began to subside.  The war of 1812 caused great damage to the estate - artistic values ‚Äã‚Äãwere taken out, a lot was devoted to fire.  In 1831, the buildings of the estate were reconstructed, and in the 19th century the chief Moscow architect M. D. Bykovsky drew up a project according to which the manor complex in Marfino ‚Äúturned‚Äù into a medieval castle. </p><p>  The architectural style remarkably conveyed the spirit of the era - the loss of the former harmony, romantic mood and the search for monumentality.  After the revolution, which took place in 1917, the estate passed into public ownership.  In Soviet times, restoration work was regularly carried out in Marfino. </p><h2>  Section 4.

    <p>  Under the Saltykovs, Marfino was an example of a noble estate of the Catherine‚Äôs era.  On the territory there were 2 summer theaters, horse-drawn carriages and equestrian yards; in the greenhouse, conditions were created under which southern plants developed perfectly and fruits ripened. </p><p>  At that time, the question: ‚ÄúMarfino Manor ... How to get to this wonderful place?‚Äù  few people worried.  Why?  The thing is that this place was so amazing and popular that not even dozens, but hundreds of guests came here almost every day. </p><p>  Vigel‚Äôs notes contain a description of the importance, laid-back courtesy and accuracy of the decency of the inhabitants of the estate, which were admirable.  True, unfortunately, after the death of Field Marshal <span>Saltykov, the estate</span> began to decline. </p><h2>  Section 5. The Times of the Panins </h2>

    <p>  The daughter of Count Orlov Panin Sofya Vladimirovna was engaged in the reconstruction of the house.  Many structures were erected in the park.  At the time when the work was supervised by F. Tugarov, the estate acquired the features of an empire style. </p><p>  And in the late 30s.  In the 19th century, it received the features of "Nikolaev Gothic" (architect M. D. Bykovsky).  The pseudo-Gothic manor house is a wonderful monument of Russian romanticism.  The pink color of the walls inside the house was a bright element that created the mood of the knightly era. </p><h2>  Section 6. Where to stay for travelers </h2>

A two-story brick building rises on a hill.  Near it is a large pond, the descent to which can be overcome by a white stone staircase.  A pier has been built at the pond, which is decorated with stone sculptures of griffins. </p><ul><li>  There are 2 churches in the estate: Peter and Paul (winter) and Nativity of the Virgin. </li><li>  Park arbors that previously served as the ‚ÄúMusic Pavilion‚Äù - a half-rotunda - and ‚ÄúMilovida‚Äù - a two-tier rotunda. </li></ul><ul><li>  The brick bridge, turrets, loopholes and jagged crests of the palace are associated with the fortress structure.  Initially, the bridge was built during the Saltykovs, and then reconstructed by Bykovsky. </li></ul><p>  By the way, one cannot fail to mention the fact that famous films were shot in Marfino, including the Noble Nest, the Crusader, The Master and Margarita. </p><h2>  <strong>Section 8.

    <p>  This church was built according to the project of V.I. Belozerov.  The construction is distinguished by harmony and noble proportions.  The basement of the church is lined with white stone blocks.  A high light drum, a dome and a small dome are the center of the composition of the church building.  A serf architect Belozerov, who carried out its construction, was buried near the church. </p><p>  <span>By the</span> way, <span>Boris Golitsyn</span> did not like the fact that inside the church the space was reduced by pylons.  He ordered to punish Belozerov with rods, which is why the architect died, because his heart could not stand it. </p><h2>  Section 9. These amazing gazebos ... </h2>

    <p>  Of great interest to tourists are arbors in Marfino.  One of them - the ‚ÄúMusic Pavilion‚Äù - is made in the form of a semicircle with a semi-dome vault and a white stone bench inside. </p><p>  Another arbor - "Milovida" - a rotunda having 2 tiers.  The lower tier is massive, and the second - grace (8-column pavilion with a dome).  From "Milovidy" wonderful picturesque views open. </p><h2>  Section 10. Bridge over the Pond </h2><p>  This building has an impressive size.  It consists of a central part (a gallery of 20 octagonal columns ending with turrets on both sides) and two lateral arched parts. </p><p>  Its crests, turrets and loopholes cause very vivid associations.  The construction looks like an element of the fortress.  The upper part of the turrets is decorated with a cornice, and on top of it there are battlements that are in harmony with the final elements of all the manor buildings.  White stone details and red walls of the bridge are a bright coloristic solution. </p><h2>  Section 11. Peter and Paul Church (winter) </h2><p>  This church is a magnificent building, characterized by a harmonious combination of masses.  Decorative excesses in its design were not used.  The central part is made in the form of a two-color rotunda with small protrusions for the narthex and the altar. </p><p>  <span>The dome of the church is</span> made in the form of an octahedron.  Bells are kept in its premises. </p><h2>  Section 12. The estate today </h2><p>  What is so special about her now?  Let's try to list only a few points: </p><ul><li>  The bells of the Church of Peter and Paul, and today, announce the neighborhood with their ringing. </li><li>  The estate since 1933 became the Martha central military clinical sanatorium. </li><li>  In the premises of the "kennel" today there is a "House of Life" and a casino. </li><li>  There are springs with mineral water containing a large number of useful elements. </li><li>  Filming was very interesting at the estate.  Local children happily participated in them as "extras".  On the set of "Masters and Margarita", to remove the witch in flight on a broomstick, a helicopter was deployed.  Known to everyone in our country, the film ‚ÄúThe Woman Who Sings‚Äù, a film about the history of poisoning, the shooting of the commercial ‚ÄúSnickers‚Äù and many other shooting events - a lot of interesting things really happened in Marfino and is happening these days. </li><li>  Hotels in Marfino are always ready to offer their services to tourists. </li><li>  Picturesque nature and an amazingly beautiful architectural ensemble - a photo shoot in Marfino will allow you to take many vivid pictures and preserve for a long time the memory of a Russian noble estate, carefully preserved today. </li></ul><h2>  13.
