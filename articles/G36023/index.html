  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beginning of World War II: Fascist Germany</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When the <span>First World War ended,</span> Germany was not in the most enviable position.  The Treaty of Versailles imposed a huge indemnity on her, and, in addition, she was forbidden to possess a large army.  The country was caught in an extremely deep economic and political crisis, and in this situation the population was expecting the appearance of a person who could restore former greatness to the state.  The leader of the National Socialist Party Adolf Hitler quickly seized the mood of the public.  He did not shun any means in achieving his goals, and the main of them was precisely the complete and unconditional seizure of power in the country.  And the first thing that needed to be done was to destroy the opposition, which Hitler did.  As a result, all who tried to resist were sent to concentration camps without any trial or investigation.  Thus, fascist Germany gradually but surely began to exist.  Mass persecution of foreigners, in particular Jews, began.  Own batch didn‚Äôt escape cleaning: this process is known in history as the ‚Äúnight of long knives‚Äù.  Thus, such party leaders as Strasser, Rem, von Kar and many others were physically eliminated.  They were charged with attempting a coup. </p><p>  In 1934, Hitler was given the <span>powers of the president,</span> as well as the title of leader of the Third Reich.  An SS appeared, the so-called guard units.  In 1935, the legislation of fascist Germany was replenished with the Nuremberg racial laws, which deprived people of Jewish origin of the citizenship of this country. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The Treaty of Versailles</span> was violated, armed forces and the latest weapons began to be created in the country: Hitler purposefully prepared for war.  The main European powers pretended not to notice this, because they hoped that fascist Germany would be strong enough to stop the ever-growing power of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  In the same 1935, England signed a naval pact with Germany, and in 1936, Hitler concluded an alliance with Mussolini, the fascist leader of Italy.  In March <span>1938,</span> Hitler intervened in the military and political affairs of Austria, which he soon occupied.  England and France were forced to agree to partition Czechoslovakia.  After that, fascist Germany "took over" its western part. </p><p>  A non-aggression pact was signed with the Soviet Union on August 23, 1939, but subject to the division of Poland, the attack on which occurred <span>on September 1, 1939</span> .  This was the <span>beginning of World War II.</span>  Then, for two years, Scandinavia, France, Yugoslavia and Greece were occupied.  Hitler‚Äôs goal was more than ‚Äúmodest‚Äù: to capture the whole of Europe, and then the whole world.  According to Hitler‚Äôs plan, many nations, including Jews and Russians, had to either be completely wiped off the face of the earth or become slaves to the Aryan nation.  However, after Europe was captured, the Soviet Union stood in the way of Hitler: he could not allow the establishment of a fascist dictatorship in Germany to spread throughout the world. </p><p>  The terrible consequences of World War II led to the fact that the vast majority of the countries that had previously fought among themselves rallied in order to prevent new military conflicts.  There was a need to create an effective collective security system.  So, in April 1945, <span>the United Nations (UN)</span> was established <span>.</span>  One of the political consequences of the war was the defeat of a group of aggressive fascist powers whose purpose was not only to redistribute the whole world, but also to eliminate other states, enslave and even completely destroy some peoples (genocide).  Fascist Germany, as one of the hotbeds of militarism, completely disappeared, but a new political international configuration appeared, which was based on two centers of gravity that intensified as a result of the war between the USSR and the USA ‚Äî the western and eastern opposing blocs.  Communism, which was originally the so-called political phenomenon, no longer had a local character: for almost half a century, it has become one of the determining factors in world development. </p>
