Little girls have been playing with dolls since time immemorial.  We can safely assume that the doll has as many centuries as human civilization. </p><p>  At first they were weaved from grass and hay.  With the advent of the everyday life of women, yarn and stern threads were made from these materials. </p><h2>  Protective ceremonial dolls </h2><p>  The doll was considered a talisman in Slavic and in many other cultures.  She was perceived as an assistant in everyday life and in life situations.  It was used for pagan and various religious rites.  Over time, dolls began to replace people in the rites of sacrifice. </p><p>  Charm and ceremonial dolls were and remain faceless.  That is, they are by no means drawn a face.  According to legend, the doll-amulet is associated with its mistress and personifies her.  Therefore, when a girl or woman wove a doll of thread with her own hands, internally she tuned in to communication with such a talisman.  From time to time, girls took him out to talk, talk about their problems, share their dreams and desires.  It was believed: that the doll began to "work", it is necessary after a conversation to give her a gift.  In their role could be: beads from dried berries, beautiful ribbons, lace.  For the most part, what will delight the chrysalis and decorate its appearance. </p><p>  Any girl who lived some couple of centuries ago made a doll of thread with her own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yarn for dolls" class="if uuid-2319013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2319013.jpg"></div><h2>  Well-forgotten old returns </h2><p>  Now humanity, "having played enough in independence", is increasingly returning to the traditions of its ancestors.  I recall the ancient holidays, canons.  Everything antique and natural has become fashionable.  And to some extent this is good.  A man must remember his roots, pass on the traditions of his ancestors to children, and preserve the ancient culture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  DIY handmade amulets made of thread increasingly began to appear in secret drawers.  And the girl, having made this strong amulet, tells the doll about her dreams, gives her gifts, just as her great-grandmother once did it.  And strangely enough, such a doll helps, like many centuries ago.  Perhaps this is magic or the power of thought, about which so much is being said.  But one thing is clear - a thread doll is always ready to support and come to the rescue. </p><h2>  We propose to create dolls from threads with your own hands: a master class </h2><p>  Let us make our personal amulet!  For the greater likelihood of translating our dreams into reality, and simply in order to create an interesting craft by themselves. </p><p>  For the doll you will need: </p><ul><li>  The cardboard is tight. </li><li>  Threads (floss, iris or threads for knitting). </li><li>  Big sharp scissors. </li></ul><h2>  DIY thread doll: step by step instructions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="winding yarn" class="if uuid-2318994" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2318994.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Wind the thread on a piece of cardboard.  To better fix the beginning of the thread, tie it “into a ring”.  We wind on the base the amount of yarn that will make our doll not thin, but not thick.  This usually depends on the thickness of the threads.  If they are thin, make more skeins, about a hundred.  If your threads are thick, fifty skeins will be enough.  The height of the cardboard block should be what the doll’s growth is supposed to be. </li><li>  At the final turn, fasten the thread by wrapping it around the previous turn.  This will help not to crumble the entire structure at the very beginning of the matter.  Check the DIY doll made of threads and step-by-step photo instructions. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beginning to create dolls" class="if uuid-2318991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2318991.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Cut a piece of thread about ten or fifteen centimeters, thread it between yarn and cardboard.  Tie this separate thread to a knot, make it tighter.  In the process of tightening, all the threads will come together and form the “crown” of the doll’s head.  Tie this thread.  You can leave it in the form of a bow, or you can hide it. </li><li>  Now pull the ring from the wound threads from the cardboard, intercept and tighten one near the doll's head, where the neck will be. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a doll's head" class="if uuid-2318996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2318996.jpg"></div><ul><li>  In order to make the doll's hands, pull out the same number of loops on the sides.  Eight or ten loops will be enough. </li><li>  Pull the remaining threads around the doll's waist with a thread of the same color. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bambinis.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="create doll hands" class="if uuid-2319001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2319001.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Cut two more strings from a skein of yarn.  Bandage the doll’s hands with them, where the person’s wrists are.  The loops at the ends of the puppet hands can now be cut with scissors, giving the desired look.  There is another option for making hands - to make them pigtails.  Braid the braids and, fixing their edges with a thread, cut off the excess ends. </li><li>  Now, cutting the loops at the bottom of the doll's body, we made the doll a skirt.  Cut the uneven ends of the thread with scissors, then the hem of the skirt will look neater.  If you are supposed to have made a male doll, then disassemble the threads, starting from the waist, into two parts, rewind the resulting “legs” from the bottom, just like the hands did.  Legs can also be made by applying another option - braiding them in braids. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="almost finished doll" class="if uuid-2319004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2319004.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know how to make a doll of thread with your own hands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Doll hairstyle </h2><p>  The doll made of threads is very "cozy".  She wants to hug, hold in her hands.  Children can take such a toy with them to bed for the night.  It is very important that the hairstyle of the doll is beautiful and durable.  Now we will learn how to do her hair. </p><p>  In order to make hair out of thread for a doll with your own hands, you need: </p><ul><li>  Threads for hair - that color, what a doll hairstyle will be. </li><li>  Scissors, cardboard - corresponding to the double expected length of curls and braids. </li></ul><h2>  Start making hair out of thread </h2><ol><li>  We wind the yarn on a long cardboard template. </li><li>  On both sides we cut the winding, it should turn out to be just long pieces of thread. </li><li>  Put a strip of paper under the hair.  Then we sew in the middle of the strands, across.  Doing it better with a sewing machine.  For reliability, stepping back five millimeters, we sew again.  Carefully remove the remaining (un sewn) sheets of paper. </li><li>  Apply transparent glue to the seams. </li><li>  We apply the hairstyle blank to the doll's head.  Press for better bonding. </li></ol><p>  If the doll is with two braids, then we trim the resulting hair with scissors below and weave two braids to our beauty. </p><p>  If you want a different hairstyle for your doll, we continue our master class.  To decorate any figure with beautiful curls, crochet a mesh cap around the circumference of her head. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creativeboom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="doll hair" class="if uuid-2319020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2319020.jpg"></div><h2>  Step by Step Actions </h2><p>  It is important to knit a hat from yarn, which will be the hair of your doll: </p><ol><li>  Armed with a crochet hook, thread an elastic band around the edge of the hat that will hold it on the doll’s head and prevent the hairdo from shamefully flying off.  Fasten the ends of the elastic band in any way convenient for you. </li><li>  Although, if you are not going to change the image of your doll from a brunette to a red one and vice versa, such a hat can be glued or (if the doll made by yourself is made of threads and yarn) to be connected to the head with a knitting hook. </li><li>  Multiply our estimated hairstyle length by two.  Next, cut the threads of this size.  To make your hair more natural and beautiful, dissolve each thread into long fibers.  This is a very painstaking and lengthy procedure, so if you do not want to mess around with your hair for a long time, you can put whole threads of yarn in a hat. </li><li>  We take our loose curl from the thread in the middle of the segment, fix it with a loop on the edge of the mesh cap. </li><li>  The first row of the cap will cover the entire radius, fixing the thread in each loop. </li><li>  The following rows of strands can be fixed once.  Moving to the top of the head, again make the rows denser.  Then the doll’s hair will be more magnificent and without bald spots. </li></ol><p>  The method of attaching hair to a hat is suitable not only for a handmade doll made of threads.  With this hairstyle, you can ennoble and decorate your beloved old toy, in which all the curls have come out over time.  Also, this method is used for hairstyles of dolls from papier-mâché. </p><h2>  Perky hair from grass yarn </h2><p>  For ignorant craftswomen, first you need to explain what is this "weed"?  This is a type of yarn with a fringe sticking out in different directions.  From such an interesting material, you can make perky hairy little doll.  You can, as in the version with a hat, screw strands from the "grass" into the loop.  But there is a way even faster and easier.  Tie this hat from the "grass", in the process of turning the thread with the fringed side up, and put the resulting hairstyle on the head of a sweetie. </p>
