  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Balance method</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The balance method in <span>economic analysis</span> is considered the most common and traditional.  It is implemented through a special system.  When planning using the specified method, a special table is drawn up - the balance sheet.  It correlates the availability of resources and sources of their income with the volumes and directions of their application.  The economic role of balance sheets is very diverse.  They are endowed with various functions, are developed to solve many problems, and are used in various sectors of economic activity.  They are also used in statistics, forecasting, accounting and other fields. </p><p>  The balance method of planning and forecasting allows you to connect needs and resources within the framework of <span>social production</span> as a whole.  At the same time, coordination is ensured between the development of related industries and industries, the proportionality and interaction of all components of the national economy.  The balance method allows you to detect unused reserves, identify imbalances.  In addition, with its help it is possible to outline and justify new proportions.  The balances used in forecasting and planning are divided into three groups: cost, material and labor. </p><p>  Material ratios characterize the use and production of certain types of materials, raw materials (metal, fuel, energy, etc.), equipment, <span>production facilities,</span> fixed assets, and so on.  Their development is carried out in physical units, cost and conditionally-natural expression.  Material balances include two parts.  The first - resource - reflects indicators by which the characteristics of resources are carried out in accordance with all sources of income.  The second part - distribution - reflects the direction of application.  Both parts must be equal. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The balance method characterizing the availability, use and distribution of fuel is being developed both in terms of equivalent fuel and in kind.  The resource part reflects the types and groups of raw materials.  The distribution part of the <span>fuel and energy balance</span> reflects the consumption of energy and fuel in accordance with the <span>target areas of</span> their application.  Thus, the overall dimensions and structure of consumption and <span>production of</span> energy in the country as a whole are determined, and directions for their application are identified. </p><p>  The cost balance method is used to reflect the formation of income, taking into account all sources of their income and distribution in accordance with the directions of application.  At the same time, the movement of financial resources, proportions, economic relations, as well as the process of using and generating state revenues, enterprises and the population through value terms are shown.  Central to this system is the balance of payments.  It characterizes the foreign economic operations of the state for a specific period.  To compile it, a special scheme was developed, which is standardized for all countries. </p><p>  The balance method, reflecting the reproduction of labor, is used to identify the availability of labor resources and the need for them in accordance with industries, patterns of ownership, areas of national economy.  Thus, it becomes possible to study the composition of the labor force taking into account social groups, as well as the identification of labor reserves.  The central place in the structure is given to the consolidated balance of labor resources.  It includes two parts. </p><p>  The first part reflects the number and availability of labor resources, the second - the directions of their application in accordance with the spheres and sectors of the national economy, types of employment, social groups and forms of ownership. </p>
