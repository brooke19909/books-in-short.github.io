Description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every woman loves smart things, especially those made by her own hands.  Experienced knitters decorate their products with various complex ornaments, braids, plaits and lace.  In this article, we will explain in detail to those needlewomen who are just starting to knit how to create a simple and at the same time original owl pattern with knitting needles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thecraftchair.com" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Owl knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2231877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2231877.jpg"></div><h2>  The original element on the canvas </h2><p>  Such a bird, like a scoop, symbolizes patience and wisdom.  This knitting pattern will decorate any knitted product.  Owl with large eyes - buttons, you can originally decorate children's hats.  Also, such a pattern is often found on women's pullovers or mittens.  On men's knitwear, this element will look no less attractive and original.  Knitted owl pattern is formed on the wrong side with the help of facial loops.  This knitting method gives the pattern a bulge and shape, thanks to this the pattern looks spectacular and mysterious. </p><h2>  Owl Tying Description </h2><p>  The drawing is created on the canvas, connected with the wrong side of the surface.  You can also create a separate ‚Äúowl‚Äù pattern with knitting needles on the product, formed in any way, selecting it from all sides with a frame of several purl stitches.  The size of the pattern depends on the number of the selected knitting needles and on the density of the pattern you have connected.  The main pattern takes 8 loops in width and 22 rows in the top, the number of purl loops forming a frame around the pattern is determined independently.  Knit a few rows with the wrong side of the stitch, then start tying the owl. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 1st row of the figure, type 4 wrong loops, 8 front loops and again 4 wrong loops. </p><p>  2 row need to be knitted with the same loops as you see in the previous row. </p><p>  3 and 4 rows repeat similarly to the first two. </p><p>  In line 5, repeat 4 loops in the wrong way (they will be repeated in each row), then you need to <span>cross the</span> next 4 <span>front loops.</span>  To do this, remove and swap the first two with the next two front loops by moving them at work.  Cross the next 4 loops using the same method, moving the first two in front of the canvas.  End the row with 4 purl loops forming a frame. </p><p>  Knit the next 9 rows in the same way as the first two lines. </p><p>  In lines 15 and 21, swap the front loops, as in line 5.  Between them repeat 5 rows respectively 1 strip.  Finish the pattern with the same row of loops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bespangledjewelry.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting" class="if uuid-2231800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2231800.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of owl knitting </h2><p>  The pattern has a symmetrical structure, so it is necessary to observe the proportion.  Both sides of the picture should mirror each other. </p><p>  All even lines are knitted according to the loops of the previous row.  That is, what loops you see, such and knit. </p><p>  For the convenience of crossing, you can use the auxiliary tool or an additional spoke. </p><p>  The first half-braids of the knitted owl pattern form the legs, the next divide the abdomen and the head of the bird, and the last movement of the loops creates eyebrows. </p><p>  For naturalness, create bird eyes from buttons or beads.  You can form small colored circles representing the pupils.  And the owl you connected will make a pleasant impression on others. </p><h2>  Openwork drawing </h2><p>  Knitting with the needles of the pattern in question may not have a bulge.

This decorative pattern will turn an ordinary blouse into an elegant product.  Nakida in this method of mating form the shape of an owl.  To avoid an increase in the fabric, it is necessary to proportionally reduce the loops according to the number of yarn.  The drawing is very interesting and artistic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.airdesignstudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Owl knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2231799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2231799.jpg"></div><p>  With this article, you learned how to knit an owl pattern.
