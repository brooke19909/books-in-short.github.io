    <h2>  Alexander Mikhailovich Butlerov: biography </h2><p>  Alexander Butlerov was born in the first half of the 19th century in the city of Chistopol.  Thanks to the fact that he appeared in the family of a wealthy landowner, the boy received a good education.  At first he studied in a private boarding school, then in a gymnasium, after which he entered the university.  From the very beginning of his studies at the university he was interested in zoology, chemistry and botany. </p><h2>  <span>Scientific activity of</span> Alexander Mikhailovich </h2><p>  Such great Russian chemists as Alexander Mikhailovich Butlerov made a huge contribution to science.  After graduation, the young man decides to devote himself to science and after a few years becomes a professor. </p><p>  However, in his youth, due to addiction to chemistry, Alexander Mikhailovich suffered punishment.  He was fond of making <span>sparklers</span> with his friends <span>,</span> and once even through his fault there was an explosion in the guesthouse.  This was the result of one of his experiments.  Alexander was punished.  For several days he stood in the dining room in full view, and on his neck hung a tablet with a prophetic inscription - "The Great Chemist." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Alexander Mikhailovich Butlerov, like other great Russian chemists, was passionate about the study of organics.  Among his greatest discoveries is the creation of the famous theory of chemical structure. </p><h2>  Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev: biography </h2><p>  Dmitry Mendeleev was born in Tobolsk.  From early childhood, his mother began to notice that her youngest child (seventeenth in a row), Dmitry, was an incredibly gifted teenager.  However, at school he was not interested in chemistry at all - he was only interested in mathematics and physics. </p><p>  In 1855, Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev graduated from the St. Petersburg Main Pedagogical Institute, after which his many scientific works, reports and dissertations immediately followed. </p><h2>  Scientific activity of Dmitry Ivanovich </h2><p>  Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev is a great researcher in the fields of physics, mathematics, economics, meteorology, etc. But his contribution to chemistry is especially important.  In addition to the fact that the great scientist did a lot of research and experimentation, wrote a lot of dissertations and scientific works, studied gases, solutions, taught young people, wrote the first textbook in Russia - "Fundamentals of Chemistry", he also made a key discovery in this area.  It was a <span>periodic system of</span> all chemical elements, that is, the famous periodic table. </p>

    <p>  Many great Russian chemists were surprised by this discovery and amazed.  Mendeleev managed not only to add all <span>known chemical</span> elements to the table, but also to predict the existence of those that no one had ever seen.  Thanks to the periodic table, it has become much easier for schoolchildren and students to study chemistry, and for scientists themselves, it is easier to make discoveries and verify data. </p><p>  Mendeleev after his death left the generation of more than 1,500 scientific works.  In honor of Dmitry Ivanovich, the 101st chemical element, Mendelium, was named. </p><p>  Alexander Mikhailovich Butlerov and Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev are two very interesting people who have dedicated their lives to scientific work and made many important discoveries.  Like all the great Russian chemists, they are unique, and their work is studied in Russian and foreign universities. </p>
