    <p>  In order to survive, any person needs to eat something, dress something, have a place at least for an overnight stay.  For all this, of course, it is necessary to pay, which means to have some kind of income.  They can be the following: profits from doing business, selling property, winning the lottery.  However, the main source of income of citizens in Russia is still wages, the types of which may differ depending on the object of classification. </p><p>  <strong>Nominal and real salary</strong> </p><p>  For the purposes of economic theory <span>, wages are</span> divided into nominal and real.  Nominal - this is directly the <span>money</span> paid to the employee for his professional duties.  A real salary is the amount of goods and products that a person can acquire with the money paid. </p><p>  Nominal and real wages are related to each other, as well as to the price level.  For example, if the nominal wage increases by 15% and the price increases by eight percent, the real wage will increase by only 7%.  On the other hand, if, under the same conditions, prices rise by 20%, real wages will decrease by 5%, despite nominal growth. </p><p>  <strong>Salary and its types depending on the form of payments</strong> </p><p>  According to the form in which the payment of wages is carried out, its natural and monetary varieties are distinguished. </p><p>  In-kind wages are issued in the form of food, clothing, household appliances and other items.  Moreover, its share in the total amount of payments cannot exceed twenty percent.  Cash salary is issued, respectively, in the form of liquid funds: in cash or by transfer to a card. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be borne in mind that both monetary and in-kind types of wages are subject to personal income tax. </p><p>  <strong>Basic and additional salary</strong> </p><p>  For the enterprise, it is important to divide the payment for labor into primary and secondary.  The first type of payments includes accruals directly for the hours worked or the volume of production produced, as well as any surcharges for excess work.  In other words, these are payments that are directly related to the fulfillment by employees of their labor duties. </p><p>  An additional salary is accrued for a time that is not directly related to official functions, but paid according to the current legislation.  This may include payment to nursing mothers of breaks in work, grace hours for adolescents employed in performing public or state duties, vacation (including school), sick leave, etc. </p><p>  <strong>New types of wages</strong> </p><p>  The development of private business in Russia has led to the emergence of new types of wages: ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and ‚Äúblack‚Äù.  ‚ÄúBelaya‚Äù is that part of the earnings that the employer pays officially, with which social taxes are deducted, and personal income tax is withheld from workers.  Accordingly, ‚Äúblack‚Äù means money paid ‚Äúin an envelope,‚Äù or something that is paid to an employee informally, bypassing various taxes. </p><p>  The reasons for this division are understandable: in this way, the employer seeks to avoid unnecessary costs, and the employee seeks to raise his level of real wages.  The benefit, it would seem, is obvious for both those and others.  In fact, such an arrangement is often disadvantageous for the employee, since it leads to a loss in pension contributions, in addition, it will be more difficult for such an employee to obtain a loan or somehow confirm his solvency in other cases.  It should also be borne in mind that the division into white and black types of <span>wages</span> is illegal.  With a clearly underestimated level of salaries, the employer runs the risk of incurring tax and <span>labor inspection</span> checks and penalties. </p>
