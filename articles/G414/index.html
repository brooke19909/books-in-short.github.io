In order to create optimal conditions, in the old days they pulled out a cellar.  However, now most of the population lives in apartment buildings, where it is impossible to build such a structure.  For this reason, refrigerators were invented.  In such devices, a certain temperature is established at which products can retain freshness for a long time. </p><p>  One of the famous brands making such equipment is Snaige.  Refrigerators of modern assembly meet all the requirements.  In stores, they are represented by a wide range.  Models differ in design, size, equipment.  In the lineup there are options with one and two cameras, as well as different colors.  Thanks to this, it is not difficult to purchase the most suitable copy.  Exterior design, colors - aesthetic criteria.  Choosing only by them is not recommended, as a rule, they act as additions.  But what is really worth paying attention to is the technical characteristics of refrigerators.  It will depend on them how the device performs the basic functions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="snaige refrigerators" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1499410.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Briefly about the brand </h2><p>  Snaige is a company specializing in the manufacture of refrigeration equipment.  It was founded in Lithuania.  It began its activities in 1963.  It is worth noting that Snaige is the only company of this profile in the Baltic countries.  Refrigerators under this brand have been widely sold in many countries since 1983.  This company, unlike other manufacturers, did not expand the range of different groups of household appliances.  Design engineers annually offer new models that are equipped in accordance with European standards and norms.  All new devices are energy efficient.  And at present, this criterion can be called the most important, since refrigeration equipment is extremely rarely disconnected from the network. </p><p>  In Russia, this brand appeared only in 1992.  Due to the expansion of sales markets in 2000, the plant was modernized.  Three new lines of refrigerators appeared in which the manufacturer tried to take into account all the requirements of consumers as much as possible. </p><h2>  Instrument Features </h2><p>  Technical characteristics of refrigerators directly affect the size of the appliance and its configuration.  It is important to note that only high-quality materials and the latest technologies are used in production.  It is this approach that distinguishes TM Snaige products from the total mass. </p><p>  Let's look at the main functions and technologies. </p><ul><li>  Cooling system.  In refrigerators, the principle of natural air convection is used, which consists in the following: when it is cooled, it goes down, after heating it goes up.  Thanks to this circulation, zones with different temperature conditions are created in the chamber and the optimum humidity level is established. </li><li>  Fast Freeze.  The technology of quick freezing allows you to preserve the composition of the products.  Due to the effects of low temperatures, ice does not have time to form either externally or internally.  Frozen foods do not change color, but their taste remains excellent. </li><li>  Properties of <span>freezers.</span>  All two-chamber models are designed to work with low temperatures.  They can maintain a level of no higher than -18 ¬∞.  In such conditions, the products are stored for a long time (about one year). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much is the refrigerator" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1499389.jpg" width="379"></div></li></ul><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  What can surprise the Lithuanian brand Snaige?  Refrigerators are represented by models with freezers, which are located below or above.  In some they are absent.  It is also worth paying attention to the difference in dimensions.  In the lineup there are both freestanding and built-in options.  In each of them there are features that are indisputable advantages.  Let's look at the main ones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Energy saving.  The company provides consumers with class A, A <sup>+</sup> , A <sup>++</sup> devices. </li><li>  Excellent quality insulation and assembly. </li><li>  The compressor of a new generation. </li><li>  Environmentally friendly materials. </li><li>  The absence of porous elements on the inner walls. </li><li>  Adjustable shelves made of impact resistant glass. </li><li>  Transparent freezer boxes. </li><li>  A wide range of colors. </li><li>  Maintaining optimal temperature conditions. </li><li>  Automatic defrosting. </li><li>  No noise during operation. </li><li>  Accessories are made in many countries of Europe. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="characteristics of refrigerators" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1499357.jpg" width="298"></div></li></ul><h2>  Minor issues </h2><p>  For those who have purchased a Snaige refrigerator, the manual will be a good helper.  It contains information about the most common breakdowns and how to eliminate them. </p><ul><li>  The refrigerator does not work.  If the light does not light, it is necessary to check the functionality of the outlet and the integrity of the network cable. </li><li>  Loud noise.  The first reason is an unevenly installed device (adjustable by legs).  The second is whether it is in contact with furniture or the wall. </li><li>  Accumulation of water inside the refrigerator.  These consequences are caused by clogging of the drain groove. </li><li>  The sealing tape is removed.  Most often, this can happen when you open the door.  Rinse it well, wipe it and put it in place. </li><li>  Water under the refrigerator.  A special bath is installed above the compressor, in which melt liquid is collected.  Water can drain down only if it has jumped off its place. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="snaige refrigerator instruction" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1499347.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Snaige RF36SM-S10021 / 0831Z185-SNBX </h2><p>  How much does a Snaige refrigerator cost?
