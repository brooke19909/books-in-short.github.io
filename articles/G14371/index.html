How to use an ultrasonic repeller for mice and rats</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A lot of parasites always live near a person - these are small rodents, cockroaches, bugs and many other representatives of the fauna.  Among all this diversity, rats and mice do the most harm to humans.  Despite the fact that these are two different species that never naturally interbreed and compete for territory (rats always displace mice), they cause the same damage to both human health and his property.  Both those and others are carriers of a dozen diseases, eat the same foods.  Mice and rats do not so much eat part of the supplies or things that are completely inedible from the point of view of a person, as they spoil them.  In general, we can say that these are unpleasant neighbors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mouse and rat repellers reviews" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11340/374850.jpg" width="315"></div>

    <h2>  Basic rodent control methods </h2><p>  Rats and mice can and should be fought.  But this is a very difficult matter.  They easily adapt to changing conditions, quickly learn to avoid danger.  It is especially difficult to deal with rodents when their colony has already reached large sizes, and in the room where they settled, there are many attractive and affordable products (granaries, barns, grocery stores, etc.). </p><p>  Many people use mouse cats to fight small rodents.  This is a good way, but it doesn‚Äôt always work - sometimes the population of rodents is too large for one predator, and besides, there are such large specimens that they themselves can hunt for a poor cat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another way is to poison mice and rats with pesticides.  Not humanely, but effective.  The minus of the method is that you should not carry out such a procedure yourself - it is better to invite a specialist.  In addition, there is a risk of poisoning pets. </p><p>  Mechanical tools are also effective.  Not 100%, but the result is very good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ultrasonic repeller for mice and rats" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11340/374848.jpg?1397539312943" width="432"></div>  The main drawback is the need for regular maintenance, that is, you need to constantly look for new moves, place traps in these places, and remove already caught individuals.

    <p>  The most modern way to get rid of rodents is with ultrasonic repellers of mice and rats.  Customer reviews about these devices are different: there are people who are completely satisfied with the purchase, but others are not too happy with the result.  Let's try to figure it out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electric rat and mouse repeller" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11340/374851.jpg?1397539353431" width="395"></div>

    <h2>  Ultrasonic repellers: principle of operation </h2><p>  From school times, everyone remembers <span>what ultrasound is.</span>  We remind you to those who forgot: ultrasound refers to high-frequency sound vibrations - above 20 kHz.  A person perceives sounds up to 20 kHz, so sometimes he can pick up these waves (when the frequency of the wave is close to the limit of susceptibility).  Scientists have proven that with age, when <span>the eardrum</span> thickens, people lose this ability. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The boundaries of susceptibility of rodents, moles, and even cockroaches are much wider.  They feel the ultrasound very well, and it makes them feel uneasy. </p><p>  The ultrasonic repeller of mice and rats works on this principle - it emits <span>sound waves</span> with a changing frequency, and rodents leave the room.  Such devices are often additionally equipped with bulbs with a variable mode of operation (blinking light also annoys rodents) and sound.  These functions (light and sound) are not intended for residential premises, since not only rats, but people will leave the house because of them. </p><h2>  Repeller models and their price </h2><p>  Here are a few models from different brands for comparison. </p><p>  1. Electronic repeller "Chiston-2 360" - exposure area - 300 square meters.  m., the radiation is directed in a circle.  The frequency range is 20-70 kHz.  Price - 1,500 rubles. </p><p>  2. Ultrasonic repeller of rats and mice "Grad A-500" with an adapter - exposure area up to 500 square meters.  m .;  circular radiation, operates at temperatures from -30 to + 85 ¬∞ C.  Price - 1780 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rat and mouse repeller hail" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11340/374849.jpg?1397539389381" width="269"></div>

    <p>  3. ‚ÄúLS-925‚Äù repeller - exposure area up to 185 sq.  m., circular radiation.  Price - 1400 rub. </p><p>  As we can see, prices from different manufacturers are approximately at the same level.  The cost of the device is affected to a greater extent by a set of characteristics: exposure area, power, availability of additional functions, battery life, temperature range. </p><p>  Now about the terminology.  The electronic repeller of mice and rats or ultrasound is the same device.  You can still hear the definitions of ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù, ‚Äúelectric‚Äù, ‚Äúmodern‚Äù.  The essence of this does not change, since all similar devices operate on a single basis.  They help not only in the fight against rats and mice, but also against moles, rabbits and other small pests.  The main thing is to use the repeller correctly, and for this you only need to read the instructions.  It says where it is best to place the device, on what area it is effective, how to choose an operating mode, etc. </p><h2>  Mouse and rat repellers: plus reviews </h2><p>  There are a lot of positive reviews from buyers.  And not even all of them are like veiled ads, which is good.  Many note that after turning on the device, the rats left almost immediately, for some - after some time.  However, there are buyers who claim that the device negatively affects pets.  This is logical, since cats, dogs, and other pets feel ultrasound well.  The only way out is not to place the device in places where pets live.  For example, you can install appliances in the basement and in the attic - the result is the same, but cats and dogs will not suffer. </p><h2>  Mouse and rat repellers: negative reviews </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic rat and mouse repeller" class="if" height="251" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11340/374853.jpg?1397539428849" width="493"></div></h2><p>  There are many negative reviews.  Buyers note that the device did not have the slightest effect on the behavior of mice (they walk directly on the device, and nothing), nor on the population.  Even additional functions do not help, but only annoy the people present.  So can repellers of mice and rats really help?  Consumer reviews suggest otherwise, so try to turn to the proven facts. </p><h2>  Facts </h2><p>  1. Ultrasound is also found in nature, for example, in the hum of a waterfall, the noise of the surf, the whistle of the wind, so talking about its complete rejection by animals is not worth it. </p><p>  2. There is no scientifically proven fact that the electric repeller of mice and rats causes panic in animals.  Anxiety and irritation - yes, however, it cannot be said that rodents run away in horror from ultrasound. </p><p>  3. The device‚Äôs effect is affected by its location - these devices work best in a perfectly empty room.  Any object scatters and partially reflects ultrasound, <span>sound pressure</span> drops, and, therefore, the efficiency of the device decreases. </p><p>  Given all the factors, we can conclude that the device is worth buying if you can arrange it correctly.  If even with a proper installation it did not show at least any results, then most likely the device is not working, or you are faced with a cheap fake. </p>
