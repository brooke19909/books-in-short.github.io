And yet, this beautiful country is the crystal dream of the most charming and handsome adventurer of all Russia Ostap Ibragimovich Ibn Maria Bender.  I propose to make a virtual trip to Brazil and fully enjoy the company of smiling mulattos in snow-white trousers and flexible beauties in carnival dresses, strong aromatic coffee and the unsurpassed nature of this largest <span>state of South America.</span> </p><p>  And to please Comrade Bender, the first item on our excursion program will be Rio de Janeiro.  This truly ‚Äúamazing city‚Äù is a kind of Brazilian <span>gold medal</span> .  But, as it usually happens, one side of the award is joyful, festive and brilliant, and the other is depressingly dull and depressing.  Let's imagine that we were in Rio on Friday before Ash Wednesday - this date is the official reference point of the famous <span>Brazilian carnival.</span>  Unimaginable seductive outfits and hats strewn with rhinestones, beads and feathers, rhythmic sounds of many drums and maraca, which together with sweet-voiced trumpets take participants and spectators to the wonderful world of samba, and therefore to the world of flirting, fun and delights, and thousands of dancing girls and young men - the famous carnival looks something like this.  All this splendor is seasoned with laughter, smiles, strong drinks, fireworks and wild Brazilian temperament.  Such a grandiose procession will not leave you indifferent and will preserve a lot of positive and pleasant memories.  In addition to amazing nightlife, music and dancing, Rio de Janeiro can please tourists with a lot of interesting sights.  Holidays in Brazil are considered inferior without a mandatory visit to the monasteries of San Bento and San Antonio, the former imperial residence of Quinta da Boa Vista and of course, a giant statue of Christ the Redeemer.  Last minute trips to Brazil, fortunate enough, found ourselves in our hands will allow us, among other things, to enjoy stunning views from the Sugar Loaf rock and to appreciate the original national dishes, as if prepared by the cute Donna Flor, descended from the pages of the book of Georges Amado. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What about the dark side of Rio?  Everything is very simple here: amazing parks, expensive hotels, chic beaches and grandiose architecture are suddenly replaced by glaring poverty.  In this rich and joyful city, there is a real exclusion zone called favelas.  Poor slums, hungry ragged children, drugs, illnesses, the highest crime rate, the complete absence of schools, hospitals, correctional facilities, and at the same time, the absolute indifference on the part of the authorities - this is the price of the magnificence of Rio de Janeiro.  And meanwhile, it is the inhabitants of the favelas who are the bearers of a true original culture, and, if you like, the spirit of the people. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the same situation is observed in other large cities of the state.  Therefore, a vacation in Brazil is either for those who know how to turn a blind eye to injustice, or for those who are inclined to sincere sympathy.  So, even the ‚Äúbluest‚Äù dream that arose in the big and warm heart of Ostap Bender‚Äôs romance may not stand the test of harsh reality. </p><p>  But back to our journey.  If you imagine that planet Earth is a huge living organism, then rest in Brazil is a unique opportunity to find yourself in the lungs of this giant.  More than half of the blue planet‚Äôs oxygen is produced in Amazon, a unique area of ‚Äã‚Äãmysterious rainforests and the longest rivers.  And to feel like a tiny, and, nevertheless, a very important cell of the vast world, you can visit <span>Iguazu Falls.</span>  Truly "big water", overthrowing from a height of more than 70 meters with a deafening noise and roar, will make you feel the full power of nature.  In addition, it is here that you can realize the cherished childhood dream - to walk along the rainbow. </p><p>  To visit this beautiful country is quite an expensive pleasure.  Therefore, last-minute tours to Brazil are the best option for travelers who do not have an extensive budget. </p><p>  So, the lovely, versatile and contrasting Brazil has already opened its hot and alluring hugs for you, curious traveler! </p>
