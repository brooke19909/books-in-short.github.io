Secondly, to stay on the Sinai Peninsula for fourteen days, a visa is not required.  And that means you can save fifteen dollars per person.  Thirdly, the famous reefs of the Red Sea in such a world famous reserve as Ras Mohammed cannot be compared with anything.  And finally, fourthly, this is an opportunity to go on a one-day excursion to Israel. </p><p>  Well, if you are bored with Sharm el-Sheikh or just want peace and unity with nature, welcome to the new resorts, "grown" satellites along the coast.  One such holiday destination is Dahab.  In this article we will talk about the wonderful hotel Le Meridien Dahab Resort 5 *.  It is located on the first line of the beach.

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  More precise location <span>of the Le Meridien Dahab Resort</span> 5 * <span>hotel</span> : <span>Egypt, Dahab,</span> Kenny Valley.  This valley lies between Sharm itself and another resort region called Dahab.  This is a place where the mountains come to the sea so close that an indescribable beauty landscape is created.  This resort is brand new.  It is suitable for those tourists who consciously go on a relaxing beach holiday.  All infrastructure is located only at hotels.  And there are few of them in Kenny Valley. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sharma Airport is about eighty-two kilometers, and to the most important Egyptian resort in the Sinai - one hundred.  The Le Meridian Dahab Resort 5 * Hotel itself was opened in early 2008.  It is a scattering of single-story buildings built in the Saracen style.  The reviews claim that the white houses with a flat roof are turned by terraces to the sea, so there is no point in paying extra for the "sea view".  The hotel has several pools and an artificial lagoon.  A wide staircase descends to a private beach.  The hotel area is surrounded by green palm trees, and numerous pools refresh the air. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Of course, like most hotels in a resort country such as Egypt, Le Meridien Dahab Resort 5 * offers tourists an all-inclusive program.  Three restaurants serve European and <span>Arabian dishes.</span>  In the Sea Breeze, the main meals are served in buffet style.  Two other restaurants - Italian and Asian - operate on a la carte system.  To visit them, you just need to book a table at the reception. </p><p>  There are on-site hotels and cafes.  For example, you can enjoy kebab and other Arabian dishes in the fresh air in Shish Terraces.  Cafe Omar offers a variety of drinks and light snacks.  You can quench your thirst on the beach and by the pool.  The Horizont Brasserie serves cocktails, including alcoholic ones.  Reviews say that dining at Le Meridien Dahab Resort is beyond praise.  The only thing to consider is that the food is all inclusive, and not ‚Äúsuper all inclusive‚Äù.  Therefore, if you want to eat between the three main meals, you have to pay for it. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Le Meridien Dahab Resort 5 * hotel is located in a bay.  It is famous for its corals.  The reefs here are treated very carefully.  Corals are not cleaned, and so that tourists can swim comfortably, build pontoons.  Fishing is also prohibited, so the inhabitants of the reefs are absolutely not afraid of people and swim very close.  Reviews repeatedly call for the purchase of special slippers for swimming, because, in addition to sharp corals, sea urchins pose a danger to the legs. </p><p>  Dahab translates as "golden", and this fully fits the description of the local beach.  However, to get to the yellow sand, you need to overcome the descent of the stairs, because the hotel is located on a low hill.  The beach is lined with original sunbeds, there are wicker baskets for sunbathing in a sitting position.  There are various water sports available by the sea.  Especially tourists recommend snorkeling and diving.  The local reef deserves attention. </p>

    <h2>  Pools </h2><p>  There are five of them in the Le Meridien Dahab Resort 5 hotel.  Moreover, four of them are filled with purified sea water, and only one is fresh.  As a result, there are no time limits on the use of pools.  In those with sea water, you can swim at night.  One of the pools is decorated like a beautiful lagoon.  There are several hot tubs.  They are spacious and free to visit.  Terraces for sunbathing by the pools are equipped with umbrellas and sunbeds with comfortable mattresses.  Beach towels are available for free. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  Young people from Western Europe love to come to Le Meridien Dahab Resort, as the natural conditions of Kenny Valley provide a lot of opportunities to do kitesurfing, diving, snorkeling and other outdoor activities.  There is animation at the hotel, but the guys and girls are very tactful: if you want to take a nap in a chaise lounge, no one will drag you to do aerobics or play volleyball. </p><p>  Tourists who have repeatedly visited this hotel have noticed that the administration takes into account the wishes of its guests.  So, a new service has recently appeared: if for some reason you are unable to climb the stairs to the beach, a special small electric car will take you there.  Last year, the hotel was decorated with a new sign: Le Meridien Dahab Resort SPA 5 *.  This means that now guests can absolutely enjoy the bath complex, which includes the Finnish sauna and Turkish hammam. </p>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  All tourists who visited the hotel Le Meridien Dahab Resort 5 *, recommend a trip to the oasis of Gabr il Bent.  The tour is very eventful: here you can dive with a mask, ride a camel, and ride a quad bike.  Coral reefs are especially beautiful in the Ras Abu Galum National Park.  And if you no longer sit still, it makes sense to follow the path of Moses: climb the mountain where God handed the tablets to the prophet.  But on this tour, warn the reviews, tourists are raising dark.  The journey to the White and Color Canyons will bring a lot of impressions.  After a march through the desert, tourists are brought to the Ain-Khudra oasis, where you can plunge into a freshwater lake.  And the tour ends with a reception in the Bedouin village of Ras al-Satan. </p><h2>  Le Meridien Dahab Resort 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists call Le Meridien Dahab Resort SPA the best five-star hotel in all of Egypt.  If there are negative reviews, this is due to the fact that tourists inattentively familiarize themselves with the profile of the hotel.  After all, she positions herself as a vacation spot for newlyweds, lovers of snorkeling and diving.  That is, people are young and healthy.  Therefore, the staircase leading to the beach for such an audience should not serve as an insurmountable barrier.  Although the restaurant has dietary dishes, a cot can be added to the room if desired.  But still in Le Meridien Dahab Resort 5 * reviews recommend not to go with the kids.  The hotel does not have a mini club and a shallow pool. </p>
