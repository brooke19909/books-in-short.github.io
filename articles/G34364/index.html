    <p>  Fold the square diagonally, then repeat the fold.  Now cut out the heart from this figure, but do not cut it to the bottom.  By expanding the square, you will see beautiful flower petals.  This craft on the theme of "Spring" requires the use of plastic tubes.  Make a hole in the center of the flowers and insert them into the tube, cutting the free ends of the plastic (they will depict stamens).  Cut leaves from green paper and attach to flowers.  Now make a clearing for them.  Cut one strip from the egg grid and paint with green paint (crafts on a spring theme often contain this shade).  Then insert the ends of the tubes into the grate - the clearing has blossomed! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to make herbalists? </h2><p>  Herbalists, or eco-humans, are sold in many stores, but children love to make <span>interesting crafts with their own hands.</span>  Take <span>nylon tights</span> and fill them with pre-purchased sawdust and grass seeds.  Tights should be packed tightly.  Now, with the help of threads, form parts of the body at the eco-man.  Highlight your hands, feet, nose, ears and so on, so crafts on the theme of "Spring" will become more expressive.  Glue the little man eyes and dress him in a bright suit.  When grass appears on the head of an eco-man, ‚Äúbraid‚Äù it with beautiful ribbons.  Eco-people are not just children's crafts!  Spring fantasies are useful for the child, they develop his imagination, <span>fine motor skills</span> and love of nature. </p><h2>  Bouquet of handprints </h2><p>  A bouquet of hands can be made with the child, and then give it to mom or grandmother.  For creativity, you only need paper, gouache and a brush.  This craft on the theme "Spring" can be made even by a very young child (with the help of an adult, of course).  The kid should dip his hand in the paint and press it against the paper.  An interesting bouquet is formed from colored hands.  With a brush, you need to finish stems and leaves with flowers.  Craft "Spring Bouquet" will really like mom or grandmother.  Also, the child can cut out the prints of his hands from colored paper and stick it on cardboard. </p>

    <h2>  Willow branches </h2><p>  Willow - a very beautiful spring tree!  Any kid will want to make a pussy willow branch for his mother.  Such an article on the theme "Spring" suggests the presence of corrugated paper (white, brown and green), thin wire, twigs and cotton wool.  From white paper, it is necessary to cut out small squares.  In the center of the square, you need to put a piece of cotton wool and roll paper with wire.  Attach the finished buds to the branches of the tree that you brought in advance.  Then wrap the twigs in brown and green corrugated paper.  Craft "Spring Bouquet" is ready! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  You just have to put the branches in a vase and decorate the room with them.  Older children can even crochet white kidneys. </p><h2>  Spring chicken </h2><p>  The wonderful season is spring!  Crafts from paper on this topic can be done endlessly.  No less interesting for children and creations from other material, invite them to make a spring chicken from an ordinary chicken egg.  To begin, prepare the egg - make a hole in it with a needle and pour out the contents, rinse the shell.  Now prepare a clearing for the chicken.  Cut a strip of green paper.  Stick flowers on it and fold it into a circle so that you can put an egg in it.  Glade is ready!  If you want this craft on the theme of "Spring" to be more stable, then carefully make an incision in the upper part of the shell and pour sand inside.  Seal the incision.  Glue a scallop cut out of red paper to the notch.  Attach the yellow paper wings to the sides of the egg.  Draw the chicken eyes and place in the clearing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts spring has come" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/809547.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Application "Dandelions" </h2><p>  Crafts "Spring has come" are very diverse in theme, materials and methods of execution.  Children love to deal with natural materials, so why don‚Äôt you give them such an opportunity?  Prepare white dandelions with down, cardboard, glue and a brush, as well as pencils, felt-tip pens or paints.  Draw on the cardboard stalks and leaves of flowers.  In the place where the flower is supposed to be located, glue you need to draw a circle.  Then put fluff from dandelions on the glue and press lightly.  The application is ready!  Children really like blowing fluff directly onto the glue and admiring the result. </p><h2>  Salty Dough Snowdrops </h2><p>  Crafts "Spring has come" can be very unusual.  Invite your child to create beautiful snowdrops from salt dough.  Prepare the salt dough and roll it into a thin layer.  Now take a plate of the size you need and use it to give the dough a round shape.  This is the basis of your craft, its background.  Then take plastic disposable spoons and cut off their handles.  Paint the spoons with blue gouache or acrylic.  Apply paint in several layers, so your snowdrops will be brighter.  Take the remaining salt dough, roll sausages out of it and give them the shape of leaves and stalks.  Gently place the finished parts on a plate of salt dough, greasing the joints at the water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts spring bouquet" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/809544.jpg" width="300"></div>  Now take the blue-colored spoons and press them gently next to the base of the stems.  The craft is not ready yet - it needs to be thoroughly dried.  You can do this in two ways: in the oven on the smallest fire and in the fresh air.  Be prepared for the fact that in the air the salty dough will dry for a long time.  When the dough is completely dry, paint the petals and stems of snowdrops with green gouache.  Cover all the crafts with a layer of varnish. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts on a spring theme" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/809545.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the spring, the nature around changes and blossoms, delighting all the kids.  At this time of year, pleasant for people, you can create many crafts from any materials at hand along with the children.  The subjects of crafts can be different: they can be devoted to the holidays (March 8, Great Victory Day, Easter), or they can simply reflect the joy of nature's awakening and the brightness of spring colors! </p>
