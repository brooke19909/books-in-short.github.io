The Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius in winter is a bewitching picture of blue and white.  But what is hidden behind this beauty? </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Most Orthodox are at least familiar with the name of Sergius of Radonezh.  This highly revered saint was repeatedly mentioned in the history of Russia of the XIV century.  Among other things, one of his merits, which are obvious even today, is the foundation in 1334 of the Trinity-Sergius Lavra, to which pilgrims and tourists flock from a huge number of cities and towns, even from other countries. </p><p>  Now it is difficult to imagine, but at first the monastery had a very difficult time - there was practically no means of subsistence.  But difficult times have passed, the courtyard of St. Sergius Lavra has grown, and it has become the largest center of culture and spiritual enlightenment.  Many active figures of the Russian Church came out of its walls.  In difficult times, the walls of the monastery protected its inhabitants from enemies. </p>

    <p>  Gradually, smaller ones began to form around this spiritual center.  With the assistance of local figures, new monasteries and churches were opened in different cities.  This also happened under Sergius, but even after his death the process continued.  In addition, already several centuries ago, while still in the status of a monastery, Lavra could already boast an extensive and rich library, which for the most part has survived to the present day.  Of course, many prominent figures of culture and arts of the time visited the monastery.  So to perceive the whole complex only as a spiritual center is a little wrong. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  In wartime </h2><p>  It is widely known that in turbulent periods of history, monasteries served as unique fortresses and defensive points.  Sergius Lavra was no exception.  She was regularly attacked by enemies: Poles and Lithuanians (in the 17th century), who tried to undermine her walls;  Germans, after which there was a need for global restoration, and even the Russians themselves, who in the Soviet period closed or even demolished many churches.  The temples of St. Sergius Lavra have stood in all the most difficult milestones of history, and this is another reason to admire the dedication of the local inhabitants, who have always defended the interests of the spiritual center of Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Main buildings </h2><p>  Of course, the first thing that catches your eyes when someone says: "Sergiev Posad Monastery" is the snow-white walls and blue domes with stars.  This is the Assumption Cathedral, and although it is neither the largest nor the oldest building of the ensemble, it invariably attracts a lot of attention.  Seeing him in the photo, it is simply impossible to believe that this church really exists - it is so beautiful. </p><p>  The central building is the Trinity Cathedral of St. Sergius Lavra.  This is the oldest surviving structure, built in 1422-1425.  It is an important architectural monument, and the painting of its internal walls is truly precious, because the work was performed by the world-famous Andrei Rublev.  In addition, it is here that the main shrine of the Lavra is stored - the relics of St. Sergius of Radonezh. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Assumption Cathedral appeared a hundred and fifty years later - in 1585.  It was built at the behest of Ivan the Terrible (who, incidentally, was baptized in a local monastery) and, perhaps, that is why the building is a bit like the <span>central Moscow churches of the Kremlin.</span>  Despite the fact that this religious building did not appear on the ensemble immediately, it fit perfectly into the surrounding landscape, becoming in fact a symbol of the complex, and even overshadowed the Trinity Cathedral of the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius in popularity. </p><p>  The royal chambers date from the 17th century.  Initially, these premises were intended to receive high-ranking guests, but after a short time they began to use the building as the educational building of the Theological Academy. </p><p>  Another construction that immediately attracts attention is the old bell tower, built in the XVIII century according to the canons of classical architecture.  It borders the cathedral square from the north, and its height is 88 meters, which is higher than similar buildings in the <span>Novodevichy Convent</span> and the Kremlin. </p>

    <p>  In total, more than 50 different and in their own way interesting buildings for various purposes are located on the territory of the ensemble: Mikheevskaya Church, Smolenskaya, which houses the iconostasis from the destroyed church, located in Pyatnitskaya Street in Moscow, etc. By the 19th century, active construction on the territory ceased, and gradually Lavra came to the form in which we see it now. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Current status </h2><p>  The entire Sergius Lavra (the entire complex of structures) today is a recognized architectural monument and since 1993 is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List at number 657. At the same time, several active monasteries are located on the territory of the ensemble, and development is still ongoing.  Perhaps the times when the monastery was in its prime have long passed, but it is also impossible to name the current state of affairs as sunset.  Spiritual life continues, now there are a large number of important institutions related to the Russian Orthodox Church.  For example, <span>Moscow Theological Academy</span> and Icon Painting School. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Besides the buildings, there is something else that attracts visitors here.  These are the <span>relics of St. Sergius of Radonezh,</span> located in the Trinity Cathedral.  In addition, there are several holy sources on the territory, the queue to which, it seems, never runs dry.  They drink from them, they collect water in the same place to take it with them, in some keys you can even plunge. </p><p>  Shrines such as the Tikhvin and <span>Chernihiv icons of the Mother of God, the</span> holy relics of Maxim the Greek and Anthony of Radonezh, the famous icon of St. Nicholas are also located here.  By the way, the famous Trinity Rubleva was written specifically for one of the temples of the Lavra, although now it is in the Tretyakov Gallery. </p><p>  The bells here are unique in their own way, some of them even have their own names.  In addition, the graves of Boris Godunov and his family are located on the territory of the Lavra.  In fact, for every pilgrim and tourist there are their favorite and in their own way delightful corners.  But at the same time, the visitor does not leave a sense of integrity of the entire ensemble - probably this is what makes Lavra unique. </p>

    <h2>  Worship services </h2><p>  Sergius Lavra is primarily a complex of existing Orthodox churches.  Therefore, it goes without saying that services and other events are regularly held on their territory. </p><p>  Divine services are held in the Trinity Cathedral every day: at 5:30 a night service begins, at 6:30 a middle liturgy.  On Sundays and holidays already at 5 in the morning you can come to the prayer service, starting from 8:30 they are repeated every two hours.  Of course, many events are held in other churches, so almost always in the complex you can get to the service. </p><h2>  Major Holidays </h2><p>  There are many significant dates in the Orthodox calendar.  Perhaps, each believer has their favorite holidays, which have a special meaning for him.  As for the Lavra, all its inhabitants also have a day that is one of the most important for them in the year.  This is September 25 / October 8 - The repose of St. Sergius of Radonezh.  Every year at this time, especially solemn services are held, to which the Patriarch and other high-ranking clergy come. </p><p>  Another holiday falls on July 5/18 - The acquisition of the relics of St. Sergius of Radonezh, one of the main shrines of the Lavra.  Various holiday events are also scheduled for this date, so these days there are especially many visitors. </p>

    <h2>  Location and route </h2><p>  The relative proximity to the Russian capital is another factor that determined the current situation in which Sergius Lavra is located.  There are several ways to get here, each of which has its pros and cons. </p><p>  The first option is a car.  Sergiev Posad is located in the direction of the Yaroslavl highway, about 70 kilometers from the capital, so the journey will take about an hour and a half.  The advantage of this method is mobility - not far from the Lavra there are several more interesting places that will be more convenient to get into using your own transport. </p><p>  The second option is a bus.  Routes regularly depart from VDNKh and Shchelkovskaya metro stations in the direction of Sergiev Posad.  You need to get out in the city, and navigating there is not difficult. </p><p>  The third option is the train.  It is also very easy to get to the Lavra from the Yaroslavl station; commuter trains depart in this direction approximately every half hour. </p><p>  The official address is as follows: 141300, Moscow Region, Sergiev Posad, Holy Trinity Sergius Lavra. </p>

    <h2>  Best time to visit </h2><p>  Sergiev Trinity Lavra looks great at any time of the year or day.  This is really a very beautiful complex of buildings, which is worth seeing at least once with your own eyes.  But if you want to not only watch, but also join the spiritual values, it is better to choose one of the church holidays.  In winter and summer, the Trinity Sergius Lavra is open to visitors daily from 5 am to 9 pm, and during special dates it receives pilgrims and tourists around the clock. </p><p>  But the ensemble looks especially good in winter.  The snow-covered Lavra looks simply unreal, as if descended from heaven.  According to tourists' reviews, winters are generally the best time to visit ancient Russian churches: at this time there is a special atmosphere.  Perhaps it is because of her that the Sergius Trinity Lavra receives the same guests again and again.  This true calm in the midst of noisy bustle makes you sit on a bench and just watch the visitors and passers-by going about their business.  And this occupation is also to some extent worth coming here. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Popularity among tourists could not go unnoticed, so over the past decades there have been a number of changes that allowed visitors to feel greater comfort.  People say that now on the territory of the complex benches are placed everywhere, you can have lunch in the refectory, there are church shops, souvenir shops.  Forgetful pilgrims can always get a scarf, a pectoral cross or something else.  Of course, there is a place where you can park your car.  Nevertheless, sometimes she is tempted to give up excessive comfort and just take a commuter train, contemplating Russian beauties sweeping outside the window. </p><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  Having visited the Trinity-Sergius Lavra, many go to Radonezh, where there is a very famous holy spring where you can swim.  And nearby there is another - Gremyachiy Klyuch.  And although the majority is sent to the Lavra purposefully, it probably makes sense to go around all the temples located nearby and perceive them as a single complex, because, in fact, it is.  Having traveled around Moscow, you can get to almost provincial, compared with the capital, but no less beautiful Yaroslavl.  Excellent examples of Russian architecture can also be seen in Suzdal and Veliky Novgorod.  In Russia, there really is something to see, the main thing is to start. </p>
