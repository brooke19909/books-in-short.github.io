    <ul><li>  <em>Dueling Aqua Coasters</em> are the longest roller coaster that exists.  Rises and descents at two hundred thirty meters in length in a tube for two people.  There are two of them in the water park.  Absolutely the same.  Designed for the competition of tourists with each other at speed. </li><li>  No less unique - <em>Python and Aquaconda</em> .  Here you can raft a company - a four-seater raft.  Ahead are expected six meters (in falls and take-offs) in huge tunnels in diameter.  These two attractions are unique.  Their analogues are not yet in the world. </li><li>  <em>The Mat Racer</em> is an attraction, also created for lovers of fast driving (or rather, alloy) and competition.  To go down the hill you have to lie on the mattress and swiftly fly down on it, being almost in free fall. </li><li>  <em>Boomerango</em> - a thrilling attraction will not leave you indifferent.  Overcoming and conquering a vertical wall is provided to every brave man! </li><li>  <em>Aqualoop</em> - starting acceleration gives tremendous speed at which it is difficult to imagine a <span>dead loop</span> of three hundred and sixty degrees! </li><li>  <em>Freefall</em> - a direct descent down in the spray of water in a free fall and a soft landing on the waterway. </li><li>  <em>Spiral</em> , as well as <em>Serpentine</em> - attractions that guarantee an exciting descent through the tunnels with a huge number of turns and accelerations. </li><li>  It is worth mentioning separately the entertainment of the <em>River (Lazy River)</em> .  The descent down the hill opens a relatively long trip on a tube along the perimeter of the entire water park, where fusing tourists are driven by an artificial current. </li></ul><p>  This is only a small part of the entertainment program, but it is already amazing! </p><h2>  Children's area </h2>

This place is located about twenty minutes from the resort of Pattaya.  If guests travel by car on their own, then they simply use the navigator or navigate on a previously captured map.  Taxi is also a fairly suitable option, solving the issue of movement.  And one more way.  The Ramayana water park in Pattaya also offers its solution: how to get there.  Visitors need to pre-order on the official website or call a transfer service at the right time.  And the problem is simply resolved.

    <h2>  Water Park "Ramayana" in Pattaya: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  It is no exaggeration to say that everyone who has visited the walls of the largest water park in this area is impressed by what he has seen and lived through, and therefore advises others to visit the Ramayana. </p><p>  Many tourists remembered the “Lazy River" - this is the largest attraction of five hundred meters.  Lying on a circle and moving with the help of artificial currents, you can get acquainted with the territory of the entire water park, taking a break from active entertainment (or lunch) and not hurrying anywhere. </p><p>  Among the local attractions, tourists left a lot of positive reviews about the jacuzzi bar.  This is a bar located in the pool along with a bar, tables and seats, which is already unique. </p><p>  Someone in the reviews recalls the green maze, impressive in its design.  By the way, it was created in the form of the emblem of the Ramayana.  Other visitors recall that before entering the park they were met by elephants.  Still others advise to drop by the floating market, where you can buy unusual souvenirs and taste the sweets of Thai cuisine. </p><p>  Separately, the services of masseurs and an underwater photographer are noted, which make the rest in the water park even more fabulous. </p>
