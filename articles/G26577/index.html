In our article we want about one of the hotels in Sunny Beach.  Nobel 4 * (Sunny Beach) is a beautiful complex on the Black Sea coast. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel </h2><p>  Nobel 4 * (Sunny Beach) is located in the southeastern part of the Bulgarian resort of Sunny Beach, near Nessebar.  It was built in 2005.  Since the complex is located away from the bustle of the city, it will be a great place for a relaxing holiday.  The hotel consists of one five-story building.  Getting to it is not difficult, since the distance to the airport in Burgas is only 25 kilometers.  And from Varna to the complex about 90 kilometers.  The hotel is located on the coast, and therefore is popular among lovers of sea holidays.

    <p>  At the barbecue restaurant you can enjoy delicious grilled food and drinks.  The pool bar and the lobby bar offer refreshments throughout the day, snacks and a cup of coffee. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  Nobel 4 * <span>(Bulgaria, Sunny Beach)</span> has a well-developed infrastructure.  On its territory there are restaurants (international and national cuisine), bars, an outdoor and indoor pool, a solarium-terrace, a hairdresser, a conference room, a small supermarket, currency exchange, safes, dry cleaning, parking, laundry, car rental. </p><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  Nobel 4 * (Bulgaria, Sunny Beach) offers its guests to visit the spa center, where you can visit the hammam, bathhouse, sauna, massage.

The entrance to the water is very gentle and convenient for children.  There is a bar on the beach for hotel guests, offering refreshments throughout the day. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, the Nobel 4 * hotel (Sunny Beach) is located near Nessebar and belongs to the famous resort Sunny Beach, which includes a seven-kilometer strip of the coast.  The resort is located away from highways, railways and big cities, which is probably why every year it gets the Blue Flag.  Sunny Beach is considered the largest resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe country.  In season, many guests of Bulgaria relax here.  The resort is a wonderful place for families with kids: a shallow bay with calm water, many children's pools, playgrounds, slides, swings.  In 2003, a huge water park with many attractions opened here.  However, Sunny Beach is interesting not only for children, but also for youth, for whom a large number of night clubs and discos work here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nobel 4 bulgaria sunny beach" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1505710.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The resort provides tremendous opportunities for the entertainment of tourists.  Here you can engage in a variety of water sports: water skiing, parasailing, windsurfing, yacht, banana. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Sunny Beach is called a children's resort, because a lot of kids really relax here.  And the reason for this is a wonderful mild climate, clean air, a good sandy coast, the absence of marine predators, a large number of parks, sites. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Resting in Nobel 4 * (Sunny Beach) (photos are given in the article), it is worth alternating your stay at sea with sightseeing.  The hotel is located near the town of Nessebar, which is rich in interesting places worth seeing. </p><p>  In the city is the church of Christ Pantocrator, which is considered one of the most beautiful in the whole country.  Its decoration is amazing.  Currently, the church houses an art gallery.  However, this is not the only such structure in Nessebar.  According to statistics, the resort has the largest number of temples per capita throughout Bulgaria.  Most of them are very well preserved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nobel 4 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1505711.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Among tourists, a visit to the ancient bathhouse and windmill is especially popular.  The city also has an ethnographic and archaeological museum.  In them you can see very ancient household items.  As for natural attractions, it is worth seeing unusual white cliffs and natural sand dunes.  Shopping enthusiasts can visit the numerous shops and shops throughout Nessebar. </p><h2>  Hotel Nobel 4 * (Sunny Beach, Bulgaria): reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, I want to refer to the reviews of vacationers who visited this hotel.  Overall, guests are satisfied with the food and service at the Nobel Hotel.  "Nobel" 4 * (Sunny Beach) is a good hotel for a budget holiday on the Bulgarian coast.  This complex, of course, can not be attributed to the chic, but it is fully consistent with its category.  If you want to spend time at the sea and relax on the beach away from the bustle of the city, then this hotel is perfect for you.  But the picky guests who expect from the complex impeccable cleaning and an incredible assortment of buffet dishes should look for the appropriate five-star hotel. </p><p>  The hotel has a good staff, welcoming all tourists.  The rooms of the complex are quite spacious and well equipped.  On the balcony there is a minimal set of plastic furniture.  Not all apartments have towel dryers and clothes, but this point can be very easily fixed with a normal rope.  Beds are issued new, without spots and traces.  The bathroom has detergents, but they are not enough.  Cleaning is done daily and fairly high quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nobel 4 sunny beach photo" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1505713.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A pleasant moment is the presence in the entire hotel of free Wi-Fi of average quality.  You will receive a password for it at the reception.  Sometimes this is not easy, because some employees either confuse the password, or simply do not want to give it out.  But in general, you can access the global network. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  How are meals at the Nobel 4 * hotel?  Reviews of tourists confirm a good level of organization.  Guests of the complex themselves choose the type of food when buying a tour.  For active guests, half board is most acceptable, but couples with children prefer the popular All Inclusive system, which allows you to completely spend time on vacation.  The main restaurant offers tourists a buffet with three meals a day.  Every day, a local chef prepares a variety of meat dishes, seafood, snacks and salads.  The assortment has a large selection of fruits, sweets, ice cream, national Bulgarian food.  Periodically, hotel staff organize theme nights with a gala dinner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nobel 4 sunny beach reviews" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1505714.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  All Inclusive allows you to receive all drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) in local bars absolutely free of charge, but when you buy half board drinks are paid separately.  The hotel's cafes and bars serve guests from morning until 12 noon. </p><h2>  Beach and Pool Reviews </h2><p>  The complex has its own beach, but in high season, according to vacationers, it is crowded with people.  If this is not so important for you, then it is quite possible to relax on it, especially since it is equipped with free sunbeds and awnings. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt like crowds and calm is extremely important for you, then you can use the services of the neighboring beach.  True, it will have to pay for the rental of umbrellas and sunbeds (20 lev for the whole day).  The hotel has a shop where you can purchase your own beach accessory so you don‚Äôt have to pay money for it daily. </p><p>  <span>The coast of Sunny Beach is</span> indescribably beautiful.  Endless sandy beaches with gently sloping sunsets and warm beaches are a great place to relax not only for the youngest guests of the country, but also for adult tourists.  There are no algae on the coast, and dangerous representatives of flora and fauna are not observed in the sea.  Staying in the water is completely safe. </p><p>  The hotel has a swimming pool with a relaxation area, however vacationers occupy sun loungers in the morning.  Sometimes there is not enough space for everyone.  Of course, this is not very convenient, but if you came exclusively to the sea, then an artificial pond crowded with people is unlikely to interest you.  Moreover, to the beach go no more than five minutes. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  In general, the hotel makes a pretty good impression.  Of course, this is not the most rave place, but there is animation and entertainment.  And those who want to get a lot of positive impressions should visit Nessebar and local attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel nobel 4 sunny beach bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1505716.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the morning, the animation team invites guests to attend a water aerobics lesson, shoot archery, play darts, go to the beach and play volleyball there.  And in the evenings, a mini-disco is arranged for the kids, after which the kids, pretty tired, but very happy, go to bed.  And the animators continue the evening shows for adults.  Some tourists think that the entertainment in the hotel is not enough, but this is a matter of taste.  If you want to take a walk, buy souvenirs and see the sights, then you should go to Nessebar.  From the hotel to the city can be reached in half an hour by leisurely step.  For those who don‚Äôt like walking, a funny open train runs to the city, which will take you to the center for 3 leva.  In addition, you can use the services of city buses (No. 5.2.1), the fare in which is 1.3 leva.  Nessebar is worthy of close attention from tourists.  There are attractions, cafes and restaurants, shops and shops. </p><p>  Each hotel has representatives of tour operators, vying to offer sightseeing trips.  Their cost is absolutely not cheap.  It makes sense to buy tours on the promenade and at the hotel, where they are much cheaper.  In general, Bulgaria has excellent transport links, so you can move around independently and watch all the places that interest you. </p><p>  A large number of Europeans are resting in the hotel, mainly Germans (pensioners and couples).  There are not so many Russians and youth at the hotel.  In season, a large number of children with parents appear in the complex. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  From the foregoing, some conclusions can be drawn regarding the Nobel 4 * hotel (Sunny Beach).  Reviews of the complex give reason to recommend it to tourists as a budget holiday destination with good food and beautiful beaches, since it fully corresponds to the ratio of price and quality. </p>
