  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History of Bulgaria. First kingdom</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The ancient history of Bulgaria is exceptionally rich.  In this small country, various ancient nationalities managed to visit.  Byzantines, Greeks, Thracians, Romans and other nations left their mark on this land. </p><p>  The history of Bulgaria began at the end of the 5th century AD.  The Bulgarian tribes included Utigurs, Kutrigurs, Ugori, Barsils, Balanjars, Savirs and others.  These nationalities led a nomadic lifestyle in the territory from the Lower Danube to the North Caucasus and the Caspian Sea.  Part of the Bulgarians (Kutrigurs and Onogurs) in the 630s formed an association.  The history of Bulgaria began with Great Bulgaria, which fell thirty years after its founding.  This happened as a result of the invasion of the Khazars. </p><p>  A part of the Bulgarian people, moving to the north, formed ‚ÄúVolga Bulgaria‚Äù (Bulgaria) on this territory.  Another part of the population (proto-Bulgarians) migrated to the west.  Having settled on the lands of the future Northeast Bulgaria, they moved to the southern territories.  There they settled in the Stara Planina region. </p><p>  Over time, the Proto-Bulgarians penetrated deeper into Thrace.  In the 7th century, the history of Bulgaria was marked by the founding of a state with its capital - the city of Pliska. </p><p>  Over the next three centuries, the state government was engaged in repelling the attacks of Byzantium.  <span>The Byzantine Empire</span> tried to destroy its new neighbor, but success in this matter has not been achieved. </p><p>  From the 8th to the 9th centuries, the history of Bulgaria was marked by the annexation of the South Balkan region to the Rhodope Mountains, territories stretching south of Stara Planina, the Morava and Timok river basins.  As well as the territory of the future North-West Bulgaria.  In addition, part of Western and all of Central Macedonia joined the state. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The unification of lands continued under Boris 1. At that time, cities such as Prilep and Ohril were annexed.  At the same time, Bulgarian power spread to certain territories of future Albanian lands.  The territorial transformations of Boris 1 were consolidated by his son - Simeon. </p><p>  As a result of the victories won by the leader of the new tribe of Turkic Bulgarians <span>Khan Asparuh, the</span> first kingdom of Bulgaria was formed.  The history of the existence of the state was marked by the adoption in 864 of the baptism of Boris 1. Thus, the kingdom entered the circle of Christian countries. </p><p>  The reign of Boris 1 took place during the period of the most important events for the state.  One of them is the invention of the Slavic alphabet by Cyril and Methodius in 863.  Since that time, Bulgaria has been considered the ‚Äúcradle‚Äù of Slavic culture and writing. </p><p>  The first Bulgarian state (kingdom) reached its climax in territorial and political power from 893 to 927 during the reign of Simeon the Great.  The ruler significantly expanded the land of the country.  This happened after his victory over the Byzantines in 917 in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Aheloy River.  Thus, Simeon expanded the borders to Greece (Galipoli peninsula), then captured Macedonia.  After that, the ruler took under the patronage and administration of his ally Serbia. </p><p>  Between 927 and 969, Bulgaria was in decline.  In power was <span>Peter 1.</span> Following the past wars, poverty came.  Robbery on the part of fairly large feudal lords, an excessive burden of taxes led to resistance and discontent among the masses.  The Bogomil movement began, which was created and led by the priest Lapping. </p><p>  In 968, the northeastern part of Bulgaria was occupied by the Kiev prince Svyatoslav.  However, after some time he went over to the side of Boris 2, who ascended the throne after Peter 1. </p><p>  The Byzantine army, displacing the Russians, occupied Bulgarian territory.  Boris 2 was captured.  The former ruler remained hostage to the Byzantines in Constantinople.  The Byzantine emperor cut many territories of the Bulgarian state. </p><p>  The western part of Bulgaria did not last longer than half a century.  The army of Basil 2 in 1014 defeated the troops of Tsar Samuel. </p>
