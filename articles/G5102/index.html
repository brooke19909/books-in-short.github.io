    <h2>  Innovations </h2><p>  Any organization or individual entrepreneur becomes a taxpayer from the moment of state registration and assignment of TIN.  From that moment on, they have an obligation to pay taxes and file declarations with the Federal Tax Service.  In the new procedure for processing payment orders, the following changes are registered: </p><ul><li>  The exact number of characters in the lines “60” (TIN) and “103” (CAT) is clearly spelled out.  TIN of individuals consists of 12 digits, and legal entities - of 10. CPR consists of 9 characters.  Both codes cannot begin with "00". </li><li>  The new requisite of the UIN may include 20 or 25 characters.  KBK - 20 digits, OKTMO - 8 or 11. Moreover, none of the listed codes can contain only “0”. </li><li>  A new mandatory payment attribute has appeared - “Basis of payment” (106).  State duties, fines, penalties and ordinary repayment of debts are listed under different codes. </li></ul><p>  A number of changes affected the rules for filling in the “Payment Type” field (110).  When paying taxes and fees, you do not need to fill out this requisite.  But in the BSC should reflect the code of the subspecies of income.  It will be used to identify the payment: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  2100 - transfer of interest; </li><li>  2200 - payment of interest. </li></ul><p>  Let's consider all these changes in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="payment order basis of payment 106" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/1605240.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Payment order </h2><p>  This is a settlement document with which the payer transfers funds from his account.  This document is used to pay for goods, services, taxes and fees.  It is executed on paper or in electronic form, using the Bankclient system.  The form of the document was approved by Regulation No. 383P “On the rules for the transfer of funds in domestic currency on the territory of the Russian Federation”.  The payment information is entered in encoded form.  This is necessary for quick accounting of payments and automated workflow between all participants in the legal relationship.  Let us consider in more detail in what order each column is filled. </p><h2>  Priority </h2><p>  Art.  <span>855 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation</span> provides for 5 priority payments.

    <p>  In the field "Payer" the legal entity indicates its abbreviated name.  If the payment is sent abroad, then the address of the location is additionally prescribed.  Individual entrepreneurs, individuals indicate their full names  (fully) and legal status.  In the case of international payment, the address of the place of residence is additionally indicated.  Payment can be made without opening an account.  In this case, the name of the bank and information about the payer are registered in the document: his full name, taxpayer identification number, TIN, address.  The payer's account must consist of 20 digits. </p><p>  The document spells out the name of the bank of the sender and the recipient, its address, BIC, correspondent account numbers, and the abbreviated name of the recipient.  If the transfer is made through an account opened with another financial institution, then the client’s account number is additionally indicated. </p><p>  In the field “Type of transaction” the payment code is entered, in the “Purpose of payment” - for what the payment is made.  If we are talking about budget payments, then the information from this field should supplement the “Basis of payment” (106).  Penalties and fines are paid with a unique code, and goods and services without it.  After filling in all the fields, the seal and signature of the bank's responsible person are put. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  These are standard details that must be present in any payment document.

Also, according to the new rules, OKTMO should be indicated instead of OKATO.  You can find out the code on the website of the territorial department of state statistics or through the service of the same name by the Federal Tax Service.  For information, you need to select a region, indicate OKATO or a municipality.  The results may be presented in abridged form.  If OKTMO ends with “000”, then the first 8 characters will appear as a result of processing.

    <h2>  Single bcc </h2><p>  Beginning in 2014, KBK 39210202010061000160 should be used in payments for the transfer of insurance premiums for compulsory insurance. Payments are made for this code to form the insurance part of the pension.  The FIU will independently distribute funds on a quarterly basis. </p><h2>  FIU and FSS </h2><p>  In payments in the Pension Fund in the field "101" the value "08" is indicated.  IE without workers in this field indicate the status of "24".  In the line "108" you need to write the number of SNILS (only numbers, without dashes).  In this case, you must specify the number assigned when registering the IP.  In the lines "106-110" should be entered "0". </p><h2>  Types </h2><p>  Under the new rules, “Type of payment” is not filled out.  Previously, codes were indicated in it depending on what kind of debt the payer paid: fine (), interest (), fine (), debt of customs authorities (), taxes (0). </p><h2>  Payer Status (101) </h2><p>  If the requisite “Basis of payment” (106), the decryption of which will be presented later, identifies the purpose of the funds, then according to the data in cell “101” it is determined who makes the transfer.  In total there are 26 statuses of payers.

If an entrepreneur pays personal income tax on employee income, he acts as an agent.  In this case, the status “02” must be indicated in the payment. </p><p>  The status that is indicated when transferring land tax or income tax depends on the BCC.  The details table is presented in the letter of the Ministry of Finance No. 10/800.  Before filling out the document, check the data with the table to avoid errors.  If the BCC is indicated incorrectly, there will be a tax arrears. </p><p>  Payments with different statuses are recorded on different personal accounts.  If this requisite is incorrect, in the internal accounting of the Federal Tax Service the amount will be credited to the debt account, which the IP may not have.  The tax to which the payment was directed will remain unpaid, even if the requisite “Basis of payment” is specified (106).  Fine and penalty will be charged on the amount of arrears.  Most often, such situations arise in organizations that are both payers and agents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="basis of tax payment 106" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/1605238.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The basis of payment "106": decryption </h2><p>  Penalty, interest and interest on debt can be repaid on time or late.  Based on the information provided in this field, you can understand by what document and for what period the funds are transferred to the budget.  The indicator “Grounds for payment” (106) is interconnected with three more lines: period (107), number (108) and date (109) of the document. </p><p>  Let's consider how to make out monthly, quarterly and annual payments: </p><ol><li>  Ground of payment (106): TP.  Transcript: payment for current year bills.  At the same time, the date of signing the document is indicated in the field "109", and in "108" is set to "0". </li><li>  Ground of payment (field 106): .  Repayment of tax arrears in the absence of a claim from the Federal Tax Service, that is, at the taxpayer’s own will. </li><li>  Basis of payment (field 106): BF.  This is the current payment of an individual through a bank account. </li></ol><h2>  Judicial settlement </h2><p>  If the basis of payment (106) “TP” means the voluntary repayment of overdue debts, then the following codes are used if the Federal Tax Service has sent a request to pay off the debt. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><p>  Ground of payment (106) </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Period (107) </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Room (108) </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Date (109) </p></td></tr><tr><td width="29"><p>  TR </p></td><td width="186"><p>  Debt payment at the request of the Federal Tax Service </p></td><td><p>  The term established in the document </p></td><td colspan="2" rowspan="4" valign="top"><p>  Number and date of request, installment, deferral, restructuring decisions </p></td></tr><tr><td width="29"><p>  RS </p></td><td width="186"><p>  Payment of installments </p></td><td><p>  Installment date </p></td></tr><tr><td width="29"><p>  FROM </p></td><td width="186"><p>  Payment of deferred debt </p></td><td><p>  Deferral repayment date </p></td></tr><tr><td width="29"><p>  RT </p></td><td width="186"><p>  Repayment of restructured debt </p></td><td><p>  Date set by the restructuring schedule </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  If the case on debt repayment is submitted to court, how to fill out a payment order (field "106")?  The basis of the payment will depend on at what stage of the judicial investigation the debt is repaid. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><p>  Ground of payment (106) </p></td><td><p>  Period (107) </p></td></tr><tr><td width="29"><p>  PB </p></td><td valign="top" width="402"><p>  Payment of debt during the bankruptcy proceedings </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Procedure Completion Date </p></td></tr><tr><td width="29"><p>  ETC </p></td><td valign="top" width="402"><p>  Payment of debt suspended for collection </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  Suspension Completion Date </p></td></tr><tr><td width="29"><p>  AP </p></td><td valign="top" width="402"><p>  Payment of debt under the act </p></td><td rowspan="2" valign="top"><p>  0 </p></td></tr><tr><td width="29"><p>  AR </p></td><td valign="top" width="402"><p>  Payment of debt under an executive document </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  This is what a correctly executed payment order should look like (field “106”: “Basis of payment”).  The document must also indicate the material number and the date of the relevant court decision. </p><p>  How else can a payment order be filled out (“Basis of Payment”, 106)?  A sample fill can be seen in the table below. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><p>  Payment code </p></td></tr><tr><td width="29"><p>  TL </p></td><td width="596"><p>  Repayment by the owner of the property of the debtor - enterprise debt during bankruptcy proceedings </p></td></tr><tr><td width="29"><p>  ST </p></td><td width="596"><p>  Payment of current debt during bankruptcy proceedings </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  If the “Basis of payment” field (106) is not filled in, Sberbank or another credit institution through which the payment passes, assigns the code “0”.  This means that it is not possible to identify the payment. </p><h2>  Taxable period </h2><p>  We will separately consider how the props “107” are filled in when making payments.  In all the listed operations, the tax period is reflected as follows: </p><ul><li>  transfer of insurance premiums - “0”; </li><li>  tax transfer - 10-digit code of the Federal Tax Service authority in the format "SS.UU. YYYY". </li></ul><p>  The first characters of the <span>code will decrypt</span> the payment period: </p><ul><li>  "MS" is a month. </li><li>  “KV” is a quarter. </li><li>  "PL" - half a year. </li><li>  "DG" - the year. </li></ul><p>  The fourth and fifth characters after the dot indicate the period number.  If the tax is paid for January, “01” shall be affixed, if for the second quarter - “02”.  The last four characters indicate the year.  These three groups are separated by dots.  This scheme allows you to quickly decrypt payments.  For example, VAT is transferred for February 2016, then in the requisite “107” you need to register “MS.01.2015”.  If there are several deadlines for the annual fee, and for each, separate payment dates are set, then these dates are indicated in the period. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="basis of payment 106 penalties" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/1605237.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If the funds are transferred not for the full reporting period, but only for a few days, then the first two characters will look like “D1” (2,3).  Depending on the number indicated, tax is paid for the 1st, 2nd or 3rd decade.  If payment is requested by the Federal Tax Service, you must specify a clear date of the act.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The correctness of filling out a payment order depends on the type of transaction and the recipient of funds.  When paying taxes, a whole series of details is additionally filled out: from the organization code to the status of the payer.  If the field “Basis of payment” (106) is not filled, then the Federal Tax Service will independently attribute the payment to one of the categories based on the results of the quarterly report.  UIN is prescribed only in budget payments.  If the account number is incorrect, the document will not be posted at all. </p>
