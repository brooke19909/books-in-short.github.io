    <h2>  What are wireless stereo headphones </h2><p>  First of all, you need to understand that the headphones designed for the TV are very different from the headphones for listening to music through a mobile device and from headsets for phone calls.  Therefore, before buying <span>wireless headphones,</span> make sure that they work well with the device for which you are going to purchase them. </p><p>  <span>Wireless headphones</span> come in three types: </p><ol><li>  Radio Headphones DECT.  They use wireless data transmission using <span>DECT technology.</span>  Digital Advanced Handheld Telecommunications (DECT) is one of the most common standards.  Approximately the same technology is used in stationary cordless phones.  They are distinguished by a large range of work. </li><li>  <span>Stereo Bluetooth Headphones.</span>  In them, wireless data transmission occurs through Buetooth-technology.  This is the most widely used form of transmission. </li><li>  Infrared headphones.  Everyone has or ever had a television with a remote control.  This remote control operates using infrared radiation, and wireless infrared headphones are arranged on the same principle.  Perhaps they transmit the highest quality sound, but they are not easy to find.  They work, however, only in the direct line of sight of the equipment, that is, the radiation can be lost by foreign objects. </li></ol>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Wireless Headphone Features </h2><ul><li>  Sound quality: now the <span>best wireless headphones</span> transmit sound with almost the same quality that good wired models can boast.  The price of such headphones, of course, is rather big.  The sound quality of medium-sized Bluetooth headphones is poor, but at the same time, if you are not a fastidious music lover, it will seem pretty clean and pleasant. </li><li>  Range: There are wireless models of headphones in which you do not have to be very close to the sound source.  That is, you can move around the house, for example, go to the kitchen, and communication with the TV or computer will not be lost.  On the other hand, walls and closed doors somehow reduce the range and quality of transmission. </li><li>  Battery Life: Some wireless headphones can last up to eight hours without recharging, while others last just a couple of hours.  There are also models powered by finger-type batteries (some prefer this option). </li><li>  The quality of voice calls: when it comes to headsets, it is first of all important to hear well the interlocutor, and that he heard you well.  In other words, voice call quality comes first.  Not all Bluetooth wireless stereo headphones with a microphone are suitable for frequent calls, many emphasize the quality of music playback. </li></ul>

As mentioned above, before you buy wireless stereo headphones, you need to make sure that they will fit the device with which you are going to use them.  And also to decide for what purposes they are needed (for example, to listen to music during training, in public transport, etc.). </p><p>  Both Bluetooth and radio headphones are equally suitable for a TV, and since there are almost no differences in the quality of stereo sound transmission between these two types of headphones, it‚Äôs worth starting from the price.  Of course, the TV model is important, because not everyone supports the ‚Äúbluetooth‚Äù broadcast, and usually no wireless headphones can be connected to outdated models. </p><p>  For mobile devices (smartphones, tablets), only wireless stereo Bluetooth headphones are suitable.  They are not as expensive as before: almost every day new models come out, and in the last year it has become easier to choose a budget model.  They are connected to the desired device through the "device search", where you just need to select the name of your headphones.  The main thing, do not forget to turn on the headphones themselves before this. </p><p>  As for headsets for talking on the phone or Skype, here again you need to choose from DECT and "bluetooth" options.  Bluetooth headsets are more common due to their versatility and price.  True, the range may disappoint, and the battery in them is rather weak. </p>

    <h2>  Headphone Types </h2><p>  If we talk about the form of models of wireless headphones, then only two are common. </p><ul><li>  Overhead: superimposed on the ear, clinging to it from the outside.  Headphones are connected by an arc.  Many in these headphones are more comfortable, but there is no question of any sound insulation. </li><li>  Vacuum droplets, they are also called "gags."  They are inserted into the auricle.  Convenient and inexpensive. </li></ul><h2>  Famous brands </h2><p>  The best manufacturer of headphones, including wireless, is considered Beats Electronics - a company founded by the popular hip-hop artist Dr. Dre. </p><p>  In addition to such well-known brands as Sony, LG and Samsung, the Chinese company AirBeats produces a quality product. </p>
