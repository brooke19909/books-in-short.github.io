Secrets of the Egyptian Pyramids</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The ancient Egyptian</span> pyramids to this day keep many secrets and secrets.  Some of them, of course, have already been uncovered, but questions remain that still concern the minds of scientists and historians.  How and by whom were these monuments created?  What technologies were used in construction?  How did builders manage to move stone blocks of tremendous weight?  Why did the pharaohs need such tombs?  You will learn all this and many other interesting facts from the article and will become a little closer to understanding the secrets of the pyramids and knowing their power and greatness. </p><h2>  Interesting facts about the Egyptian pyramids </h2><p>  These ancient building constructions have occupied their honorable places and glorify the talent of their creators, thanks to which they managed to make eternal monuments.  Until now, scientists have not been able to reliably determine how the pyramids were made and what technologies were used.  Only some data is known, but most of the technologies used are kept secret. </p><h2>  Just tombs? </h2><p>  In Egypt, there are about 118 pyramids created in different periods, of various sizes and types.  There are two varieties of pyramids, the older ones are stepped, one of the first surviving instances of the Djoser pyramid, about 2650 BC.  e. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-747284" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/747284.jpg?1538293445"></div><p>  In reality, these pyramids are graves, and their clusters are a cemetery.  In ancient times, it was believed that wealthy people should be buried with everything that they might need in the afterlife, so the pharaohs found their last refuge in the magnificent pyramids, which they began to build long before their death. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The robbers of the tombs of the pharaohs </h2><p>  The horrors taking place about the Egyptian pyramids are directly related to the robbers who so love to visit them under cover of night and to take away their last property from the deceased.  However, it is not only for the sake of the jewelry hidden in the tombs that marauders visit the monuments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-747283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/747283.jpg?1538293445"></div><p>  Locals have spoiled a lot of the appearance of some pyramids.  For example, the two pyramids in Dakhshur do not look at all the same as before, all the limestone with which they were covered is stolen for building houses in the nearest town.  Stone blocks and other building materials are often stolen, which leads to incredible destruction. </p><h2>  Secrets and Myths </h2><p>  The horrors of the Egyptian pyramids also lie in the fact that many legends reign around them.  The reason for the emergence of this myth was the fictitious curse of the most famous tomb in the world - the tomb of Tutankhamun.  It was discovered in 1922 by a group of researchers, most of whom died over the next seven years.  At that time, many believed that this was due to the curse of the tomb or some mysterious poison, although most still think so. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-747282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/747282.jpg?1538293445"></div><p>  But all this has become one huge fallacy.  Immediately after the tomb was opened, it made a splash.  In one of the newspapers, in the name of rating upgrades, it was indicated that before entering the tomb there was a warning sign that everyone who entered here would die.  However, this turned out to be just a newspaper duck, but after the researchers began to die one by one, the article gained popularity, and since then there has been a similar myth.  It is worth noting that most of these scientists were of advanced age.  So easily, some of the mysteries of the Egyptian pyramids are solved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pyramid device </h2><p>  The burial complex of the pharaohs consists not only of the pyramid itself, but also of two temples: one next to the pyramid, one must be washed by the waters of the Nile.  Pyramids and temples, which were not far from each other, were connected by alleys.  Some are partially preserved to our days, for example, the alley between Luxor and <span>Karnak temple.</span>  Unfortunately, such avenues, unfortunately, did not survive between the Giza pyramids. </p><h2>  Inside the pyramid </h2><p>  Egyptian pyramids, interesting facts about them, and ancient myths - all this is in direct connection with the internal structure.  Inside the pyramid is a burial chamber, to which passages lead from different sides.  The walls of the aisles were usually painted with religious texts.  The walls of the pyramid in Saqqara, a village near Cairo, were painted with the most ancient memorial texts that have survived to this day.  Near the pyramids of Giza is also a famous figure of the sphinx, which according to legend should protect the peace of the departed.  Unfortunately, the original name of this building did not reach our time, it is only known that during the Middle Ages the Arabs called the monument ‚Äúthe father of horror‚Äù </p><h2>  Types of Pyramids </h2><p>  Many puzzles of the Egyptian pyramids are directly related to their creation.  Until now, no one has been able to reliably determine how the ancient Egyptians managed to create such monumental buildings that are still intact. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-747281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/747281.jpg?1538293445"></div><p>  Scientists believe that the construction was carried out in several stages, during which the size of the pyramid could significantly increase compared to the original.  Construction began long before the death of the pharaoh and could take several decades.  About ten years were needed only to create a suitable site for the construction and leveling of the soil.  To create the largest pyramid to date, it took two decades. </p><h2>  Who built the pyramids </h2><p>  There is an opinion that the pyramids were built by slaves who were starved and beaten with a lash for poorly done work, but this is not so.  <span>Archaeological excavations</span> have shown that the people who built the pyramids were kept in good conditions, they were well fed.  Nevertheless, no one has yet managed to unravel forgively how the heaviest stone blocks rose up, because human power is incapable of such a thing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-747280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/747280.jpg?1538293445"></div><p>  However, archaeologists believe that over time, the construction technique changed, and the Egyptian pyramids themselves changed.  Interesting facts in mathematics also relate to the construction of pyramids.  So, scientists were able to determine that the pyramids have mathematically correct proportions.  How the ancient Egyptians managed to do this remains a mystery. </p><h2>  Egyptian pyramids - a wonder of the world </h2><ul><li>  The Cheops Pyramid is the only miracle of the world that has survived. </li><li>  There are several theories about building pyramids.  According to one of them, the construction took place on the principle of leverage, but given this it would take no less than a century and a half, and the pyramid was erected in two decades.  This is what remains a mystery. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-747279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/747279.jpg?1538293445"></div><ul><li>  Some lovers of the mystical consider these buildings to be powerful energy sources and believe that the pharaohs spent time in them and during life in order to gain new vitality. </li><li>  There are absolutely incredible theories.  For example, some believe that the pyramids were built by aliens, while others that the blocks were moved by people who own a magic crystal. </li><li>  There are some more questions regarding the construction.  For example, it has not yet been clarified why the pyramids were built in two stages and why breaks were needed. </li><li>  Pyramids were built for two centuries and were built several at once. </li><li>  Now, according to the studies of various scientists, their age is from 4 to 10 thousand years. </li><li>  In addition to accurate mathematical proportions, pyramids have another feature in this area.  The stone blocks are located so that there is absolutely no gap between them, even the thinnest blade will not crawl there. </li><li>  Each side of the pyramid is located in the direction of one side of the world. </li><li>  The Cheops Pyramid, the largest in the world, reaches a height of 146 meters, and its weight is more than six million tons. </li><li>  If you want to know how the Egyptian pyramids were created, you can learn interesting facts about the construction from the pyramids themselves.  The walls of the aisles depict construction scenes. </li><li>  The faces of the pyramids are curved one meter so that they can accumulate solar energy.  Thanks to this, the pyramids could reach thousands of degrees and emit an incomprehensible hum from such a glow. </li><li>  An ideally straight foundation was made for <span>the Cheops pyramid</span> , so the faces differ from each other by only five centimeters. </li><li>  The first pyramid built is dated 2670 BC.  e.  In appearance, it resembles several pyramids located next to each other.  The architect created a type of masonry that helped achieve this effect. </li><li>  The Cheops Pyramid is made up of 2.3 million blocks, perfectly smooth and matching each other. </li><li>  Buildings like the Egyptian pyramids are also found in Sudan, where they later embraced tradition. </li><li>  Archaeologists managed to find the village in which the builders of the pyramids lived.  A brewery and a bakery were discovered there. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-747278" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/747278.jpg?1538293445"></div><ul><li>  Egyptian pyramids hide many secrets.  Interesting facts relate, for example, to the <span>number pi,</span> by the principle of which a pyramid is made.  The walls stand at an angle of 52 degrees, which makes the ratio of height and perimeter equal to the ratio of the <span>diameter of the circle</span> to the length. </li></ul><h2>  Power and greatness </h2><p>  Why were the Egyptian pyramids created?  Interesting facts about the construction do not give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat they were for.  And pyramids were created to praise the power and greatness of their owners.  Lush tombs were a considerable part of the entire burial complex.  They were filled with things that the pharaohs might need after death.  There you could meet literally everything that a person might need.  Any <span>household utensils,</span> clothes, jewelry, dishes - all this and many other things were sent along with the pharaohs to their tombs.  These riches, buried with the owners, are often the reason for the appearance of robbers who want to receive jewelry.  All these riddles and myths that envelop the pyramids, starting from the very creation, have remained unsolved for many centuries, and no one knows if they will ever be revealed. </p>
