  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tuscany beaches: overview, description. Tuscan Riviera</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The beaches of Tuscany attract with their diversity.  Here lovers of expensive establishments or hitchhikers will find entertainment, adventure and even love.  The area attracts with picturesque views, noisy clubs and, of course, pleasant Italians. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Tuscany itself is not a city.  It is an area located in Italy.  The administrative center of Tuscany is the city of Florence.  The region consists of ten provinces: Arezzo, Gressto, Florence, Livorno, Lucca, Massa Carrara, Pisa, Pistoia, Prato, Siena. </p><p>  More than three hundred kilometers of the coast is washed by the waters of the Tyrrhenian Sea.  The very territory of the region is represented by low hills and mountains.  The plains here make up only 8% and are mostly located near the Arno river valley. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="photo of tuscany" class="if uuid-3209514" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3209514.jpg"></div><p>  The main mountain range is the Apennines, which surrounded Tuscany from the northeast side.  The described region is rich in other mountainous reliefs: the Apuan Alps, the Metal Bears, the Leaning Mountains of Pisa, Pratomanio and Mount Amiata. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Before deciding where to go in Tuscany, you should closely familiarize yourself with its history.  Firstly, it is possible to determine which city or region is closer in spirit.  Secondly, the existence of the region stretches from the second millennium BC. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about periodization, it is easier to divide the development of the region into three stages.  The first is an ancient period.  During the Bronze Age, the Apennine and Villanovo cultures began to dominate here, which appeared together with the first Italian tribes.  Then the territory was occupied by Etruscans, as evidenced by archaeological finds.  By the way, Etruscan civilization was one of the first to proclaim the equal rights of women and men. </p><p>  They were defeated by the Romans in the third century BC.  The new people settled all the cities and founded new ones - Florence and Goat.  In the last city, walls, an acropolis, a forum and a capitol have been preserved from that period to this day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.terraditoscana.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best tuscany beaches" class="if uuid-3209515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3209515.jpg"></div><p>  The second period is the Middle Ages.  Since the fall of the Roman Empire, Tuscany has experienced a crisis until other nations began to come to free lands.  Then began the large-scale construction of castles and fortifications.  With the proclamation of free communes, the first higher education institutions appeared in Tuscany. </p><p>  Tuscany is considered the site of origin of the Italian Renaissance.  It was this commune that gave the world the geniuses of painting by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, the father of the Italian language - Dante Alighieri, the famous scientists Giovanni, Francesco and Ingirami. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The third period is already a New time, and, directly, today.  Tourists observe how history is going on in this region, and they themselves make their own corrections there.  For example, respect for nature and incredible landscapes. </p><h2>  Versilia </h2><p>  The first on the list, recommended for visiting vacationers, is the Tuscan Riviera - Versilia.  Known for its white sand beaches with gentle sand and the gentle sea.  People come here not only to get enough of vitamin D and enjoy playful sea waves, but also to see the beauty of small towns.  For example: </p><ol><li>  Elite Forte dei Marmi (forte dei marmi).  The beaches here are perfect for family vacations or for water activities.  The overwhelming majority of them is paid: rental of sun loungers and an umbrella can cost 20 euros.  Free zones are on the outskirts, but the number of vacationers is too large.  If you get tired of lying and splashing around in the water, you can see local attractions: Piazza Marconi, Piazza Dante and Piazza Garibaldi. </li><li>  Viareggio.  The beaches of this resort are marked with EU Blue Flags for cleanliness.  Municipal beach area is considered free, although you still have to pay 3-5 euros for a place.  Private beaches and their service will cost visitors 35 euros.  The architectural assets of the city are the Matilda Tower, the Villa Paolina Bonaparte and the Pineta di Ponente Park. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.citalia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go in tuscany" class="if uuid-3209517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3209517.jpg"></div><p>  On the best beaches of Tuscany in Versilia, tourists are offered many services.  Among them are especially popular: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Yacht Club in Punta Alla; </li><li>  diving; </li><li>  water skiing and surfing; </li><li>  tennis courts and golf courses; </li><li>  horseback riding. </li></ul><p>  Inveterate party-goers will find themselves in many night clubs where famous DJs and stars come.  And art lovers can get aesthetic pleasure from visiting local galleries. </p><h2>  Resorts in Grosseto </h2><p>  The first thing to note is that there are territories protected at the state level.  This is the Maremma National Park, Biancan and Orbetello Lagoon. </p><p>  As for popular tourist places, the TOP-3 includes resorts: </p><ol><li>  Punta Talamone.  The town attracts people with its painting and aesthetics of the ruins of ancient fortresses.  Also here you can only be surprised at the diversity of fauna and flora. </li><li>  Castiglione della Pescea.  In the noted settlement, there is a clear contrast between the powerful walls and port districts, which follows its own active rhythm of life. </li><li>  Pitigliano.  The terrain in the mountains, which is surrounded by crystal clear river flows and (un) modest temples. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.discovertuscany.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tuscan riviera" class="if uuid-3209516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3209516.jpg"></div><p>  The most frequent request for “cool Tuscany beaches” is also relevant in Grosseto.  Soak up the sun on: </p><ol><li>  Cala Violina.  Wild beach without additional service.  Only azure water, clean sand and an unforgettable view. </li><li>  Punta Ala.  Free zone, which on the one hand is conquered by the vast sea, and on the other - a majestic pine forest. </li><li>  Castiglione della Pescaia.  A modern beach with all amenities and an open view of the local landmark - an ancient fortress. </li></ol><h2>  Elba Island </h2><p>  Elba Island is a real witness to many significant events in world history.  There are no more territories that would be visited by all civilizations known to man.  The untouched nature, unique works of art and centuries-old culture create a separate universe here, which every self-respecting traveler must visit. </p><p>  One of the most popular beaches of Tuscany is located on this island - Biodola.  Ideal for families with children: soft sand and a shallow bottom add comfort to children's entertainment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.citalia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy in March" class="if uuid-3209519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3209519.jpg"></div><p>  Another favorite coast for locals and visitors is Paolina.  It is compared to a peaceful and wonderful harbor with pebbles.  Opposite the shore there is a lonely rock with a view of the sea power and beauty (you can only swim to it).  Rumor has it that it was here that Paolina Bonaparte liked to relax (which is why the name). </p><h2>  Budget vacation </h2><p>  The free beaches of Tuscany are an incredible rarity.  Some visitors can grab the site for nothing in private areas, while others conveniently (or not) settle on stones nearby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tuscansecrets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rosignano maritimo" class="if uuid-3209518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3209518.jpg"></div><p>  The list of free zones includes: </p><ol><li>  La Spiaggia Della Lecciona is an alternative to Punta Ala with a pine forest. </li><li>  Cala Violina </li><li>  Buka Del Fate - located on the other side of the island of Elba, getting here is quite difficult (you can’t do without a Google assistant or map).  The car will have to be parked somewhere along the road and on foot to get to the place through the forest.  But the breathtaking view and clear water are worth it. </li><li>  Barkola. </li></ol><p>  But we must not forget that many free beaches often, nevertheless, require an admission fee (but it is minimal). </p><h2>  Florence </h2><p>  Italy in March is beautiful, and especially in Florence (it is not for nothing that it is called the spring city).  On the north bank of the Arno River is the historic city center, which is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.  Here you can find the Duomo Square, the Baptistery of St. John and the Academy Gallery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ourescapeclause.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="forte dei marmi" class="if uuid-3209521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3209521.jpg"></div><p>  Crossing the Ponte Vecchio bridge you can find yourself in the heart of bohemia.  The Oltrarno district is rich in many assets: these are wonderful museums that reveal the features of modern art;  openwork religious buildings;  restaurants enticing with pleasant aromas;  modest cafes. </p><p>  The city itself is a storehouse for inspiration, meeting with history and contact with the fabulous past. </p><h2>  Livorno </h2><p>  Time to escape a little from the tourist influx centers and go to the provinces, where you can enjoy harmony and see the real life of Italians.  Livorno reveals business Italy, where residents have no time for comfort on weekdays (a vivid example is Rosignano Marittimo). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.silversea.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="livorno italy" class="if uuid-3209522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3209522.jpg"></div><p>  The list of mast si included: </p><ol><li>  Mascagni Terrace is a musical place that is associated with a composer named Pedro Mascagni. </li><li>  The old fortress, as a symbol of impregnability and stability.  Time is merciless, so frequent attacks and robberies reduced the structure to the foundation.  But the locals decided to restore the building, and today it is open to visitors. </li><li>  The cathedral is a monument of architecture of the Renaissance. </li></ol><h2>  Pisa </h2><p>  Pisa is the pearl of the Tuscan region, which evokes clear associations with the Leaning Tower.  In addition to the popular business card of the city, it is worth paying attention to other unique buildings.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  Duomo Cathedral; </li><li>  Chocolate Valley, which impresses with its tasting; </li><li>  Campo Santo Cemetery; </li><li>  Santa Maria della Spina; </li><li>  Palazzo del Oroolgio. </li></ul><p>  It is worth coming here during the summer holidays.  Then they organize several festivals, of which the most spectacular ones are Luminara and games on the bridge. </p><p>  The list is not limited to this, as are the beauties of Tuscany themselves.  It is necessary to visit the region at any moment of spiritual ascension and exhaustion of inspiration.  Tuscania will fill the soul with vivid impressions and warmth, and fantasy will destroy the erected boundaries. </p>
