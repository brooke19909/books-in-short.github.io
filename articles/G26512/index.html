    <h2>  Milestones of biography: childhood, youth, years of study and service </h2><p>  Novikov Nikolai Ivanovich was born in the suburbs of Moscow, in the estate of his parents Tikhvinsky-Avdotin, in 1744.  His family belonged to a noble family. </p><p>  Nicholas childhood passed in a quiet home environment, his first teacher was a village clerk.  Later, the boy entered the Moscow noble school, from which he was expelled in 1760 "for laziness." </p><p>  After expulsion from the educational institution, Nikolai Novikov did not indulge in sadness, but devoted his free time to reading literature.  After a couple of years, in 1762, he entered the military service in the prestigious Izmailovsky regiment.  Having become a random participant in the palace coup, as a result of which Catherine the Great came to power in the country, Novikov was promoted to officer by decree of the new empress. </p><p>  Catherine found a lesson for an educated and well-read young man.  Nikolai Novikov was included in the list of deputies who were entrusted with the compilation of the draft of the future state code.  It is known that Nikolai Ivanovich very conscientiously treated his new duties and did his best to bring benefit to the Fatherland. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Journalism </h2><p>  Nikolai Novikov entered Russian history as a talented journalist and publisher.  In 1769, he left military service and set about fulfilling his dream: the writer (like many enlighteners) believed that by communicating the right knowledge to people, society could be changed for the better.  The instrument of his struggle, he chose satire. </p><p>  Novikov began to publish several magazines.  They were called ‚ÄúDrone‚Äù, ‚ÄúPurse‚Äù, ‚ÄúPainter‚Äù, ‚ÄúHollow‚Äù.  In these publications, Novikov tried to ridicule the mores of his time: he advocated reforms in the education and upbringing system, pointed out the shortcomings of serfdom, ignorance and social injustice.  Often he criticized the actions of the authorities in a mild form. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novikov Nikolay Ivanovich" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39456/1062683.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  His magazines took the position of opponents in relation to the official publication ‚ÄúAnything‚Äù, which was actively supported by Catherine the Great. </p><p>  Naturally, the magazines published by Novikov were closed by the authorities because of their independent and bold position. </p><h2>  Pedagogical works </h2><p>  Nikolai Novikov managed to do a lot in his life, the biography of this man is a vivid confirmation of this. </p><p>  Known Nikolai Ivanovich and as a bright teacher.  He penned numerous works addressed to parents and teachers.  These are, as a rule, journalistic works and special authorial works on pedagogy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In fact, Novikov is creating his pedagogical theory based on the ideas of enlightenment and humanism.  He denies the educational power of the physical punishment of children, points out the need for parents to pay great attention to the upbringing of the younger generation, to love their offspring, to enlighten their minds with knowledge, and the soul with virtuous examples. </p><p>  Novikov especially advocates moral education and upbringing of the younger generation in the family and in educational institutions.  He talks about the need to refuse to transfer children to the care of hired tutors and servants, as well as the need for equal access to education for boys and girls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolai Ivanovich Novikov biography" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39456/1062684.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Masonic lodge </h2><p>  Novikov Nikolai Ivanovich was a member of the Masonic lodge - an influential secret organization, circulated in those years in Europe and in Russia. </p><p>  For the first time at a meeting of free masons Novikov appeared in 1775 - he was attracted by the ideas of enlightenment, respect for morality, and the desire to create a new social structure. </p><p>  It is assumed that Novikov created his printing house on the basis of Moscow University thanks to the support of fellow masons.  The ideas of Freemasonry and Protestantism can be traced in many writings of the writer. </p><h2>  Imprisonment and years of oblivion </h2><p>  It was for his ideas that Novikov suffered. </p><p>  In 1792, by order of the empress, he was arrested and placed in the <span>Shlisselburg fortress.</span>  The accusation against the writer indicated that he distributed mystic-Protestant and Masonic literature, which confused the minds of his contemporaries. </p><p>  There is a hypothesis of historians, according to which the heir to the throne - the son of the Empress Pavel - sympathized with the ideas of Masons and favored Novikov, therefore his royal mother was so strict in relation to the writer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicholas Novikov biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39456/1062685.jpg" width="334"></div>

    <p>  By the way, immediately after the death of mother Pavel released Novikov from the fortress.  However, he, by his own admission, lost all his health in captivity.  He went free into the frail old man who dreamed of only one thing - peace and oblivion. </p><p>  Nikolai Ivanovich Novikov, whose biography is full of ups and downs, lived the rest of his years in his parents' house, taking care of the peasants and leading a quiet lifestyle.  He died in 1818 and was buried in his estate. </p>
