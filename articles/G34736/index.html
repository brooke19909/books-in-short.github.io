It's time to remind the children that such a great event took place in the country.  And to do it better in the game.  Therefore, in this article I want to tell you what crafts on the theme of "sport" exist. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Painting </h2><p>  You can do anything with children, kids are often interested in almost everything.  So, crafts on the theme of "sport" can be in the form of drawings.  However, it is not interesting to simply draw and draw the players with pencils or paints.  You can do it with your fingers!  You will need special children's <span>finger paints that</span> will significantly enliven the work process.  An interesting idea can be drawing a team of soccer players or hockey players with fingerprints - these will be athletes.  It remains for them to finish only the handle-legs, as well as the ball or washer and the gate.  The picture is ready! </p><h2>  Modeling </h2><p>  Crafts on the theme of "sport" can also be created from plasticine.  If children of senior preschool or primary school age will work, ordinary plasticine purchased in office supplies is also suitable.  If the children are still very small, they can prepare a special salt dough (painted with food dyes) and sculpt crafts from it.  What can be done?  Why not introduce the top three winners in your favorite sport?  To do this, you will need to create a pedestal from plasticine, and put the winning men on it.  It is important not to forget to sign the steps of the winners with the numbers 1, 2 and 3, and to decorate people with a beautiful shape and attributes of their sport.  All <span>plasticine crafts</span> are ready! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts on the subject of winter sport" class="if" height="499" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/342801.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Applications </h2><p>  Crafts on the theme of "sports" can also be tried to make out of paper - this is no less interesting idea.  Why not create a victorious collage from photographs and magazine clippings?  To do this, the child must choose their favorite athletes during their training or performance, cut out from the magazine and stick on whatman paper.  Now you need to decorate the sheet.  For this, it is necessary to cut out the attributes of the sport in which these athletes perform from colored paper.  It can be glued water, in which swimmers practically live, an ice arena for skaters, a track for cyclists or a ski track for skiers - anything.  You can also stick small bouquets of flowers everywhere on the paper and draw fireworks, which will symbolize the victory of athletes. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children's crafts on the theme of sports" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/342806.jpg?1393308645968" width="384"></div></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Voluminous crafts </h2><p>  Now we will create crafts on the theme of "winter sport" in volume.  To do this, you will need paper, cones, acorns.  We will make athletes skiers.  For their body pretty long bumps will be needed, and the head, arms and legs will be acorns.  They are attached to the base with the help of hairpins (therefore, these crafts should be done under the supervision of adults).  Caps from acorns can become feet, and they can also be used as the bottom of <span>ski poles.</span>  Paper is needed in order to make the mountain with which athletes come down.  It can be just a cone, or you can make it from glue and pieces of paper according to the principle of papier-m√¢ch√©.  So the slide will be more like a real one.  The skis themselves can be made from any dry blade of grass or even cardboard.  That's all, the skiers are ready! </p>

    <p>  You can also try making a set of balls from the dough!  What is not an interesting idea?  To do this, you will need to make a round cookie and paint them together with the kids with food colors.  Great for this is also a special paste, with which decorate cakes.  So what can balls be like?  It can be a basketball orange, a soccer black and white ball, you can also make a baseball - white with red firmware.  It should be noted that after baking such desserts will go off with a bang. </p><p>  However, this is not all children's crafts on the theme of "sports" that you can think of.  There are many options, you just need to turn on your imagination. </p>
