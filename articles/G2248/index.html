  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The fattest man in the world: a review of the brightest claimants for the title</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The problem of obesity</span> today is very acute in many countries of the world.  A sedentary lifestyle, malnutrition, poor ecology - all this cannot but affect the state and well-being of a person in the most negative way.  The <span>Guinness</span> Book <span>of Records</span> regularly registers more and more new nominees for the title ‚Äúthe fattest man in the world‚Äù, and from year to year, these data become, frankly, more and more depressing: weight increases, age decreases, people‚Äôs plans change from the desire to lose weight to the desire to get better to deserve even more close public attention.  We bring to your attention several striking similar examples. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the fattest man" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14531/334836.jpg" width="398"></div></h2><h2>  John Brower Minnock </h2><p>  A taxi driver from Washington, John Brower Minnock, is the fattest <span>man in the world</span> from 1941 to 1983.  His weight was 635 kg with a height of 185 cm. A team of 13 orderlies could hardly cope with his movement.  As a result, doctors came to the conclusion that John urgently needs to lose weight, otherwise he simply will not survive.  The results were simply amazing: in 2 years the weight of this person decreased by 419 kg!  But it turned out to be not so easy to cope with this pathology, and soon the weight began to return: in a week, John gained 90 kg.  He survived only to 42 years.  At that time, his weight was 362 kg. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the fattest people on the planet" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14531/334835.jpg?1392277926373" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  Manuel Uribe Garza </h2><p>  Manuel Uribe Garza was the holder of the title "the fattest man" until 2008.  He is alive and even very happy to this day, as he managed to defeat his ailment and become the person who lost the most kilograms and, most importantly, retained this result.  By 2007, Manuel's weight was 560 kg, and he could no longer move without assistance.  Manuel went to the doctors, underwent a <span>resection of the stomach,</span> began to strictly adhere to a diet designed specifically for him.  Reducing weight by 200 kg was just the beginning.  After this, Manuel almost learned to walk again and even married a nurse who helped him in recent years. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the fattest man" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14531/334958.jpg?1392289139771" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Paul Mason </h2><p>  Another representative of the section of the Guinness Book of Records called "The Thickest People on the Planet" is Briton Paul Mason.  At 48, he weighs 445 kg.  Paul admits that his overweight is a consequence of the most severe depression that overtook him after the death of his father.  Paul can no longer walk independently and leads an almost immobile lifestyle.  Around his bed are a variety of devices to help alleviate his situation at least a little: medical devices, stands for food and drink, hygiene and medicine, TV and computer.  The nutritional value of Paul‚Äôs daily diet is more than 20,000 calories, while an adult man has 2,500 calories per day.  Paul Mason is on full state support, and the cost of food alone is about $ 24,000 a year. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the fattest people of Russia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14531/334833.jpg?1392277988533" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The fattest people in Russia: Dzhambulat Hotokhov </h2><p>  Dzhambulat Hotokhov is the fattest <span>child</span> in Russia and the world.  At 10 years old, his weight exceeds 150 kg.  Dzhambulat was born the most ordinary child, but by the age of three his dimensions corresponded to the age of seven years.  Despite all the inconveniences and health risks, the relatives of Dzhambulat find some advantages in this state of his.  So, such a build is considered almost ideal for practicing sumo wrestling.  Jambik with pleasure visits the gym and easily lifts two weights of 16 kg each. </p><p>  These are the representatives of the title "the fattest man."  Of course, this is not all applicants for getting into the Guinness Book of Records, but only officially registered.  It seems that such sad statistics will make you think about your diet and lifestyle in general.  Be healthy and beautiful! </p>
