The manufacturer pleased not only the functionality, but also the unusual design of almost every model.  Let us recall the Moto Corporation, see what happened to it now, and, of course, we‚Äôll postnostalgize for the selection of the coolest devices.  Phone "Motorola", old models, photos are waiting for you in this article. </p><h2>  Moto Corporation </h2><p>  The company was founded in 1928 by the Galvin brothers in the United States.  She got the name thanks to one of her first products - the Motorola autoradio receiver (moto - motor, ola - radiOLA).  In the 50s of the last century, an emblem in the form of bat wings was developed, which made Motorola phones (old models) so recognizable.  But that is all later. </p><h2>  Success and sunset </h2><p>  In 1956, the company released the world's first pager, and in 1983 - the first commercial mobile phone in the history of mankind. </p><p>  But already in the 2000s, the production of mobile phones became unprofitable for the corporation.  In 2011, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $ 12.5 billion. </p><h2>  What about now? </h2><p>  We remember the Motorola phones, the old models of the company.  But the electronic company in 2016 released a new line of models already Moto smartphones.  True, under the protectorate of Lenovo.  You could see them on the shelves of Moscow stores since March 2016. </p><h2>  Cell phone Motorola.  Old models </h2><p>  It's time to immerse yourself in nostalgia - consider the dozen of the company's most legendary phones: </p><ol><li>  StarTAC.  Mentioning about Motorola phones, old models, it is impossible not to say about him - the embodiment of communication devices from the cult Star Track in reality.  And at the same time, this is the first clamshell telephone in the world, and the first mobile with a vibration alert.  It was released in 1996. </li><li>  RAZR V3.  In the early 2000s, the Motor Racer was the face of the corporation, an indicator of style.  Due to the fact that the case of the device was metal, and it was incredibly thin for those times, the ‚Äúclamshell‚Äù was nicknamed Razor - a razor.  The phone had an internal and external display, a camera, Bluetooth and only 7 MB of memory. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Motorola phones old models" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/1673717.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  ROKR E1, E398.  The most "music phones" - they had dedicated buttons for the music player, powerful stereo speakers, light music - flashing LEDs to the beat of the composition, and, according to some information, iTunes.  There was also a slot for flash drives. </li><li>  V70.  The first phone with a rotator design - in order to get to the keyboard, the phone case had to be twisted.  He could rotate not only back and forth, but also 360 degrees.  An interesting feature was the round design of the monochrome screen. </li><li>  AURA.  Even just looking at this device - to get aesthetic pleasure.  A metal telephone with the same rotator design this time had a really round color screen.  And if you rotate the device "rear", you could see through the special window meticulously executed gears of the rotator mechanism. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone motorola old models photo" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/1673719.jpg" width="500"></div></li><li>  ROCR E8.  If you look at all Motorola phones, old models, then he is the first with a "landscape" screen orientation.  The second feature was the keyboard - in normal mode, it was lit with standard keys, and for the photo mode and the player, the icons needed only for their interface lit up. </li><li>  MPx200.  The corporation tried to invest something unusual in each model.  This, too, was no exception - the ‚Äúclamshell‚Äù could open both vertically and horizontally.  And this model has already been equipped with a resistive touch screen. </li><li>  MING a1200. <strong> </strong>  A stylus came with the resistive touch screen of this model.  But the most interesting point was the transparent cover of the device, in which the developers placed the speaker. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cell phone motorola old models" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/1673718.jpg" width="440"></div></li><li>  RIZR Z8. <strong> </strong>  Laconic black device with acidic green accents.  This time, the shape of a ‚Äúslider‚Äù but with a ‚Äúsmack of Motorola‚Äù - in the open position, the phone did not have a straight shape, but curved in the shape of a banana for more convenient ‚Äústicking‚Äù to the head during a conversation. </li><li>  Milestone DROID.  It was a metal slider with a side ‚Äúquarter‚Äù -keyboard, which had a huge diagonal for 2009 - 3.7 inches. </li></ol><p>  We hope that you learned something new and interesting about the Motorola phones, the old models of the company. </p>
