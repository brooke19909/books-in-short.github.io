There are many models of microwave ovens that are equipped with electronic controls, touch buttons and additional functions.  A very important factor is the coating of the working chamber of the stove, the most common ones are made of enamel or stainless steel.  To choose the right device, it is worth considering its various options.  For example, there are models that can successfully replace the oven.  Such microwave ovens are equipped with convection grill functions, their characteristics will be discussed in the material. </p><p>  <strong><span>Microwave:</span> what can she do?</strong> </p><p>  A popular feature that the device has is the heating and defrosting of products.  Using the microwave, you can prepare hot sandwiches and more sophisticated dishes.  If the microwave oven is equipped with a grill, then this makes it possible to bake meat, as on a spit, and convection helps to turn the device into an excellent replacement for the oven of a conventional stove.  Convection microwave ovens produced by well-known brands BORK, SAMSUNG and others are popular. Moreover, there are models that have only a grill or only convection.  The first is suitable for cooking meat, fish.  Convection is used for baking.  There are models that combine both functions, which helps to increase the range of dishes that a microwave can prepare. </p><p>  <strong>Grill or convection?</strong> </p><p>  Before choosing a microwave oven, it is worth considering: for what you will use it.  Only for heating pre-cooked dishes, or it will become in your kitchen a competitor to the oven.  The usefulness of dishes cooked in the microwave, about the need and convenience of using the grill function with convection, has long been debated among cooking enthusiasts.  Grill is a special device <span>in the microwave,</span> adapted for frying.  In modern models, they exist in two forms: heating elements and quartz.  The former look like a metal spiral with a heating element inside.  Most often, it is located on top of the working chamber of the microwave oven.  Some models allow you to move it, which helps to better fry foods.  A microwave quartz grill consists of a wire made from an alloy of chromium and nickel, which is placed in a <span>quartz glass</span> tube <span>.</span>  A similar grill is mounted in the upper part of the microwave oven, above its working chamber.  Quartz grill helps to fry food products more softly and evenly, although its power is noticeably inferior to a grill with a heating element.  Some microwave models also have a lower grill. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Convection is, in fact, the <span>uniform movement of</span> hot air.  Thanks to the ring heating element and the fan, heated air is distributed inside the chamber.  A similar function used <span>in microwave ovens</span> can expand the number of cooked dishes. </p><p>  For cooking in the microwave, you can use any dishes, the main thing is that it is not made of metal, and, preferably, without finishing with gold or silver.  Using a grill with convection, it is best to take special dishes made of heat-resistant material, which is designed for microwave ovens. </p><p>  <strong>Grill &amp; convection microwave reviews</strong> </p><p>  Customer reviews that have purchased such microwave ovens suggest that, as a rule, they are not disappointed with the choice.  It turns out not bad at all.  Tasty meat and fish.  You can bake a cake.  Moreover, for those who fear for their health, it turns out to be an important factor that the operation of the microwave oven in the "grill with convection" mode is not dangerous to humans.  In fact, the harmfulness of this device is greatly exaggerated. </p><p>  Its radiation is not ionizing, it does not significantly affect the human body and does not contribute to the development of dangerous diseases.  On the contrary, from the fact that the products in the microwave oven are uniformly heated from all sides, moreover, without the use of oil and water, they retain more useful substances.  In addition, microwaves are more economical than traditional stoves, cooking with them takes less time, and dishes are obtained with almost no loss of vitamins. </p>
