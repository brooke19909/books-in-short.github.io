Stunning nature, the gentle sea and sandy beaches do not leave anyone indifferent.  The abundance of demand creates supply.  Today, along the entire coast you will find a huge number of <span>hotels, pensions, hotels</span> and hostels.  The Olympics pushed construction even further; new resort cities have grown in Sochi, which are distinguished by modern infrastructure and amazing conditions for recreation.

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Surely you have already heard about the famous city-hotel called ‚ÄúVelvet Season‚Äù.  This is a huge complex in the Imereti Lowland, which every year is flooded with tourists from all over Russia.  It is on its territory that the Russian House Hotel is located.  Sochi is the most magnificent and bright corner of Russia, but this hotel has the most beautiful part of it.  Right from the windows you can freely admire the magnificent views of the mountain ranges of Krasnaya Polyana, parks, ponds and alleys.  Designers have invested a tremendous amount of work, but the beauty they created is beyond praise. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  Here the question of this disappears by itself.  This is a completely new facility, which was built specifically to receive numerous guests.  Therefore, the issue of transport links was decided immediately, even before the construction of the Russian House hotel complex.  Sochi is already a very modern resort, and now at all, thanks to a developed transport structure, it will not be difficult to get to any of its corners. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Hotel address: 28 Figurnaya street. If you have decided on the hotel at the airport, you can get to it with transfers by bus.  A shuttle bus number 135 will take you from the airport, which will take you to the New Century shopping center.  Then buses No. 57 and 100 will take you directly to the Russky Dom stop.  Sochi is a resort where surprisingly hospitable people live, so if you get lost, just ask for directions.  From the train station you can get an electric train to the station "Olympic Park".  Next, you need to hire a taxi or walk. </p><h2>  Hotel Advantages </h2><p>  Adlersky district is a picturesque nature and fresh air, stunning beaches and warm sea.  But that is not all.  A distinctive feature of this complex is the availability of its own infrastructure.  Here you will never be bored, for each age category there is an occupation to your taste.  The most pleasant thing here is that it is possible to combine a comfortable life in the country and all the advantages inherent in the urban infrastructure of recent years.  You can stroll through the fashion boutiques or go on a bike ride, sit by the pond or go to the most fashionable restaurant. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  If you love wildlife, you like a walk through the forests and fields, then you will definitely enjoy a <span>vacation in Sochi.</span>  The Russian House complex is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã44 hectares, and in the immediate vicinity of the hotel begins the territory of the ornithological park, where our tourists like to spend their days.  On the territory of the hotel (it is difficult to call such a huge area), 18 hotel buildings are located.  Each of them is given the name of the Russian gem.  Adler district itself is a real gem of Russia, so the names "Sapphire", "Garnet", "Amber" and "Amethyst", "Emerald" and "Pearl" are suitable for the local hotels as well as possible.  The usual resort entertainment here awaits you right under the windows of the hotels.  Directly between its buildings are dozens of restaurants and cafes, bistros and bars.  You don't have to go far to have a tasty snack or a cup of coffee. </p>

    <h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  Of course, this question excites tourists in the first place, so it should be solved before you arrive in Sochi.  ‚ÄúRussian House‚Äù prices are kept at an average level, that is, they are available to almost everyone who decided to go to the resort.  A single standard will cost you from 1800 to 3450 rubles per day per room.  Price varies depending on the season, the peak of which falls on the hottest summer months.  Double standard costs a little more, but, in terms of person, more profitable.  You will give from 2500 to 4500 per day, depending on what time you have chosen for the trip.  Finally, a two-room double ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù costs from 3,000 to 6,000 rubles.  The price includes bed and breakfast buffet.  In this case, children under 12 years old are free of charge, only breakfast is paid separately.  Its cost for a child is 500 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi complex Russian house" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1033618.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Catering for tourists </h2><p>  Meals are organized according to the "buffet".  Breakfast is included in the price, and then you can adjust the food system at your discretion.  You can choose half board or full board, and you can go for lunch and dinner in various cafes and restaurants, which are enough here.  It all depends on your preference.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the food in the hotel restaurant is very good, the cuisine is simply amazing, but if you want to find a cheaper option, you should pay attention to the cafe network like ‚Äú50/50‚Äù or ‚ÄúLaguna‚Äù.  There are 9 bars and 17 lobby bars, as well as 8 restaurants around the clock.  Each of them has its own zest, which distinguishes it from everyone else. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Many people come here in order to properly bask in the golden sand.  The hotel has its own beach, equipped with comfortable sun loungers and parasols.  Only 500 meters away is the hotel "Russian House 3 *".  Sochi is the cradle of beach holidays, and leaving here without sunbathing will be at least imprudent.  If you are tired of swimming in the sea or the weather seems unsuitable, then you have an indoor pool at your disposal, which is especially loved by children.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the beach is very clean and well maintained.  There are toilets and showers, as well as rescue towers.  For children there is a huge playground. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel russian house sochi" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1033617.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  As usual, there are a lot of reviews, and good ones, and not very good ones.  However, having become acquainted with their content, we can conclude that the situation in the hotel and the quality of service are at an altitude, while the prices are quite reasonable.  Some tourists were dissatisfied with the quality of food in the hotel restaurant, however, if you remember how many different cafes and bars there are in the hotel, as well as the entire resort city "Velvet Season" - the question goes away by itself.  The guests did not note any more shortcomings in the hotel‚Äôs work, that is, we can conclude that this is a great place for families. </p>
