It was a tragic time when the world war burned out, in which Germany, like other European countries, suffered enormous losses. </p><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa huge astronomical attraction was not immediately realized - only after the projection apparatus was created, and this happened in 1923, at the Zeiss optical instrument factory in Jena.  Then in Jena the first demonstration of the map of the starry sky took place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nn-stories.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nizhny Novgorod Planetarium" class="if uuid-2803561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104074/2803561.jpg"></div><p>  The planetarium was a huge success and similar structures were opened one after another in different countries and cities.  The planetarium in Nizhny Novgorod was opened in 1948, shortly after the end of the war.  Initially, he occupied the premises of the Alekseevsky Church, located in the Annunciation Monastery, and was located there for a long time.  Only in 2005 the cathedral building was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church, and a special building was built for the planetarium. </p><h2>  Planetary equipment </h2><div class="photo" data-original="afisha.yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Exposition at the planetarium in Nizhny Novgorod" class="if uuid-2803557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104074/2803557.jpg"></div><p>  The new planetarium in <span>Nizhny Novgorod has</span> surpassed the previous one in both size and applied technology.  This is the first digital planetarium in Russia to use computer technology and laser optics in its work.  A computer program was developed for him, which allows you to show the movement of the stars in dynamics, to show a map of the starry sky for different seasons and any geographical points. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Viewers can see the starry sky of the Southern and Northern Hemispheres, get acquainted with the names of stars and constellations, learn how to orient themselves by stars.  The planetarium in Nizhny Novgorod holds up to 1300 educational events per year; up to 50 thousand spectators visit it annually. </p><p>  The most spectacular and spectacular Great Star Hall was opened in 2007.  Its discovery took place on the 50th anniversary of the Space Age, on October 4, 2007 - on this day in 1957, Soviet people launched the first space satellite into orbit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="new.nnov.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="planetarium space simulator" class="if uuid-2804082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51662/2804082.jpg"></div><h2>  Relationship with educational programs </h2><p>  The planetarium in Nizhny Novgorod opens the door for school trips, astronomy lessons are held here, as well as classes at astronomical circles.  Thematically related problems are cosmonautics and events dedicated to space flights are organized at the planetarium, as well as simulators are installed that simulate the docking of spacecraft in orbit. </p><p>  The location of the new planetarium is next to the circus.  Such a neighborhood contributed to popularization: the Nizhny Novgorod planetarium, whose poster next to the circus poster, attracted new visitors. </p><h2>  Space simulator in Nizhny Novgorod </h2><p>  It is worthwhile to tell separately about the simulator installed in the planetarium.  This is a complex high-tech construction that allows you to complete all stages of docking the Soyuz TMA spacecraft to the ISS.  Docking is performed in different versions, to different parts of the station. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are four such simulators in Russia, the first being in Star City and used to train cosmonauts before real work in space.  The second simulator is located in Novocherkassk, the third - in the Cosmonautics Museum in Moscow. </p><p>  The technical equipment of the planetarium in Nizhny Novgorod is the leader in Russia and is at the forefront on a global scale.  Of the 4000 operating planetariums, the technical level of Nizhny Novgorod is in 200th place. </p><p>  Note that the planetariums of our country are united in the Association, coordinate their activities, participate in joint projects. </p><h2>  Virtual reality effect </h2><p>  Digital technology allows you to achieve the effect of "immersion", when viewers can observe the starry sky in the amount that is available to astronauts in orbit.  Programmers and astronomers are improving the software, achieving accuracy and clarity when demonstrating space luminaries. </p><p>  People visiting a planetarium often have a desire to look at real stars, especially since it is now possible: telescopes with digital control and powerful optics are on sale.  Astronomy has become available not only to professional scientists, but also to amateurs. </p><h2>  Popular science astronomy </h2><p>  A digital planetarium is not only a demonstration of the starry sky.  Digital technology has made possible the visualization of celestial bodies - as if we were close to them.  Solar prominences, rings of Saturn, lunar craters can be seen in educational videos, and spectacular panoramas are accompanied by explanations of the lecturer.  For those who want to visit the planetarium of Nizhny Novgorod, the schedule is published on posters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nnv.arriva.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nizhny Novgorod planetarium inside" class="if uuid-2803560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104074/2803560.jpg"></div><h2>  Planetary News in Nizhny Novgorod </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.318582" data-lng="43.95487000000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/6/0/3/8603.png"></div><p>  The planetarium is popular among city residents.  That is why the new residential complex was named after him. </p><p>  <strong>LCD Planetarium, Nizhny Novgorod</strong> - is the address of a modern, well-equipped complex, environmentally friendly and comfortable for residents. </p><p>  Residents and guests of Nizhny Novgorod, welcome to the Planetarium at Revolutionary St., 20! </p>
