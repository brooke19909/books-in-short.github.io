    <h2>  History of Yaroslavl </h2><p>  In 1010, by order of Yaroslav the Wise, the city was laid, which was named in honor of its founder.  The history of the emergence of Yaroslavl suggests that a site was chosen for this in the area where the Volga merges with the Korostel River.  This made it possible to reliably protect him from enemies from three sides.  It is first mentioned in chronicles that describe the hunger riots in 1071. </p><p>  From ancient times to the present, the history of Yaroslavl is closely linked with the history of the Russian state.  Since ancient Russia, the city has forever inscribed itself in history as a powerful, culturally enlightened and wealthy principality.  It had an impact on the life of the Russian state. </p><p>  It is important that after reunification with Moscow (1380), Yaroslavl did not lose its role and a long period (before the accession to the throne of Peter I) was an important city on the northern trade route.  It was the second most populated city and the third largest commodity city in Russia.  In it, crafts and industry developed rapidly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the XIX century, this Russian city became the most beautiful city in the country.  For its magnificent landscapes, he received the name "Russian Florence". </p><p>  Yaroslavl confidently maintained leadership in industrial production until the beginning of the 20th century.  The city had 50 factories that provided jobs for 15,000 workers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslavl city attractions" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/692403.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Yaroslavl became famous for educational institutions - starting with the Grigorievsky shutter and ending with the eight largest universities that Yaroslavl is proud of today. </p><h2>  Yaroslavl City: Attractions </h2><p>  A significant part of the historical and cultural monuments of the city is located in the historical center.  By and large, the center is the main attraction, always available for visiting tourists. </p><p>  The layout of the center was developed during the time of Catherine the Great.  These ancient places give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat Russian cities looked like in the 18th century after the urban development reform carried out by Catherine II (1763).  The author of the project of the center of Yaroslavl was Ivan Starov. </p><p>  Its borders conditionally pass along the streets of Sobin and Republican.  This territory was formerly called the Earth City. </p><p>  The starting point of construction was the Church of Elijah the Prophet, erected on the banks of the Volga in 1650.  A semicircular square (now Sovetskaya), surrounded by symmetrically placed administrative buildings, was liberated next to it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Specialists call this principle of building classicism, typical of the architecture of the XVIII century.  The "rays" of streets diverge from the square in different directions.  Each of them goes to the architectural monuments of an earlier period.  For example, Plazparadnaya Square approaches the Assumption Cathedral, which has existed since 1215.  Uglichskaya street approaches the Vlasov (or Znamenskaya) tower, which has been preserved from the ancient <span>defensive structures of the</span> 17th century.  The breakdown street ended with the church of Simeon Stolnik, which has not been preserved to this day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of Yaroslavl" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/692404.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All the streets of the center of Yaroslavl are built up with beautiful old buildings, which are designed in clear symmetry.  They are distinguished by numerous refinements characteristic of the architecture of the 18th and 19th centuries. </p><h2>  Church of Elijah the Prophet </h2><p>  The city of Yaroslavl has on its territory a most valuable architectural monument of the 17th century.  According to an ancient legend, this church was founded by the great Yaroslav the Wise.  This event coincided with the beginning of the construction of the city. </p><p>  According to legend, the reason for the construction of the temple was the victory of the prince over a huge bear, which happened on the day of Elijah the Prophet. </p><p>  The temple stands on the site where two old churches used to be.  It was built at the expense of the richest merchants of the city in 1650.  It was located on the site of the Ilyinsko-Tikhon Church, which currently exists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Assumption Cathedral </h2><p>  The history of Yaroslavl was marked in 1215 by the appearance of the first stone church, which was built by Prince Konstantin Vsevolodovich.  The Assumption Cathedral was rebuilt several times.  After a terrible fire in 1501, he was badly damaged. </p><p>  When the inhabitants of the city cleared the rubble, the relics of princes Vasily and Constantine (XIII century) were discovered, which became the main shrine of the temple for many years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslavl city" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/692405.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 1937, the Assumption Cathedral was blown up, a cultural park took its place.  In 2004, a decision was made, and large-scale work began on the construction of an exact copy of the Assumption Cathedral in its former place.  In 2010, Patriarch Kirill held the first services in the reconstructed church. </p><h2>  Museum of History </h2><p>  The beautiful Russian city of Yaroslavl, the sights of which are the subject of pride of its inhabitants, has an interesting museum.  It was founded in 1985.  The Museum of History of Yaroslavl is located in the house, which at one time belonged to the merchant Kuznetsov. </p><p>  The exposition is presented in six rooms.  Here are documents and interesting exhibits related to the history of the city. </p><h2>  Sobinov House </h2><p>  This is a museum of the great opera singer L.V. Sobinova opened to visitors in May 1995.  He is the only one in Russia fully dedicated to the life and work of a brilliant representative of Russian musical culture. </p><p>  This house is connected with the life of three generations of the Sobinov clan.  The future singer was born in him, spent his childhood and youth.  The exposition is based on the monographic principle, which fully and vividly represents the life and work of the singer. </p><h2>  Drama theatre </h2><p>  The city of Yaroslavl is proud of the very first Russian theater.  <span>The Volkovsky Theater</span> in 2010 celebrated its anniversary (260 years).  Then on the site of today's theater was a leather barn. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslavl Kremlin map" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/692406.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It was here that the merchant son <span>Fedor Volkov</span> began to stage the first performances.  The first play was Esther.  The history of the theater holds many bright events.  At the end of the 18th century, the theater was already known in Russia. </p><p>  In 1911, the construction of the Volkovsky Theater was completed.  Its author and construction manager was the architect Nikolai Spirin.  Today, this building houses one of the best Russian theaters. </p><h2>  Chamber theater </h2><p>  At the address st.  Sverdlov, house 9 is the <span>Yaroslavl Chamber Theater,</span> which successfully operates under the direction of V. Vorontsov.  Today it is the only theater in Russia with a permanent composition.  Theater performances are held on their own stage, in addition, theater festivals are held here with the participation of popular actors of the country. </p><p>  The creation of such a theater was first thought by Yuri Vaksman, who had previously worked in the <span>Yaroslavl Youth Theater.</span>  He decided to create his own theater.  To realize his dreams, he worked in the restaurant business for several years.  Having accumulated initial capital, in 1999 he realized his dream.  Vladimir Gusev was invited to the post of chief director, who triumphantly staged Peter Suet's play ‚ÄúInterview‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslavl today" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/692407.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The most important area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe theater is the holding of theater festivals at various levels.  During its activities, four major international theater festivals were organized. </p><p>  The theater is famous for its charity work aimed at helping veterans of the Second World War, people with disabilities in Afghanistan and their families. </p><h2>  Yaroslavl Kremlin </h2><p>  The history of the Yaroslavl Kremlin began in 1010 near Rostov the Great.  <span>Yaroslav the Wise</span> ordered to build a fortified city to ensure the safety of the city. </p><p>  Geographically, the Yaroslavl Kremlin (a map clearly demonstrates this) is located on a strategically important territory.  It has the shape of a triangle. </p><p>  The Kremlin has another name - Chopped City.  This is due to the fact that its fortifications were cut down from wood.  According to the mural dating back to 1648, it can be seen that the fortifications cut down from wood included 2 passing towers, 10 deaf and 12 clears.  <span>The Kremlin walls</span> were protected by the governor‚Äôs house, the city cathedral and the bishops‚Äôs chambers. </p><p>  In 1658, a fire virtually destroyed all buildings.  I had to start building stone fortifications of the Yaroslavl Kremlin.  From the side of Kotorosl, a stone tower was built, which was called Zeleina.  It was used as a repository of gunpowder. </p><p>  From the Volga side there was another attraction of the Yaroslavl Kremlin - Podvolzhskaya tower.  Much later, it was rebuilt into an arsenal; it was preserved in excellent condition to this day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of Yaroslavl" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/692408.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Six temples were built on the territory of the Yaroslavl Kremlin: </p><ul><li>  Assumption Cathedral (1215) a brick structure with white stone details.  The cathedral was the spiritual and architectural center of the city for many centuries. </li><li>  Ilyinsko-Tikhonovskaya church - in Soviet times, the building was equipped as a museum  Lenin, and later organized in it workshops of restorers. </li><li>  The Church of St. Nicholas in its outward appearance reflected the financial difficulties of the parishioners who invested in construction.  Today, there is a department in this building. </li><li>  Leontief Church - was built as the bishop's house church.  It was consecrated in honor of Leonty of Rostov. </li><li>  Church of Our Lady of Shuya - was rebuilt in stone in 1690.  She was crowned with five helmet-shaped heads.  It has not survived to our time. </li><li>  Church of Our Lady of Tolga.  It was a parish church until 1802, and was later demolished. </li></ul>
