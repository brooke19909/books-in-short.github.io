  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reforms of Solon</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Athenian society in the VI century BC.  e.  underwent a number of changes.  This time was called the "great period of Athens" and was characterized by an increase in the part of the population that was engaged in trade and craft.  This new type of people, different from the aristocracy of that time, was called the demos, which means ‚Äúpeople‚Äù.  Demos was at enmity with the aristocratic strata of society, trying to come to power, which was necessary to combat the plight.  A huge role in this was played by the reforms of Solon, the results of which were equated with the political revolution. </p><p>  Solon was one of the seven wise men of Greece.  He was a famous reformer who changed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe political life of Athens.  The democracy established with his participation enabled society to become more developed.  What preceded this?  Historians describe this period of time as follows.  The position of the economy in Attica worsened over the course of a century, and the discriminatory policies of the authorities towards ordinary people forced people to live in poverty and eke out a poor existence.  The peasants constantly lived in debt, not knowing where to find the means in order to provide for their families.  They were placed in conditions under which there was no way out.  Poor residents had to mortgage their land, sell their children into slavery, and even mortgage themselves.  This all led to protests in society and social upheaval.  Any questions of a simple person asked to the owners were ignored.  The conflict between rich and poor has worsened.  Dissatisfied were not only poor residents, but also a little wealthy and not very <span>noble people.</span>  Ahead of society waiting for the reform of Solon. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The last point of patience of the people was the defeat in the war with the Megars for the right to own the island of Salamis.  It happened in the 7th century.  An interesting fact is that after that in Athens it was forbidden to mention the name of the island.  But there are always people who violate the prohibitions.  It was Solon, who became the mediator between the demos and the aristocracy.  Both respected him.  He wrote poems that were differently perceived by people.  Reading them in the square, he appealed to the consciousness of the Athenians, urged them to wage war with the Megars.  Fearing the fiercest punishment, he spread the rumors about his madness.  He later led the army and navy and launched a second war with the Megars.  This time Athens came out victorious.  This brought him popularity, he became an intermediary in solving social issues.  Then came the reforms of Solon.  What did they consist of? </p><p>  First, he canceled all debts.  This was the first reform of Solon - sisakhphia.  The peasants were able to return their land.  In addition, freedom of will was introduced.  This undermined the main role of the clan nobility.  The main purpose of the sage was democracy in Athens.  His role in <span>social progress has</span> been recognized and appreciated. </p><p>  The next reform of the Salon concerned <span>monetary circulation</span> in the country; it helped provide bread for the poor.  Big changes have also taken place in politics and social structure, the census of the population and accounting of incomes of citizens of the country have begun.  The Areopagus became the highest organ in the country, and pentacosiomedimus became part of it.  Solon's reforms also affected the <span>jury.</span>  <span>The court</span> now became available to all, which indicated the democratization of Athens.  The significance of the activities of the Athenian sage is great.  Of course, not everything Solon did satisfied all categories of people in Athenian society, but what he <span>put into practice</span> can be compared with the political revolution, it changed the political system.  Through the efforts of such figures, the <span>wheel of history</span> spins faster. </p>
