In particular, it passes through the Zaporizhzhya and Dnipropetrovsk regions.  Service extends to parts of Kherson and Kharkov territories.  Until March 2014, this railway structure performed the tasks of transporting passengers and goods across the Crimea and Sevastopol.  Head of the Dnieper Railway - A. S. Boretsky, Ch.  engineer - A. G. Lashko, first deputy.  Chief - O. V.

    <h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  The structure began its existence back in 1873, on November 15.  It was on this day that the first passenger train arrived at the station Nizhnedneprovsk (formerly Yekaterinoslav).  The starting point was Sinelnikovo.  This first train consisted of two wagons.  Over time, due to increased volumes of coal mining in the Donbass, the development of the iron ore basins of Kryvyi Rih, and also thanks to the activity of M.O. Pol (a well-known public figure), it was decided to continue the construction of railway lines with state funds. </p><h2>  Development during the war years </h2><p>  During the Second World War, the Dnieper Railway was almost completely destroyed.  During the hostilities and during the liberation of the territories of Russia from the invaders, station workers carried out transportation services, provided the front, as well as reconstructed works on the tracks and repaired <span>rolling stock.</span>  Thousands of railway workers took part in military operations, a huge number of them led underground activities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Head of the Dnieper Railway" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/466513.jpg" width="556"></div>

The Dnieper Railway was no exception.  It was not only restored, but also reconstructed.  Not only new stations of the Dnieper Railway were rebuilt, but station buildings were also updated, and new ones were built in some areas.  Large bridges and other various artificial structures were erected.  At the same time, the meridional main direction from Art.  Lozova to Zaporozhye.  Electrification was carried out in all major latitudinal directions and suburban areas.  A little more than 30% of the cargo turnover, therefore, remained behind the locomotive draft.  The rest of the volume of these operations is performed by electric.  About 85% of the road was equipped with automatic interlocks.  More than 95% of the sites are equipped with centralization of signals and arrows of the electric type.  In addition to the main ones, new sorting stations were built.  These facilities are equipped with modern technical complexes of automation and mechanization.  High-performance units are used to carry out repair work on the tracks and maintain the canvas in proper condition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stations of the Dnieper railway" class="if" height="199" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/466514.jpg" width="600"></div>

Of all this amount, over 58% are electrified.  More than 83% of the tracks are equipped with automatic adjustment systems.  The structure includes four transportation directorates.  Transport activities are carried out by 244 stations, 19 of which are precinct, 67 are freight, 7 are passenger and 4 are sorting.  The rail track connects the Kryvyi Rih iron ore basin and the Donbass due to the presence of two latitudinal lines: Pyatikhatki - Verkhovtsevo - Dnepropetrovsk - Sinelnikovo - Chaplino and Timkovo - Krivoy Rog - Apostolovo - Zaporozhye - Kamysh - Zarya.  The Dnieper Railway provides services to such large industrial centers as Dneprodzerzhinsk, Nikopol, Pavlograd, Novomoskovsk and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dnieper railway official site" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/466515.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Cargo turnover </h2><p>  According to reports and statistics, the activities carried out by the Dnieper Railway are characterized by a large proportion of the reception and dispatch of goods.  However, it should be noted that the turnover of the structure is relatively low in general.  This is due to the relatively short range of transportation.  Manganese and <span>iron ore,</span> coke, <span>coal, and</span> ferrous metal are mainly transported.  Machines, industrial goods and equipment, building materials, grain, fluxes often act as cargo. </p><h2>  Passenger Transportation </h2><p>  Until recently, a large number of trains transported citizens from Russia to Ukraine.  Very well developed suburban service.  It accounts for more than 85% of all passenger traffic.  However, due to the insignificant range, part of the suburban traffic is only a quarter of the total passenger turnover. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="management of the Dnieper railway" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/466516.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Reform </h2><p>  To date, all units of the structure are involved in the implementation of industry and government programs for the development of the transport network.  The activity is primarily aimed at enhancing security and improving the reliability of transportation, improving volumetric and quality indicators.  Relatively recently, the administration of the Dnieper Railway was undergoing reform.  So, the Crimean, Zaporizhzhya and Krivorozhsky sections were reorganized in the Directorate of railway transportation. </p><h2>  Using modern technology </h2><p>  Of particular importance in the informatization of the structure is the Internet connection.  The Dnieper Railway, the official website of which is dp.uz.gov.ua, uses the latest achievements in the field of communications and world experience in solving many issues.  In addition, the presence of the structure on the Internet allows you to more closely and quickly interact with customers.  On the pages of the site you can find all the necessary information on the services provided by the organization. </p>
