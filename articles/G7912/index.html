    <p>  Hotel La Casa Siolim 3 (North Goa, Siolim) is located at a fairly remote distance from the beach - the third coastline.  The Chapora River flows within walking distance.  Therefore, renting a car, motorcycle or scooter is relevant.  This will allow you to move independently and not depend on travel companies and routes.  A great way to explore the country and region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2>

    <h2>  Hotel Food System </h2><p>  Choosing for your trip or vacation the distinctive and vibrant India in general and the Hotel La Casa Siolim 3 * (reviews and photos of tourists hereinafter) in particular, it is worth remembering some of the features of the country and leisure in it.  This is not Turkey close to Europe, which will offer all-inclusive system services for a modest budget.  Here you can live on a very modest amount in terms of Russian rubles, while eating exotic fruits, fresh seafood and fish.  However, it should be borne in mind that the concept of good service is somewhat different. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When staying at the La Casa Siolim 3 * hotel, you can choose a fare without meals or including buffet breakfast.  A small restaurant is located on site.  The menu includes dishes not only of traditional Indian cuisine, but also European.  During the day, you can enjoy light snacks and cold drinks at the bar. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2>

    <p>  The hotel, as already mentioned, belongs to the category of "bed and breakfast", so it is logical that it does not offer its guests an abundance of a variety of services, including entertainment.  One of the advantages of the hotel is the pool with sunbeds located around it.  For children there is a special small compartment with less depth.  Hotel La Casa Siolim 3 * (India) has a well-groomed green area.  Walking and outdoor recreation are guaranteed.  There are umbrellas and tables with benches, so you can arrange an impromptu breakfast or dinner in the open. </p><p>  Additionally (for a fee) you can use the services of a massage therapist and a tour desk located on site, laundry and dry cleaning. </p><h2>  Hotel accommodation </h2><p>  In countries with a hot climate, where the tourist flow does not subside almost throughout the year, as a rule, there is a division into several seasons.  For example, low, medium and high.  Specific dates depend on several factors.  In particular, the rainy season (if any) is of importance, when movement and travel around the country becomes difficult, as well as the proximity of major holidays (Christmas, New Year, Valentine's Day).  Hotel La Casa Siolim 3 * (India) is no exception.  The prices for living in it largely depend on the time of year.  Therefore, before planning a trip, be sure to take a look at the rates. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Arrivals and registration of newly arrived guests are carried out from two in the afternoon, and departure before noon.  Upon individual request, the time can be changed to an earlier or later.  As a rule, the administration easily goes to a meeting. </p><h2>  Hotel Cancellation Policy </h2><p>  If you have finally planned your trip to India and chose La Casa Siolim 3 * in Siolim as your place of residence, be sure to read the rules of accommodation.  We recommend that you always leave room for maneuver and choose the conditions under which cancellation of a room reservation will be free at least 5-6 days before check-in.  In this hotel, the rules are such that pre-paid cash will be returned to you in 100% only if the refusal occurred at least seven days before the expected date of arrival.  Refunds will only be made at 50% if you change your mind between the week and 48 hours before arrival.  Well, at the last moment (within two days) nothing can be canceled, the hotel reserves the right to the deposited cash amount. </p><h2>  What audience is the hotel focused on? </h2><p>  The budget hotel La Casa Siolim 3 * (India) is primarily aimed at tourists with limited financial resources.  These are those people who do not sit still, and they only need housing in order to spend the night.  Do not count on first-class service and entertainment here. </p><p>  The hotel is suitable for independent travelers, couples, groups of friends, to a lesser extent families with children, especially younger children.  You should take into account the remoteness of housing from the beaches and calculate your strength and your companions.  The national composition of vacationers is quite mixed, quite a lot of Indians from neighboring regions. </p><h2>  Beaches near Siolim </h2>

    <p>  It is important for tourists to know that the maximum distance from the town of Siolim, and therefore from the Hotel La Casa Siolim 3 * to all the beaches of North Goa, is fifteen kilometers.  The route is easy to overcome, especially if there is a car, scooter or even a simple bicycle at the disposal.  The closest to the urban settlement are the beaches of Morjim (4 km), Anjuna (6 km), Tivim (14 km).  Great places to relax, everyone will find exactly what they want for themselves - peace and solitude or bright and noisy parties. </p><p>  <span>Morjim Beach</span> is a three-kilometer sandy coast.  It is full of restaurants with light awnings made of palm branches, it burns with its bright sun and pleases with the warm sea, and at night it plunges into the atmosphere of absolutely stunning parties, indescribable in energy.  Morjim is perfect for outdoor enthusiasts. Kite surfing and windsurfing are popular on its territory. </p><p>  Anjuna is a small village with its own beach.  It is perfect for daytime relaxation and noisy evenings in the company of friends.  It seems that the atmosphere of the holiday reigns here twenty-four hours a day and three hundred sixty-five days a year.  On Wednesdays, a large market is organized on the beach, the assortment of which is beyond description.  Tourists will find here everything from local crafts to delicious and fresh food. </p><p>  When planning a vacation, you need to study the place where you are going from various positions: climate, service, prices, housing, traditions, etc.  You need to pay attention to what the hotel has among the tourist environment (in particular La Casa Siolim 3 *) reviews.  Goa is a specific region.  They go to India for vivid impressions in order to get acquainted with the local culture and traditions, spiritual practices.  Therefore, as a rule, the level of comfort of housing is not highlighted. </p><h2>  Hotel La Casa Siolim 3 *: location reviews </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the hotel is one of the most budget accommodation options in North Goa.  He cannot boast of proximity to the beaches.  Tourists in their reviews emphasize this fact, and from a different point of view.  Someone was misled by travel agents, others themselves chose this hotel.  This leads to a polarity of opinion.  On the one hand, according to the guests, you get a quiet and secluded place with a decent level of service, a good combination of price and quality, on the other hand, with a considerable distance from the sea.  However, the problem disappears if you rent a scooter, motorcycle, bike or car. </p><h2>  La Casa Siolim 3 service reviews </h2>

    <p>  The hotel received mixed reviews from the guests.  It should be said in advance that the assessment of the relationship between the administration and staff is often extremely subjective, therefore it is worth treating them as an opinion, and not as a 100% true axiom. </p><p>  Hotel guests for the most part speak of an average level of quality of service.  First of all, complaints are addressed to personnel who are not always ready to understand and explain, and besides, not everyone speaks English.  Secondly, the quality of cleaning the rooms is called into question, since it is not carried out regularly.  Thirdly, according to some tourists, the restaurant turned out to be a mid-level cafe.  After paying half board or full board on the spot, it turned out that such a service could not be provided at all.  However, in this case, the fault of the travel agency is in the face, as the hotel does not hide the information that only breakfast is possible.  In addition, guests did not like the fact that wireless internet was available only in the lobby, and was not available in the rooms. </p>

    <p>  But the hotel guests speak very favorably of the owners as a very friendly and pleasant married couple. </p><h2>  What to see in Siolim? </h2><p>  The village is rather modest in size and level of development of tourist infrastructure, so locals often call it a village.  However, the proximity of the river and the sea makes it almost the center of fishing in the region.  For the traveler, there is everything you need: cafes, ATMs, hotels, a market and souvenir shops.  Every year Siolim attracts an increasing number of tourists, so there is hope that the service will gradually develop and improve. </p>

    <p>  Despite its size, the city has three interesting sights.  Two of them are historical and architectural in nature - this is the Church of St. Anthony and the Temple of Sater.  The third is rather entertaining and gastronomic.  Every day, an impromptu market opens on the descent from the Chapora River Bridge.  He works with a break, first for two hours in the morning (from 8:00), and then from five in the evening until midnight.  A large market is replete with freshly caught fish and seafood.  For a very low price, right before your eyes, you will not only be cleaned, but also prepared. </p>
