    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  This city was previously of great importance for the development of Ancient Russia.  Everyone who has visited this place knows that already in the middle of the VIII century a settlement was formed here.  Ladoga was considered a fortified hub on major trade routes.  Also, this place is the first capital of Russia.  It was here that Rurik arrived to reign before heading to Novgorod.  Currently, Staraya Ladoga, is a village, which is located one hundred and forty kilometers from St. Petersburg.  Modern life in the village is different from what it was in former times.  Now it is associated with measured and calm.  What attracts tourists to Staraya Ladoga?  Attractions here are represented in a fairly large number.  These are mainly monuments of ancient architecture.  Among them, the Staraya Ladoga fortress on the Volkhov River stands out especially.  Its architecture, dating from the 16th century, has been preserved in this form to this day.  Great popularity among tourists enjoy the St. Nicholas male and Assumption convents of Staraya Ladoga.  It is believed that the latter was imprisoned by <span>Evdokia Lopukhin,</span> who was the first wife of Peter I. You can also visit the Church of Ion the Baptist and the mound-grave of Prophetic Oleg.  There are two popular museums in Staraya Ladoga: local life and the archaeological.  It is unlikely that an inquisitive traveler will be able to leave these attractions unattended. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Brief historical background </h2><p>  Ship repair and production workshops of the Earth fort are the oldest known buildings.  They were erected from logs.  According to dendrochronological data, the wood used for the construction was cut down in the middle of the 8th century.  It is assumed that immigrants from Northern Europe worked on their construction.  On this territory, many archaeological excavations were carried out.  According to the data received, the first Ladoga settlement was founded and settled by the Scandinavians.  At the same time, E. A. Ryabinin believes that they were Gotlanders.  Last year, <span>archaeological excavations</span> were again carried out on the territory of Staraya Ladoga <span>.</span>  In the course of them, a ridge was discovered that dates back to the Merovingian era.  This is supposedly the 7th century AD. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="old ladoga sights photo" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/467234.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Further development </h2><p>  The first settlement included several buildings.  Pillar structures had analogues in Northern Europe.  They were located about two kilometers south of the <span>Lyubshan fortress.</span>  At that time, this region became a kind of center of intersection of the interests of the ancient Germans and Slavs, as well as local Finno-Baltic states.  Subsequently, the Ilmen Slovenes destroyed the Ladoga settlement.  Later, this territory was built up with structures that had a log structure.  The people who became the first inhabitants of Ladoga, and those who settled here later, had completely different cultural traditions.  There was no continuity between them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The construction of the first fortress </h2><p>  Ladoga developed as a trade and craft settlement.  In the IX century, during the internecine wars, it was once again destroyed.  Only a decade later, the first fortress was built here.  Its design was similar to neighboring Lyubshanskaya.  Ladoga from a small trade and craft settlement turned into a typical city of Ancient Russia.  Its total area was about twelve hectares. </p><h2>  Value </h2><p>  For a major trade route, the city was one of the important points.  At the next excavations conducted on the territory of Staraya Ladoga, a birch bark scroll was found.  On it was depicted the image of a boat.  The <span>Novgorod Chronicle</span> mentions that there is the grave of Prophetic Oleg.  At the same time, the Kiev version is very different from this.  She suggests that the burial is located on Mount Szczekowice.  At the very end of the 10th century, Ladoga was attacked by the Varangian Eirik.  Later he became a Norwegian ruler.  The very first fortress stood in Ladoga for more than a century.  She was destroyed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="monasteries of the old ladoga" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/467236.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Old Ladoga Fortress </h2><p>  It was founded in 1116.  The order to create a stone fortress was given by Posadnik Pavel.  Currently, this place has become the "heart" of Staraya Ladoga.  The ancient building is located on the site where the Elena River flows into the Volkhov.  The Old Ladoga fortification was of strategic importance during the period of <span>Novgorod Rus.</span>  This place was considered the only possible harbor for the haven of sea vessels that were not able to overcome the thresholds of Volkhov.  The first local fortification was built during the time of the Prophetic Oleg.  Currently, the Staroladozh fortress is open to the public. </p><h2>  Rename </h2><p>  At the beginning of the XVIII century, Peter the Great was founded by <span>New Ladoga,</span> which was located at the mouth of the Volkhov.  The former settlement lost its urban status and the right to use its own coat of arms.  The place was given a new name - "Old Ladoga".  Excursions to the settlement, which are held today, will not leave indifferent any lover of ancient Russian history.  The estate "Assumption" was considered the local cultural center.  She was very close to the settlement.  Many famous people spent time here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="old ladoga fortress" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/467237.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Modern realities </h2><p>  In 2003, <span>Staraya Ladoga,</span> whose sights do not lose their relevance to this day, celebrated its anniversary.  At that time, the settlement existed for 1250 years.  This event attracted the attention of the press and authorities.  The President gave special instructions to prepare for the celebration of the anniversary.  Vladimir Putin visited the village twice.  Today, one-day excursion routes are organized in Staraya Ladoga.  During them you can get acquainted with the history of the village, the main events that took place here.  The cost of the trip is 1090 rubles. </p><h2>  Museum "Old Ladoga" </h2><p>  In the 70s.  restoration work was going on here.  They were led by A.E. Ekk.  Soon, updated expositions were opened.  Also, the first visitors were able to look at the exhibits of the museum of local lore.  Later, excavations began on the territory of the ancient structure.  They were carried out by an archaeological expedition, the leadership of which was A. N. Kirpichnikov.  In the year 84, the museum received the status of a historical and architectural reserve of federal significance. </p><h2>  Reconstruction </h2><p>  The gate and Klimentovskaya towers were restored in the Soviet period.  It remains to reconstruct three more.  A few years ago, the restoration of the switch tower began.  The concept of its reconstruction is as follows: it is required to ensure that the superstructure protects the masonry from further destruction.  It is assumed that the new tower will turn into a kind of conservation hood for the surviving historical structure.  Currently, reconstruction works are ongoing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="old ladoga museum" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/467238.jpg" width="550"></div>
