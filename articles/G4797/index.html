    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Grand Hotel Palace, located in Thessaloniki, is a conference hotel, it is possible to brighten up your leisure time quite well. </p><p>  The first thing that deserves attention is a wellness fitness center with an indoor heated pool, constantly cleansed with ozone.  On its territory there is an excellent gym, sauna and steam room. </p><p>  There is also a spa, where guests are offered a wide range of different types of massage and treatments that harmoniously combine therapeutic techniques and the secrets of modern cosmetology.  Naturally, masters use only natural products. </p><h2>  Wedding organization </h2><p>  This is another activity of the Grand Hotel Palace.

In any of the banquet rooms can accommodate up to 1,000 people, so even a wedding with a grand scale will be held with a bang. </p><p>  The chef will develop a special creative menu taking into account the wishes of future newlyweds, and the master pastry chef will bake a luxurious designer cake.  The hall and the venue will be decorated with stunning floral arrangements.  However, everything else will also fall on the shoulders of the organizers - starting with the installation of lighting, ending with the selection of music. </p><p>  When ordering a wedding package of services, the newlyweds receive: </p><ul><li>  Accommodation in a bridal suite with late check-out. </li><li>  VIP reception - a greeting in the form of champagne, a basket of fruits, honey and nuts. </li><li>  "Honeymooners breakfast" right in the room. </li><li>  Wedding cake and champagne. </li><li>  Tasting dishes to design a festive menu. </li><li>  Photo / video shooting. </li></ul><p>  This, of course, is only a small part of the standard package.

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Now you can pay attention to reviews of Grand Hotel Palace.  So, here are the nuances that travelers who have been here tell about: </p><ul><li>  Fitness Centre.  This is not just a small room with several exercise machines, as is the case with some other hotels.  In the Grand Hotel Palace 5 * there is really a good and modern professional gym, ideally suited for conducting full-fledged workouts. </li><li>  Transfer.  A free shuttle bus runs to the city center from the hotel. </li><li>  The rooms.  Clean, comfortable, comfortable.  With excellent bathrooms - without dampness and mold, with new plumbing.  White underwear, soft.  They are cleaned daily (with the replacement of linen and towels), but the maids themselves work quietly, without interfering with the guests' relaxation - they come in their absence. </li><li>  Service.  At the highest, truly 5-star level.  Everything, from administrators to waiters in the restaurant, are friendly and friendly to guests. </li><li>  Silence.  The hotel is very calm - there are no noisy youth companies and vacationers with children.  Which, however, is due to the concept.  It mainly stops business people or lovers of exploring the sights who want to spend the night for several days in a comfortable place. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand hotel palace terracina" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2075770.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Grand Palace in Thailand </h2><p>  It will be useful to get distracted and pay attention to a hotel of the same chain located in Pattaya.  And this is the Grand Jomtien Palace Hotel.  Three star, really. </p><p>  It is located a minute walk from the sandy beach.  On its territory there is a large spa, an open-air bath, several pools, a sauna, a gym, as well as a coffee shop and restaurant. </p><p>  Compared to the Greek complex, the Grand Jomtien Palace Hotel in Pattaya offers extremely low prices for accommodation.  In addition, there are discounts!  In winter, a week in an improved double room for two people costs only 17-18 tons!  And in a junior suite - less than 40 tons.  True, at the height of the holiday season, prices rise, but this phenomenon is found in resorts everywhere. </p><h2>  Grand Palace in Italy </h2><p>  This complex is also worth mentioning.  Located in a place called Terracina, Grand Hotel Palace is a 4-star hotel, located just a couple of tens of meters from the sandy beach.  Moreover, in about 5 minutes you can walk to the ruins of the ancient Roman temple of Jupiter of Anxur, a famous attraction.  The location is really advantageous.  After all, in 10 minutes you can walk to the port from where the boats depart to the Pontic Islands. </p><p>  The rooms are simple but comfortable.  For two people a week of living will cost about 50,000 p.  This price includes breakfast and 10 percent VAT, but you will also have to pay city tax. </p><p>  Special attention would be noted hotel staff.  The complex employs professionals who speak not only Italian and English, but also Portuguese, French, Spanish, Greek, German, and Russian. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel in Taormina </h2><p>  In fact, we can talk about the complexes of the Grand network for a very long time.  But finally, it is worth noting the attention of another Italian hotel.  And this is the Grand Hotel Mazzaro Sea Palace 5 "stars". </p><p>  Located in the city of Taormina, right on the beautiful beach of Lido di Spizone.  There is an atmosphere of luxury, but the prices are appropriate.  A week in a suite with a private pool for two guests will cost 200,000 p.  A day in the standard is also not cheap - about 13-14 thousand rubles.  Although even in apartments of this category there is a ‚Äúfive-star‚Äù atmosphere. </p><p>  But the hotel has everything - a Welness center, a water sports club, a stable, and champagne and caviar are served for breakfast.  So if you want to arrange an unforgettable vacation in premium Italy, you can safely go to the Baia Taormina Grand Palace Hotel. </p>
