From them you can weave anything you want: from earrings to swimwear and dresses.  Many rubber bands of different colors, aromas, shapes are known, there are even luminous ones.  Therefore, from this variety you can choose the material you like and make a stylish little thing out of it.  This will be a caterpillar bracelet made of rubber bands, the production technology of which will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Caterpillar Bracelet </h2><p>  The method of <span>weaving bracelets</span> from elastic bands will allow needlewomen to develop their own style.  In addition, elastic bands are inexpensive, and things made from them are not inferior in quality to modern jewelry, sometimes expensive. </p><p>  Making things out of gum, each craftswoman will weave such an ornament that suits her.  The color scheme can be selected for any specific outfits, which will make the image more complete. </p><p>  The collection of bracelets made of elastic bands includes such types as ‚ÄúWave‚Äù, ‚ÄúBay leaf‚Äù, ‚ÄúBow‚Äù, ‚ÄúFrench braid‚Äù and many others.  Of particular note is the Caterpillar bracelet.  He stands out among the rest in that the work is quite simple and at the same time beautiful and delicate. </p>

    <h2>  What do you need </h2><p>  To weave a caterpillar gum bracelet, you need the following materials. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Elastic bands for weaving of different colors. </li><li>  Hook for weaving. </li><li>  Machine or slingshot. </li><li>  Plastic clasp. </li></ul><p>  Before you begin, you need to study the diagram, carefully read the instructions on <span>how to weave a bracelet made of rubber</span> "Caterpillar".  If you have experience weaving from gum, then the work will be simple to perform. </p><p>  A few words about the pattern by which the bracelet is made of rubber bands "Caterpillar".  First you need to work out the algorithm for performing weaves.  It‚Äôs better to train on elastic bands of contrasting colors so that it is better to see weaving. </p><p>  We must learn to quickly and efficiently perform eight out of a rubber band.  You also need to work out the removal of the gum from the column with a hook.  Moreover, there are two options for removing the elastic: on the machine, it is thrown over to the side, and on the slingshot there are internal weaves.  We must learn to distinguish them from each other and use where necessary. </p><p>  These are simple ways to weave.  Having learned how to weave such bracelets well, you can tackle more complex techniques that will help to reveal creative potential and bring pleasure from work. </p><p>  Now you need to be patient and attentive and you can begin to do the work. </p><h2>  Weaving on the machine </h2><p>  Fun and elegant bracelets made of rubber.  The "caterpillar" on the machine is simple. </p><p>  On the machine, remove the middle bar of the columns, leaving only the extreme.  For weaving, we take two <span>contrasting colors,</span> for example, blue and red.  In the first row of blue elastic bands we make two eights on columns from corner to corner.  This will be the only eight in the weave. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Above them is again a blue color.  Now crochet the lower blue elastic bands in the middle.  Put on the elastic again and remove the lower ones in the center.  Thus, alternating red and blue loops, weave a strip of the desired length.  To complete the weaving, you need to remove the center of the gum, leaving only one at a time.  Then from each column we throw everything one by one, pick up all four elastic bands, put on a finger, stretch and insert the hook.  We put the other end of the hook on the first two loops.

    <p>  The machine also weaves more voluminous bracelets.  But we must remember that there are quite complex schemes that you can start with, having thoroughly trained. </p><h2>  Slingshot weaving </h2><p>  Bracelet "Caterpillar" of rubber bands on a slingshot is as follows.  On a slingshot we put on eight rubber bands.  Then remove the lower one to the center and put a clip on it.  Now again we put on the rubber band with the eight and remove the last in the center.  Repeat row by row until the desired length and close with the second end of the clip. </p>

    <p>  Color performance can be different: monophonic, multi-colored without any strict pattern or alternating contrasting colors. </p><h2>  Forks </h2><p>  Another way to weave a caterpillar bracelet is to weave on forks.  For him, you need to take rubber bands of three colors, preferably contrasting, so that the weaving is visible well. </p><p>  Gently fasten the forks with adhesive tape, prepare 20 pink and orange elastic bands, 10 yellow ones (you can take colors as desired), and you will also need a hook for weaving. </p><p>  We put the first yellow elastic on the eight extreme two teeth of both forks.  An orange gum follows it, fold it in half, put it on two teeth of one fork and thread the yellow end under it, throwing it onto another fork.  Twist the pink in half, put on the yellow one, thread the last one and throw it on the orange.  Raise the orange gum above yellow, as usual. </p><p>  Again we take the orange, turn it on, put it on the yellow one, which we take out and throw it on the pink one, remove the last one in the center.  Etc. </p>

    <p>  External colors - orange and pink, weave them in two elastic bands, then divide the central yellow by eight into both forks, put on another yellow one, remove the lower one in the center.  Throw one end of the yellow gum to the other side. </p><p>  Performing repeating blocks in this way, weave to the desired length.  At the end, we divide the yellow gum evenly, throw off the orange and pink in the center.  The edges of the yellow rubber bands are removed on one tooth of the fork and then connected with a clip to the other end of the bracelet. </p><h2>  Fingers weaving </h2><p>  Consider another option, how to weave a bracelet made of rubber "Caterpillar".  The technology is the same as when working with a slingshot.  The columns in this method will serve us fingers, but otherwise weaving will be similar.  You can also do without a hook, but a clip for connecting both ends of the bracelet is still useful.  You can make a multi-colored bracelet, as shown in the figure, or you can weave a pattern, for example, strips of different colors, evenly replacing each other. </p>

    <h2>  Nails weaving </h2><p>  To make a caterpillar bracelet in this way, you must first prepare an impromptu machine.  It is performed as follows.  Take a small board, sand it with sandpaper, hammer two small cloves with a hammer, at a distance of 3 cm from each other.  This device will simulate a slingshot for weaving from gum. </p><p>  And then the work is similar to weaving bracelets from rubber bands "Caterpillar". </p>

    <h2>  Pinnacle of excellence </h2><p>  Each needlewoman wants to make such a thing that will not only differ from others, but will also become an example of her style.  In this case, not only elastic bands are used for weaving, sometimes some other materials for crafts are added to them: ribbons, beads, pebbles, beads, ready-made flowers, etc. Such "zest" will give the woven thing exclusivity, an individual author's style. </p><p>  When the usual weaving, which can be made by everyone, has such details, the product becomes unique: no one else has such an accessory. </p><p>  Thus, the classic pattern, which is used to make a bracelet made of "Caterpillar" gum, can become a pattern of an exclusive model.  Such a thing can be used in your own wardrobe as jewelry, or presented to someone as an original gift. </p>
