At the same time, you can stay at the resort in a cheap hotel or in a luxurious five-star hotel.  Among the fashionable options, Taj Exotica Goa 5 * is popular, which not only offers quality service, but also has an excellent location.  We will tell about the hotel itself, its infrastructure and number of rooms in this article.  And also consider the main advantages and disadvantages that tourists who have already rested in this resort complex highlight in their reviews. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  When choosing a hotel for relaxation, it is important to pay attention not only to the state of the number of rooms, the proposed entertainment and services, but also to its location.  As a rule, five-star complexes are located close to the sea and to infrastructure facilities.  The Taj Exotic Goa Hotel in India was no exception.  It is built on the first line of the sea, almost on the coast, and only a pedestrian road separates residential buildings from the beach.  The distance to it is about 200 meters, so you can reach the sea in about 2-3 minutes.  There are several restaurants near the hotel where you can dine for a moderate fee.  For guests with children, a playground is nearby. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="15.2445896" data-lng="73.92494970000007" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/4/2/9/4429.png"></div><p>  At the same time, this resort complex is located in a quiet area.  There are no nightclubs and youth bars nearby.  The large city of Margao is 12 km away from the hotel.  You can get to it both by taxi and by public transport.  Traditionally, airplanes from Russia arriving in Goa on vacation land at Dabolim <span>International Airport</span> .  It is 27 km away from here, so the journey to the hotel will take approximately 45 minutes.  If necessary, the complex provides its guests with a transfer from the airport to the hotel and back. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Basic information and placement rules </h2><p>  The luxurious Taj Exotica Goa is suitable, above all, for a relaxing and relaxing stay.  It is located on a vast territory of 56 acres (approximately 227 thousand square meters), most of which is occupied by a tropical park.  Tourists can stay in the main two-story building or in small separate bungalows.  In total, the hotel offers future guests 140 comfortable rooms, of which only 45 are in the main building.  It is known that the complex was built in 1999, but it cannot be called obsolete, since cosmetic repairs are regularly carried out here.  Its last update, for example, was made in 2016.  For the convenience of tourists from Russia who do not speak English, the hotel has Russian-speaking staff. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Territory view" class="if uuid-2543925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2543925.jpg"></div><p>  The complex offers its guests fairly loyal settlement rules.  For example, dogs of small breeds are allowed to come here, but their accommodation is paid separately.  In addition, you can only check in with them in a bungalow, while the room should be on the ground floor.  In addition, dogs are not allowed to appear in public.  Other animals are prohibited.  But the hotel welcomes tourists with young children with hospitality, offering guests under 12 years of age discounts on accommodation.  Check-in starts here from 15:00.  Upon registration, the administrator will require a valid passport and visa from foreign tourists.  A free airport shuttle is provided only to guests who have stayed at the hotel for more than two nights. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Rooms </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the rooms of the Taj Exotica Resort &amp; Spa (Goa) are located both in the main building and in separate bungalows.  Moreover, in the main building, as a rule, the most budget rooms are offered.  This is a spacious studio apartment consisting of a bedroom, a bathroom and a balcony.  The rooms on the ground floor are replaced by a fenced porch.  Guests are provided with two single beds and one rollaway bed, which is why only 3 adults can stay here.  The windows and balconies of these rooms overlook the garden or have side sea views.  The total area is 57 square meters.  m </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebookers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Room features" class="if uuid-2543967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2543967.jpg"></div><p>  But there are also luxury apartments in the main building, which are suitable for more demanding guests.  They have a large area, which is already 111 square meters.  m. The living room in these rooms is divided into three zones: bedroom, dining room and living room.  The bathroom is also equipped with a jacuzzi. </p><p>  Most of the rooms are located in one- and two-story bungalows, designed for 2-4 visiting families.  Such apartments practically do not differ from the option described above.  They also consist of a bedroom and a bathroom, have a French balcony.  Some of the rooms located on the ground floor also have access to their own outdoor pool.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment is 57 square meters.  m </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tbeds.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Room Interior" class="if uuid-2543963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2543963.jpg"></div><p>  Luxurious presidential villas are suitable for relaxing in the upper class.  These are separate buildings with three rooms, including a kitchen equipped with all necessary equipment.  Near the villa there is a small garden and a separate outdoor pool.  This apartment can accommodate up to 4 adults.  For families with small children, the hotel has Suite Deluxe rooms, which consist of two residential and one children's room. </p><h2>  What facilities are there in the rooms? </h2><p>  Rooms at the Taj Exotica Goa feature a sophisticated, modern interior, plenty of d√©cor and quality furniture.  But for a comfortable stay, they are also equipped with additional amenities.  For example, each hotel building is connected to a central cooling system, so even in hot weather guests can sleep peacefully in their living rooms.  There are also plasma TVs in the rooms, to which a set of satellite channels is connected, as well as a player for playing DVDs.  For a fee, you can connect wireless Internet and telephone.  The hotel provides a minibar for storing drinks for free, but it is not included in the price.

So, for example, guests at check-in are given not only towels, but also bathrobes and slippers.  There is a hairdryer, a <span>cosmetic mirror</span> and a set of bath accessories in the rooms, which includes toilet paper, shampoo, liquid soap and shower gel.  Some rooms have a private air conditioning in the bathroom. </p><p>  The hotel strictly adheres to the standards inherent in five-star hotels, so maids carefully clean their rooms and change towels every day.  Bed linen is changed at least three times a week.  Also, guests can use the phone to order food and drinks from the restaurant around the clock, but this service is provided for a fee. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel Taj Exotica Goa 5 * owns a huge territory, on which there are many infrastructure facilities.  But not all of their services are included in the price.  First, we list the main services available to guests: </p><ul><li>  car parking; </li><li>  24-hour reception, where luggage storage and currency exchange are located; </li><li>  lobby equipped with soft sofas and air conditioning for a comfortable stay; </li><li>  several shops, including bookstore, jewelry and souvenir. </li></ul><p>  Free of charge throughout the hotel you can connect to wireless Internet.

Only a pedestrian road separates it from the hotel.  There are no sun loungers and parasols on the beach, but all guests are given free towels.  There is a water entertainment center on the coast, where for a fee you can go windsurfing, parasailing, diving, as well as ride a banana, catamaran or water ski.  There are fenced massage pavilions on the beach. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vogue.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open pool" class="if uuid-2543954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2543954.jpg"></div><p>  Guests can enjoy a swim or sunbathe by the outdoor pool.  It is filled with fresh water, which is not additionally heated. </p><h2>  What other types of entertainment can this complex offer tourists? </h2><p>  However, the Taj Exotic Goa hotel offers its guests not only a beach holiday.  There is entertainment for both relaxing and active pastime.  But not all of them are free.  We list the most basic of them: </p><ul><li>  a spa offering paid entry to the jacuzzi and massage services; </li><li>  gym; </li><li>  mini-football field; </li><li>  playgrounds for playing table and classic tennis, mini-golf; </li><li>  billiard room; </li><li>  yoga lessons and archery; </li><li>  giant chess and board games; </li><li>  tour agency; </li><li>  tropical bird watching. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.amoma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Private pool" class="if uuid-2543978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2543978.jpg"></div><h2>  Conditions for placing with small children </h2><p>  The beach hotel "Taj Exotica Goa" is located in a picturesque and peaceful place, therefore it is often chosen for families with small children.  For such guests a cradle and a pot are provided in the room.  Tourists can get a free stroller for free.  But the amount of such equipment is limited, so it is better to inform about the need to obtain it in advance.  As expected, all restaurants are equipped with high chairs for feeding. </p><p>  But the choice of entertainment for kids is not too large.  For them, a shallow pool and a playground are built.  A mini club is open several hours a day.  Guests can also pay hourly babysitting services if desired. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the hotel Taj Exotic Goa </h2><p>  Most often, tourists respond positively about their vacation at this hotel, calling it a great place for a vacation on the sea.  They say that they will gladly return here again, and will also recommend it to their friends and acquaintances.  In their opinion, the hotel compares favorably with other Goa complexes with the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  qualified staff, who was always polite, friendly and at the same time tried to quickly solve the problems of the guests; </li><li>  a variety of breakfasts, which offer several types of cereals, as well as fresh fruits and vegetables; </li><li>  well-groomed and clean sandy beach, which is cleaned several times a day from garbage; </li><li>  upon arrival and departure, hotel staff give the girls a cut rose; </li><li>  the hotel is surrounded by greenery, so even in the heat it is fresh and cool here. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebookers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Living Room" class="if uuid-2543971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2543971.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews for "Taj Exotic Goa" </h2><p>  Nevertheless, there are no ideal hotels, therefore this complex has its drawbacks.  And although tourists most often call them insignificant and urge them not to pay attention to them, future guests still need to know about them.  Therefore, we list the main, according to guests, the disadvantages of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  on the territory of the complex there are a lot of crows that make noise and pollute the territory; </li><li>  a small and shallow pool, so tall people in it are uncomfortable to swim; </li><li>  the sea quite often storms, high waves rise, therefore it is not safe for children to swim there; </li><li>  there are few entertainments for kids in the hotel, so children often get bored at the hotel. </li></ul><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Thus, the Taj Exotic Goa hotel is a great place for a relaxing holiday.  The complex offers its guests high quality service, which is fully consistent with the cost of living.  The hotel is primarily suitable for discerning tourists who are looking for a place for a relaxing beach holiday. </p>
