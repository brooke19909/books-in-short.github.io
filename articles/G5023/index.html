Great gift for your beloved daughter</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every mother wants her beloved daughter to be the most-most: the most intelligent, healthy, beautiful and fashionable.  And if the mother knows how to handle knitting needles and yarn, then it will be easy for her to fulfill her wishes, because creating a knitted coat for the girl with knitting needles with a description of her will not be difficult.  The coat can be double-breasted with two rows of interesting buttons, it can be connected with a patchwork, plaits, patterns, ordinary elastic.  The main thing is that mother‚Äôs love will be stored in it. </p><h2>  You must know in advance that ... </h2><p>  In this article, we will try to figure out how to make a knitted coat for a girl with knitting needles according to the description.  Here we need to focus on the fact that the outer coat and cardigan (it is also worn by children) are very similar.  But different names suggest that there are still significant differences in these things.  Their patterns are really similar.  But the yarn for the coat is chosen much thicker, and the craftswomen knit with a more tight viscous.  In addition, a children's knitted coat should be made a little looser, because it will be worn on other clothes - a warm dress, a blouse or a sweater.  And in the depths of the armholes and neck you cannot make mistakes, because the child will then need to move in the coat, so it is necessary for the girl to be comfortable not only walking, but also raising her hands. </p>

    <p>  The yarn should be thick and dense, because the clothes are intended for autumn or spring. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a rule, mom can decide for herself whether to use insulation and lining.  Of course, such a coat will be much warmer, but it will turn out to be more bulky.  And the patterns used to create a children's coat should not be loose, but those that could hold their shape. </p><h2>  Children's coat is milky.  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  We will figure out what is needed in order to make a children's knitted coat, designed for a baby of three to four years. </p><p>  Will be needed: yarn in a mixed composition, where at least half is wool, 400 g (per hundred meters 240 g), knitting needles No. 5 and five buttons. </p><p>  Patterns that the knitter will use in the work on the product: </p><ul><li>  shawl smoothness - means that in all rows all the loops will be facial; </li><li>  braids - 1x1 and 2x2; </li><li>  a pearl pattern, or in a different way - a mess: in the first row of knitting, two front loops and two wrong ones should be alternated;  in the second row, as in the rest, knit two wrong ones over two front loops, and two facial ones over two wrong loops. </li></ul><h2>  We knit the front shelves for a milky coat </h2><p>  To make one front shelf, you need to dial 70 stitches on the knitting needles and knit a full width fabric using a pearl pattern.  The exception is only six extreme from the center of the loops.  They need to be knitted for the strap with a garter stitch, and the entire height of the detail. </p>

    <p>  After 25 cm is ready from the beginning of work, it is necessary to reduce the loops - every two, until there are 32 working loops.  When knitting the next row, four facial loops and two wrong loops must be alternated.  And then - from four faces to form a 2x2 pigtail, making a cross in every fourth row.  To form the armholes, after 30 cm from the beginning of knitting, reduce three loops once on the outer edge, once two loops, once one loop. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At a height of 15 cm (according to the diagram), in order to accurately make the neckline on the inner edge, close once six loops, once three, once two and once one loop. </p><p>  It is not very difficult to make a knitted coat for a girl with knitting needles according to the description, as it already becomes clear.  The second shelf must be tied out using the same pattern and the same verbal ‚Äúportrait‚Äù as for the first shelf, only in a mirror.  We must not forget that on one level of the shelf should make three holes for buttons.  The total height of the coquette should be 22 centimeters. </p><h2>  We knit the back of a children's coat of milk color </h2><p>  Knitted coat for girls with knitting needles with a description continue to do so.  On knitting needles we collect 125 loops and knit a pearl pattern.  When 25 centimeters are ready, after every two loops we reduce the loops for as many pieces as will be necessary to leave 64 pieces on the needles (twice as much as on each of the shelves). </p><p>  In the next row you need to alternate four facial with two wrong.  In the next rows, a 2x2 braid is made of four faces, and in every fourth row you need to make a cross. </p>

    <p>  To form the armholes in this coat, after 30 centimeters have been tied, three loops, once two, and once one loop should be reduced along the outer edge.  For the neck at the 20 cm center, close 13 stitches.  Tie each part separately until the yoke reaches 22 centimeters. </p><h2>  Knit sleeves, belt.  Putting the pieces together </h2><p>  To knit the sleeves, you need to dial 35 loops on the knitting needles and begin work, alternating four front and two wrong.  Of the four faces, a 2x2 pigtail is tied, a cross should be made in every fourth row. </p><p>  After 14 cm in height is ready, you need to add loops, knitting two loops from one.  Continue so that the number of loops is 72. After that, move smoothly to the pearl pattern.  Knitting nine centimeters, symmetrically on both sides - in order to make the sleeve round - reduce once three loops, once two and once - once.  Having knitted another ten centimeters, close all the loops. </p>

    <p>  We knit a belt on the back.  Collect ten loops and tie a scarf with a viscous strip, the length of which will be 12 centimeters. </p><p>  Now you can start assembling.  Side and shoulder seams are sutured.  Mittens should be slightly tucked around the gusset and carefully sewed into the armholes.  The belt is sewn with two buttons to the back.  Now, along the neckline of the coat, raise 55 loops for the collar and knit only ten centimeters with a garter stitch. </p><p>  A beautiful coat with knitting needles is ready.  Little fashionista will be very pleased.  Moreover, such a second will be impossible to find. </p><p>  By the way, such a knitted coat with a hood <strong> </strong>  It will also look good.  It can be knitted separately also with pearl viscous and neatly connected to the neck. </p>
