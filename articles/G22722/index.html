    <p>  The lamp itself consists of a housing in which the LED is located.  Nearby are the control board and battery.  Above them is a photoresistor, a solar panel and a protective glass. </p><p>  In the daytime in sunny weather, the converter accumulates solar energy and converts it into electrical energy, which enters the battery.  This energy allows the garden lamp to function in the dark. </p><p>  More expensive models of these devices have a motion controller that automatically turns on the lamp when a person approaches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A solar-powered garden lamp includes a transistor or microcircuit that acts as a sensor, by which the LED turns off when the battery is completely discharged, or can reduce the brightness of the light in case of loss of part of the charge. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The quality of such a device is determined by the silicon used.  In inexpensive fixtures use its polycrystalline or amorphous varieties.  Monocrystalline silicon can work in any season, it is resistant to aggressive effects.  If it is not possible to purchase a single-crystal cell, it is better to use multicrystalline solar cells. </p><p>  To give durability to products they are covered with a special film. </p><p>  Manufacturers began to invent marketing moves to hide some flaws in their products.  In particular, polycrystalline devices have come to be called <span>street LED lights,</span> but their normal life will be only one season. </p><p>  The branded devices boast a long service life.  Here, a sufficiently powerful photocell, sunlight enters into deep layers into it, which ensures stable operation of the lamps for a long time.  In Chinese fixtures, the thickness of the solar cell is comparable to foil, so its service life is much less. </p>

    <p>  The lighting is also influenced by the structure of the glass.  With prevailing days with cloudy weather, it is better to use textured glass, since it accumulates radiation, while a smooth surface contributes to its partial reflection.  The most expensive and durable coating is tempered glass. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Positive aspects of devices </h2><p>  <span>Solar-powered</span> garden-park <span>lamps</span> contribute to the refinement of recreation areas such as gardens, parks, squares.  These devices can be equipped with nickel-metal hydride batteries, which allows them to turn on when dark, turn off and start charging when morning comes. </p><p>  Currently, lamps are available in various designs.  Mostly produced traditional columns with different heights, as well as garlands.  In addition, they began to produce lamps in the form of dogs, cats, gnomes, snails and other potential inhabitants of the green zone.  Manufacturers also offer devices in the form of lamps around which butterflies fly. </p><p>  The devices in question do not need to possess the basics of installing electrical wiring, since the scheme of a solar-powered garden lamp does not imply supplying electricity to it, which saves financial resources to their owners. </p><p>  The light incident from these lights does not hit the eyes, because it is not super-bright. </p><p>  These fixtures are automatic equipment and can deceive thieves in the case of their malicious intent to attack your property. </p><p>  They do not require grounding and are completely safe for both people and the environment. </p>

    <p>  No special care is required for them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the same time, the lifespan of the considered types of lamps is quite long. </p><p>  Since they are operated in open areas, manufacturers provide them with a high level of protection against adverse weather factors. </p><h2>  Negative aspects </h2><p>  The solar-powered garden luminaire scheme does not provide for the use of dimensionless batteries; therefore, such devices have a limited lighting period, which, as a rule, does not exceed 8 hours.  This figure is achievable if the weather was sunny all day.  Cloudy weather significantly reduces the operating time, bringing it up to 4-5 hours. </p><p>  The negative side can be attributed to one of the positive sides: dim light.  Perhaps some places need to be well-lit, and this will require additional installation of electric lights. </p><p>  In some cases, there are reviews from customers that the lamps do not work well or do not shine at all during precipitation. </p><p>  When winter comes, they require dismantling, because negative temperatures can damage the battery. </p><h2>  Types of equipment in question </h2><p>  The most practical lamp for the garden with a shortened leg.  In this case, the installation is carried out by simply pressing the device into the ground with the help of hands. </p><p>  Among fairly dimly lit lanterns there are spotlights.  If the power of the solar lamp is 10 kW, then the power of the spotlights is equivalent to a 100-watt incandescent lamp. </p><p>  There are suspended <span>types of lamps.</span>  They are used as an element of garden decor, placing on tree branches or arbors.  Most often, such solar-powered garden lights are balls gathered in a garland. </p>

    <p>  Wall models are used to <span>illuminate the facade of the</span> house.  Operated when attached to it. </p><h2>  Improving garden lights </h2><p>  The cheapest models are Chinese.  Over time, the buyer of such products comes to understand that something needs to be done to improve their design or effectiveness.  With improvement, some elements of the luminaires are replaced by more powerful ones.  Thus, it is possible to replace the battery or LED, as well as the inductor used in tower-type flashlights.  Installing a more powerful inductor will help to achieve a bright glow coming from the lamp.  This action automatically leads to the replacement of the battery, because its capacity will cease to be sufficient for a long time, or it may simply fail. </p>

    <p>  Instead of one LED, you can use three, but when mounting them you need to ensure that the voltage spread is minimal, otherwise in one place the illumination will be increased brightness, and in another reduced. </p><p>  Thus, repairing a solar-powered garden lamp basically comes down to replacing individual parts. </p><h2>  Add colors </h2><p>  You can also improve the lights using colored LEDs.  This replacement requires knowledge of whether this device is suitable for such actions or not.  If it is not adapted, and the color LEDs have been installed, then the lamp will work for about 2 hours, and then turn off. </p>

    <p>  First you need to purchase an energy converter, the best of which is a polycrystalline silicon battery, which has a small mass, but good moisture protection and high power.  Next, buy a lithium-ion battery.  Next we get a regular LED. </p><p>  The latest acquisition - the most important - is an electronic control module, which consists of a pair of transistors and two pairs of resistors. </p><p>  Connection of the solar battery, LED and battery is done separately.  Assembly can be carried out on an inexpensive universal 42x25mm DIY PCB. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The layout of <span>a solar-powered</span> garden <span>light is</span> quite simple.  With its help, such a flashlight can be assembled by any versed person.  In this case, it is necessary to take into account the quality of the materials used in the lamp, since it is they that determine the service life and price of this device. </p>
