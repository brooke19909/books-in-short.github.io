  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In what cases are accounting statements and accounting statements calculated?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Accounting work is associated with numbers, calculations, calculations.  All these operations are performed by a person, and no one is immune from mistakes.  Identified errors must be corrected.  Correction of incorrect calculations should be accompanied by a document - an accounting statement.  Each accountant must know how to compile it.  In the certificate it is necessary to indicate the causes of the error and the method of its correction in accounting and tax accounting.  This is done so that over time not to forget why corrections were made. </p><p>  <strong>How is the accounting statement drawn up?</strong> </p><p>  Accounting is based on documentary evidence of all <span>business transactions.</span>  In addition, documents are subject to registration as primary.  The tax code considers the accounting certificate to be the primary document.  Such a document does not have a specially designed form, so an accounting statement can be drawn up arbitrarily.  The content of each of them, depending on the operation, is individual.  However, the following information is required in each certificate: </p><p>  1. Name of the organization composing the document. </p><p>  2. Table of contents (accounting statement or statement-calculation). </p><p>  3. Date of compilation. </p><p>  4. The content of the operation. </p><p>  5. Scope of operation and unit of measure. </p><p>  6. The position of the persons responsible for the operation, and the correctness of registration. </p><p>  7. Signatures of the indicated persons. </p><p>  <span>Correction of a mistake</span> is considered a business transaction.  In this regard, there should be a basis for recording an operation in the form of a correction of an error in accounting registers.  This basis is the primary document - accounting statement.  It is subject to storage with all <span>primary documents,</span> with the register in which corrections were made.  <span>The storage period of the document is</span> associated with the storage period of the accounting register, in which adjustments were made. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You should be aware that an accounting statement is issued not only to correct errors, but in other cases: when <span>registering fixed assets and intangible assets,</span> depreciation calculations.  In accounting, all adjustments are made during the period of error detection.  In tax accounting, errors relating to past reporting periods are corrected at the time they are made.  In some cases, if the period when a mistake was made, it is impossible to determine whether the tax liabilities of the reporting time in which it was discovered are subject to correction. </p><p>  <strong>Accounting reference calculation</strong> </p><p>  This document is needed if it is necessary to fix the amounts for which the accountant is responsible.  The operation is used, for example, in the separate accounting of taxable and non-taxable value added (VAT) operations.  In this option, you need to calculate the taxable and non-taxable revenue, on which the amount of VAT depends. </p><p>  To confirm the calculation, there are other situations where an accounting certificate is required.  An example of them may be as follows: calculation of the amount of interest on loans (received and issued) with an indication in the certificate of the loan agreement details, amount, interest rate, term of the agreement. </p><p>  In addition, the certificate-calculation can be used in calculating the amount of temporary disability benefits and be attached to the sick leave. </p><p>  The accounting statement helps to fix various cases, calculations, serves as a confirmation of the position in the dispute with the tax authorities.  Its compilation does not take much time.  It should be remembered that the lack of an accounting statement is considered a great violation of the rules for reporting income and expenses.  To avoid negative consequences during the annual inventory, be sure to check the availability of all accounting certificates.  Otherwise, a fine may be imposed. </p>
