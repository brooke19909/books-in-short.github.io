Ust-Kachka is a large health-improving complex that has incorporated several multidisciplinary health resorts at once. </p><p>  The uniqueness of this place is that on the territory of 182 hectares there are natural resources that have a beneficial effect on human health: pine forest, 3 types of healing springs and a well-equipped park for a good rest. </p><h2>  Resort History </h2><p>  Although the sanatoriums of the Ust-Kachka resort begin their history with wells accidentally discovered in 1935 with mineral hydrogen sulfide water, today it is the largest balneological health-improving complex in Europe. </p><p>  The building of the sanatorium buildings began immediately after the war, and by the end of the 40s he already received his patients year-round.  In 1951, a well with bromide mineral water began to work, the number of buildings increased and the infrastructure expanded, which brings resort sanatoriums (Ust-Kachka) to the level of the USSR‚Äôs largest health resort. </p>

    <p>  In the period from 1960 to 1980, a diagnostic and medical base was formed, new buildings were erected, and the provision of vacationers with full-fledged dietary nutrition and a variety of leisure activities was improved.  A park zone is developing, which occupies 80 hectares of area.  In 1972, another well was opened with medicinal-table water, which transfers the sanatoriums (Ust-Kachka united them into one complex) to the resort level of republican significance, where the party nomenclature of the entire Soviet Union rested. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the period of economic difficulties in the 90s, the resort not only did not decline, but increased the number of its customers due to the introduction of the latest health-improving techniques and improvements to the infrastructure on its territory.  This takes the sanatorium to the level of federal significance in 1995 and receiving the gold medal of the best health resort in Russia in 2005. </p><h2>  Bioclimatic and landscape features of the resort "Ust-Kachka" </h2><p>  There are many resorts with medicinal waters in the world, but there is no such combination of bio-climate, landscape and mineral waters anywhere except Ust-Kachka. </p><p>  The resort territory is located in the mid-continental climate, which means a moderately cold and dry winter with frosts up to -15 degrees and warm summers with temperatures up to +19 ... + 20 degrees. </p><p>  The therapeutic effect that can be obtained with aerotherapy is no less than with mineral water and mud.  A large role is played by the pine and spruce-pine forests located on the territory of the sanatorium. </p>
