Although this is not entirely true.  The fact is that in translation from Old German the word means "master's".  In other words, it is "something that is ruled by a ruler."  Reich called German lands.  In different periods of history, there were three such associations. </p><h2>  First Reich </h2>

    <p>  What is the First (Ancient) <span>Reich?</span>  <span>This</span> is another name for the <span>Holy Roman Empire,</span> which was later added with the postscript ‚ÄúGerman nation‚Äù.  This state association lasted from 962 to 1806.  The board in it was not inherited, it was an elected position.  The ruler himself was limited in his rights. </p><p>  The First Reich was one of the most powerful states in Europe.  After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, he subjugated the territories of modern Italy, France, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.  Its final destruction is associated with Napoleon, who captured most of Europe and defeated the German troops near Austerlitz.  So France was exalted in the political arena. </p><h2>  Second Reich </h2>

    <p>  What is the Second Reich?  This is Germany, which existed from 1871 to 1918.  It is often called Kaiser.  The Prussian king <span>William the First</span> and his chancellor <span>Otto von Bismarck</span> created a new empire <span>.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Because of the desire to gain economic and political domination in Europe, the state initiated the First World War.  However, this was the beginning of the collapse of the Second Reich, because at the end of the war it ceased to exist. </p><h2>  History of the Third Reich </h2><p>  In 1934, Adolf Hitler received power in the state.  His only goal was the worldwide domination of the German nation.  He believed that his nation belongs to the Aryan race, and only she was worthy to exist on Earth.  Other peoples, in his opinion, were created only as minions. </p>

    <p>  The last Reich was created in the thinking of the F√ºhrer after reading his book "Third Reich".  Its author was A.M. van den Brook.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such a state has been hovering in German society since the defeat in the First World War, which was unleashed by the Germans. </p><p>  The defeat in the war led to grave consequences for the country: </p><ul><li>  loss of most colonies; </li><li>  agricultural decline; </li><li>  the collapse of production; </li><li>  external debts to the victorious states. </li></ul><p>  This all formed a radical mood in a certain part of the population.  The Weimar Republic has shown its inability to lift the country out of the crisis, so the population turned its attention to the Communists and National Socialists. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A significant influence on the choice of citizens was made by the fire of 1933 in the Reichstag building, in which the communists were accused.  They left the political arena, and the fate of the country was predetermined.  National Socialists came to power with Adolf Hitler at the head.  Thus began the Third Reich. </p><p>  What is the Third Reich?  First of all, this is the unofficial name of Nazi Germany.  Prior to this, the term was used by the National Socialists, propagandizing the regime of the future.  It existed from 1933 to 1945 and was destroyed as a result of the defeat and surrender of Germany in World War II. </p>

    <p>  The photos of the Reich presented above testify to the belligerent orientation of the country from the very beginning of its existence.  The new state has its own symbolism, the army.  It was managed by Adolf Hitler along with his like-minded people. </p><h2>  Secrets of the last Reich </h2><p>  In its short existence, Hitler Germany managed to destroy millions of civilians, including women and children.  She has captured many states.  Such military success is haunting some researchers.  Therefore, there are versions about the secrets of the Reich. </p><p>  The most popular story is that the Nazis built a shelter in Antarctica.  There they brought workers, scientists, staff.  The Germans called this territory New Swabia and hid there after the defeat in World War II.  There is also a theory that Hitler himself fled there.  Although there is no official evidence of this, it remains a mystery what the Germans did off the coast of Antarctica.  And ships and submarines sailed there quite often. </p><p>  Other unsolved secrets of the Reich: </p><ul><li>  Is Hitler's death real or is it a staging? </li><li>  Who was Bormann? </li><li>  Gold of the Nazis. </li><li>  What happened to the <span>Amber Room?</span> </li><li>  Disco Nazis. </li><li>  Missile of the Last Reich. </li></ul><p>  In addition to the above stories, there are also occult secrets of Nazi Germany. </p>
