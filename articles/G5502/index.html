The main advantage of <span>phones, smartphones</span> and tablets manufactured by BQ-mobile is its very low cost.  At the same time, the quality of products is at a very decent level. </p><p>  What is the catch?  Let's try to understand the example of several smartphones BQ-5058, BQ-5059 and BQ-5037 from the BQ Strike Power line, there are a lot of reviews on these devices on the Web. </p><h2>  "Budget" philosophy </h2><p>  To get started, let's step back a little from the topic.  What is a budget smartphone and who will buy it? </p><p>  The Internet is full of announcements of new smartphones - flagships and middle peasants - of various well-known companies.  Of course, many will buy a smartphone of a well-known brand, albeit overpaying for the image of owning such a device. </p><p>  However, in the market of mobile gadgets there is a category of devices that differ in extremely low cost with good technical characteristics (if you believe the descriptions).  Many users who are not demanding on the characteristics of a smartphone will buy a budget device simply because of the low cost. </p><p>  Basically, the "budget" category of devices is represented by Chinese companies.  At the same time, having heard the name of the manufacturer, the buyer in perplexity will ask again: "What kind of brand is this?" </p><p>  But there are exceptions.  For example, the company BQ-mobile is not a Chinese, but a Russian manufacturer.  Under the BQ brand, many different electronic devices are produced: smartphones, tablets and even <span>push-button mobile phones.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A little about the company BQ-mobile </h2><p>  What kind of company is this and where did it come from?  After all, a few years ago no one had heard of her.  And now this is a pretty hyped brand. </p>

    <p>  BQ-mobile company first introduced its products to the mobile device market in 2013.  The founder and owner of the brand is businessman Vladimir Puzanov.  The young businessman took a significant risk, starting the production of smartphones in Russia.  He made a bet on a very low cost of production in the presence of an extensive market for its sale. </p><p>  As the sales levels of the first batches of BQ-mobile mobile devices showed, the risky move of Vladimir Puzanov fully paid off.  Today, several million BQ-mobile devices are sold in Russia per year.  This is a very good indicator. </p><p>  It should also be noted that physically there is no production in Russia; all mobile devices under the BQ-mobile brand are manufactured at factories in China. </p><h2>  Overall impression of design </h2><p>  So, back to our smartphones, BQ-5058, BQ-5059 and BQ-5037.  All three gadgets belong to a series of devices with increased battery capacity BQ Strike Power.  Reviews about smartphones in this series are mostly positive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the first detailed inspection it is difficult to believe that the devices belong to the budget segment.  Build quality is high, the back cover is metal.  Under the cover is a battery and slots for SIM and microSD cards.  For the operation of the antennas, plastic bets are left at the lower and upper ends of the case.  Front screen covers fashionable 2.5D glass.  The case of all three devices is a bit thick due to the capacious battery. </p>

    <p>  The design of the <span>BQ</span> Strike Power <span>phone</span> , according to user reviews, does not cause wild delight, but this is not required from the device.  It is enough that the device looks interesting and does not give out its origin in appearance. </p><p>  Smartphones are equipped with standard equipment.  Opening the red box with the company logo, we will find the following: </p><ul><li>  the device itself; </li><li>  power adapter; </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  stereo headphones; </li><li>  user manual and warranty card. </li></ul><h2>  Display and performance </h2><p>  All three smartphones are equipped with a 5-inch IPS display.  The screens of BQ-5059 and BQ-5037 received a resolution of 720x1280 pixels, for BQ-5058 this indicator is equal to 480x584.  The image is quite decent, viewing angles are good.  Maybe the BQ-5058 is a little lacking in detail when displaying small text, but this is not critical.  If someone does not like the quality of the display, you can pay a little extra and purchase a BQ Strike Power 5059 smartphone with an HD screen.  Smartphone screens from the factory are protected by a film. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Now let's talk about the technical stuffing of smartphones.  The performance of all three BQ StrikePower phones, according to user reviews, is at a low level.  The 4-core Mediatek processor (Qualcomm for BQ-5037) allows you to comfortably use the basic functions of smartphones and play simple games.  Each of the gadgets has on its board 1 GB of RAM.  The built-in drive has a memory capacity of 8 GB. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the BQ-5058 and BQ-5059 devices received the new Android 7 operating system, which is not typical for budget smartphones. </p><h2>  Cameras: budget quality </h2><p>  The optical modules of all three smartphones, in principle, did not bring any surprises.  The main camera of the BQ-5059 and BQ-5037 has a resolution of 13 megapixels, for the BQ-5058 this parameter is worse and equal to 8. </p><p>  The front camera is better with the BQ-5059, its resolution was 8 megapixels, for fellow reviewers this parameter is 5. </p><p>  When shooting on the main camera, photos of medium quality are obtained, this was not a surprise.  If under natural light in good weather you can get decent pictures, then the conditions change for the worse, and the quality of the photos inevitably falls: the image becomes blurry and noise appears on it. </p>

    <p>  The front cameras of smartphones BQ Strike Power, according to reviews, also do not grab stars from the sky.  You can get good quality photos from them only under ideal conditions. </p><h2>  Smartphone Communication Features </h2><p>  All presented devices support work with two SIM-cards.  One of the smartphones, BQ-5037, supports 4G networks.  Reviews on BQ Strike Power in terms of voice quality are positive. </p><p>  The wireless interfaces on all three smartphones are identical.  This is the standard suite of Bluetooch 4.0, Wi-Fi 802.11 n and GPS.  The operation of all modules is stable, there are no complaints about the quality of the connection.  The only nuance can be considered a long search for satellites GPS module smartphones. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The BQ Strike Power smartphones are equipped with high-capacity batteries and, according to the manufacturer, they can offer the user significant battery life.  The BQ-5058 and BQ-5059 models received a battery with a capacity of 5000 mAh, for BQ-5037 this parameter is 4000 mAh. </p><p>  What about the uptime of BQ gadgets? </p><p>  According to user reviews, the BQ 5037 Strike Power is quite capable of stretching for 3 days without access to the outlet, and with some savings, the phone can survive all 4. </p>

    <p>  The BQ-5059 will work for 5 days, or even more, it all depends on the mode of using functions that entail increased power consumption (watching video, using wireless interfaces). </p><p>  But the BQ Strike Power 5058, according to reviews, is the record holder for autonomy among the heroes of the review.  If you use a smartphone mainly for calls and only occasionally connect the wireless capabilities of the device, you can squeeze out a whole week of work without an outlet.  Very worthy indicator!  Not the last role was played, of course, by the low screen resolution.  Do not forget about the 5000 mAh battery. </p><h2>  In the dry residue </h2><p>  There is nothing special to add.  Everything falls into place after a general analysis of the budget smartphone market and the study of pricing policies conducted by BQ-mobile. </p><p>  The annual sales of company gadgets are growing steadily.  BQ-mobile currently sells several million devices a year. </p>

    <p>  The line of budget smartphones, long-lived BQ Strike Power, according to reviews on the Web, is very popular among users.  BQ-mobile products attract customers primarily due to the low cost of gadgets.  Few people can offer a full-fledged smartphone, with a good battery and attractive design, at a price of 6000 Russian rubles. </p>
