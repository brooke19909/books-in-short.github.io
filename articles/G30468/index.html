Particularly relevant are trips to exotic places and countries at a time when the cold season begins in Russia.  Currently, Dubai is gaining more and more popularity among tourists.  This city is able to surprise with its luxury.  But few travelers know what currency is in Dubai.  Throughout the country of the United Arab Emirates, one monetary unit is valid.  She is the main currency of Dubai - the dirham.  In exchange points, it can be determined by writing three letters before the sum - AED.  However, sometimes a currency can be referred to as dhs.  Such a prefix is ​​placed after the cash amount. </p>

    <h2>  Currency history </h2><p>  Not so long ago, back in 1959, the Persian rupee was used as the monetary unit in Dubai.  A few years later, starting in June 1966, another currency came into circulation.  She served the rial of Saudi Arabia.  It was a temporary monetary unit.  At this time, many sought to exchange rupees for real.  The exchange rate was then 100: 106.5.  But the currency did not last long.  Already in September of the same year, Qatar riyal was introduced into circulation.  At the same time, the Bahraini dinar served as a means of payment in Abu Dhabi.  For one such unit ten rupees were given. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The modern currency of Dubai - the dirham - came into circulation in 1973.  It began to be used throughout the <span>United Arab Emirates.</span>  It was possible to exchange the old currency for the new dirham at the rate of one to one.  Only Abu Dhabi excelled, here the exchange rate was only 0.1 to 1. At that time, there were banknotes in denominations of five, ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred, two hundred, five hundred and a thousand dichrams.  For coins, another, smaller currency is used - fils. </p>

    <h2>  Banknotes and coins </h2><p>  As in most other countries, in Dubai, the currency is issued in two versions: banknotes and coins.  Banknotes are compact in size and can easily be placed in any wallet.  The most popular banknotes in Dubai are one hundred dirhams, they are distinguished by a red color.  A purple denomination of fifty dirhams is no less common.  Next come twenty dirhams, they have a blue-green color, green ten and an orange banknote with a nominal value of five dirhams. </p><p>  However, this is not all bills.  In circulation there are also banknotes in denominations of two hundred, five hundred and a thousand dirhams.  At the same time, you should be very careful, since a <span>thousandth bill is</span> very similar to a fifty dirham banknote.  Fraudsters can take advantage of this, since the face value of a bill on one side is indicated in Arabic numerals.  On the reverse side, the denomination is indicated in Roman numerals.  On the bills themselves there is an image showing the life and traditions of the UAE. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to banknotes, there are coins in circulation.  There are only three such banknotes: </p><ul><li>  One dirham. </li><li>  Fifty Fils. </li><li>  Twenty-five fils, the smallest coin. </li></ul><p>  It is worth considering that there are exactly one hundred fils in one dirham.  But a dirham coin in Dubai is simply irreplaceable in Dubai.  It is used to pay for a parking space.  Motorists should take care of their availability in advance. </p>

    <h2>  Currency Exchange in Dubai </h2><p>  Make a currency exchange in Dubai is not difficult.  This can be done at any specialized point.  Very often they are automated.  At the same time, the exchange rate of Dubai is one of the most transparent, since it does not have any hidden fees. </p><p>  You can easily find an exchange office in any of the many shopping centers.  They are easy to recognize by LED screens, which display the exchange rate.  His quotes are updated every morning, and sometimes several times in one day. </p><h2>  How and where is it more profitable to exchange? </h2><p>  Do not change all the money at once, do it as necessary.  This is due to the fact that during the exchange part of the money is still lost.  And if you exchange the entire amount at once, but don’t spend this money, you will have to change it again at the end of the trip.  So another part of the sum of money will be lost.  Do not be afraid of cheating when exchanging money.  If the operation is performed at automated points, the likelihood of this is completely eliminated. </p>

    <h2>  Exchange rate to the ruble and the dollar </h2><p>  The exchange rate to the ruble of the Dubai currency is constantly changing.  This is due to the high volatility of the Russian currency.  But quotes do not have sharp changes.  Today, <span>one dirham</span> costs a little more than fifteen Russian rubles.  But with respect to the dollar, the currency of Dubai has a stable rate.  For one US dollar, exchange offices offer 3,675 dirhams. </p><h2>  What money is better to take on a trip? </h2><p>  The currency of Dubai for the residents of the Russian Federation is very exotic.  In our country, it is unlikely that it will be possible to exchange rubles in advance for dirhams at a bank or other exchange point.  But this should not upset the tourist who is going to visit the <span>United Arab Emirates.</span> </p><p>  Dubai is one of the most developed centers of leisure and tourism.  For this reason, exchanging money is not difficult.  All exchangers accept most currencies of all developed countries.  The ruble is no exception. </p><p>  However, despite the ease of exchange, when choosing a currency that you should take with you on a trip, it is better to stay on the dollar.  The article has already mentioned that his course is always stable.  In addition, it is the most profitable in comparison with the euro and even more so the ruble. </p>

    <h2>  And in the end </h2><p>  At the end of the article, I would like to recall that the currency called dirham exists not only <span>in the United Arab Emirates.</span>  Also called the currency of Morocco.  But it is worth considering that the rates of this currency are significantly different in relation to the euro, dollar and other <span>monetary units.</span> </p>
