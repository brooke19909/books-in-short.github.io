The state is located in northern Africa and is among the <span>countries of the Maghreb.</span>  So called the medieval historians of the state, located west of Egypt.  And now the concept of the Maghreb is actively voiced in politics.  It also includes Libya, Algeria, Morocco and other administrative territories.  The area of ​​Tunisia is only 164 thousand square meters. Therefore, the camp is considered the smallest state. </p><p>  For many millennia, it has been a kind of “mediator” or a link between African and European countries.  Tunisia includes not only mainland lands, but also two more islands - Djerba and Karkana.  The country is a presidential republic led by the president of Tunisia.  And the legislative power is concentrated in the hands of a <span>unicameral parliament.</span>  The current president of Tunisia is Beji Qaed Es-Sebsey.  The country has gone through various stages of history and is now an independent state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisian population" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2081687.jpg"></div>

Tourists can exchange foreign currency at banks or exchange offices.  There are special exchange points at airports, hotels and ports.  They have a fixed rate of the Central Bank of the country. </p><h2>  Ethnic composition of the population </h2><p>  The country has two official languages ​​- French and Arabic.  In addition, Italian, German and English are incredibly common.  In the south of Tunisia and in the mountainous regions, even Berber dialects are still preserved.  The state religion is Islam.  It is worth noting that most of the local residents, approximately 95%, are Sunni Muslims, while all the rest profess Christianity and Judaism. </p><p>  The ethnic composition of the population of Tunisia is very diverse due to the complex historical path.  Even outwardly the indigenous people are significantly different from each other.  Here you can see both bright people, by appearance similar to Europeans, and dark-skinned. Most of the Tunisian population is Arabs (97%).  In addition, Italians, Turks, Jews and French live in the country. </p><p>  Currently, the population of Tunisia is more than ten million people. </p><h2>  Country history </h2><p>  Historians believe that the country's territory was first developed by man more than a million years ago.  The first state formations appeared here quite early.  The first Greek villages appeared on the coast in the twelfth century, and then the Phoenician ones.  Carthage already in the third century BC reached unprecedented power.  The state was considered the strongest in the Mediterranean.  Later, having lost warriors with Rome, Carthage became a Roman province.  In this status of the earth were up to the fifth century AD.  After the fall of the great empire, the lands of Tunisia for a long time passed from the hands of some conquerors to others.  Later, in the seventh century, Arabs appeared here who spread Islam throughout the territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what continent is Tunisia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2081900.jpg"></div>

Having achieved independence, the country has become respected in the <span>Arab world.</span>  But in the future, Spain encroached on its territory, as a result of which the state had to leave under the guardianship of Turkey.  After some time, such submission began to be purely conditional.  But in 1881, Tunisia was captured by the French.  All internal resistances were severely suppressed.  But the internal struggle with a new force flared up after the end of the First World War.  Tunisia managed to become a completely independent state in 1956, ending its colonial past.  The country proclaimed itself a republic.  Around the same time, Tunisia's modern currency appeared. </p><h2>  Internal geography </h2><p>  The lands of Tunisia are mountain spurs and savannahs.  Most of the country is incredibly deserted.  Spurs of the Atlas Mountains occupy about a third of the country.  The Mediterranean Sea has a significant impact on the climate in Tunisia.  It can be quite cool on the coast, and in the south of the country hot weather can prevail at this time.  On the territory of the state there is only one large river Majarda, flowing into the Gulf of Tunisia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisian currency" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2081708.jpg"></div>

Some of them are popular and famous resorts.  Travelers should know that the time in Tunisia differs from Moscow only two hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Climate resort country </h2><p>  On the territory of the country, two climatic zones can be distinguished: desert tropical in the south and subtropical Mediterranean in the north.  On the coast, summer heat is far from always noticeable due to the influence of the Mediterranean Sea.  In general, the summer in Tunisia is incredibly hot and dry, but winter on the contrary is wet and mild.  During the hot southern winds from the Sahara, heat covers the entire territory of the country.  At this time, the air temperature rises above +40 degrees.  For tourists, the most suitable time to visit local resorts is the period from the end of April to November.  In spring and autumn, you can take time on excursions and trips.  But summer is the time for a beach-sea vacation.  The swimming season here lasts until the beginning of November, and begins in May.  Djerba island is a very special place with its microclimate and weather conditions. </p><h2>  What documents are needed for a vacation? </h2><p>  Since 2014, a visa-free regime has been introduced between Russia and Tunisia.  This makes it possible for Russians to enter the country with only a passport.  It is possible to stay in the state for up to three months - 90 days.  No additional documents are required for the trip in the form of confirmation from the hotel or vouchers.  At the border, Russians are not too bothered by document checks.  The only procedure is to present a migration card, which is issued on the plane, immediately before landing.  It must be correctly filled out and presented during passport control.  The map is saved until the departure in the opposite direction.  In fact, it is a temporary residence permit in the country. </p><h2>  Country Culture </h2><p>  The culture of Tunisia is incredibly interesting and rich.  For a long time, it was formed under the influence of various civilizations.  Europe had a huge impact.  A couple of years ago, UNESCO awarded Tunisia the title of the cultural capital of the Mediterranean.  It is worth noting that the country is one of the most attractive African states. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tunisian president" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2081878.jpg"></div>
