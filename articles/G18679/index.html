Description, diagrams and interesting ideas</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Pajamas are a type of nightwear designed to protect the body from heat loss during sleep.  Pajamas are divided into men's, women's and children's.  With trousers or shorts, nightwear can be worn by everyone, but a nightgown is an exclusively feminine kind of sleepwear. </p><h2>  The history of pajamas </h2><p>  The first pajamas were worn so that a person would not freeze during sleep.  Unstable and imperfect heating, and often even its absence, forced people to find salvation from the night cold.  The first pajamas were a repetition of underwear, in particular - a man‚Äôs shirt.  The length ranged from the middle of the knee to the ankle; there could also be cuts on the sides, additional fasteners and valves. </p><p>  After a while, pajamas underwent changes.  Now the female version from the male is very different.  In addition to the finish, which uses lace, silk, and beads for female models, different materials are also used.  Men's pajamas are more durable and tight, often consist of pants or shorts and T-shirts or a loose shirt.  Female models are more diverse.  Various flowing materials are used in the production - silk, satin, viscose.  Models are very diverse - from men's versions of strict long pajamas with a shirt to light translucent flirty nightgowns. </p><h2>  Pajamas for girls </h2><p>  In order to sew pajamas yourself, you need to decide which model you like most.  Then measurements are taken and a pattern is built.  For example, the <span>simplest pattern of</span> pajamas for a girl is based on a <span>children's t-shirt.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  To start work, the material is selected from which pajamas will be sewn.  It is necessary to use only natural fabrics, choosing them according to the season.  For the warm season, linen, knit, viscose things are good.  Flannel pajamas are suitable for cold weather.  The pattern is based on a T-shirt, in which the child feels most comfortable. </p><p>  The thing is washed before work, thoroughly ironed and steamed.  Then, the T-shirt folded in half is placed on a sheet of paper and the outline is drawn with a pencil so that a 2 cm allowance remains. The resulting workpiece is mirrored on the second half of the paper. </p><p>  It is now convenient to work with this pattern.  Sleeves can be lengthened or shortened, the hem can be made of any comfortable length.  The width of the product is also convenient to change - the shirt can be both more tight-fitting and perfect free, almost trapezoidal shape.  Such pajamas, the pattern of which does not require taking measurements and extra expenses for the purchase of fabric, are very convenient for children - the thing turns out to be warm, soft and interesting. </p><h2>  Product assembly </h2><p>  Such a pattern of pajamas for a girl does not imply the presence of a large number of details.  Due to the peculiarities of the child‚Äôs figure, the product consists of two identical parts - the front and the back.  The assembly is the stitching of the parts together from the wrong side.  First of all, it is necessary to grind the edges of the product - sleeves and collar.  With a hem, this can be done after assembly - the width of the thing allows.  When the sleeves and collar are finished, pieces of pajamas are sewn together. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  This drawing is made in compliance with the proportions.  For a child of 3 to 5 years old, it is necessary to print it on a paper size of the appropriate size and transfer it to the fabric.  Oddly enough, this shirt can be done for the boy.  Classic children's pajamas used to look just like that - long, to the floor, with a fastener in the middle. </p><p>  To make your pajamas as comfortable as possible, use another standard pattern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The circles depicted in the armpits will help round off the transitions in the armholes.  To accomplish this, use a compass or pattern with a suitable line. </p><h2>  Pajamas for the boy </h2><p>  The simplest pattern of pajamas for a boy consists of a pattern of <span>trousers</span> and a T-shirt.  To build a drawing, you need to take measurements: </p><ul><li>  product length - measured in front of the protruding point of the clavicle to the desired length; </li><li>  chest girth - a centimeter tape is laid under the armpits around the body; </li><li>  sleeve length - measured from the upper point of the shoulder to the hand in a slightly bent position of the hand; </li><li>  the length of the trousers is external and internal - the external is measured from the waist to the ankle along the outside of the leg, the inside is measured from the crotch to the ankle from the inside; </li><li>  waist circumference - a centimeter tape is laid around the waist;  for the smallest children, as well as for large children, a centimeter tape is laid along the most protruding point of the tummy; </li><li>  hips - measurement is made on the most prominent points of the hips; </li><li>  girth of the neck - the tape is held around the neck without strong tension; </li><li>  shoulder length - the distance from the neck to the extreme point of the shoulder. </li></ul><p>  To build a pattern, many measurements are used in half.  This is necessary so that the two halves of the pattern after assembly of the product repeated the contours of the body. </p><p>  Suppose that for a child about a year the parameters will correspond to the values: </p><ul><li>  half thigh circumference - 25.5; </li><li>  sleeve length - 26; </li><li>  product length - 31; </li><li>  trousers length - 39; </li><li>  half neck circumference - 12. </li></ul><h2>  Drawing a trouser </h2><p>  To get a pattern of pajamas for a boy, you need to draw a pattern for the front of the trousers: </p><ol><li>  A right angle is drawn in the upper left corner of the sheet of the required format.  Point A is noted. It should be borne in mind that at the beginning of construction, about 5 cm depart from the edge of the sheet. </li><li>  From this point A, a segment is laid down, the length of which is equal to the length of the trousers.  This is point N. A line of sufficient length is drawn to the right side of this point.  This is the bottom line of the trousers. </li><li>  From A, a value corresponding to the half-circumference of the thigh / 2 + 5 cm is marked down. This is point B. A horizontal segment is drawn to the right from this mark. </li><li>  Now, from the right side, the distance of the half-circumference of the hip / 2 + 3 cm is laid off to the right side. Point B1 is noted.  A vertical line is drawn up from it up to the intersection with the lines of the top and bottom of the product.  Points A1 and H1 are noted. </li><li>  To the right side of B1, a distance of 0.1 is laid (half-circumference of the hip + 2 cm).  Point B2 is marked. </li><li>  After that, a bisector is drawn from B1 to the right.  On it lay 2 - 2.5 cm. Mark point B5. </li><li>  From the A1 mark, a 1 cm length is drawn down. Point A2 is noted. </li><li>  The B1H1 distance is divided in half, the midpoint is K. </li><li>  Sequentially trace the contour of the trousers at the points: A and A2, and B5, and B2, and K, and H1, and N. </li></ol>

    <p>  The constructed pattern of pajamas for a child is suitable for modeling pajamas for an adult.  The difference will only be that the sizes will vary. </p><h2>  Stitching parts </h2><p>  After the pattern is built, pajamas are sewn together.  Sewing (the pattern is already transferred to the fabric from the wrong side) is very easy. </p><p>  Before starting work, the fabric is ironed and steamed. </p><p>  First, the internal and external seams are sewn to the very top.  Then you need to cut the edges of the trousers.  This can be done with a sewing machine or manually. </p><p>  After that, a drawstring is made, into which subsequently an elastic band is wound up.  It is important to consider that these manipulations are carried out on the front side - from the face the tissue is wrapped inward and sewn up. </p><p>  After sewing is completed, the product is carefully ironed on both sides. </p>

    <p>  It turns out great comfortable pants. </p><p>  Using the same pattern, you can also sew shorts, just keep in mind that the length of the product will be much shorter.  Other measurements will remain unchanged. </p><h2>  Men's pajamas </h2><p>  Men's pajamas most often consist of shorts or trousers and a <span>T-shirt.</span>  <span>The pattern of men's</span> pajamas is different in that when constructing the drawing, another size is used - the length to the knee.  It is measured from the hip along the leg to the knee.  The leg is slightly bent.  This distance is laid on the vertical line of the AN. </p><p>  The resulting pattern is also transferred to the fabric, cut and sew.  It‚Äôs convenient to insert not an elastic band into men's trousers, but a decorative lace - it will not pull the body during sleep and is more suitable for an adult man. </p>

    <h2>  Top for men's pajamas </h2><p>  When pajamas are sewn with their own hands, patterns do not have to be model.  To build a <span>pattern for a men's shirt, a</span> method where an old men's shirt is used is perfect. </p><p>  Option 1: a shirt, carefully steamed, measured with a <span>centimeter tape,</span> using rulers, a prototype is drawn that matches the size of the shirt. </p><p>  Option 2: the shirt is unstuck at the seams and the parts received are circled as if on a piece.  Then the pattern lines are drawn and the drawing is transferred to the fabric. </p><p>  Both options are simple and convenient for beginners. </p>
