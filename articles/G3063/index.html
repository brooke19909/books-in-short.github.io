But for more than twenty years, it belongs to the country of the pyramids. </p><p><br>  One of the main advantages of Taba is the extraordinary beauty of the local landscape.  Golden beaches, impressive mountains, lagoons, grottoes, palm oases and other virtues of nature that fill this resort captivate vacationers with their splendor. </p><p><br>  Taba is located near the international airport, so the path from it to the picturesque place takes very little time. </p><p><br>  Hotels of Taba, scattered along the coast, against the backdrop of iridescent granite mountains look simply magnificent.  They pleasantly surprise holidaymakers with excellent seafood, dishes of different nations and local drinks. </p><p><br>  The main attraction of Taba is the island of the Pharaohs.  All visiting tourists are eager to visit it.  A couple of minutes by boat, and you will see the bay of extraordinary beauty.  But this small island is a crusader fortress.  Built in the 12th century, it served as a border crossing point.  Now it is a museum.  With the onset of darkness, a light show is arranged above him. </p><p><br>  The island of Pharaohs is surrounded by a <span>coral reef,</span> which is always popular among divers, thanks to the amazing underwater world.  Active sports enthusiasts will enjoy exciting windsurfing, and for romantics, evening boat trips. </p><p><br>  The hospitable Taba hotels organize trips to the local History Museum. In addition, the Taba resort attracts visitors to other attractions within a few hours drive.  This is Mount Moses and the monastery of St. Catherine. Still closer is the Color Canyon.  Which got its name because of colored granite. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p><br>  Also, tourists are offered trips to Cairo and Israel (for those who have an Israeli visa). </p><p><br>  To the choice of vacationers, Taba hotels provides the most diverse, from the fashionable five to the democratic three. </p><p><br>  From the richest choice, we can distinguish several of the most popular hotels in Taba. </p><p><br>  <strong>Hyatt Regency Taba Heights 5 *</strong> </p><p>  Comfortable hotel located on the beach.  The hotel area is very cozy despite the large area.  There are no six pools, an artificial lagoon, two restaurants and several bars.  Visitors love the Hyatt Regency Taba Heights for their excellent service and unmatched cuisine with an impressive selection of food on offer.  The hotel is suitable for families with children, has a kids club and playgrounds.  Paid <span>services</span> include <span>babysitting services.</span> </p><p><br>  <strong>Sol Y Mar Sea Star Resor 4 *</strong> </p><p><br>  Located on the shores of a sandy beach.  The rooms with terraces are very comfortable.  There are all conditions for relaxing with children.  The hotel will offer vacationers a lot of entertainment: discos, animation, billiards, <span>table tennis,</span> poolside relaxation.  The hotel is served by a bar, restaurant and snack bar. </p><p><br>  <strong>Salah El Deen Taba 3 *</strong> </p><p><br>  A small hotel opposite the island of the Pharaohs.  On the territory: two swimming pools, a buffet restaurant, a kids club, souvenir shops and much more.  The rooms have air conditioning and a paid minibar.  Some of the rooms have a balcony.  Hotel Salah El Deen Taba is the best combination of price and quality. </p><p><br>  Throughout Taba, hotels reviews that are full of admiration will provide tourists with maximum impressions and positive emotions. </p><p><br>  <strong>Some features of a holiday in Taba</strong> </p><p>  Be prepared for the fact that this resort has virtually no Russian-speaking attendants.  Everyone speaks no English. </p><p><br>  Leaving, even for a while, Taba hotels, be sure to bring your passport with you.  Since this is a border zone, and misunderstandings may arise. </p><p><br>  There are no big bazaars in Taba.  Souvenirs can be bought in stores at the hotel. </p><p><br>  If you are going to visit Color Canyon, put on sportswear, so it will be more convenient for you. </p><p><br>  For visiting the monastery of St. Catherine, closed clothing is required.  No bare legs, shoulders, back.  Women need a head scarf.  The same goes for tourists visiting Mount Moses.  It‚Äôs also cold in the evenings.  Stock up on warm clothes. </p><p><br>  Going to Israel, cook dollars.  <span>Egyptian pounds</span> are not accepted there, and it is not always possible to exchange money during the tour.  If the guide will give out the insignia of your group: caps, <span>stickers on clothes,</span> do not throw them away.  Otherwise, it is quite possible to get lost. </p><p><br>  Always get acquainted with the features of the country you want to visit, and rest will succeed without fail. </p>
