In particular, great interest among people of different generations is caused by questions related to who the inhabitants of Ancient Rus were - Eastern Slavs, what they did and what they believed in.  After all, as the Romans claimed, who knows his past, he can understand the present, and therefore, anticipate the future. </p><h2>  Who are the <span>Eastern Slavs</span> and how did their resettlement occur? </h2><p>  As you know, the Glagolitic alphabet was created only in the 9th century.  Therefore, there are practically no written sources in which the occupations and life of the Eastern Slavs would be consecrated.  It is all the more difficult to find data on their origin.  However, a synthesis of all the information currently available suggests that the division of the Slavs into Western, Southern and Eastern occurred between the 5-8th centuries of our era.  Moreover, over time, the tribes of the latter, in turn, also divided into two groups.  The first of them founded Veliky Novgorod and also inhabited the territories of Beloozero and the modern Tver region, while the other first settled in the Dnieper River basin, and then spread throughout the territories of modern Moldova and southern Ukraine to the west and north to the upper Volga. </p>

    <h2>  Genesis at an early stage of development </h2><p>  Judging by archaeological findings, the economic activities of the Eastern Slavs in the <span>early Middle Ages were</span> limited to primitive farming (growing wheat and poultry millet), as well as storing (collecting <span>honey from wild bees),</span> raising livestock, hunting and fishing.  They lived in log half-dugouts with stone stoves, and their utensils and tools were so few and simple that they did not build any fortifications to protect their settlements, consisting of 1-2 dozen houses.  The fact is that when an enemy attacked, it was easier for residents to escape, establish the same settlement in a new place and acquire simple belongings, than to sacrifice life for the sake of saving a pair of hoes and rough pots. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The main occupation of the Eastern Slavs after the emergence of ancient settlements </h2><p>  The first fortified settlements of our ancestors appeared in the 5th century.  However, mass migration from unprotected small villages located in the lowlands to fortified settlements on the hills or high banks of the rivers began in the 8th century.  Moreover, in different regions this process proceeded with unequal intensity.  For example, the most fortified settlements arose in the Dnieper basin. </p>

    <p>  Even after the resettlement from the villages, the main occupation of the Eastern Slavs did not change.  Moreover, they not only cultivated the fields located around their settlement, but also planted gardens and vegetable gardens directly inside the city fortifications.  At the same time, along with agriculture, crafts began to develop there, such as the manufacture of metal agricultural tools, knives and other weapons, as well as pottery.  This is evidenced by fragments of ancient forges, for example, in the Ekimoutsky settlement.  By the way, it was during this period that such concepts as a settlement and a settlement were born, meaning a place near the fortress or defensive wall, where there were workshops and a retail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Customs of the Eastern Slavs </h2><p>  To avoid incestuous marriages and degeneration, it was customary for our ancestors to arrange games in which all residents of two or three neighboring villages participated.  During such festivities, a ritual ‚Äústealing‚Äù of brides took place.  And for the supposedly forcibly abducted girl, her family relied on a ransom, since he was losing an employee. </p>

    <p>  Getting married meant that the man became his (brother-in-law) in the family of his wife and he could eventually have up to several dozen children.  Thus, some fathers of families acquired a large relative who could assist in the attack of enemies, and at a certain age, polygamy of working hands appeared on their households.  The latter circumstance was extremely important, since the main occupation of the Eastern Slavs - agriculture - required the application of collective efforts. </p><h2>  Beliefs </h2><p>  The Eastern Slavs were pagans and worshiped the pantheon of their gods, many of which were for them the personification of the forces of nature.  And this is not surprising, since the main occupation of the Eastern Slavs is agriculture, and its result completely depended on whether it rains, if the hail breaks the crop and if the river that spilled in the spring will wash it off. </p>

    <p>  The main god of the eastern Slavs was Perun, who controlled thunder and lightning, causing horror and awe.  The <span>sun god Yarilo, the</span> sky <span>god</span> Svarog and the patron saint of livestock Veles were especially revered.  In addition, our ancestors believed in the existence of good and evil spirits, as well as in forest, water and house spirits, capable of interfering in the affairs of mortals, both in order to help them and to harm them. </p><h2>  Holidays </h2><p>  The main occupation and belief of the Eastern Slavs left their mark on their holidays.  In particular, since ancient times they had <span>pagan holidays</span> associated with seasonal agricultural work.  So, at the end of December, children and adults dressed up so that it was difficult to recognize them, and went to the houses of neighbors, demanding gifts for their songs and jokes in the form of edibles.  Moreover, this custom of caroling was inherent not only to the Eastern, but also to the southern and western Slavs.  In addition, Shrovetide, associated with the wires of winter, a summer holiday, which after the adoption of Christianity was named <span>Ivan Kupala Day,</span> and festivities on the occasion of the end of the harvest, when a large loaf of honey was baked from new flour, was also a great holiday. </p><h2>  Cult of ancestors </h2><p>  A special place in the life of the Eastern Slavs was given to the worship of the Sort and Rozhanitsa, personifying great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers and protecting the family and home.  Sometimes they were also called ‚Äúchur‚Äù or ‚Äúschur‚Äù, from which came the word ‚Äúancestors‚Äù and the expression ‚Äúchur me‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúprotect me, grandfather‚Äù.  Our ancestors also believed that from the ‚Äúother world‚Äù, which was controlled by Veles, the ‚Äúdead‚Äù could return to the ‚Äúthis world‚Äù for a short time and harm the living, therefore it was not customary to speak badly of the dead. </p>

    <h2>  Defense against enemies </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the main occupations of the <span>Eastern Slavs in ancient times</span> were quite peaceful, they often had to pick up weapons to protect their settlements.  Our ancestors fought on foot and wore no armor other than a shield.  They used weapons as a sword, a bow with a quiver filled with small arrows, and a long rope, throwing which they strangled the enemy.  Judging by historical documents, the warriors of the Eastern Slavs amazed the enemies by their excellent swimming, diving and long exposure to the water, breathing through reed tubes.  The latter circumstance helped them to ambush lakes and rivers, confusing the opponents.  Later, when the clans appeared leaders, transmitting power by inheritance - the princes, they began to recruit the most powerful and dexterous members of their large family in the squad.  Such warriors were, as they would say today, professional soldiers, and the fighting efficiency of the army, consisting of teams of several princes allies, was incomparably higher than in the case when all the men of the tribe took up arms. </p><p>  Now you know some information regarding the topic ‚ÄúResettlement and occupation of the Eastern Slavs,‚Äù and you can judge for yourself what a giant leap our ancestors made, starting with primitive agriculture, in order to become the first space explorers. </p>
