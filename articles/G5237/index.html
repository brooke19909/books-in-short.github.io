    <h2>  Chau Loan Hotel: traveler reviews </h2><p>  Since the hotel becomes a kind of second home for vacationers during the holidays, it is very important that it suits you if not for all, then at least for most of the parameters.  After all, of course, if you do not want to spend too much on accommodation and consider three-star hotels, then here you should not count on chic rooms and the highest class service here.  However, even unpretentious tourists probably want to live in comfortable, cozy and clean apartments, where there is everything you need.  Therefore, in order not to make a mistake in their choice, travelers ahead of time begin to collect information about different hotels.  Invaluable help in this process is provided by familiarizing yourself with the opinions of those who have previously been to one place or another.  After all, it helps, based on the personal experience of former guests, to compile a close-to-reality view of a particular hotel. </p><p>  Today we suggest you get acquainted with the opinions of Russian travelers about the three-star Chow Loan Hotel.  Judging by the rating of the hotel (4.5 points out of 5 possible), the vast majority of tourists liked it here.  After all, not all hotels are awarded such a rating, even if we consider institutions of a higher price category.  But we learn about everything in detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chau loan hotel vietnam" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1119456.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, according to them, the apartments here are bright, spacious, clean and comfortable.  A big plus is the presence of balconies (in Nha Trang, not all modern hotels can boast of this).  Guests note high-quality stylish furniture made of solid wood, new appliances.  In general, judging by the comments of tourists, the apartments of this hotel have everything that you may need during your stay.  Many guests highlight the fact that both Chow Loan rooms and public areas have free Wi-Fi.  Moreover, the connection speed is quite high.  Also, as pluses, travelers note the availability of a free electronic safe, hairdryer, kettle and refrigerator with a freezer. </p><p>  As for cleaning, there were no complaints from the vacationers.  On the contrary, guests assure that the maids are doing their job perfectly.  So, the cleaning of the rooms was carried out every day.  In addition, towels and bed linen were changed daily, which is not so often seen not only in three-star hotels, but also in higher-class establishments.  Also regularly replenished sets of personal hygiene products, reported tea bags and coffee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chau loan hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1119455.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in the Chau Loan Hotel 3 *, reviews of which we are considering, includes breakfast only.  They are served in the hotel restaurant from 6 to 9 am and are held in buffet style.  I must say that many tourists praise the local breakfasts.  According to them, such a variety of dishes is not always found even in more expensive hotels.  So, in the mornings, guests can have a meal with fo soup, noodles with vegetables, meat or seafood, a side dish, scrambled eggs or omelettes, boiled eggs, sausages, sausages, bread with jam, vegetables and fruits.  In addition, to the delight of tourists, almost every day for breakfast they had the opportunity to try dishes from such delicacies as <span>crocodile</span> and ostrich <span>meat</span> .  Also, many vacationers praised the local coffee. </p><p>  Travelers can have lunch and dinner if desired in the hotel restaurant, but at an additional cost.  Prepare here, according to many guests, very tasty.  However, in the end, the bill comes out slightly more expensive than in cafes and restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel or in the center of Nha Trang.  Therefore, most travelers preferred eating outside the hotel.  Moreover, there is no shortage of cafes here. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Another indisputable advantage of the Chau Loan <span>Hotel (Vietnam, Nha Trang)</span> is its proximity to the sea.  So, according to the guests, the distance to the nearest beach is about 150 meters.  It is public, so you will have to pay extra for renting sun loungers and umbrellas.  By the way, tourists advise those who want to stay on a sun lounger to come to the sea early, as there are not so many sun loungers here, and they are quickly occupied.  However, you can always sit completely free right on the sand, laying a mat or towel.  As for the local beach, then, according to travelers, it is quite clean.  The sea, of course, sometimes takes out various rubbish to the shore, but beach workers constantly clean it.  Entering the water here is quite gentle, so vacationers with children will be comfortable. </p>
