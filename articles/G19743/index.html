On the one hand, this provides a lot of opportunities for individualization, but on the other hand, it confuses the choice.  The fact is that you have to not only understand the design and basic functionality, but also delve into the intricacies of the platform implementation.  The only criterion that remains unchanged throughout perhaps the entire history of the existence of mobile devices is price.  It often becomes crucial.  The Microsoft Lumia 532 device is attractive in many respects, but just in this case everything can solve its cost.  According to many experts, it is seriously overpriced, and only those who truly appreciate Windows Phone and the original design from Microsoft can buy this model.  However, the smartphone has many other advantages, but first things first. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that the gadget will not surprise you with anything revolutionary, and you need to estimate the chances of a purchase by closely comparing its capabilities with the offers of competitors.  But for starters, it's still worth getting acquainted with the potential of Lumiya 532, the characteristics of which can be represented as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Dimensions - 118.9 mm in length, 65.5 mm in width and 11.6 mm in thickness. </li><li>  Mass - 136 g. </li><li>  Screen parameters - 800 x 480 pixels, support for up to 16 million colors. </li><li>  OS platform - Windows Phone in a modified version 8.1. </li><li>  Cameras - the main module is 5 megapixels and front-facing VGA is 0.3 megapixels. </li><li>  The processor - "Qualcomm Snapdragon" at 1.2 GHz. </li><li>  The amount of memory - about 3 GB is available to the owner with the possibility of increasing it by 128 GB due to the card. </li><li>  The size of RAM is 1 GB. </li><li>  The battery is a 1560 mAh lithium-ion battery. </li><li>  Wireless - Bluetooth 4 and Wi-Fi. </li></ul><h2>  Design and features of the case </h2><p>  Do not forget that the matter is still about the actual product of Nokia, a company that always had successful budget employees.  Such models, first of all, differed from the gray mass of competitors by their high-quality assembly and bright design.  In many ways, this was also achieved in the case of Nokia Lumiya 532, which is well-arranged and available in 3 bright colors, not counting white.  The surface of matte plastic is pleasant to the touch - it is widely used in Microsoft smartphones and has almost become a brand feature of the brand.  But the dimensions cause contradictions in the judgments.  Still, the competitors' devices look somewhat more elegant and, most importantly, they are more organic in the hand. </p>

    <p>  The advantage of this smartphone in terms of housing features is the lack of flimsy connections and backlashes.  At the same time, the manufacturer managed to implement the convenient design of Microsoft Lumiya 532 from the point of view of user disassembly.  The device is easy to assemble, while maintaining the reliability of all the mounts.  By the way, it is worth noting the ergonomic placement of controls - from the volume buttons to the headphone jacks everything is in place and does not interfere.  Although the lack of LED backlight and flashlight still upsets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Display specifications </h2><p>  Again, in this part, the features of the budget line of Nokia, which uses the same matrix for the screens, are manifested.  The ‚ÄúLumiya 532‚Äù display was no exception, the characteristics of which can be represented as follows: a 4-inch screen with a resolution of 480 x 800. Actually, this is not the most impressive size, but against the background of competing smartphones it is completely tiny.  Moreover, it is not a matter of resolution, but of the diagonal itself, because of which many experience inconvenience when watching a video. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, the screen has a number of significant improvements that were previously inaccessible to the mass audience of the manufacturer.  For example, the creators worked on brightness, improved automatic backlighting, and provided for a screen lock at the time of approach.  The features of the ‚ÄúNokia Lumiya 532‚Äù display include the technology of saturation of colors, due to which the picture has become more vibrant in dark places and in the sun.  But there are also misses in the implementation of high technology.  So, the advertised oleophobic film did not justify itself, since fingerprints still remain. </p><h2>  Memory and performance </h2><p>  In general, the model has 8 gigabytes of memory, but only 2.7 GB are at the disposal of the user.  If necessary, this amount can be increased using a memory card with a maximum capacity of 128 GB.  You can also use the memory in the OneDrive system, which allocates 15 GB for each owner of the ‚ÄúLumia 532‚Äù.  The characteristics of the RAM are not impressive, since it is only 1 GB, but this will be enough to use games and applications for Windows Phone.  In general, there are no special complaints regarding the performance of this device.  This is greatly facilitated by the processor "Qualcom Snapdragon 200".  This is a quad-core chipset, the frequency of which is up to 1.2 GHz for each core.  According to the owners, the operation of this platform does not cause any particular difficulties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The smartphone has a built-in camera with 5 megapixels, which, by today's standards, is rather not impressive, but makes you analyze the functionality of the module from different angles.  The fact is that the latest models are increasingly proving the following: with officially similar parameters, the devices can produce completely different quality.  In the case of the Lumiya 532 smartphone, the camera's characteristics look promising - video shooting with a frequency of 30 frames and a resolution of 848 x 480 pixels.  Unfortunately, these parameters are not supported by anything special, like autofocus, so you should not expect high quality. </p><p>  However, on a good day with good lighting, you can make a pretty good series of photos.  When working with video, which developers most likely sharpened with a 5-megapixel module, it is also possible to filter sounds that are uncomfortable for human perception.  For example, in the process of video shooting, the Lumiya 532 smartphone can exclude noise from cars or rain getting into the sound track. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The experience of using this smartphone has found advantages in a variety of aspects of operation.  The usual characteristics of the operation of the device should be attributed to the main ones.  Owners claim that audibility and sound quality are generally ahead of most phones in this segment.  In addition, against the background of Android-based devices, the stability of the Lumiya 532 operating system is noted.  Reviews positively note the normal functioning of the smartphone, however, ‚Äúglitches‚Äù and ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù are increasingly found in high-tech gadgets, and the model from Nokia attracts precisely due to the absence of such shortcomings. </p><p>  At the same time, the aesthetic advantages of the smartphone are noted.  Users claim that even after the operation time, the panels do not lose their bright shade, and also retain physical strength.  However, for those who care about the physical integrity of the device, it will not be difficult to choose a cover for the ‚ÄúLumiya 532‚Äù in the most suitable design style. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the device does not stand out anything special, except for the original design and the advantages of the Windows platform.  And if not for the negative sides, then the smartphone could take the place of a leader in its class.  However, this did not happen due to many factors.  Owners, first of all, scolded the creators for saving on the Lumiya 532 camera, reviews of which emphasize that autofocus could significantly improve the quality of images.  Further, the absence of a flashlight and the poor operation of the backlight are noted.  Concerning the corps, opinions are also ambiguous.  Basically, negative operating experience is associated with soiled coatings.  It really remains fingerprints and fingerprints, which indicates the use of low-quality protective film. </p><h2>  Price and competitors </h2><p>  Before moving on to the main competitors of the model, you should pay attention to the positioning of the Lumiya 532.  Its price is 6000 rubles. Therefore, you can attribute the smartphone to strong state employees.  But here he is waiting for the ‚Äúyounger‚Äù model in the family with the index 435. Actually, the devices are similar in appearance, but the ‚Äúhero‚Äù of the review wins due to the processor (4 cores versus 2) and a camera with a large number of pixels.  The difference in price is 4,500 against 6,000 rubles. </p>

    <p>  Representatives of the Androids impose more serious rivalries on the smartphone, including Explay Fresh and <span>Highscreen Zera F. In</span> terms of functionality and performance, these models are perhaps more interesting than the Lumiya 532.  Price smartphone 6000 rubles.  at the same time does not require surcharge.  However, the Android platform in the case of state employees is rather unpredictable.  It is this segment that accounts for the largest number of complaints about the unstable operation of the interface, etc. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  To summarize, the conclusion will be simple.  From the user's point of view, the Microsoft Lumiya 532 phone is a reliable device for making calls and solving simple multimedia tasks.  Moreover, the technical basis for performing these functions is implemented at a decent level.  This is good audibility in a conversation, and stability of signal reception, and impeccable processor performance.  Another thing is that modern users want more, but here the bar itself, set by the developers, is not enough.  And smartphones of the same family with wider functionality and, for example, a better camera cost much more. </p>
