The territory is in a state of revival after its transfer to the hands of the Moscow Patriarchate in 1990.  But much has already been done, services are being held in the cathedrals, the destroyed premises have been restored, and a museum of the history of the monastery has been opened.  To visit this holy place will be interesting and informative to residents and guests of the capital. </p><h2>  The history of the monastery </h2><p>  Any story begins at birth.  The first Moscow monastery, consecrated in the name of the Savior, was created in the 13th century by Prince Daniel.  Since that time, at the request of the rulers, he twice changed his location, until in 1490 he settled on the high <span>bank of the Moskva River</span> , becoming the defender of the capital from attacks by enemies from the south.  The new place of the Spassky Monastery gave it a new name. </p><p>  The monastic life in those years, like the life of all Russia, was not calm.  The walls that became serfs reflected the attacks of the Tatar khans Makhmet-Girey and Kazy-Girey, and Polish-Lithuanian invaders.  And for many years the monastery remained a fortress on the way of the enemy. </p><p>  With the coming to power of the Romanov family, the monastery began its heyday, the reigning persons gave it their special attention.  Mikhail Fedorovich took up the fortification of the walls, later began to change the wooden structure to stone.  For this purpose, experienced craftsmen were specifically requested from the Belozersky Monastery.  The modern Moscow Novospassky Stauropegial Monastery has the same territory and the same layout of buildings as four centuries ago: a pentagon with towers in the corners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

He had large land with villages, forests and meadows.  The Romanovs chose this place for the burial of their relatives, which strengthened the position and wealth of the monastery.  But there were also difficult trials in the life of the monastic fraternity.  Moving the capital to St. Petersburg weakened communication with the reigning house.  Then there was the arrival of Napoleon in Moscow and a big fire.  But the monastery is being restored and continues its missionary work, becoming the center of religious education of the population.

    <p>  After the revolution, the walls of the monastery consisted of a women's prison, a <span>forced labor camp,</span> and the NKVD economic department.  The premises were used for keeping and torturing people, storing documents and vegetables.  The monastery was ravaged, shrines destroyed and desecrated. </p><p>  Only 73 years after these events, the prayer again sounded in the walls of the Novospassky stavropegic male monastery. </p><h2>  Rebirth </h2><p>  August 19 - Day of the Transfiguration of the Lord - the main patronal festival of the monastery.  On this day, thanksgiving prayers are especially hot in these walls for the fact that the Lord did not let the first Moscow monastery die.  She is recovering. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The brotherhood sees its main task as converting people to faith, <span>reviving morality</span> and spirituality.  It is necessary to restore not only brick and mural, but also crippled souls.  There are more and more parishioners here.  For more than 20 years, a <span>Sunday school</span> has been working <span>for children</span> and adults (7 age groups), for more than 15 years there has been a youth association ‚ÄúYoung Russia‚Äù, classes are being held to teach the truths of the Orthodox faith.  Everywhere with people working monastery teachers. </p>

The ruined necropolis of the Romanov family is completely impossible to restore, but in the church of <span>Roman Sladkopevts</span> fragments of plates and found artifacts from burials were carefully collected.  The icon of the Fedorov‚Äôs Mother of God, the patrimonial icon of the Tsars-Romanovs, is also placed here.  Not so long ago, during excavations in the territory of the Kremlin, the burial of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, who was killed by terrorists in 1905, was found.  It has been transferred to the family necropolis and is now resting here.
