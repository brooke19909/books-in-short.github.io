Japan is a country of contrasts, and this city is one of its colors. </p><p>  This is the third largest metropolis of the country, located in the south of the island of Honshu in the Gulf of Osaka.  He made the city a major port and industrial heart of Japan.  Osaka attracts many tourists due to its <span>attractions, entertainment</span> and shopping. </p><h2>  Osaka Castles </h2><p>  One of the main historical and cultural attractions of the city is the Osaka Samurai Castle in Japan.  It impresses tourists not only with its size (its area is one square kilometer, its height is 5 floors, and another 3 floors the castle goes underground), but also with its splendor - its walls are covered <span>with gold leaf.</span>  The castle was built in 1597 by the commander Hideyoshi.  20 thousand people were employed in its construction.  The castle stands on a sheer embankment of huge boulders to protect against attacks. </p><p>  In the XVII century, the castle was destroyed after the civil wars, and subsequent attempts to restore it were prevented by a lightning strike that caused a fire.  Until the XX century, the castle stood in ruins, and only in 1931 the city hall restored the monument of architecture, placing a museum in it.  Then the main tower, destroyed in the XVII century, was restored according to the preserved image on the screen.  True, the Second World War once again affected the construction - the American air raids partially destroyed it. </p><p>  After the war, the castle was restored and opened for tourists.  The interiors of the main tower were completely restored - they are all modern, but the main gates, ditches, several more original buildings, preserved from the Middle Ages.  In the museum itself you can see an interesting exposition telling not only about the castle, but also about Hideyoshi's activities, about samurai and about the history of the region as a whole.  A screen is also stored here, which became the sketch for the restoration of the castle in the 20th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In addition to the largest and most famous Osaka castle, in the city you can also see Himeiji <span>Castle</span> or <span>White</span> Heron <span>Castle</span> .  It was built in the 16th century, and today it is a whole complex of 80 buildings made in the traditional Japanese style.  This castle is no less interesting for tourists, in addition, it is included in the UNESCO heritage list. </p><h2>  Temples of Osaka </h2><p>  Japan, like any other country in Asia, is full of various temples.  There are many of them in the economic center of the country.  There are both Buddhist and Shinto religious buildings.  Moreover, the largest centers of various schools within Buddhism are among the first to be represented. </p><p>  Shitenno-ji, or the temple of the Four heavenly lords, is one of the oldest Buddhist temples in the country, representing its own Vasya school.  The temple was built back in 593 and since then has experienced many shocks - for many centuries it has been destroyed by fires and lightning, typhoons, wars and uprisings, and the bombing of American troops.  And each time the temple was rebuilt.  After the Second World War it was restored, but it was no longer built of wood, as before, but of reinforced concrete.  Tourists who arrived in Osaka in April can attend a festival held annually in the temple and see what the court dances of the bugaku that existed in Japan from the 8th-12th centuries looked like. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another Buddhist temple is also interesting - Issin-ji, mainly because statues from the ashes of dead people are placed on its territory.  From the middle of the 19th century, urns with the ashes of the dead students of this Buddhist school were placed on the territory of the temple.  When there were so many urns that there was nowhere to store them, statues began to be made of dust bound with resin.  A total of 13 statues were made, but 6 of them were damaged in World War II. </p><p>  The Shinto branch is represented in Osaka by such large temples as Temman-gu, built in 949, and Sumiyoshi-taisha, the main sanctuary of the god of the same name.  In the latter, by the way, the oldest Japanese seals are kept. </p><h2>  Contemporary Architecture: Impressive Objects </h2><p>  As the economic heart of the country, Osaka could not do without buildings, striking in scope and manufacturability.  You should start from <span>Kansai Airport.</span>  It is unique in that it was built on a completely artificial island.  And although the cost of its maintenance will never pay off, this is one of a kind airport.  Osaka (Japan) cannot but admire the stubbornness of the townspeople. </p>

    <p>  Despite the presence of ancient temples and castles, the face of the city is still its modern towers and skyscrapers.  Tsutenkaku television tower is considered a real symbol of the city and compared with the Eiffel.  At an altitude of 91 meters there is an observation deck.  She is very popular, but not the only one in the city.  The Umeda Sky Building skyscraper has a platform on the 39th floor.  This skyscraper of two towers and the likeness between them of hanging gardens or a space observatory (whichever you prefer), soaring at an altitude of 170 meters, may also interest tourists in the surrounding park, as well as in a restaurant imitating a 19th-century Japanese street. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Maru Biru is another symbol of the city.  The hotel is located in a skyscraper, and all its rooms have an undeniable advantage - the view from the windows of any room overlooks the main attractions of Osaka. </p><p>  Soaring fountains are also interesting.  Osaka, Japan, Dream Pond - this is the location of a unique fountain, which is based on geometric figures with pouring water, as if suspended in the air.  It looked like a miracle in 1970, when it was installed for the World Exhibition, today it is one of the hallmarks of the city. </p>

    <p>  Another such object, without a doubt, can be called the Osaka railway station, mainly due to its unique watch.  The water flows are controlled by a computer and add up not only the numbers that show the time in Japan, but also beautiful patterns - a bewitching and impressive sight. </p><h2>  Amusement parks </h2><p>  The Japanese know a lot about entertainment and rides.  The main amusement park that Osaka and the entire island of Honshu offer is, of course, Universal.  This is a <span>theme park</span> competing with the famous Disneyland.  There are attractions and entertainments arranged based on films made by Universal Studios - Jurassic Park, Shrek, Jaws, Harry Potter and many others.  The park is so interesting and large (140 hectares) that it is not easy to get around it in a day, so tourists are advised to buy tickets for 2 or 3 days.  Here you can even have a bite to eat - in a pizzeria in the style of the Godfather or in a French cafe. </p><p>  If the attractions at Universal are not enough for a tourist, he will find an amusement park near the village of Tempozan, known throughout the world for its 112-meter-high Ferris wheel, which makes it the largest in the world.  Also in the park there is an aquarium with 35 thousand inhabitants, an observatory, a bird sanctuary, an ultramodern cinema and many other entertainments. </p>

    <h2>  Museums in Osaka </h2><p>  Those tourists who crave Osaka not only for entertainment but also for education should visit the local museums and exhibitions.  As the largest port, Osaka has accumulated exhibits on the history of human-sea relations for many centuries.  Therefore, it is no coincidence that the Osaka Maritime Museum is so interesting.  It is located at the entrance to the Osaka Bay and looks very impressive - a huge steel dome.  Inside 4 floors, on which various ship attributes are placed, as well as a full-size copy of a merchant ship. </p><p>  You can see the most interesting exposition at the Museum of Ceramics, which is located about a kilometer from Osaka Castle.  The city with its noise and bustle remains behind the brick walls of the museum, and away from the hustle and bustle you can plunge into the calm meditative world of ancient Japanese art and admire its best examples.  Fans of contemporary oriental art should go to the art museum, where, in addition to the main exhibition, representing art from different periods, interesting exhibitions are held. </p><p>  The Santori Museum is also known throughout the world for its inverted cone building and a collection of 20th-century graphics. </p><h2>  Oceanarium "Kayukan" </h2>

    <p>  We have already mentioned the aquarium in Tempozan, but it is worth talking about it separately, because not only Osaka, Japan as a whole is proud of it.  The Kayukan Oceanarium is one of the most significant in all of Japan, and it was built in Osaka.  This unique building is like a butterfly spreading its wings and decorated with mosaics.  There are 14 reservoirs in which the inhabitants of the Pacific Ocean are represented.  They are divided into zones according to their habitat.  Here you can find not only fish, but also animals, underwater flora, corals and algae and many other inhabitants of the ocean.  The pavilions are designed so that visitors can see the underwater and surface life of animals, for example, as fur seals bask in the sun and then dive to the depths. </p><h2>  Natural attractions </h2><p>  Despite the industrial development and the forest of glass and concrete skyscrapers, Osaka, like any other Japanese city, values ‚Äã‚Äãits nature and its unique places.  So, a tourist should visit the Tennoji park, which includes a zoo, a greenhouse and a botanical garden.  This is an analogue of the well-known Central Park in Manhattan, the same green oasis in the center of an industrial city.  Here you can see the traditional Japanese garden of Keita-Cohen, which is spread around the pond right behind the art gallery.  This garden once belonged to the richest merchant and was presented to the city along with the mansion.  The garden is part of a large complex with a unique greenhouse - a completely glass building has gathered flowers and plants from different parts of the planet. </p><p>  The local zoo has 1,500 animals and birds, but hummingbirds, as the only one in Japan, and hippos are especially interesting, for which they created conditions close to natural. </p><p>  You can also enjoy Osaka and <span>Honshu</span> from the water, cruising the Santa Maria Bay on a three-deck ship.  On board is not only an open deck for exploring the city and the ocean, but also a restaurant and the Columbus Museum. </p><h2>  Entertainment and nightlife </h2><p>  Connoisseurs of traditional Japanese culture in Osaka are waiting for the Noh and Kabuki theater, Bunraku, as well as sumo fights. </p><p>  Bunraku is a traditional Japanese puppet theater, and Osaka is its birthplace.  Japan is very revered by this art form.  The Bunraku National Theater, located in the Namba quarter, gives performances to everyone, but it is worth considering that tickets are taken apart very quickly. </p><p>  Kabuki is a unique form of theatrical art that combines music, dance and drama.  You can watch the performances at the Setiku-dza Theater.  Especially sophisticated viewers can go to the Osaka Hall But, where they put on plays in a more complex style for perception. </p><p>  Fans of nightlife should go to the Ebisu Basi area, where all the trendy youth of Osaka hang out, or to the Ameriyumur area.  This is a Japanese piece of America with its Statue of Liberty and King Kong.  During the day there are a lot of street musicians and flea markets, and at night local youth drinks and dances in American bars. </p>

    <h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Osaka Trade Center is a Shinsaibashi area.  Here you can buy absolutely everything.  Shinsaibashi has boutiques and shops of all world brands, and a covered street has a huge 600-meter long market.  The area includes the American Village, where you can buy incredible souvenirs in the shops and flea markets. </p><p>  You can also go shopping in Dan Dan Town - this is the Nippombashi district, where the local electronic paradise is located, where you can buy any gadget.  Today in Japan such quarters can be found in any major city. </p>

    <h2>  Cafes and restaurants </h2><p>  Like any metropolis, Osaka can offer tourists any cuisine - from Indian to French, however, to try local specialties, go to the Dotombori or Umeda area.
