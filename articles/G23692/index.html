Where is it more profitable to open a current account for individual entrepreneurs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the article, we will consider why we need a settlement account for individual entrepreneurs. </p><p>  The obligation to use a current account by an individual commercial figure has not been legally approved.  In this case, it is allowed to use only personal cards.  Why do I need a checking account for individual entrepreneurs?  The fact is that without it it is problematic to implement the whole range of payment transactions.  In order to organize full-fledged accounting and for accounting convenience, it is recommended to replace bank cards for personal use with a standard settlement account that is intended for commercial activities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fisher.osu.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cashless payment for un" class="if uuid-3165876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165876.jpg"></div><h2>  Why do I need a checking account for individual entrepreneurs? </h2><p>  For this category of figures, the presence of such an instrument in the bank provides an opportunity to carry out two forms of settlements: in a cashless format and in cash.  Why is such an IP account required: </p><ul><li>  it allows you to conclude agreements of a civil and legal nature, making payments on them; </li><li>  through the account you can make all kinds of transfers of large amounts, which is prohibited for the sphere of cash circulation; </li><li>  there are no restrictions on the time of sending money in favor of legal entities; </li><li>  the obligation to staff can be settled in cashless form. </li></ul><h2>  Justification for the need to open it </h2><p>  In some situations, opening an account at a banking institution is not a right, but an obligation of entrepreneurs.  Do I need such an IP bill?  Yes, it is needed, especially if the proceeds from one of the agreements exceed the limits of 100 thousand rubles.  If it is absent, entrepreneurs have to break one contract with the counterparty into several deliveries at once.  By crushing, the volume of workflow increases and accounting is complicated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The disadvantage of a personal card of individuals is that you cannot bind terminals to them and accept electronic payments through them.  Why else do you need a checking account?  It is necessary to expand the list of payment methods and make various transfers to third parties.  A non-cash form of payment is provided for transactions that are characterized by the transfer of large amounts (more than 100 thousand rubles), as well as for operations related to wholesale trade.  You can not do without such a payment instrument and in the framework of participation in the public procurement system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fool.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to open a current account for un" class="if uuid-3165296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165296.jpg"></div><h2>  What other benefits does a current account have? </h2><p>  What are the conditions for opening a current account for an individual entrepreneur? </p><p>  Cash payments lose their relevance to business due to the high cost of servicing them.  The bank charges a commission for each cash withdrawal and transfer transaction to counterparties.  Is a business account required for individual entrepreneurs?  Of course, since its launch allows you to reduce costs by lowering interest on commission services.  An additional plus is perpetuity.  A card for personal use needs to be updated regularly (re-release of plastic takes up to two weeks, and, at times, is a paid option). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Conducting settlement operations using personal plastic is associated with an increased risk of tax security.  One of the advantages of the considered payment instrument is to minimize the risks of disputes with the Federal Tax Service and the separation of the financial flow of work and personal nature.  The controlling body, if there is no separate account for the individual entrepreneur, can credit all receipts on the card to income.  This entails underpayment of taxes and the occurrence of various lawsuits. </p><p>  The tax authorities have the right to make requests for movement on the accounts of all business entities.  Based on the information received from the financial institution, FTS specialists may make additional assessments on taxes.  Entrepreneurs will have to prove the need to exclude personal income from the tax base in the framework of the judicial procedure (which is not required if there is a separate payment instrument).  If it is impossible for the court to present compelling arguments with documentary evidence for absolutely every operation, a conclusion can be made in favor of the fiscal authorities.  Now let's talk about non-cash form. </p><h2>  Bank transfer for individual entrepreneurs </h2><p>  Today, such a calculation is used quite often, since it is very convenient and profitable.  At the same time, many businessmen are attracted by freedom, but not everyone decides to open their own business.  In fact, there is nothing super complicated, especially if the businessman is registered as an individual entrepreneur.  In this case, they offer convenient forms of taxation with a minimum of paper work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.freep.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="conditions for opening a current account for un" class="if uuid-3165291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165291.jpg"></div><p>  But despite its simplicity, every novice businessman needs to thoroughly research any nuances of this type of activity.  This will certainly avoid a lot of mistakes, and doing business will make it more convenient. </p><p>  So, as it has already been found out, it will become much easier to go about your business if the businessman has his own bank account.  This makes it possible to conduct cashless transfers to customers and suppliers.  This format is very convenient, so it is used quite often.  To be able to accept payments and pay not only in cash, but also in non-cash form, it is required to open bank settlement accounts. </p><h2>  Account is optional </h2><p>  By law, a businessman can carry out his activities without such a payment instrument in a bank, however, they still need to acquire if he wants to be able to use all the advantages.  It should be borne in mind that cash payment is limited by Russian law.  That is, under one agreement, a money transfer of no more than one hundred thousand rubles is allowed.  With non-cash, there is no such problem, and this is its additional advantage.  Under one agreement, you can get an unlimited number of transfers.  In this case, there will be no need to renegotiate the agreement each time certain amounts are reached. </p><h2>  Where is it more profitable to open? </h2><p>  So, we will decide where to open a checking account for individual entrepreneurs. </p><p>  According to the feedback of entrepreneurs, it is especially convenient to do this in such banking organizations: “Point”, “Tinkoff”, “Sphere”, “Alfa-Bank”, “Promsvyazbank”.  First of all, recommendations on where to open a current account for individual entrepreneurs are based on the following facts and advantages: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneyunder30.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="un checkbook" class="if uuid-3165294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165294.jpg"></div><ul><li>  You can apply for these organizations quickly enough; </li><li>  they have the most reasonable prices for cash settlement services; </li><li>  the system of interest accrual on the balance works (usually from 6%); </li><li>  money transfer is carried out instantly; </li><li>  managers themselves go to the IP to open a checking account. </li></ul><p>  Where to open a current account for individual entrepreneurs, it is important to decide in advance.  It is worth noting that this is not a complete list of benefits, but only the main ones. </p><h2>  Checkbook </h2><p>  Opening bank accounts, entrepreneurs expect to use them to pay for expenses that arise during the conduct of business.  However, in the event that there is a need for cash withdrawals, the checkbook for an individual entrepreneur is considered the best option.  What is it for?  First of all, to make payments for purchases and services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bredintlus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="current account for un where is more profitable" class="if uuid-3165295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165295.jpg"></div><p>  The amount is written out on the check, but it is obtained by the bearer.  This makes it possible not to carry cash with you, to make payments if there is no ATM, and the institution is still closed.  A checkbook for an individual entrepreneur can be cash when the amount for issuance is entered, and settlement when funds are indicated for the transfer to the account of the individual or organization that presented the paper.  Most often, the first option is used.  It is believed that such a document provides security, as it is carefully checked, and the check itself is very difficult to fake. </p><p>  How does the tax office verify the current account of an individual entrepreneur?  About it - further. </p><h2>  Tax Checks </h2><p>  Sometimes people are interested in whether this body can check the current account.  It is worth saying that on certain grounds, of course, it can.  That's why she and the state official service.  But there are a number of significant nuances: </p><ul><li>  who owns the payment instrument (individuals, individual entrepreneurs or LLC); </li><li>  legislative basis; </li><li>  cases when inspectors have the right to inspect. </li></ul><p>  So how does the tax check the current account of the individual entrepreneur?  According to the Tax Code, the inspection service has the right to request the following information from a financial institution: </p><ul><li>  opening and closing an account; </li><li>  Actual balance at the time of the request; </li><li>  statement of debit transaction; </li><li>  certificate of funds transfer. <div class="photo" data-original="www.thisismoney.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use a current account un" class="if uuid-3165297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165297.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  The Bank undertakes to provide the requested data within three days.  Verification can also be carried out on the basis of Article No. 122 of the Tax Code for non-payment of income tax, as well as other offenses.  Where it is more profitable to open a current account for an individual entrepreneur, you have to decide for yourself. </p><p>  Now we will see how such a payment instrument is launched and what an individual entrepreneur needs for this. </p><h2>  How to open and use? </h2><p>  Opening such a tool in a modern bank is a simple and convenient procedure.  We will tell you later how to run it for an individual entrepreneur and become a client without leaving home.  Documents will need quite a bit: </p><ul><li>  passport along with registration certificate; </li><li>  tax accounting document; </li><li>  statistics code sheet; </li><li>  seal of the entrepreneur, if available; </li><li>  copy of the license in the event that the relevant activity is licensed. </li></ul><p>  The bank manager will additionally prepare a client application along with a card with sample signatures, an agreement on remote servicing and a USB key for access to online banking. </p><p>  How to use the current account of IP, not everyone knows.  Currently, many banking institutions offer to open this tool through the functions of pre-booking.  To do this, a special form is filled out on the website of the selected financial institution, the details are sent to the electronic box.  Next, you should come up with the papers at the agreed time to the employee accompanying the application, and then complete the registration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="business-review.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how the tax checks the checking account un" class="if uuid-3165292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3165292.jpg"></div><h2>  Cash </h2><p>  We will tell you how to deposit cash into the bank account of an individual entrepreneur. </p><p>  There are four ways: </p><ul><li>  transfer from the card; </li><li>  replenishment through an ATM; </li><li>  replenishment at the bank cash desk; </li><li>  translation through a translation system. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, the opening of a current account is the right, and not the obligation of the businessman.  At his request, a businessman can launch one or more of these payment instruments in rubles or currency in those banking institutions that he chooses.  In addition, IPs are allowed to pay taxes with insurance premiums in cash through a bank.  True, in practice, Internet entrepreneurs can not do without a checking account, as there are a number of reasons for this. </p><p>  We examined why we need a checking account for individual entrepreneurs. </p>
