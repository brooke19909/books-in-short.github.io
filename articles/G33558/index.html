Photos taken here will delight you with their beauty and various entertainments captured on them. </p><p>  On the base you can not only sunbathe and swim, but also conquer the gym, ride <span>sailing catamarans,</span> ATVs and bicycles, sail and enjoy the fresh air. </p><p>  Especially tourists admire the clear water in the bay.
