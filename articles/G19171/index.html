    <p>  To date, there are very few lenders who can provide a large amount of money on credit based on only one identity document.  Nevertheless, some citizens do not have the opportunity to confirm their registration or they are simply registered at a different address in an apartment that is not located in the Russian Federation. </p><p>  What to do in this situation?  Can I get a loan without registration?  Let's consider this question in more detail. </p><h2>  Features of loans without a residence permit </h2><p>  Although there are not many, but, nevertheless, there are organizations in the territory of the Russian Federation where clients can obtain loans without a residence permit in Moscow or a permanent place of registration.  Such banks include Sberbank and Rosbank.  These companies have programs for people without a permanent job or residence in the region where the loan office is located.  In this case, obtaining a loan without registration in the passport is not so difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, it is worth considering that a citizen has the opportunity to get a loan.  For her, it is enough to provide only a document that confirms where exactly the person lives.  Temporary registration is valid for several categories of individuals.  First of all, these are citizens of other countries, as well as those people who do not have citizenship.  <span>The maximum period of temporary registration is</span> usually 90 days.  Based on this, it is easy to guess that you can get a loan without registration in Moscow for no more than 3 months.  Otherwise, the borrower simply will not be able to leave the territory of the Russian Federation until the loan is paid off, which contradicts the registration law. </p><h2>  MFI </h2><p>  Of course, getting money from a well-known bank is not so easy if a person does not have a permanent residence permit, registration or other supporting documents. </p>

    <p>  In this situation, you can contact the MFI.  In organizations of this type are usually more loyal to these categories of borrowers. </p><p>  Today, the market has a huge number of companies providing such loans.  However, if a borrower cannot confirm a residence permit even in another region, then it will be impossible to obtain a loan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If there is no registration in the passport, then you can apply for a loan only in companies that provide microloans.  However, in this case, the borrower will also have to meet certain requirements.  For example, to obtain a microloan it is necessary to confirm that a person has already been a client of a bank and regularly paid debts.  You will also need to clarify a permanent job and stable earnings. </p><p>  In some situations, you must additionally indicate your property as collateral. </p><p>  If the borrower can only provide temporary registration at the place of his stay and he does not have any registration in the passport (regardless of the country), then most likely he will be refused a loan.  And this applies to any type of organization. </p>

    <h2>  <span>How to get a loan</span> without a permanent residence permit </h2><p>  Obviously, getting a loan in this situation will be very difficult, but there are several options that may work.  The borrower must first visit the bank through which his salary is accrued.  If a citizen of the Russian Federation is a holder of a salary card of a certain banking organization, then, most likely, certain benefits are provided for him.  As a rule, in this case there is no need to provide additional documents.  That is, by and large, a person can get a loan without registration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, one must be prepared for the fact that in such a situation, the borrower will expect higher interest rates on overpayments.  In addition, you will need to indicate your work phone number so that the representative of the credit organization can call the boss and clarify whether the potential borrower really works in a particular organization.  The same goes for retirees. </p><p>  The most loyal programs, which can be used to obtain loans without a residence permit, operate at Alfa Bank and Sberbank.  Accordingly, the longer a person has been holding a card, the more data the bank organization has regarding monetary movements in the accounts of the borrower.  If they see that over the past few years quite impressive amounts of money have constantly been credited to the account, then this will be a kind of guarantee that a person will be able to properly pay debts.  In all other situations, the only option left is to contact a microloan organization, where it will be possible to get a cash loan without registration with the least problems. </p><h2>  Kredito24 </h2><p>  According to customer reviews, in this organization it is very convenient to arrange loans online.  At the same time, the decision to issue a loan is made very quickly, within a few minutes.  At the same time, there is a flexible credit system.  The loan repayment period without registration is from 1 week to 30 days.  Moreover, the client can at any time change the repayment period of his loan. </p>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Today, only those who are already clients of the organization can get a loan from a bank without registration.  In other situations, it makes sense to apply for microcredit, but you should be very careful.  When choosing an organization, it is necessary to clarify its status, availability of a valid license and other information.  In order not to overpay the crazy interest in the end, you should carefully study the contracts before signing them.  Otherwise, taking a few thousand rubles, you can even say goodbye to your apartment or car.  Remember, there are a huge number of scammers.  In order not to get caught by them, it is worth giving preference only to serious organizations.  It is best to preliminarily check with the bank, perhaps it has a program, under the terms of which you can not provide additional data. </p>
