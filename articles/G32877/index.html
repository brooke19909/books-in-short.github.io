Children from all over Russia come here. </p><h2>  How did the camp begin? </h2><p>  The first shift was back in 1960, in July.  Then from 37 regions of Russia, the camp was visited by 520 children.  The workers were Artek counselors in the amount of 14 people, including Andreev A.I., who headed the "Eaglet". </p><p>  Then the camp was very small.  It consisted of a pioneer pavilion with a library and a playroom, left-luggage offices, showers, a dining room, a wooden stage and 28 tarpaulin tents along the sea.  The solemn line in honor of the opening was held in 1960 on July 12.  The duration of this shift was 45 days. </p><p>  In the afternoon, the guys planted trees and flowers, cleaned up garbage, thereby helping builders.  And in the evening we sat by the fire and sang songs.  Throughout the shift, they were instilled with special social ideals: </p><ul><li>  to be a citizen and patriot, a fighter and a hard worker, a devoted friend and comrade, a person of diverse culture; </li><li>  have high morality, deep knowledge, live in the name of the common good. </li></ul><p>  The image of a brave boy in a red-star Budenovka helped children evaluate their actions. </p>
