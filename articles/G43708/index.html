Foreign policy and its outcome</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For Russia at the end of the XI and the first quarter of the XII century, the appearance of such a ruler as Vladimir Monomakh was a salvation in many directions: culture, foreign and domestic politics, literature.  According to eyewitness accounts, he was not only a wise statesman, but also a very <span>kind person,</span> although many of his actions are interpreted differently.  Vladimir Monomakh, whose foreign policy was distinguished by rather strict methods, made him respect all the neighboring states united by him in Russian lands.  Consequently, such a quality as kindness extended only to fellow tribesmen, who, in turn, were completely subordinate to the will of the Kiev prince. </p>

    <h2>  Long way to power </h2><p>  The grandson of the famous <span>Yaroslav the Wise, the</span> son of his beloved Vsevolod and (presumably) the daughter of the Byzantine emperor Konstantin Monomakh, from whom he inherited the nickname, Vladimir Vsevolodovich early began to delve into the intricacies of government.  In Pereyaslavl-South, he began his career as a commander, managing his father's squad.  In this capacity, he suffered several defeats on the battlefield.  This gave him further experience in waging war and negotiating with the enemy.  During the reign of Smolensk and Chernihiv lands, he gains authority among the population and forms a squad, which is clearly organized and competent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Already at this stage, the commitment to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfeudal separation is seen, with the common interests of all Russian lands, which will be implemented by the future Kiev prince Vladimir Monomakh.  Its foreign policy consists in tough suppression of attacks on subordinate territories by both steppe nomads and influential states, even such as Byzantium.  After the death of his father, who ruled Kiev, he could seize power by force, but made a wise decision to follow the order of inheritance created by Yaroslav the Wise, and not to foment the already complicated relations between the princes and brothers.  According to the principle of seniority, Svyatopolk began to rule Kiev lands, and Vladimir received Pereyaslavl as reign.  At this time, he actively supported his cousin.  Conventions of the ruling Russian princes became a tradition, at which common problems were discussed and joint actions were stipulated for the defense of the state from the Polovtsian raids. </p><h2>  Foreign and <span>domestic policy</span> during the reign of Vladimir Monomakh </h2>

    <p>  Since <span>1113,</span> after the death of Svyatopolk, Vladimir Monomakh was called up to Kiev lands, but the principle of seniority was violated, Oleg should become the next prince.  In the future, this circumstance will significantly complicate relations between relatives and lead to war.  The rule of his predecessor caused widespread discontent, especially among the poor.  The unrest that arose about this turned into a turmoil that was quickly suppressed by the new <span>Kiev prince Vladimir</span> Monomakh. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The policy of Vladimir Monomakh can be traced quite clearly.  This is the union of all disparate Slavic lands under the authority of one ruler.  The principalities ruled by his brothers and sons should be clearly subordinate to Kiev in the economic and political field.  The unification of the Russian lands led to a significant increase in the military power of the state and its formation as a European power, which the rest of the nations could not ignore.  The policy of the ruler Vladimir Monomakh inside the country was tight with respect to the princes, whose power he limited and granted some concessions to the working people.  His ‚ÄúCharter‚Äù was aimed at supporting artisans, smerds, who, through their labor, ensured the country's economic stability. </p><p>  On the other hand, the prince toughly acted on the battlefield.  The Polovtsy for a long time scared their children by his name (Vladimir Monomakh).  The foreign policy of his reign is defined as the conduct of constant bloody wars aimed at maintaining the authority of the state and protecting its borders.  He is constantly struggling with the steppes, scores many victories and concludes peace treaties.  Since 1116, the Polovtsian raids on Russia completely ceased.  The foreign policy of Vladimir Monomakh regarding Byzantium is also aggressive.  Since 1116, he fought with the Greeks, captures several cities on the Danube.  The result of the campaign is a peace concluded in 1123.  The granddaughter of Monomakh becomes the wife of the Byzantine emperor.  At the same time, peace treaties are signed and dynastic marriages are concluded with the rulers of many European states (Hungary, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway). </p>

    <h2>  Cultural heritage </h2><p>  During the formation of Russia as a single state, a rather low standard of living of the population is observed.  In fact, the lands inhabited by Slavic tribes continue to exist in the primitive system.  The level of culture of medieval European countries at that time was much higher, but Vladimir Monomakh, whose foreign policy implied integration into Europe, very quickly brought the country to a new stage of development, while not losing the originality of Slavic values ‚Äã‚Äãthat exist today.  His rule was marked by the erection of many churches and temples, the development of writing and literature, architecture and architecture. </p>

    <h2>  Historical meaning </h2><p>  In 1125, Vladimir Monomakh died.  None of the previous and subsequent rulers received such praise in the annals and folk tales.  He became famous as a wise and fair prince, a talented and successful commander, an educated, intelligent and kind person.  His activity in rallying Russian lands and suppressing internecine wars is the basis for the establishment of a strong and united state, which first entered the international level as a reliable partner and formidable enemy. </p>
