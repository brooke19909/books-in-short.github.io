In addition to convenient beaches and a clean calm sea, this village offers its guests a huge number of different attractions and, of course, well-developed infrastructure.  The resort is quite old and most of the hotels here were built in the middle of the last century.  However, despite this, many local hotels are quite comfortable, as they are periodically reconstructed.  Good accommodation is offered in Rimini, for example, the Marinella hotel. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel and how to get to it </h2><p>  The location of the Marinella 3 * hotel (Rimini) is Miramare di Rimini, a lively beautiful and very popular tourist area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village.  This hotel is built right on the seashore.  The distance from it to the beach is only 100 m. That is, tourists need to go to the coastline for no more than 2-3 minutes. </p>

    <p>  About 100 km from Rimini is the very popular resort of Bologna.  Also in the immediate vicinity of the village are the cities of Pizzo and Ravenna.  The capital of Italy, Rome, is quite far from this resort - at a distance of 300 km.  The international airport is approximately a 10-minute drive from the hotel.  Tourists who arrived in Rimini by plane can get to the hotel by taxi or public transport.  A bus stop is just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel.  Also, tourists are provided with a shuttle by the Marinella 3 * hotel (Rimini). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This hotel is located in one of the most vibrant areas of Rimini.  Therefore, hotel guests can use the infrastructure of the city to the full.  However, unfortunately, this arrangement has one big drawback.  In the evenings, the street next to the hotel is very noisy.  All sorts of discos and parties can prevent guests from sleeping. </p><h2>  What is a hotel: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  The rooms in the Marinella 3 * hotel are rented in a small four-story building of a modern building.  The hotel building does not look very original, but neat and solid.  In the evenings, the hotel building is beautifully illuminated.  Inside the hotel is also quite impressive. </p><p>  Most of the tourists commented on this hotel.  According to many vacationers, this hotel, albeit not chic, but quite decent.  In addition, renting a room here is much cheaper than in many other complexes. </p><p>  The rooms at the Marinella 3 * hotel <span>(Rimini), reviews</span> of which on the Network are mostly only positive, are rented exclusively to non-smoking guests.  In some cases, pets are allowed in the hotel rooms.  The reception at this hotel is located on the ground floor.  A dining room is next to it. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel is located very close to the airport, the noise of airplanes does not interfere with its guests in the rooms.  The location of the hotel in this regard, tourists generally find actually very convenient. </p>

    <p>  In any case, all the tourists who have ever lived in Marinella Rimini 3 * believe that the rooms here are quite clean.  The maids in the rooms are cleaned very often and quite carefully.  Towels and bed linen at this hotel are also almost always clean.  True, sometimes it happens that they are replaced only after the tenants put them in the room on the floor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The showers in the rooms of the Marinella Hotel 3 * (Rimini), unfortunately, did not deserve good reviews.  Hot water here is far from always.  Sometimes the hotel is turned off and cold.  There is no shower tray in the bathroom.  Water drains simply into a hole in the floor.  Actually showers themselves have a very small area.  Therefore, when tourists take water procedures, water is sprayed on the toilet, and on the sink, and even on the walls.  As a result, the showers are always damp, and in some cases also smells like sewers.  Actually the water itself in this hotel is very soft and always clean.  This, of course, can be attributed to the advantages of the hotel. </p><p>  Apart from not very comfortable showers, some tourists also consider some of the drawbacks in the rooms of this hotel to the fact that they have to pay separately for air conditioning.  Using it costs about 5 euros.  Many vacationers find the wake-up call service provided at the hotel very convenient. </p><h2>  Marinella 3 * (Rimini): service reviews </h2><p>  Most of its guests consider the hotel workers to be rather helpful and polite.  Hotel residents are trying to solve problems arising from residents promptly.  Unfortunately, none of the workers in the complex speak Russian.  The only exception is the wife of the hotel owner, Ukrainian by nationality.  With any serious problems, tourists can contact her directly. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  In order to make guests at this hotel feel comfortable, they are provided with a number of various additional services on its territory.  Oversized items, for example, hotel residents can leave in a luggage storage room.  The hotel also has free parking.  Tourists can go to the upper floors by elevator. </p><p>  This hotel also has a small business corner.  If necessary, guests can send a fax to the desired location or make a photocopy of documents.  Some travelers book room service at this property.  Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews of tourists about the hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel "Marinella" - budget.  Therefore, the services here, unfortunately, are not provided to tourists so much.  However, many vacationers consider this hotel in the price / quality ratio pretty good.  The lack of a pool, of course, can be attributed to some of the disadvantages of the hotel.  But then the hotel has free Wi-Fi.  In public places, the speed of the Internet at this hotel is pretty good.  But in most rooms, unfortunately, you cannot use the Network. </p><p>  Also, this hotel deserved good reviews for the availability of free parking.  True, the size of the hotel parking is small.  In order to put a car here, you need to take a queue.  However, there is also a large private paid parking on site.  If necessary, the car can be left here. </p><p>  Travelers in the hotel rooms tourists quickly enough.  For too long, the registration of newly arrived guests is not necessary.  For new residents with children while waiting, the host of the hotel in some cases even offers a free lunch.  In addition, guests at this hotel can use the express check-in / check-out service for a fee. </p><h2>  Hotel Food Reviews </h2><p>  Marinella is a hotel where vacationers usually book half board.  That is, tourists are served breakfast and dinner.  For meals at the hotel, his former guests have basically only good reviews.  Meals at the hotel are delicious and fresh.  In particular, residents praise the meat food offered in the hotel's dining area.  Scanty breakfasts and dinners at this hotel none of its former guests considers.  To some of the shortcomings of the hotel menu, many tourists attribute only monotony.  In the buffet you can take soups, pasta, ham, cheese, pastries, vegetables, etc. </p>

    <p>  Another drawback of the hotel buffet is the presence of queues.  To be late for breakfast and dinner at this hotel is not worth it.  Otherwise, other residents will take out the best dishes. </p><p>  In addition to the dining room, the hotel also has a small bar.  Here, if desired, you can order any drinks. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Most tourists believe that the Hotel Marinella 3 * hotel is suitable only in order to spend the night in it.  This hotel does not provide too much entertainment to its guests.  However, the hotel still sometimes hosts discos on the terrace.  The hotel also organizes karaoke from time to time. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  The proximity to the sea is what distinguishes the Marinella 3 * hotel.  Rimini and Ravenna are cities offering vacationers a very good beach holiday.  The coastline is directly across the road from the Marinella Hotel.  Guest reviews of the beach hotel deserved very good.  It has considerable length and width.  And therefore, there are almost never large clusters of vacationers on it.  The coastline at this place is covered with sand.  Therefore, sunbathing on the beach is very convenient.  Many tourists do not even rent sun loungers on the seashore in this place - they relax on rugs. </p><p>  Not far from the hotel Marinella 3 * (Rimini) is located beach number 62, considered the cleanest in Italy.  If desired, hotel guests can visit him.  There are other UNESCO Blue Flag beaches in Rimini. </p><p>  The infrastructure on the coastline located next to the hotel is very well developed.  Merchants are constantly walking along the beach, offering sweets, souvenirs and other small goods to vacationers.  There are cafes on the coastline where you can dine inexpensively.  Dishes are served in most cases, freshly prepared and delicious. </p>
