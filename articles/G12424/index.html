  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cenozoic era</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The era of Earth evolution lasted a different number of years.  They included various periods.  The Cenozoic era is the latest geological era.  Its duration is 65 million years.  The Cenozoic era is divided into three periods: anthropogenic, Neogene and Paleogene.  Each of them, in turn, is divided into eras. </p><p>  The Cenozoic era continues today. </p><p>  The Paleogene period includes Oligocene, Eocene, Paleocene, Neogene - Pliocene and Miocene, Anthropogenic - Holocene and Pleistocene. </p><p>  How life went on in the Cenozoic era </p><p>  65 million years ago, the <span>Paleogene period</span> began <span>.</span> </p><p>  The first era was the Paleocene.  The Cenozoic era began with it.  At that time, the continents continued their movement, and Gondwana (the great mainland) continued to split.  <span>South America</span> turned out to be completely cut off from the world <span>.</span> </p><p>  On land mammals, early primates began to develop, insectivores and rodents appeared.  Large representatives of both herbivores and predators appeared.  In the sea waters, new species of sharks and other predatory fish began to develop. </p><p>  Among the plants, flower species began to spread. </p><p>  The Eocene era began fifty-five million years ago.  The main continents began to settle down approximately the same as today.  South America has ceased to be associated with Antarctica, while India has moved to Asia.  Australia and Antarctica began to diverge. </p><p>  On land lemurs, bats, large herbivores (ancestors of cows, horses, elephants, pigs and others) appeared.  Other animal species have also evolved. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The number of freshwater <span>fish</span> increased <span>, whales</span> returned to the water. </p><p>  Palm trees began to grow in temperate latitudes, forests of many parts of the Earth were distinguished by lush vegetation. </p><p>  The Oligocene era began thirty-eight million years ago.  The Australian continent and Antarctica were completely divided, and India crossed the equatorial line.  The climate on the planet has become cooler.  An extensive ice sheet formed over the South Pole.  This has led to the expansion of land and a decrease in water volume.  In connection with the cooling, the vegetation also changed.  Instead of <span>tropical forests</span> , steppes spread. </p><p>  Herbivorous mammals began to actively develop in the steppe territories.  New <span>species of hares,</span> rabbits, rhinos appeared, the first representatives of ruminants appeared. </p><p>  Twenty-five million years ago, the Neogene Period began.  It includes two eras. </p><p>  During the Miocene, almost all the continents continued to move.  As a result of the clash of Africa with Europe and Asia, the Alps formed.  After the union of India and Asia, the Himalayas formed.  At the same time, the Andes and the Rockies arose.  At the same time, the Australian and South American continents remained isolated from the world.  Each continent has developed its own unique vegetation and wildlife.  The spread of the ice sheet to Antarctica provoked even greater cooling. </p><p>  During the Miocene, animals migrated from one continent to another. </p><p>  Five million years ago, the Pliocene began. </p><p>  The continents were located almost in the same places as today.  The cooling and spread of the steppes continued. </p><p>  Mammals and herbivores actively developed.  The horse has evolved.  The birthplace of this animal is <span>North America.</span>  From there, horses spread throughout the planet. </p><p>  Towards the end of Pliocene, North and South America became interconnected.  On the formed "land bridge" the movement of animals from one continent to another began.  Researchers suggest that at this time many species died out due to the escalated struggle for survival. </p><p>  Two million years ago the Anthropogenic period began. </p><p>  The first era - the Pleistocene - is characterized by the spread of the ice sheet.  At this time, periods of warming and cooling alternated, and sea level also fluctuated.  It should be noted that this situation still persists. </p><p>  Many species of animals have adapted to the climate.  The first people appeared. </p><p>  About ten millennia ago, the Holocene began - the second era of the Anthropogenic period. </p><p>  The climate was reminiscent of modern, periods of cooling and warming alternating.  The development of the <span>human race has</span> begun <span>.</span> </p>
