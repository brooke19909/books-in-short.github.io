Reviews, prices, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From all over Europe, many travelers around the world choose Bulgaria for their holidays.  It impresses with architecture, history and culture.  Excellent service, mild climate, relatively low prices and hospitality of the population - these are the advantages that make traveling to Bulgaria interesting and unforgettable. </p><p>  Bulgaria is well known to the citizens of Russia since the days of the USSR.  Already in those years, many went to rest in a friendly country, and the <span>resorts of Bulgaria</span> work year-round - in winter skiing, in summer - beach.  The language is very similar to Russian, in many hotels the hotel speaks good Russian and understands visitors.  A visa is required to enter the country.  Beach holidays are in demand due to the large number of sandy beaches, clean and very long.  Many of them have been given the ‚Äúblue flag‚Äù - this is a symbol of environmental cleanliness, which is issued by the European Union.  Most <span>hotels in Bulgaria were</span> built during the USSR, but in recent years they have been renovated.  Currently, the country has an excellent fund of hotels of any level - from budget to exclusive.  The population is very hospitable, each guest is greeted with polite and high quality service.  The cuisine is distinguished by familiar dishes with some national specialties; the prices in restaurants and cafes are quite reasonable. </p><h2>  Nessebar </h2><p>  The town of Nessebar is located on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, on a peninsula, 30 km from the large city of Burgas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park nessebar" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20113/455870.jpg" width="300"></div>  The distance to the world famous resort Sunny Beach is about 3 km.  Nessebar is considered one of the most ancient cities in Europe.  In 1956, it received the status of a museum city, and since 1983 it has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund.  The population of the city does not exceed 10,000 inhabitants, it occupies a small area, but, despite this, it is rich in attractions and can offer tourists an interesting excursion program.  In the city there are ruins of fortresses and temples, wooden buildings of the times of the XIX century, numerous architectural monuments.  Nessebar is divided into New and Old Towns: in New there are most modern buildings and hotels, and Old is located on a separate small peninsula, which is separated by a narrow strait.  The old city allows you to plunge into the atmosphere of the Middle Ages - wooden buildings and museums attract researchers of antiquity.  The city has a port where many ships from Europe constantly arrive.  Part of Old Nessebar went under water during the flood, in good weather, sunken monuments can be seen while walking on a boat.  All 40 temples in the city survived - and this is considered to be a miracle.
