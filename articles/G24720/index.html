It is located near the city of Nilsia, and from the regional center of Kuopio, approximately 70 kilometers.  The resort itself is located directly on Lake Suvari in the Tahkovuori Mountain region. </p><p>  For the first time, tourists began to receive tourists here in 1968, when the first ski slope was launched.  Since then, the resort has constantly changed.  Now he has acquired the distinctive features of a modern international tourist center. </p><h2>  About the resort </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in the resort of Tahko" class="if uuid-2978550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2978550.jpg"></div><p>  Tahko in Finland is one of the best resorts in the central and southern parts of the country.  Here there are as many as 23 ski slopes, half of which has a length of more than one kilometer, and elevations - up to two hundred meters. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this place is famous not only for highways, but also for the presence of special areas for beginners and children.  A separate lift is available for snowboarders. </p><p>  In Tahko (Finland), it seems that everyone here is doing for people.  For example, on a ski lift, you can get to the ski slope directly from the parking lot, so you don‚Äôt have to go anywhere, loaded with equipment.  A safe belt lift will help even the smallest skiers to conquer the slope, which they can afford. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ski trips are regularly arranged at the Tahko ski resort in Finland, where vacationers have the opportunity to get acquainted with the winter landscapes of this place.  Tourists especially enjoy these events.  Cross-country skiing trails run across the ice of a frozen lake and its diverse landscape.  Moreover, part of the route is also lit. </p><p>  It is believed that the Tahko ski resort in Finland is an ideal place for entertainment and a comfortable stay.  On the slopes there are several cozy restaurants where you can take a break, drink coffee, taste fresh pastries, order a drink for every taste.  When dusk descends on this place, incendiary parties begin that can warm even in the most severe frosts. </p><p>  In Tahko (Finland), there are two rental points where you can rent snowboards, the necessary ski equipment, sets of cross-country skis, and if necessary, lubricate and prepare them before going to the track. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski resort Tahko" class="if uuid-2978552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2978552.jpg"></div><p>  The infrastructure of the Tahko ski resort is able to impress even demanding athletes.  The choice for tourists here is represented by more than 800 accommodation options of various levels.  These are fashionable hotels, and cottage villages, and apart-hotels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Currently, this resort has 23 slopes and 14 lifts.

For example, near Tahko there is an arena for two thousand spectators, where concerts and even opera performances are constantly held. </p><p>  Near the slopes of this resort there is Achodansaari island.  It is considered a center for spending free time and various courses in the spirit of pietism.  The fund with the same name, which owns it, considers its main goal the need to promote the historical, church and cultural heritage of the leader of pietism Paavo Ruotsalainen, to support the spiritual life in the district in the appropriate spirit.  There is a museum on the island itself, which also belongs to the foundation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Living conditions - cottages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tahkoexperience.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in the resort of Tahko" class="if uuid-2978557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2978557.jpg"></div><p>  This resort offers a variety of accommodation options.

The hotels have nightclubs, bars and restaurants, there are congress halls for business meetings. </p><p>  Cottages in Tahko in Finland - one of the most common and sought after accommodation options.  The most budgetary will cost you about 150 euros per day.  That is how much a double room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã24 square meters 200 meters from the slopes will cost. </p><p>  It offers views of the parking lot and the mountainsides.  The room itself has everything you need for cooking (oven, electric stove, microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher, coffee maker), TV, separate beds for two guests, which can be connected.  It also offers its own electric sauna, toilet and shower, the possibility of additional accommodation for one adult or child for a fee. </p><p>  Convenience lies in the fact that in the building there is a pizzeria, the cottage is located in the center of Tahko.  Of the obvious disadvantages - the small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room and the insufficient amount of hot water, which may not be enough for uneconomical use. </p><p>  Alternatively, you can rent a cottage with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã38 square meters.  He is in Maaninka.  From here, about 50 kilometers to Tahko and less than 30 kilometers to another ski resort - "Kasurila".  This place is ideal for a relaxing and measured vacation in the countryside.  It features a wood sauna. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Many people prefer to stay in Tahko in hotels (Finland).

The ski slopes in Tahko are located within walking distance from civilization, which is considered an obvious plus.  On the slopes there is a wide range of opportunities, a well-groomed network of tracks attracts athletes of different ages and training. </p><p>  There is enough space for snowboarders who will be able to demonstrate their skills.

Here regularly there is a need to book slopes.  To do this, you need to check the availability of free time in a special table, and then send the appropriate application to the email address.  It should indicate the time, date, name of the club, contact person with an international phone number, discipline and group size. </p><p>  Applications are accepted in the order they are received.  The only condition is that they should be sent at least 48 hours before the start of the reservation. </p><p>  The head coach is responsible for creating the track.  It is important to ensure that the reserved area is equipped with the signs provided for this.  In this case, all team members and equipment must remain inside the reserved part of the slope. </p><h2>  Travel Impressions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tahko.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in the resort of Tahko" class="if uuid-2978547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2978547.jpg"></div><p>  In reviews of Tahko, tourists often note a large number of accommodation options, a markedly developed infrastructure. </p><p>  Many are satisfied with almost everything, from living.  It is especially convenient to stay in hotels or cottages within walking distance of the ski lifts.  The rooms are carefully thought out to make tourists as comfortable as possible.  There is a clothes dryer, own kitchen, sauna. </p><p>  There is a separate locker in the basement for storing inventory.  The variety and number of slopes can impress even the most demanding skier. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecrowdedplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tahko resort in Finland" class="if uuid-2978545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2978545.jpg"></div><p>  Of the negative aspects, travelers say that the organizers do not prepare the tracks well.  Some had to deal with a situation when only four out of 23 were open, and even those badly broken. </p><p>  In addition, on most slopes, too steep and short zones for braking, which is extremely difficult for beginners.  The only outlet for cross-country skiing is well-prepared and varied.  Compared to other Finnish resorts, this one is notable for its high prices and crowding. </p><p>  Some leave here completely disappointed.  Just because of the unjustifiably high cost, a small number of open routes and their unsatisfactory level of training.  Because of this, the whole impression of a holiday spoils.  Long lines are almost constantly formed on the lifts, and by the middle of the day, the tracks are simply smashing to smithereens.  And all this at a high cost, clearly not in line with the level of service provided here, on which customers rely. </p>
