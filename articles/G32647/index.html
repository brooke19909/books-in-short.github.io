She relates her style to portrait photojournalism.  Her photos are very light, even airy.  They convey the beauty of every single moment.  Anna is very fond of the special light in photographs, so she often shoots at sunrise or sunset.  In each work, Anna pays special attention to various trifles.  After all, it is they who create the atmosphere that was on the day of the shooting, and which is so easy to forget over time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Makarova photographer" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44225/1432397.jpg" width="600"></div>  Anna will not allow this to happen.  Her main <span>motto in life:</span> "Beauty in all its manifestations."  In work, she also strives for excellence.  In her opinion, in order to beautifully remove a wedding, it is necessary to love it, to be with it, so to speak, on the same wavelength.  Anna has no doubt that she was created for this work, because weddings are her weakness, she adores them.  Her goal is to create works that people will remember for a lifetime.  Anna wants her clients to open a photo album decades later and experience memories on the most important day of her life.  In order for the photographs to convey the loud laughter of the guests, the smell of flowers, the emotions when pronouncing the cherished ‚ÄúI agree‚Äù and ‚ÄúI agree‚Äù.  Anna Makarova chose one of the most difficult professions - working with people, but she is given to her with such ease, because she really loves them.
