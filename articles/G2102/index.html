Smartphone Comparison</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Huawei is the most famous Chinese brand in both the domestic and European markets.  The manufacturer has long occupied its niche and delights loyal fans with new high-tech gadgets.  Relatively recently, the company released a rather controversial line of Honor 8, combining as many as three smartphones in them.  Each of its price category.  As a result of this, the question arose sharply.  <span>Honor 8 or Honor 8</span> Lite?  The Pro version is not considered, because it is quite expensive.  To make the right choice, you need to thoroughly study the characteristics of each model and only then decide whether it is worth overpaying for the "full" version.  In the meantime, recall the main milestones of the development of Huawei. </p><h2>  "From rags to riches", or Huawei Success Story </h2><p>  The Chinese brand was born in 1987.  Then the company was engaged in the development and production of various network equipment.  Everyone knows her modems well.  But in addition to these devices, devices for organizing wireless communications, network cabinets, antennas and other equipment were also produced.  In the field of smartphone production, the company tried its hand in 2009.  Their first model was the communicator Huawei U8230.  It is widely used in the Republic of Belarus thanks to the local mobile operator Life, which offered a gadget in installments on very favorable terms.  But since then, a lot of water has flowed, and the current Huawei Honor 8 and Honor 8 Lite can not be compared with the first smartphone. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that all the time the development and formation of Huawei was accompanied by some kind of scandal.  Charges of industrial espionage were especially frequent.  However, the cunning company blamed all the responsibility on "unscrupulous employees."  Thus, not a single scandal hurt her in any way.  And it would be foolish not to take advantage of the activities of these very ‚Äúunscrupulous employees‚Äù.  There is an opinion that it was through espionage that the company was able to "rise" and conquer a decent part of the mobile market.  Let them think what they want, but the fresh smartphones Huawei Honor 8 and Honor 8 Lite say the opposite.  Gadgets turned out worthy.  Now compare these two devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The face of Honor 8 </h2><p>  The Huawei Honor 8 smartphone is made of metal and lined with glass panels.  It looks beautiful.  But glass very quickly collects fingerprints.  Even the <span>oleophobic coating</span> on both sides of the device does not really help.  The entire front part is occupied by a screen.  There are no control buttons under it.  They are located on the screen, and the order in which they can be displayed can be customized as users wish.  On the rear panel is a dual camera module, an LED flash from two sectors and a fingerprint scanner.  The speaker is located at the end.  The second gap for him is actually a sham.  At the bottom there is also a connector for charging and a conversational microphone.  On the top, the 3.5 headphone jack is habitually housed.  The screen of the smartphone is covered with a protective glass with a 2.5D effect.  Typical "average" design. </p>

    <h2>  The look of Honor 8 Lite </h2><p>  And what is the difference between the design of the lightweight version of the "eight"?  The Honor 8 Lite smartphone is made of plastic and is also covered by glass panels.  But unlike the "elder brother", its body, both in the back and the front, is deprived of any grease-repellent coating.  The design of the rear panel is also different, since there is no dual camera here.  And the flash is solid.  Which also slightly affects the appearance of the gadget.  The rest is the same "eight", only in a slightly simplified case.  But this does not mean at all that the build quality and materials have suffered at least a little.  Everything is exactly at the same level.  This is a feature of Huawei products.  By the way, the Lite version lacks a <span>protective glass</span> on the screen.  Therefore, they will have to be used with a certain amount of caution.  And it‚Äôs better to get a protective film or glass in general. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Performance Honor 8 </h2><p>  Huawei Honor 8 is equipped with an eight-core, 64-bit HiSilicon Kirin 950 processor manufactured by Huawei, which operates at a frequency of 2.3 gigahertz.  This is a pretty nimble and quite modern "stone."  The amount of RAM is 4 gigabytes.  Its modules are considered energy efficient because multi-channel mode is used.  This allowed us to increase both the performance and the autonomy of the entire hardware platform.  For graphics meets the advanced chip Mali T-880 MP4.  It fully supports OpenGL and DirectX.  Due to this, for a smartphone there are no problems with games.  Even in such "heavyweights" as World of Tanks Blitz, the number of frames per second does not sag at all.  And this is good.  In addition, the smartphone easily copes with playing Full HD video in MKV format.  The amount of memory that is available to the user is 64 gigabytes.  But it is possible to install a memory card up to 256 gigabytes. </p>

    <h2>  Performance Honor 8 Lite </h2><p>  Now let's compare the Honor 8 and Honor 8 Lite in performance.  In the "lite" version, the same HiSilicon is installed, but the 655th model with a clock frequency of 2.1 gigahertz.  This processor is a bit slower than in the usual "eight", but its performance is enough for the eyes.  The amount of RAM and its type is exactly the same as in a more advanced model.  But the GPU is a little different.  But he supports all the necessary technology.  Just the maximum core frequency is slightly different.  In any case, even the power of the simplified version is quite enough for any modern games.  The volume of the internal drive is 32 gigabytes.  The ability to install a microSD memory card is also there.  And the maximum capacity is identical - 256 gigabytes.  That is, there are no special differences in performance. </p>

    <h2>  Honor 8 cameras </h2><p>  It's time to figure out who is better in terms of cameras.  Honor 8 or Honor 8 Lite?  To do this, one fact needs to be clarified: in the usual figure eight, the main camera is represented by a two-module sensor.  Each of them has 12 megapixels.  The first is used to photograph objects in focus and record video, and the second lens is responsible for processing the background.  It is he who allows you to perform a beautiful blur effect.  But much more valuable is the fact that there is a completely manual shooting mode and the ability to save photos in RAW format.  The quality of the pictures is simply excellent.  With a properly set ISO and white balance, even when shooting at night, artifacts are minimal.  The front camera is represented by an 8-megapixel module with an aperture of 2.2.  There is no flash, but a screen is used instead.  The quality of the photographs is satisfactory.  For selfies and talking on Skype is enough.  Honor 8 has such cameras. Their characteristics are almost flagship. </p>

    <h2>  Honor 8 Lite Cameras </h2><p>  Now consider the Honor 8 Lite cameras.  The characteristics of the main module indicate that it has 13 megapixels, a complex optical system and aperture 2.2.  But the most valuable thing is the pixel size.  Here it is equal to 1.25 microns.  This allows you to achieve a better image.  There is only one module.  While the usual "figure eight" flaunts two.  But this does not mean that the quality of photographs is worse.  There just won't be an artistically blurred background.  There is also limited manual control of the camera and there is no way to save images in RAW.  Thus, the camera is no worse.  The front module is exactly the same as the "full" version: 8 megapixels, aperture 2.2, wide-angle lens.  The quality of the front sensor photos is acceptable.  It is quite possible to photograph yourself for social networks.  Chatting on Skype will also be very comfortable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="honor 8 lite specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/2045965.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy Comparison </h2><p>  Comparison of Honor 8 and Honor 8 Lite in terms of autonomy obviously cannot be "honest".  Smartphones, although similar, are in different weight categories.  Both devices are equipped with a 3000 mAh battery.  The only difference is that in the "full" version there is a fast charge, but in Lite it is not.  With the same battery capacity, both devices have different performance.  And this could not affect the battery life.  As expected, the ‚Äúlite‚Äù version works a couple of hours longer.  She is a little weaker, but autonomous.  If the usual eight is capable of playing Full HD video at a maximum screen brightness of 8-9 hours, then the Lite playback time is 10-11 hours.  In other tests, the difference is exactly the same.  If for you the important long-term work of the smartphone without recharging, then choose the Lite version of the device.  Honor 8 is much worse with autonomy. Features still affect. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  So, what to choose - Honor 8 or Honor 8 Lite?  The price difference is sensitive.  The conclusion suggests itself: if you are not a fan of a blurry background in images and the metal case does not play a noticeable role for you, then it is better to choose a light version of the smartphone.  The difference in performance is minimal, but there is an increase in battery life.  And for many, the latter factor may be decisive.  Overpay for a dual camera (which may be useless) and a metal case is not worth it.  Even the Lite version is able to satisfy the needs of any user.  Indeed, the quality of both models are no different. </p>
