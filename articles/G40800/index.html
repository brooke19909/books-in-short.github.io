  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Evolution factors and their significance</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Evolution is a biological factor.  It applies to all changes in the system of living organisms that have occurred during the life of our planet.  All manifestations of evolution occur under the influence of certain factors.  Which of them have the greatest impact, and how is it manifested?  Consider the main factors of evolution. </p><p>  1. One of them is heredity.  This is the ability to copy from one generation to another some of the properties of the body that relate to metabolism or other characteristics of individual development as a whole.  This directing factor of evolution is carried out due to the self-reproduction of units of genes that accumulate in the structure of the <span>cell nucleus,</span> namely in the chromosomes and cytoplasm.  These genes are decisive in ensuring the constancy and species diversity of various life forms.  Heredity is considered the main factor that forms the foundation of the evolution of all living nature. </p><p>  2. Variability, in contrast to the first factor, is a manifestation in living organisms of various signs and properties that are not dependent on family ties.  This property is characteristic of all individuals.  It is divided into the following categories: hereditary and non-hereditary, group and individual, directed and non-directed, qualitative and quantitative.  Hereditary variation is the result of mutations, and non-inherited variation is due to the influence of the <span>external environment.</span>  <span>Factors of</span> evolution, heredity and variability can be called determining in this process. </p><p>  3. The struggle for existence.  It determines the relationship between living organisms or the influence of abiotic signs on them.  As a result of this process, organisms that are weaker die.  Those that remain have higher viability rates. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  4. <span>Natural selection.</span>  It is a consequence of the previous factor.  This is the process by which the survival of the strongest individuals occurs.  The essence of natural selection is to transform populations.  As a result of this, new species of living organisms appear.  It can be called one of the engines of evolution.  Like many other evolutionary factors, it was discovered by C. Darwin. </p><p>  5. Fitness.  This includes structural features of the body, color, behaviors, methods of raising offspring and much more.  There are a lot of these factors, so they have not yet been fully studied. </p><p>  6. <span>Population waves.</span>  The essence of this factor is a certain fluctuation in the number of certain types of living organisms.  As a result, a rare species can become more numerous and vice versa. </p><p>  7. Insulation.  It implies the emergence of obstacles to the spread of living organisms and their crossing.  There can be various reasons for its occurrence: mechanical, environmental, territorial, morphological, genetic, etc. One of the main reasons often becomes an increase in differences between previously close organisms. </p><p>  8. Mutations.  These environmental factors can occur under the influence of natural or artificial traits.  When changes are made to the genetic nature of an organism, mutational changes occur.  This factor underlies hereditary changes. </p><p>  9. The <span>drift of genes.</span>  There are situations when the population is sharply reduced.  This can occur under the influence of various circumstances (flood, fire).  The remaining representatives of living organisms become the determining link in the formation of new populations.  As a result, some traits of this species may disappear and new ones may appear. </p><p>  Human development has gone its own way.  But the factors <span>of human evolution are</span> similar to those described above. </p>
