But times are changing and now the question of how to withdraw money from the Megaphone is quite relevant. </p><h2>  Opportunities </h2><p>  If a person has a sufficient amount in the account, then he can withdraw part of it in cash even without going to the office of the operator.  A few years ago, they could only be cashed out if the contract for the provision of telecommunication services was broken.  In this case, the entire balance of the account could be obtained at the cash desk of any of the offices of the telecom operator. </p>

    <h2>  Cash withdrawal in Russia </h2><p>  If you live and use the connection in the Federation, then there will be no problems with receiving cash.  Using the Unistream system, you can withdraw money at one of more than 7 thousand points by choosing the one closest to you.  Subscribers have two options for filling out an application for cash withdrawal: via SMS or a special form on the website. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

In the first case, you can simply send an SMS-message to the number 3116. In its text you must specify the type of payment (for the Unistream system - Unim), the amount and surname, first name, middle name.  In response, you will receive a message requiring confirmation of the transfer.  Only after performing all necessary actions the subscriber will receive a message in which the control number will be indicated to receive the amount sent.  After that, you can go to the nearest Unistream station located on the territory of the Federation.  By presenting an <span>identification card</span> and saying the control number of the transfer, you can get the indicated amount.  Please note that the transfer fee will be deducted from the phone account.

    <p>  You can withdraw money from Megafon through the Leader system.  The procedure is no different from receiving money through Unistream.  Only when sending SMS to number 3116, you must specify the type of payment - Lid. </p><h2>  Payment Rates </h2><p>  Of course, cashing out funds is a simple but rather expensive service.  If you use the Leader system, you need to pay 5.95% from each operation, while a transfer fee of up to 5000 is charged a one-time commission of 95 rubles, if you transfer from 5000 to 15000, 259 rubles will be debited from the account.  At the same time, the maximum one-time transfer amount cannot exceed 15,000, and no more than 40,000 can be transferred within one month. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you want to withdraw money from the Megafon phone through the Unistream system, then note that the tariffs are no different from those that are set for the Leader.  True, subscribers have the opportunity to make a payment not via SMS, but through the site.  In this case, only 3.3% will have to be paid, and fixed commissions will not be charged. </p><h2>  Transfer abroad </h2>

All the same Unistream and Leader payment systems provide the opportunity to receive transfers in several countries abroad.  The commission for transferring funds abroad will be the same as in Russia - 5.95% of the payment and a fixed amount of 95 or 259 rubles, respectively, for transfers up to 5000 or up to 15000.

    <p>  Through the Leader and Unistream systems, funds can also be transferred to foreign countries, the main thing is to indicate the code of the recipient state: Ukraine (UKR), Tajikistan (TJK), Moldova (MDA), Kyrgyzstan (KGZ), Kazakhstan (KAZ) , Georgia (GEO), Belarus (BLR), Azerbaijan (AZE).  When transferring funds via SMS to number 3116, it is necessary to indicate the payment system, amount, country code, name of the recipient, name of the sender and his status (whether he is a resident or not). </p><h2>  Alternative funds transfer methods </h2><p>  Currently, you can withdraw money from the Megafon phone not only through the transfer system.  The operator provides the opportunity to receive funds to a <span>bank card</span> or account, you can also transfer money to another phone. </p><p>  It is most convenient to make transfers through the website of the Megafon operator.  A telecommunications company provides the opportunity to use the Mobile Payments service.  To do this, in the specified form, you must enter your phone number and password, which will come in SMS.  After that, you will get access to additional features - the transfer of funds to any bank account or card.  But keep in mind that crediting money can last up to 5 business days. </p>

    <p>  If you do not want to use the site, then you can transfer funds using SMS to the already known number 3116. How to withdraw money from the Megafon phone in this case is very simple to understand.  To credit them to a bank card, simply dial card, its number, expiration date, which is indicated on its front side and the amount of payment.  But <span>transferring money</span> to a bank account using SMS will not work, for this it will be necessary to use the Megafon website.  But keep in mind that not all financial institutions are on the list of partners, in which case you will receive a message that the service is not available. </p><p>  Another method of withdrawing money from a Megafon phone is to transfer funds to another number.  To do this, it is enough to send an SMS to number 3116, in its text you need to indicate the number to which funds are transferred, and the amount. </p><h2>  Tariffs for transfers </h2>
