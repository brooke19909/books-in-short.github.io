In them you can find hundreds of beautiful monuments of architecture, art, nature.  One of these cities is Belgorod, located at a distance of 700 kilometers from Moscow and on the border with Ukraine.  What is his story?  What sights of Belgorod can visitors see this wonderful city? </p><h2>  A bit about the history of the city </h2><p>  In the distant XVI century, on the chalk hills near the rivers Seversky Donets and Weselka, a fortress was built by order of the Russian Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich.  His goal was to protect the state‚Äôs borders from attacks by Crimean Tatars, Lithuanians and Poles.  Over time, a city called Belgorod was built on this site. </p><p>  The history of the city is quite rich.  Over the centuries, he experienced many sieges: Poles, Cossacks and Germans, but in the end the city survived and exists today.  Today, thanks to the museums and various attractions of the city of Belgorod, you can find out its rich history. </p><h2>  Monuments of Belgorod </h2><p>  On the territory of the city there are several monuments that are presented to guests and tourists visiting <span>Belgorod: a monument to</span> Vladimir the Great, an incorruptible traffic cop (dedicated to a real person), Kamenotes (a symbol of the extraction of chalk, which is abundant in the city) and gymnast Svetlana Khorkina. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sezon5.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Vladimir the Great" class="if uuid-2451911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79436/2451911.jpg"></div><p>  Monument to Vladimir the Great is located on the Kharkov mountain and rises on a 15-meter base.  The monument itself has a height of seven meters; it took about one and a half tons of copper to create it.  The monument was erected in 1998.  It is believed that it was Prince Vladimir who first founded the settlement on these lands, although there is no written evidence of this.  This monument symbolizes the brotherhood of those Slavic peoples who inhabited this land, as well as the unity of the Orthodox faith and the Russian state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Museums of the city </h2><p>  In every city there are museums that reveal the wealth of history, science and painting.  In Belgorod, there are also such places, even several: Art, History and Local Lore, Literary museums.  There is also a Museum-Diorama and museums dedicated to the Battle of Kursk and other events taking place in this area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.2do2go.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Belgorod Art Museum" class="if uuid-2452351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79436/2452351.jpg"></div><p>  Among the list of these sights of Belgorod, I would like to draw attention to a couple of them.  The art museum opened in 1983, in the building of the cinema that used to be here.  But at the end of the last century, he was moved to a new building, built and decorated in the Art Nouveau style. </p><p>  The collection includes works by a local artist who painted several hundred paintings, Mikhail Dobronravov.  In addition to his paintings, the museum has more than four thousand paintings painted from the 18th to the 20th century.  From time to time there are also vernissages, as well as various performances in the concert hall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nostradamvs.livejournal.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum in Belgorod" class="if uuid-2451970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79436/2451970.jpg"></div><p>  The Museum of Folk Culture also deserves the attention of tourists visiting this city.  It was opened in 1999 and gained popularity among local residents.  Thanks to the collected exhibits and their excellent placement and combination, the organizers were able to convey a picture of everyday life, as well as the history of the people who have lived here for centuries.  The exhibitions are dedicated to the time of the Khazar Khaganate, the life of Russian peasants, trade, industry, and also include archaeological finds and documents. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Visit to the zoo </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zoo in the city center" class="if uuid-2451981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79436/2451981.jpg"></div><p>  Speaking about the sights of Belgorod with a description of their details, it is worth mentioning the wonderful zoo, which is located in the city center.  It was founded in 1988 and for 3 years was part of the Victory Park.  Then it became a separate resting place. </p><p>  The zoo contains about 90 species of various animals, including about 200 individuals.  15 species out of 90 are listed in the Red Book of Russia.  Among the inhabitants of the zoo, visitors can see lions and tigers, bears, foxes and wolves, kangaroos and camels, fallow deer and lamas, caimans and pythons.  This is not all the inhabitants of the zoo. </p><h2>  Walks in the city parks </h2><p>  Not a single city can do without a vacation spot.  Among the attractions of Belgorod there are parks in which everyone can relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. </p><p>  Perhaps the most popular is the central park named after Lenin.  It was founded in the mid-1950s.  After 50 years of its existence, the park was reconstructed.  A lot of modern attractions for children were delivered on the territory, a children's town and an amusement park were built, which makes it possible for both adults and children to have a good weekend here.  The park is also decorated with beautiful alleys on which flowers and shrubs grow.  All this creates coziness and comfort for guests who come here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nostradamvs.livejournal.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Entrance to Lenin Park" class="if uuid-2451950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79436/2451950.jpg"></div><p>  Another park, Victory Park, was founded on the banks of the river in 1989.  In its place during the Second World War, fierce battles took place.  But today only a few monuments dedicated to this event and the walk of fame remind of this.  There is a small fountain in the park with beautiful lighting.  Its location is an excellent place to relax and walk. </p><h2>  Other sights of Belgorod </h2><p>  Perhaps it is worth mentioning some other features of the city that may be of interest to tourists.  For example, in the city there are several cathedrals and temples built during the XVIII-XIX centuries.  They impress with their architecture and convey the spirit of their time.  Having survived to our time, they will interest everyone who is fond of ancient buildings and their appearance. </p><p>  I would also like to note that the city has a drama theater named after Schepkin, as well as a state philharmonic society.  The theater building was built in a classical style with columns in 1962.  Today it provides various performances for adults and children.  The building of the Philharmonic is made in a modern style, which is the indisputable decoration of the city.  There are three concert venues where several orchestras, a choir, ensembles and show ballet perform. </p><p>  In the city center you can see the so-called Sundial.  If the street is clear, you can compare your time with them.  And if it is already evening, then the clock is transformed, attracting people with its luminous stars and constellations. </p><p>  Now you know what to see in Belgorod.  There are not many sights here, but everyone has their own history and attract tourists from all over Russia. </p><h2>  Some interesting facts </h2><p>  Several facts concerning Belgorod are noteworthy.  For example, an oak tree grows near the city, which Bogdan Khmelnitsky planted here more than 300 years ago.  On the territory of the university there is a fountain with a sculpture of the archangel Gabriel.  On the river Weselka is a floating musical fountain, which attracts all lovers.  And on Cathedral Square there is a sign of memory.  It is believed that if you stand in its center, close your eyes, clap your hands three times, scroll three times around its axis, and finally make a wish, it will come true. </p><h2>  What tourists say about Belgorod </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel in the center of Belgorod" class="if uuid-2451919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79436/2451919.jpg"></div><p>  So, we introduced you to the sights of Belgorod (photos are presented in the article).
