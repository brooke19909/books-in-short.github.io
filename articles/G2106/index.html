    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  A number of negative points is characterized by a vacation in the Hammamet Garden Resort SPA.  Reviews note the following: </p><ul><li>  the rooms are very small (it is simply impossible to turn around in them); </li><li>  at the weekend, many locals relax at the hotel, and therefore in public areas it is very crowded and noisy (you can‚Äôt get to the pool at all); </li><li>  Considering that they ride camels on the beach, all the sand is strewn with animal waste products; </li><li>  weak animation (evening shows do not deserve attention); </li><li>  Considering that the air conditioners in the hotel do not turn on until 14:00, it is simply impossible to be indoors in the morning; </li><li>  old furniture and appliances in the rooms; </li><li>  instead of juices, powdered drinks are served for breakfast; </li><li>  there are no fermented milk products in the buffet menu; </li><li>  during cleaning, maids can pick up dirty towels, and bring fresh ones only in the evening (thus, you will have nothing to wipe off after a shower); </li><li>  there is not a single lifeguard by the pool or on the beach; </li><li>  hazardous joints on slides in a children's pool; </li><li>  the staff does not speak Russian; </li><li>  the furniture in the halls is very old (there are stains and holes); </li><li>  the rooms have very poor lighting, so in the evening you can neither read nor do makeup (the corridors are also practically not lit); </li><li>  cockroaches in the bathroom. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Unfortunately, for the pampered and demanding tourist, the Hammamet Garden Resort SPA 4 * hotel (Tunisia) is not the best place to relax.  Negative reviews are much more serious than positive ones.  Of the advantages, perhaps, only food and a convenient location can be distinguished.  In all other respects, the hotel is significantly behind Turkish and Egyptian counterparts.  The number of rooms is outdated, savings are felt in everything, and the staff does not know their work well enough. </p><p>  Thus, this hotel is in no way a place for lovers of a calm measured rest on the beach or by the pool.  Rather, active travelers who come to get to know Tunisia better can stay here.  If you are not going to spend the whole day in the territory, then this hotel will become a good place for an overnight stay and food. </p>
