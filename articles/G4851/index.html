This will require several sheets of felt, crayon, scissors, a needle with thread and minimal sewing skills.  To get a more voluminous product, you will also need a small amount of holofiber, sintepuha or regular cotton wool for filling. </p><p>  Such a heart can be given to your soulmate as a sign of your love, used as a nice accessory or made a beautiful garland to decorate the interior.  Felt is an ideal material for needlework, since it does not have a wrong side and is equally beautiful on both sides; it is easily cut and does not crumble, so the edges do not need to be processed. </p><h2>  How to choose a felt? </h2><p>  There are several varieties of felt for needlework.  It varies in composition, thickness and stiffness.  For small soft toys, a material made of polyester with a thickness of 2-3 mm is best suited.  It can be soft or hard, the choice of this parameter is up to you.  Hard felt holds its shape better, but soft has a delicate texture, more pleasant to the touch.  A tough look is more suitable for a garland, and a soft one for a brooch or a romantic gift.  Choose bright, rich and delicate colors, then the decoration will turn out beautiful and interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of felt" class="if uuid-2251256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2251256.jpg"></div><h2>  Cut and sew </h2><p>  Before starting work, you need to make a pattern for a heart of felt.  You can choose any shape and draw a figure yourself.  The heart can be narrow and elongated or more round, symmetrical or creative, it all depends on your desire.  However, if there is no time to mess around, you can use a ready-made template. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.print-ables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Heart pattern" class="if uuid-2250785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2250785.jpg"></div><p>  Draw on paper a beautiful heart of the desired shape and size, cut with scissors, and then proceed to cutting.  Put the pattern on a piece of felt, circle with chalk and carefully cut. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Felt hearts" class="if uuid-2250775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2250775.jpg"></div><p>  To make a voluminous heart of felt, you need to cut out two identical halves.  Then, with the help of a thread and a needle, sew them together using a buttonhole stitch ‚Äúover the edge‚Äù, leaving a small hole for filling.  Fill the void with holofiber, sintepuh or cotton, then sew completely.  Felt keeps its shape well, so try not to tighten the seam, otherwise the heart will turn out to be uneven. </p><h2>  How to use hearts? </h2><p>  The resulting product can be used in different ways: string several hearts of felt on a cord and make a beautiful garland;  attach a loop and hang somewhere, for example, on a Christmas tree or other plant;  sew a pin on the back and wear a heart as a cute brooch;  put your heart in a beautiful box and give it to your loved one as a symbol of your love. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  If there is no time for sewing, you can just glue the felt halves together.  Crystal Moment or silicone hot melt is best suited for this purpose. </p><p>  If you choose a thick felt, you can not fill the toy with filler, since the material itself is quite voluminous and the heart will turn out beautiful without additional efforts. </p><p>  As a filler, you can use aromatic herbs, for example, lavender, mint or chamomile. </p><h2>  Garland of hearts </h2><p>  To make a long garland of felt hearts with your own hands, you can use another manufacturing technology.  A hard felt 2-3 mm thick is best suited for this purpose.  To begin, cut two identical strips 6 cm wide and 20 cm long. Fold them together and sew on a typewriter along the long edge.  If you want to get a larger garland, you can use a thicker felt, and make the strips large, for example, 10 by 30 cm. </p><p>  Expand the resulting canvas.  Using a ruler and chalk, draw 9 straight lines perpendicular to the seam.  The distance between the lines should be 2 cm. Again, connect the canvas so that the drawn lines are on top and the seam inside.  Align the strips exactly along the long edge, and then sew on the machine.  If the felt is too elastic and slips out of your hands, secure it with pins. </p><p>  Now, with scissors, cut the felt along the drawn lines and the result will be charming hearts - smooth, neat and incredibly cute!  For a garland 1 meter long, about 30 hearts will be required. </p><p>  Cut a piece of thick thread or cord about 1 meter long.  On one side, tie a loop on which you will hang the future garland.  Thread the other end of the thread into a needle and collect your beautiful hearts on it.  Make a loop at the end of the thread.  To make the garland more interesting, use a felt of different colors.  Decoration is ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="makezine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Garland of hearts, felt" class="if uuid-2250996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2250996.jpg"></div><p>  Whatever method of making felt hearts you choose, they will turn out beautiful, interesting and very romantic.  The manufacturing process is simple and does not require special sewing skills, and felt sheets are very inexpensive, so creating a wonderful jewelry with your own hands will not be difficult.  Felt hearts will be an excellent decoration for your outfit or a cute gift, and a garland will make the interior of the room festive and cozy. </p>
