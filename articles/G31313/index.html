Among them, the Sirinat National Park stands out with its special beauty, which annually hosts tens of thousands of tourists. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="8.0902522" data-lng="98.29743529999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/0/4/3/18043.png"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Phuket has over thirty beautiful natural parks.  The famous Sirinat National Park is thirty-first in this list.  In 1980, the governor of Phuket ordered the subordinate departments to work out the issue of identifying sites that require state protection.  Many places were explored by experts, and several coral reefs were discovered in the cleanest waters of the bay.  After that, the governor signed a decree granting the place national status.  The reserve was named Had Nai Young.  The new name - Sirinat Marine National Park - received the reserve in 1992, when Queen Queen Sirikit celebrated her sixtieth birthday. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.paradise-diving.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="national park" class="if uuid-3245114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3245114.jpg"></div><h2>  Flora and fauna of the park </h2><p>  The park spreads over an area of ‚Äã‚Äãninety square kilometers and is located in the northwestern part of Phuket.  The coastline of the reserve stretches for thirteen kilometers near the famous Patong Beach, where young people like to spend their free time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.proudphuket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach forest" class="if uuid-3245109" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3245109.jpg"></div><p>  The island has rich flora and fauna.  In particular, the forest, which is called mangrove, is forbidden for deforestation.  The forest is home to a wide variety of lizards, snakes, amphibians.  Another type of forest is called beach, because it stretches just along the coastline.  In dense tree branches birds nest, of which there are several dozen species on the island.  There are also rare ones: spotted pigeon, hassle, lane.  The main function of the forest is to protect against coastline damage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="baoangiang.com.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="forest on the beach" class="if uuid-3245113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3245113.jpg"></div><p>  The description of the Sirinat National Park will be incomplete, if not to mention its peculiar miracle - snow-white beaches, which have chosen sea turtles for their nesting.  This sight is definitely worth a look.  The Tortoise Rescue Fund monitors annually and protects nests from ruin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get to the park </h2><p>  From the main city of the island - Phuket Town - Sirinat National Park is located only thirty kilometers away.  For such a short walk, you can rent a bike and feel free to go to meet the beauties of nature.  From Patong Beach, the reserve is only thirty minutes away. </p><p>  They also know how to get to the Sirinat National Park in the province of Phang Nga.  Those who decide to go from here should definitely take a camera with them and charge their mobile devices well, because the path lies through the famous Saracen Bridge.  It offers magnificent panoramic views.  After the bridge you need to drive another three or four kilometers, and you are there.  You can also get through the airport.  This road is not too different from the rest.  Upon reaching the airport, you need to drive a few more kilometers.  Entrance to the Sirinat National Park is paid, about 400 rubles.  All the money that is earned at the park, management spends on its maintenance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="villacarte.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monkeys in the park Sirinat" class="if uuid-3245115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3245115.jpg"></div><h2>  Attractions and entertainment </h2><p>  If you go to the northern part of the island, closer to Mai Khao beach, you can get to the famous Tachachai trail.  The trail is unique in that it runs through mangroves, which are very valuable and carefully guarded by the authorities of the island.  The length of the trail is only six hundred meters, but on this way you can see many rare interesting plants that are famous for the Sirinat National Park.  You can take a photo in the morning, when the sun is high above the island, or in the evening, but using the lighting function of the camera or smartphone.  Among the roots of trees and foliage, which lies on the ground, looking closely, you can see crabs.  They make special sounds that complement the amazing atmosphere of this paradise. </p><p>  Mai Khao Beach, better known as the wild beach of the Sirinat National Park, will appeal to those who want to stay in silence, alone with nature and feel all the strength and power of the three elements: water, air and land.  A walk along the beach calms and tunes in a special way. </p><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  In this amazing conservation area, you can stay for a few days, because the locals have taken care of where to stay for tourists.  There are cozy small bungalows in which you can have a great time as independent tourists, and there is a large company.  The park has excellent cafes where chefs offer dishes for every taste.  But it is better, of course, to fully plunge into the atmosphere of the island and feel its taste through those dishes that the Thais themselves prefer. </p><p>  For tourists in search of real adventure, there is another interesting option - camping.  These are specially equipped cooking areas, with showers and latrines.  The tourist centers on the island for a small fee offer to rent a tent, which can be installed directly on the beach and enjoy the surrounding scenery and magnificent sunset at least 24 hours a day.  And for those who don‚Äôt know how to pitch a tent and doubt their strength, a sleeping bag is offered for rent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="map2city.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bungalow in the park" class="if uuid-3245112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3245112.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about Sirinat National Park in Phuket are extremely positive.  Tourists report excellent infrastructure that helps beginners navigate a large area.  Everywhere there are signs and signs in English with markings that are understood even by people who do not know any other than their native language.  The cuisine, which is called one of the most delicious in the world, inspires travelers.  And, of course, nature - landscapes that you will never forget. </p>
