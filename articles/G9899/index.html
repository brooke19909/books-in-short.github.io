  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mechanical movement - all about it</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It would seem that the term "mechanical movement" speaks for itself.  The subject was at one point, and after a while it turned out to be at another - that was the movement.  However, not all so simple.  Behind the term given above lies a deeper meaning. </p><p>  Moving from point to point does not occur instantly, but during a <span>certain time.</span>  And not just right from point A to point B, but along some line.  The line of motion of the body is called the trajectory, and its length is the path traveled.  To describe the behavior of the body and its trajectory is often a rather difficult task.  But if we use the representation of the position of the body in space using coordinates and time, this will be the law of motion. </p><p>  Now the following question arises - how is the mechanical movement carried out?  In the case when all points of the object move in the same way, it will be progressive.  If, when moving, the points of the body are located on a circle, then the movement will be rotational.  Now we already have a characteristic of mechanical motion, and not one. </p><p>  The task of physics includes not only a description of the process of motion itself, but also prediction of where the body will be at a given point in time.  However, in order to use the law of motion and its characteristics for this, we need to find the starting point with respect to which all calculations will be performed.  After it is determined, we will get a complete reference system in which any mechanical movement can be described. </p><p>  The movement occurs relative to the starting point of the coordinate system or, in another way, the frame of reference.  The origin can be chosen arbitrarily, and when you change the reference point, the description of the movement may turn out to be different.  Thus, we determined that mechanical motion is relative.  <span>This concept of</span> relativity was formulated by Galileo. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to quantitatively describe the entire process of movement, it remains for us to introduce such a concept as speed.  Under <span>translational movement, it</span> is understood as the ratio of perfect displacement to the time spent on this displacement.  In the case where the speed does not change in direction and value, the movement will be uniform and straightforward.  If this requirement is not met, the movement will be uneven. </p><p>  The value of the speed of movement is also a relative value, and depends on its direction, i.e.  it <span>is a vector quantity.</span>  If a train moves relative to the Earth‚Äôs surface at a speed of V1 and a passenger travels at a speed of V2 in it, then the passenger will move at a speed of V1 + V2 relative to the Earth.  But if it moves against the movement of the train, then in relation to the Earth it will move at a speed of V1 - V2. </p><p>  To complete the description of the movement, it is necessary to give the units of measurement of the characteristics used.  Time is measured in seconds, the distance traveled is in meters, but the speed, respectively, is in meters per second. </p><p>  The concept of mechanical motion from the point of view of physics is considered above.  However, such a concept is also found in other sciences.  So, the concept of "mechanical population movement" is operated by <span>socio-economic statistics.</span>  Another name for this term is migration.  It implies the movement of people through separate territories (countries, republics, regions), and such a movement is associated with a change in residence. </p><p>  The material considers such a concept as mechanical motion, and describes its characteristics.  The properties of motion ‚Äî the trajectory, speed, the distance traveled ‚Äî are determined, and a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <span>relativity of motion is given.</span>  Also indicated is the use of a similar concept in other sciences. </p>
