Universal grief has affected every person.  Nevertheless, the people managed to go through terrible trials and achieve a great victory.  The underground movement made a significant contribution.  Today, not far from the city of Bryansk, is located the "Partisan Glade" - a <span>memorial complex whose</span> purpose is to perpetuate the memory of brave warriors. </p><h2>  From Russian scouts to Soviet saboteurs </h2><p>  The theory of conspiracy war has been familiar to the army since 1600.  Intelligence tactics were also used in Russia.  The army of the prince included a group called the ertaul.  Only the most daring and most dexterous soldiers were accepted into the ranks of this formation.  The main task of the regiment is to advance ahead of the troops, stop enemy reconnaissance and inform their brothers about a sudden attack.  In fact, they served as a guard. </p>

The French called this part of the army partie, that is, a detachment.  During the battles of Napoleon, ordinary people also joined the fight against the aggressor. </p><p>  The peasants became a decisive force in World War II.  Their units were present in all occupied lands.  Especially much for the victory over the invader did the Soviet people.

The participants in the groups were old men, women and young men, who, due to age and other reasons, were not allowed to participate in hostilities. </p><p>  The state was also interested in such assistance.  The order on the formation of partisans was issued in the early days of World War II.  The main tasks of this department were also identified. </p>

The management gave a clear order not to give up.  For three long months the point did not let the invader to its land.  But on October 6, 1941, Bryansk was occupied. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the eve of thousands of men and women who were not accepted into the army, went to the forest.

    <h2>  The creation of clandestine units </h2><p>  Avengers occupied the territory of several areas.  In addition to the Bryansk forest, they owned the neighboring Dyatkovo, Kletnyansky, Sofievsky lands.  In the spring of 1942, there were about a hundred detachments and more than 200 battalions and espionage groups.  The partisan glade consisted of 60,000 people, it is worth noting that 8,000 of them were women. </p><p>  Their work was invaluable to the people.  These daredevils liberated cities and villages, established the old order there, rebuilt cultural institutions and even published their own newspaper. </p><p>  Subsequently, a peculiar Bryansk partisan republic was created, which included Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians.  This was facilitated by the advantageous geographical position of the region.  Another task facing the avengers was to preserve the harvest for the front soldiers from the enemy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, with their help, Bryansk and the territories adjacent to it were liberated on September 17, 1943.  The Partisan Glade Museum can tell about this and many other things in detail, interestingly and fascinatingly. </p>

    <h2>  Alien and his architect </h2><p>  For many years, the legend of brave forest soldiers walked around this region.  That is why, in order to perpetuate the heroes who liberated their native land from invaders, it was decided to open a memorial complex.  They tried to bring the date closer to the anniversary of the liberation of the city from the Nazis.  The solemn event took place on September 17, 1969.  The place where the monument is located today was chosen for a reason.  It was here that in 1941 the first meetings of future defenders of the fatherland took place. </p>

    <p>  The project was entrusted to the best masters of that time.  Vasily Gorodkov was appointed the architect.  It was according to his plan that the Partizanskaya Polyana complex was created.  Bryansk has become his hometown since 1948.  Then the man was sent here after studying.  His task was to restore the broken item.  He immediately fell in love with the amazingly picturesque nature and good-natured people.  Here he stayed, devoting to this region his whole future life. </p><h2>  Welcoming atmosphere </h2><p>  It is worth noting that from the beginning of its foundation the complex has been repeatedly supplemented.  It is still developing. </p><p>  The memorial is filled with dozens of unique objects, each of which tells the tragic and sad story of liberation.  Partizanskaya Polyana in Bryansk is one of the main points of pilgrimage for tourists.  And indeed, it is worth the attention that is given to it. </p><p>  An exclusive cafe with reasonable prices and delicious coffee welcomes guests.  At the entrance hangs a plan of the territory.  There visitors can find out all the information about the memorial.  The purpose of the construction is also indicated on the stand. </p><h2>  The highlight of the historical institution </h2><p>  The sculpture "Partisan in Ambush" is very impressive.  Its author is Alexey Kobilinets.  The master depicted a man who was about to throw a grenade.  Despite the fact that his act requires a lot of courage, the face of the figure remains impassive.  Surprisingly accurately reflected movement.  When guests look at the sculpture, there is an empathy effect.  People feel the same tension as a hero. </p>

Its opening took place in 1977, on the significant September anniversary of the liberation of the city from the Nazis.  Exhibits talk about how the resistance movement originated and developed.  Presented are personal items of soldiers, orders and medals for their merits, and even real weapons.  Entering the museum, a person falls into the years 1941-43.

    <h2>  Heart of glade </h2><p>  The central figure of the monument is the Wall of Sorrow.  It causes particular pain in the hearts of guests.  The names of the heroes who died for the freedom of the motherland are embossed on it.  Behind each surname lies someone's destiny, life destroyed by the war.  In total, 8,000 warriors were immortalized there, who did not wait for victory.  The author of the sculptures, from the harsh images of which is breathtaking, is Alexei Kobilinets.  Nearby there is an <span>eternal flame,</span> stylized as a wooden log. </p><p>  Many tourists are attracted by the exhibition of military equipment, which the Partisan Glade boasts.
