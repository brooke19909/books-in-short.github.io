  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Citizens Property Insurance: Information and Tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The well-being of the population of our country is growing, and in connection with this, <span>insurance of property of</span> citizens is becoming increasingly popular.  Today real estate <span>insurance is</span> especially in demand.  Apartments and houses are growing in price, and therefore it is understandable that each owner wants to protect himself financially from a variety of unforeseen situations and <span>accidents.</span>  Having concluded an agreement on <span>insurance of property of</span> citizens, at the same time it is possible to get insurance of home property, which includes monetary compensation for damage caused to interior and household appliances, as well as jewelry and art values ‚Äã‚Äãand clothing.  Each <span>capable citizen</span> can act as a policyholder <span>,</span> regardless of whether he knows in advance that an insured event may occur or simply wants to protect himself and his property from the occurrence of force majeure situations. </p><p>  If a citizen has entered into a voluntary contract for insurance of home property with an insurance company, then it can be considered that he has protected himself and will receive compensation for damage from such risks as floods, fires, arson, flood with water from any kind of pipeline systems, theft and robbery, illegal actions , deliberate destruction of property, vandalism and hooliganism.  The cost of services stipulated in the contract depends on the number of conditions taken into account.  In the same cases when the apartment is purchased under mortgage lending, real estate insurance becomes mandatory.  The same case occurs when real estate is pledged to obtain a loan from a bank. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Property insurance of citizens applies to residential buildings, if it is intended for temporary or permanent residence.  The contract also includes decoration.  And engineering equipment.  Additional facilities and buildings such as a bathhouse, garage, greenhouse, fence, etc. may also be subject to insurance.  When concluding an apartment insurance contract, the exact same conditions exist.  Today, many zealous owners insure landscape constructions and even landscape design elements, as well as those engineering systems that are available on the land. </p><p>  Property insurance for citizens cannot be concluded for dilapidated real estate, for houses to be demolished, and apartments and buildings in disrepair.  Also, the so-called expendable property is not insured.  it includes cosmetics, medicines, food, pet food, supplies for household and office equipment, seedlings and seeds, documentation and securities, including money, photos and videos, cult objects and jewelry of natural origin, such as gold bullion and mineral stones. </p><p>  Insurance is a crucial step and therefore, when concluding a contract, you need to be sure of the reliability of the insurer.  It must be remembered that this is still a business and the main goal of an <span>insurance company</span> is to make a profit at minimal cost.  In order not to become a victim of unscrupulous insurers and receive the compensation due in the event of an insured event, when signing the contract, you must carefully study the conditions that are written in it.  The wording should be clear and understandable, without omissions and understatements.  Even the smallest details decide everything and it may be better to even use the services of an insurance broker to get full <span>insurance compensation</span> . </p><p>  Remember that your well-being depends on your rationalism and attentiveness. </p>
