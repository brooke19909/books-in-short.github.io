    <p>  Description "Grand Hotel Astrakhan" says that it is permissible luxury.  Is it really?  Let's find out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel is located at Astrakhan, Kuibyshev street, 69. </p><p>  From its windows a wonderful view opens: many guests, peering out onto the street, see the Volga River.  The hotel is located in the city center, so it is not so far from the main attractions.  Even from the railway station you need to go only 1 kilometer, so you don‚Äôt even have to take a taxi: you can walk, unless, of course, the bags are very heavy. </p><p>  From other attractions, the distance is slightly larger, some are on the other side of the Volga, but Astrakhan is not St. Petersburg, and local bridges do not part at night, so you can get to the other side of the river at any time. </p><p>  The singing fountain, located two kilometers away, is especially beautiful at night when the lights turn on.  You can sit around him even until the morning and not get tired ... </p><p>  In addition to the <span>Astrakhan Kremlin,</span> which is located 1.8 kilometers from the hotel, guests can visit the local museum of local lore 2.5 kilometers away.  There you can find the <span>Astrakhan Opera and Ballet Theater,</span> located 1.9 km away.  There is a river port 3 kilometers away.  In order not to get lost, you can find out at the reception where it is better to go, and even better to buy a pocket card with all the signs and recommendations. </p>

The rooms are located on all five floors, vary in size and overlook both the city and the Volga.  Some rooms have only everything you need (a bed and a bathroom), while others are real houses with living rooms, work rooms and several bedrooms.

    <p>  ‚ÄúGrand Hotel Astrakhan‚Äù has several restaurants at once, but the main ones are ‚ÄúGrand Fusion‚Äù and ‚ÄúGrand Royal‚Äù.  They are located on two floors and are connected by a staircase, but the menu in them is different.  And from the first floor, and from the second you can watch the Volga from the window and enjoy its view during the meal. </p><p>  By the way, if you agree with the administrators, you can provide yourself with a buffet breakfast in the restaurant "Fusion".  In particular, this service is included in many special promotions.  The restaurant is open from 7-00 in the morning and is open until 23-00 in the evening, so if you wish you can have breakfast, lunch and dinner. </p><p>  Banquets are held in the Grand Volga banquet hall (as you might guess, the view of the river also opens from here), which seats about 200 people.  This place is very popular among Astrakhan residents who want to celebrate a holiday on a grand scale - a wedding, anniversary, retirement, childbirth or christening.  For advice about holding a banquet, dishes and other trifles, you can call +7 (8512) 48-25-36 or write to mice@grand-hotel-astrakhan.com. </p><p>  For a small snack and meeting with friends, the Golden Pistachio lobby bar, which provides its customers with a wide range of snacks and drinks, may be suitable for you.  It also offers stunning views of the Volga.  Another plus of the Golden Pistachio is the mode of operation - the lobby bar is open until one in the morning, after which the employees begin to escort the clients who are too late. </p><p>  You can also not worry about some not very pleasant audience.  Hotel security is vigilant to provide guests with maximum security. </p><p>  The Grand Hotel Astrakhan also offers its guests a wide range of original desserts and a wide variety of wines, teas and coffee, which are often almost impossible to buy in an ordinary store. </p><h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  The local administration arranges everything so that none of the guests need anything, and that everything necessary can be obtained without leaving the room.  For example, this applies to daily reading of newspapers. </p>

Although all the guests claim that the expenses are justified.  Five stars oblige to provide the client with the highest level conditions so that each guest wants to stay here to live forever.  It is no accident that residents of Astrakhan regularly give their loved ones accommodation in a hotel for a special offer held on various holidays.  Everyone wants to live a few days in this paradise and feel like a VIP person, right?

    <p>  But you have to pay for everything: for food in restaurants, rooms, spa services and access to the gym.  I must say that this does not apply to hotel guests: all services are provided by a single complex.  The only restriction is that children under 10 years of age are not allowed to visit the SPA center (for safety reasons).  But this is not scary, because the child can always be left with a nanny. </p><p>  Even high room rates can be understood and accepted: after all, luxury is never cheap.  But Astrakhan is not Moscow and not St. Petersburg, therefore, prices are not as high as they could be. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  The Grand Hotel Astrakhan can be an excellent choice for those who want to really have a good rest.  The hotel strives to ensure that any person who wants to stay here for a while, have a delicious dinner, hold a banquet or business negotiations in an appropriate setting, take advantage of additional services (pool, SPA center, massage room, gym, Finnish sauna), have of this opportunity.  All prices are absolutely justified, but at the same time they are not overpriced, thanks to which the guests are satisfied. </p>
