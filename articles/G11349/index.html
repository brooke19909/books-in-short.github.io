  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Telefunken TV: customer reviews, manufacturer and prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The article will be devoted to the Telefunken TV lineup.  Reviews of their owners, technical specifications of this group of devices, as well as a universal algorithm for their settings will be discussed in detail below.  We also provide brief information about the manufacturing company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eldorado.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.eldorado.ru/cat/detail/71358621/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Telefunk brand TV" class="if uuid-2232984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2232984.jpg"></div><h2>  About the manufacturer </h2><p>  Telefunken Industrial Group was founded in Germany in 1903.  This company specializes in the production of television and radio equipment and communications.  Moreover, in its catalog there are both exclusive devices and ordinary, everyday solutions. </p><p>  It is to the second group, for the most part, that the modern Telefunken TVs belong.  The manufacturer most often transfers the rights to this brand to third-party companies that manufacture high-quality equipment under the supervision of German specialists.  Therefore, the German control over the manufacture of such multimedia centers is carried out in full. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  Any modern Telefunken TV is deprived at the software level of such a function as Smart TV.  This fact alone relates the model range of this manufacturer to the segment of entry-level devices.  It is also important to note the fact that the type of matrix used in such multimedia devices is currently outdated TN + Film.  In this case, the screen resolution can be either 1366X768 (HD format) or 1920X1080 (the picture meets the specifications of the FullHD standard). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But such technical characteristics significantly reduce the cost of all Telefunken TVs without exception.  Owner reviews confirm the availability of such entertainment multimedia centers.  Younger models of this manufacturer can be purchased for 7500 rubles, and the cost of the most advanced solutions reaches 14500 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eldorado.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.eldorado.ru/cat/detail/71358621/"><img itemprop="image" alt="What does a television function look like?" class="if uuid-2232993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2232993.jpg"></div><h2>  First level </h2><p>  The most affordable, at the moment, in the lineup is a device such as Telefunken TV with the LED19S64T2 marking.  Its screen size is 19.5 ‚Äù, and the maximum picture format is 1366X768.  The type of matrix installed in this entry-level multimedia device is Direct LED.  The highest brightness value of the latter may be 200 cd / m2 and this is a rather low value by current standards.  Similar competing solutions are capable of delivering up to 300 cd / m2.  The dynamic contrast of the device is declared at 3000: 1, and the response time is 16 ms. </p><p>  Many questions raise the capabilities of the built-in tuner.  It can only work with analogue PAL / SECAM broadcast and digital DVB-T2.  In this case, there can be no talk of supporting cable and satellite television.  To receive such a signal, you must install an additional external set-top box. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The speaker system</span> consists of 2 speakers.  Each of them can give out 5 watts.  Well, and in total this allows you to get 10 watts in peak mode. </p><p>  The functionality of the built-in software shell is minimal and there can be no talk of SmartTV support in this case. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eldorado.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv telefunken reviews" class="if uuid-2232999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2232999.jpg"></div><h2>  Middle segment </h2><p>  Nominally to the middle segment is the LED24S12T2 model of Telefunken TVs.  24 ‚Äùis the diagonal of the screen in this case.  The resolution of this device is improved and equal to 1920X1080.  That is, the image quality already meets the FullHD standard.  The brightness level is increased to 220 cd / m2.  At the same time, the contrast increased to 5000: 1.  The matrix of the device is made using the same technology as the younger model - Direct LED.  The reaction time has been significantly reduced and for this solution it is only 6.5 ms. </p><p>  Again, the specifications of the built-in tuner are exactly the same as those of the more affordable TV model with a smaller screen size.  It supports PAL / SECAM analog standards and only one digital DVB-T2.  But if you need to receive a satellite signal, you will have to purchase a separate satellite receiver.  The same thing will need to be done if it is necessary to receive cable television programs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The stereo system, as well as the software shell, have exactly the same characteristics as the previously considered model LED19S64T2. </p><p>  It can be noted that a 19 ‚Äùmultimedia center and a 24-inch Telefunken TV have much in common.  Owner reviews confirm their high degree of similarity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eldorado.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.eldorado.ru/cat/detail/71358621/"><img itemprop="image" alt="24-inch TV" class="if uuid-2233004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2233004.jpg"></div><h2>  Most advanced model </h2><p>  The increased screen diagonal to 31.5 "is the main difference between the flagship Telefunken TV.  User reviews contain comments about the improved image quality due to this.  The matrix installed in this device is made using the same DirectLED technology.  Its image format complies with the requirements of the HD standard and has a maximum resolution of 1366X768.  The upper limit of brightness is increased to 330 cd / m2, and the contrast when playing the most moving scenes reaches 5000: 1.  The reaction time is 7 ms, and the refresh rate of the pictures on the screen is fixed at a value of 50 Hz. </p><p>  Another major difference from the two previous models are the capabilities of the software shell.  In this case, it is supplemented by the Android operating system and fully supports the SmartTV function. </p><p>  The sound subsystem has 2 speakers of 4 watts each.  That is, in total this allows you to get 8 watts. </p><p>  The communication set of this device is perfectly balanced and allows you to solve any problems and problems.  Another important feature is the presence of a WiFi transmitter. </p><h2>  Basic setup </h2><p>  The standard procedure must be followed during the setup process of any <span>Telefunken</span> TV <span>.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> at the same time indicate that anyone can handle it.  This algorithm includes the following main steps: </p><ol><li>  Unpacking the multimedia device. </li><li>  Removing all delivery components. </li><li>  Assembly of the TV. </li><li>  Connection to the power supply network and signal cable from the antenna. </li><li>  Installing batteries in the control panel. </li><li>  Turn on the TV. </li><li>  Enter the menu and start the search for all available television programs.  Moreover, both analog and digital. </li><li>  Saving the channel list. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.eldorado.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.eldorado.ru/cat/detail/71361819/"><img itemprop="image" alt="24 inch television" class="if uuid-2233006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2233006.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The most affordable Telefunken TV LED19S64T2, which was discussed in this article, can be purchased for 7500 rubles.  A mid-range device with a diagonal of 24 ‚Äùand the designation LED24S12T2 can already be bought for 9500 rubles.  Well, the flagship TF-LED32S52T2S will cost 14,500 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eldorado.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.eldorado.ru/cat/detail/71361819/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Telefunken TV manufacturer" class="if uuid-2233009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2233009.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Telefunken televisions considered in this article have a number of common advantages.  In reviews, users primarily distinguish such advantages: </p><ul><li>  Very low cost; </li><li>  Acceptable characteristics; </li><li>  Sufficient sound quality; </li><li>  Simple and intuitive setup procedure. </li></ul><p>  Especially the owners of such televisions like the affordable price for almost all segments of the population. </p><p>  Cons of the TVs of this manufacturer, users note the following: </p><ol><li>  A stripped-down software shell in younger models. </li><li>  19 ‚Äùand 24‚Äù devices do not support the SmartTV option. </li><li>  Minimum features of the built-in tuner. </li><li>  It can only work with regular programs. </li></ol><p>  Support for satellite broadcasting and cable television channels, as previously noted, is no longer discussed. </p><p>  Some owners say that, if necessary, these shortcomings can be eliminated.  But at the same time, the owner will have to additionally purchase external appropriate receivers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Telefunken_logo.svg"><img itemprop="image" alt="TV reviews Telefunken" class="if uuid-2233010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2233010.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  This article is devoted to a review of technical specifications in the telephony TV lineup.  Reviews about them, the setup procedure for such <span>multimedia systems</span> were also considered.  Now it will be easier for a potential buyer to choose the model that will meet his requirements. </p>
