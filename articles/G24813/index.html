    <p>  Thailand, a paradise of the earth, famous for its fertile <span>subtropical climate,</span> softened by monsoons, is a unique place on Earth where summer reigns all year round and several crops ripen here a year.  You can relax here year-round, but still the period from November to February (the so-called cool period) is considered the best time for tourists to visit the country. </p><h2>  Description of the hotel in Pattaya </h2><p>  The hotel complex itself is located in the second line, not far from the beach.  The distance from it to the entertainment and shopping districts is about 4 km.  The comfort and friendliness of the staff is remembered by its guests Tune Hotel Pattaya 3 *.  Reviews of 95% of guests about it are positive!  Customers like that when they check into the room they are not required to make a deposit. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Basic economy class services are provided to guests: comfortable accommodation, a beach and one-time meals (breakfast).  The rooms are small, such as standard.  They do not open with a key, but with a chip card.  Smoking is prohibited.  The smoking area is equipped in the lobby; those who violate this procedure must pay a fine. </p><p>  There is no balcony in the room, but the bathroom pleases with its impressive size and the set of ergonomic plumbing and hygiene products present in it.  The latter are represented by shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, toothpaste.  This equipment is carefully maintained by the staff. </p><h2>  Services - For guests </h2><p>  Present in the room appliances are new, in good condition.

Wi-Fi is remarkably functioning on the territory of the hotel complex, which allows you to watch online movies and even play computer online games.

    <p>  There is also a minus: as in most Thai economies, <strong> </strong>  there is no refrigerator or minibar in the rooms of the Tune Hotel Pattaya 3 *.  Reviews of hotel guests about food in the hotel indicate its minimalism.  Hotel cafe TOM &amp; TOMS treats guests only with classic breakfasts.  The food is light and nutritious: scrambled eggs, sausages, sausages, bacon, salads, granola.  Lunch and dinner are organized by guests on their own, at their discretion.  Shops with fixed prices are attractive with a wide selection of food for guests of the Tune Hotel Pattaya 3 * hotel.  Pattaya, as you know, is not the cheapest place in Thailand to buy European food at commercial prices. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to organize your meals for hotel guests </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, the hotel only partially solves the problem of food for its guests.  Buying food for lunch and dinner is the concern of the tourists themselves.  Where to go for groceries?  The necessary shops are nearby, a 5-7 minute walk.  The best (according to resorts reviews) price / quality ratio is offered by Makro store.  The Big C store provides the largest <span>assortment of products</span> . Ready-made food, which is enough to reheat, is sold at the Tesco store.  Some tourists buy food there. </p><p>  However, vacationers who have rejected prejudices about exotic Asian cuisine, supposedly not suitable for residents of Western countries, are in the most advantageous position.  A good option for guests of the Tune Hotel 3 *, following the example of the Thais themselves, is to eat in local street cafes called "macaques."  There are many of them in Pattaya.  The most popular food that holidaymakers order at the macaque is chicken skewers, sausages, octopuses, sprinkled with sweet and sour sauce.  The price of one barbecue (in terms of) is 15 rubles. </p><p>  By the way, according to reviews of tourists - guests of the Tune Hotel, there have been no cases of poisoning among these visiting lovers of such street food.  On the contrary, holidaymakers write with satisfaction about their tasting of one or another national dish. </p><h2>  Thai Recommended Europeans </h2><p>  We are pleased to recommend some delicious and nutritious local dishes.  The reviews are good: spicy soup (tom yam), coconut soup (tom ha), green papaya salad (som there), rice noodles fried with various additives, grilled fish stuffed with herbs, local pancakes.  Many holidaymakers like the original local Morning Glory salad (the Thai name is too long).  These are stalks of greens fried with garlic.  And the most consumed dessert in the Land of Smiles is <span>glutinous rice</span> with mangoes.  Thais are also considered great lovers of local coconut ice cream, which is eaten with bread. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tune hotel patong" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/792600.jpg" width="427"></div>

    <p>  Have we convinced you to eat at the top  Indeed, the economical hotel Tune Hotel Pattaya 3 *, more precisely, its cafe, cannot provide you with such an assortment of really tasty, healthy and inexpensive dishes. </p><p>  If you are determined to eat in local cafes and restaurants, be prepared for the fact that you will bring bills with "European" prices. </p><p>  Finish our gastronomic certificate on the positive.  Families who come with small children do not experience any inconvenience in Thailand with the purchase of food for them.

In their reviews, they note the advantageous location of the hotel complex, the comfort of its relatively small but neat and well-furnished rooms, good food.  Tourists also note the exceptional friendliness of both staff and local residents.  No wonder Thailand is called the country of smiles!  Crime in the Free Country (roughly translated as "the land of Thai") is one of the lowest in the world.  Visitors have something to learn from Thais whose motto is ‚ÄúSanuk‚Äù (translated as ‚Äúenjoying life‚Äù). </p><p>  Guests of the Tune Hotel Pattaya 3 * hotel freely walk with almost no restrictions in the evening and night.  There are simply no bullies here.  There is no drug trade either.  The laws of this country are merciless both to drug dealers and drug addicts.  Imprisonment - at a minimum.

Indeed, vacationers in the world famous resort city of Pattaya are greeted by many hotels, starting with the famous five-star hotels - Hilton Pattaya, Hard Rock <span>Hotel Pattaya, Pullman Pattaya Hotel.</span>  It is unlikely that they will be able to buy a tour for a ten-day trip for a couple of adults for only $ 1,624, as the Tune Hotel Pattaya 3 * offers. </p><p>  Most of the guest reviews of this hotel contain a positive characteristic of the hotel staff.  Hotel staff are not only friendly and helpful to their guests, they are motivated by the administration not to tip. </p><h2>  Hotel in Patong - party-goers home </h2><p>  Pattaya is considered a favorite place for guests of the Land of Smiles who prefer a relaxing family vacation.  However, some who want to relax in Thailand prefer foam parties and fun until the morning.  They can recommend another city - a resort suitable for such a holiday.  The unique Patong resort located on the island of Phuket, the informal capital of world-class night parties, is very popular and in demand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tune hotel pattaya 3 reviews" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/792592.jpg" width="510"></div>

It is another hotel complex of the Tune Hotels economy class hotel chain and is a modern, spectacular six-story building with 144 standard small rooms.  A pair tour for 8 nights costs only $ 1300. </p><h2>  Benefits of a hotel stay </h2><p>  The comfort of the ‚Äústandard‚Äù rooms is estimated by vacationers as a four-star level.

A five-minute walk from Tune Hotel Patong offers shoppers an inexpensive gift shop.  If you are interested in a more thorough shopping, you will have to go a little further.

Tourists recommend bargaining while shopping at the market located near Tune Hotel Patong 3 *.  Reviews of hotel guests indicate that the initial prices, voiced by the seller, are inflated 3-4 times.  In principle, the real "selling" value of a product in Taiwan's markets is similar to its value in fixed-price stores.  Therefore, before heading to the market, we recommend visiting a fixed price store. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tune hotel pattaya 3 pattaya" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/792602.jpg" width="532"></div>

    <p>  We advise holidaymakers, future guests of the 3 * Tune Hotel Patong (Phuket), seeking exotic entertainment, not to lose their head.  Beautiful enticing "girls" on the streets are most often men.  Moreover, their appearance is often impeccable, because their lifestyle involves hours of treatment in local beauty salons. </p><p>  The fact remains: Tune Hotel Patong 3 * (Phuket) is often chosen for their vacation by people who want to realize their sexual and erotic fantasies.  Patong Resort is an informal Asian capital of the sex industry. </p><h2>  Water activities for tourists </h2><p>  Reviews of guests of the hotel complex recommend, in addition to shopping (which we have already mentioned), also water activities. </p><p>  This is facilitated by the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe coast of Pattaya and the beaches of Phuket.  Tune Hotel Patong 3 * and Tune Hotel Pattaya are washed by the waters of the Gulf of Thailand.  Its depth is ideal for beginners: at a distance of 20 kilometers from the coastline is only 11 meters, the average depth of the bay is 45 m. </p><p>  The currents in its water area are not strong.  Warm waters led to the formation of an underwater coral world, interesting for divers and snorkelers (snorkellers and snorkellers).  Hotel guests use the services of diving schools and rent appropriate equipment. </p><p>  In South Pattaya, Sukhumvit Street is home to the head office of the world's largest diving instructor association (PADI).  Of those who want to, they recruit groups and under the vigilant supervision of instructors they are taught the art of safe immersion.  In the reviews of guests of the Tune Hotel Pattaya posted their photos in the underwater world.  Moreover, the very first dives of beginners take place in a special pool-aquarium.  Complete training has a multi-stage structure.  Resorts who come to Taiwan have the opportunity to first get basic skills in a diving school.  This is sufficient for most beginners.  Interested in diving awaits the open course, then - advanced open course, and finally, seriously interested in diving - reascue course. </p><p>  Those wishing to learn diving are among the guests of Tune Hotel Patong.  Their feedback on the underwater kingdom off the coast of Taiwan is enthusiastic: they feel their harmony with nature here. </p>
