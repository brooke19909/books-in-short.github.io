    <h2>  Man in the world of science </h2><p>  In earlier times, the development and advancement of science was mainly dominated by men, whether in China, Greece, India, or the Middle East.  From the 16th to the 20th century, it developed mainly in Western countries.  But over time, everything has changed.  Science in the world is now open to everyone - regardless of nationality, gender, religious affiliation, or any other personal characteristic.  People from almost all corners of the planet take part in its development, and specialized institutions work in each country. </p><p>  A variety of scientific fields is one of the keys to progress.  This allows you to cover many points of view, to develop various approaches to solving various kinds of problems that help balance irregularities and lead to a more complete understanding of the natural world.  Science and technology of the world are world heritage.  Nowadays, it is open to absolutely everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="man in the world of science" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1157932.jpg" width="600"></div>

What do you see?  It can be your hand on a mouse, a computer screen, a newspaper, a ballpoint pen on a table and much more.  In a sense, science is our knowledge of all things that exist in the Universe: from the smallest particles in a metal atom to nuclear reactions that form a huge fiery star - the Sun.  Complex chemical interactions and electrical vibrations within our own body can also serve as an example, which allows us to read and understand these words. </p><p>  But it is equally important that science in the world is a continuous and interesting process by which we learn about how the <span>Universe works.</span>  However, science is different from many other methods of learning, as it relies on testing ideas and hypotheses with evidence gathered in the natural world.  Most of all people are interested in the issue of cognition of the natural world and gaining access to those areas that have a direct impact on human life. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="science and technology of the world" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1157931.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  That's all she ... </h2><p>  Science helps to satisfy the natural curiosity with which we are all born: <span>why is the sky blue,</span> how <span>did the</span> leopard get its spots, <span>what is a solar eclipse?</span>  With its help, we can answer all questions without resorting to any magical explanations.  Education in this area inevitably leads to technological progress, and also helps to understand extremely important and useful topics, such as health, the environment and natural hazards. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Science is good.  The knowledge gained with its help is a powerful and reliable force.  They can be used to develop new technologies, treat diseases and solve many other problems.  Science constantly updates and accumulates information about the universe.  As a rule, this leads to new questions for further investigation.  In other words, this is a global human activity in which, one way or another, people around the world take part. </p>

Without it, modern society would not be modern.  But you should not stop there: we still have a lot to learn.  Millions of scientists are working to put together the various pieces of the puzzle.  They are trying to find out how the Universe works by peering into its nooks and crannies with the help of microscopes and telescopes.  People use all kinds of tools to solve its secrets.
