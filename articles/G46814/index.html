  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of the coat of arms of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the coat of arms of Russia is very ancient and interesting, it contains many facts related to its creation.  The first information can be traced back to 1497, since scientists proved that it was at this time that the seal of Ivan III, which he received from Vasily the Dark, was the designation of a lion tormenting a snake (the lion at that time was a symbol of the Principality of Vladimir). </p><p>  To form the ideology of a united country, a new symbol of power was chosen by the end of the 15th century.  The history of the coat of arms of Russia indicates that the designation of statehood was chosen George the Victorious (previously it was used in Kievan Rus).  The double-headed eagle was chosen as another symbol. </p><p>  The history of the coat of arms of Russia indicates that de facto this symbol challenged the right of the Habsburg Empire to be called the strongest state in Western Europe.  In addition, there was a formal reason for this, because the wife of Ivan III, <span>Sofia Paleolog,</span> was the daughter of the head of the Morey despot, and the double-headed eagle was their patrimonial sign. </p><p>  With the final elimination and cessation of dependence on the Golden Horde, the first grand-prince seal appeared.  Historians came to the conclusion that the history of the coat of arms of Russia begins with the state emblem depicted on the seal, which sealed the letter of the individual princes to land in 1497. At the same time, images appeared in the Kremlin on the walls of the <span>Faceted Chamber</span> in the form of a gilded double-headed eagle on red field. </p><p>  In the years 1539-1589.  under Ivan the Terrible, the double-headed eagle is transferred to the coat of arms of Russia.  History mentions the addition of its unicorn in the center.  Then it was replaced by the horseman-snake-man - the Moscow symbol.  Later, Orthodox symbolism appeared, which reflected the role of official religion. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The horseman was identified with the sovereign, and since the time of Ivan the Terrible, he appeared on Russian seals and coins.  The image symbolizing the Grand Duke, so perceived until the beginning of the 18th century.  Only under Peter I (in 1710) he began to be called "St. George."  In those years, imperial emblem was established. </p><p>  The times of Russian unrest in 1604-1606  made their changes in state symbols.  The traditions of Western European heraldry were used: the horseman turned right, and instead of the cross, the third crown appeared for the first time.  After 1625, a double-headed eagle with three crowns, meaning the conquered Astrakhan, Siberian and Kazan kingdoms, was decorated with the coat of arms of Russia. </p><p>  The history of the reign of Alexei Mikhailovich makes adjustments, which are expressed in the appearance of the <span>scepter and power.</span>  After 1699, elements of the Order of St. Andrew appeared on the coat of arms, which were introduced at the insistence of the ruler.  The eagle acquires a black color in the manner of Western European coats of arms.  By decree of 1704, the image of the rider (George the Victorious) is called the "sovereign."  This is confirmed in documents of the later, 1730s. </p><p>  The history of the coat of arms of 1730-1740  gets a fixed form for a long time.  The Swedish engraver, invited by the Empress Anna Ioannovna, was Swiss by birth and engraved, with minor modifications, the State Seal, which was used until 1856. </p><p>  Emperor Paul I, after Napoleon conquered Malta, became the head of <span>the Order of Malta,</span> and the history of the coat of arms continued to undergo changes, and a cross was placed on the chest of the eagle.  During the <span>reign of Paul I</span> , a complex <span>emblem of the Russian Empire was</span> developed <span>,</span> consisting of 43 small ones, which they did not have time to approve during his lifetime.  In 1830, various other variations appeared, but Emperor <span>Nicholas I</span> adopted 2 official types. </p><p>  In 1856, the small coat of arms was approved, and the heraldic reform of Alexander II in 1857 adopted a whole set of designs, consisting of 110 drawings.  In the future, until the February Revolution, there are no changes in this important state issue. </p><p>  After the Provisional Government came to power in 1917, all attributes of the coat of arms, except for the eagle, were lost.  In this form, it existed until 24/07/1918, until a new Soviet model was adopted.  In 1978, a red star was added to it.  In 1992, the inscription "RSFSR" was abolished on the symbol of statehood, replacing it with another - "Russian Federation".  The adoption of the modern state coat of arms took place in 1993. </p>
