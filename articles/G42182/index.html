    <h2>  Characterization of a chemical element </h2><p>  If we talk about manganese as an element of the <span>periodic system,</span> then first of all it is necessary to characterize its position in it. </p><ol><li>  It is located in the fourth large period, the seventh group, a subgroup. </li><li>  The serial number is 25. Manganese is a chemical element whose atomic <span>nucleus charge</span> is +25.  The number of electrons is the same, neutrons - 30. </li><li>  The value of the atomic mass is 54.938. </li><li>  The designation of the chemical element of manganese is Mn. </li><li>  The Latin name is manganese. </li></ol><p>  It is located between chromium and iron, which explains its similarity with them in physical and chemical characteristics. </p><h2>  Manganese - chemical element: transition metal </h2><p>  If we consider the electronic configuration of the reduced atom, then its formula will look like: 1s <sup>2</sup> 2s <sup>2</sup> 2p <sup>6</sup> 3s <sup>2</sup> 3p <sup>6</sup> 4s <sup>2</sup> 3d <sup>5</sup> .  It becomes obvious that the element under consideration is a <span>transition metal</span> from the d-family.  Five electrons on the 3d sublevel indicate the stability of the atom, which is manifested in its chemical properties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a metal, manganese is a reducing agent, however, most of its compounds are capable of exhibiting sufficiently strong oxidizing abilities.  This is due to the various oxidation states and valencies that this element possesses.  This is the peculiarity of all metals of this family. </p><p>  Thus, manganese is a chemical element located among other atoms and having its own special characteristics.  Consider what these properties are, in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Manganese is a chemical element.  Oxidation state </h2><p>  We have already given the electronic formula of the atom.  According to her, this element is able to exhibit several positive degrees of oxidation.  It: </p><ul><li>  0; </li><li>  +2; </li><li>  +3; </li><li>  +4; </li><li>  +6; </li><li>  +7. </li></ul><p>  The valency of an atom is equal to IV.  The most stable are those compounds in which values ‚Äã‚Äãof +2, +4, +6 are manifested in manganese.  The highest oxidation state allows compounds to act as the strongest oxidizing agents.  For example: KMnO <sub>4</sub> , Mn <sub>2</sub> O <sub>7</sub> . </p><p>  Compounds with +2 are reducing agents, manganese (II) hydroxide has amphoteric properties, with the predominance of the main ones.  Intermediate oxidation states form amphoteric compounds. </p><h2>  Discovery story </h2><p>  Manganese is a chemical element that was not discovered immediately, but gradually by various scientists.  However, people have used its compounds since ancient times.  Manganese (IV) oxide was used for the smelting of glass.  One Italian stated that the addition of this compound in the chemical production of glasses colors their color purple.  Along with this, the same substance helps eliminate turbidity in stained glass. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Later in Austria, the scientist Kaym managed to get a piece of metallic manganese, influencing high temperature on pyrolisite (manganese (IV) oxide), potash and coal.  However, this sample had many impurities, which he failed to eliminate, so the discovery did not take place. </p><p>  Even later, another scientist also synthesized a mixture in which a significant proportion accounted for pure metal.  It was Bergman, who had previously discovered the element nickel.  However, he was not destined to bring the matter to the end. </p>

    <p>  Manganese is a chemical element, which Karl Scheele first managed to obtain and isolate as a simple substance in 1774.  However, he did this together with I. Gan, who completed the process of smelting a piece of metal.  But even they were not able to completely rid him of impurities and get a 100% yield of the product. </p><p>  Nevertheless, it was this time that became the discovery of this atom.  These same scientists made an attempt to give a name as discoverers.  They chose the term manganesium.  However, after the discovery of magnesium, confusion began, and the name of manganese was changed to modern (H. David, 1908). </p><p>  Since manganese is a chemical element whose properties are very valuable for many metallurgical processes, over time it became necessary to find a way to obtain it in its purest form.  This problem was solved by scientists around the world, but managed to be resolved only in 1919 thanks to the work of R. Agladze, a Soviet scientist and chemist.  It was he who found a way in which it is possible to obtain pure metal with a substance content of 99.98% from sulfates and manganese chlorides by electrolysis.  Now this method is applied worldwide. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Being in nature </h2><p>  Manganese is a chemical element whose photo of a simple substance can be seen below.  In nature, there is a mass of isotopes of this atom, the number of neutrons in which varies greatly.  So, the mass numbers vary from 44 to 69. However, the only stable isotope is an element with a value of <sup>55</sup> Mn, all the others have either a negligible short half-life or exist in too small quantities. </p>

    <p>  Since manganese is a chemical element, the oxidation state of which is very different, it also forms a lot of compounds in nature.  In its pure form, this element does not occur at all.  In minerals and ores, his constant neighbor is iron.  In total, you can identify some of the most important rocks, which include manganese. </p><ol><li>  Pyrolusitis.

    <h2>  Chemical properties </h2><p>  From the point of view of chemistry, manganese is a chemical element whose ion charge varies greatly from +2 to +7.  This leaves its mark on its activity.  In its free form in air, manganese reacts very weakly with water and dissolves in dilute acids.  However, it is only necessary to increase the temperature, as the metal activity increases sharply. </p><p>  So, he is able to interact with: </p><ul><li>  nitrogen; </li><li>  carbon; </li><li>  halogens; </li><li>  silicon; </li><li>  phosphorus; </li><li>  gray and other non-metals. </li></ul><p>  When heated without air, the metal easily passes into a vaporous state.  Depending on the degree of oxidation that manganese exhibits, its compounds can be both reducing agents and oxidizing agents.  Some exhibit amphoteric properties.  So, the main ones are characteristic for compounds in which it is +2.  Amphoteric - +4, and acidic and strong oxidizing in the highest value of +7. </p><p>  Despite the fact that manganese is a transition metal, complex compounds for it are few in number.  This is due to the stable electronic configuration of the atom, because its 3d sublevel contains 5 electrons. </p><h2>  Production methods </h2><p>  There are three main ways in which manganese (a chemical element) is obtained in industry.  As the name reads in Latin, we have already designated - manganum.  If you translate it into Russian, it will be "yes, I really clarify, discolor."  Manganese owes its name to the manifested properties, known since antiquity. </p><p>  However, despite the fame, they managed to get it in pure form for use only in 1919.  This is done by the following methods. </p><ol><li>  Electrolysis, the product yield is 99.98%.  In this way manganese is obtained in the chemical industry. </li><li>  Silicothermic, or silicon reduction.  In this method, silicon and manganese (IV) oxide are fused, resulting in the formation of a pure metal.  The yield is about 68%, since the compound of manganese with silicon into silicide is incidentally.  This method is used in the metallurgical industry. </li><li>  The aluminothermic method is reduction using aluminum.  Also does not give too high product yield, manganese is formed contaminated with impurities. </li></ol><p>  The production of this metal is important for many processes carried out in metallurgy.  Even a small addition of manganese can greatly affect the properties of alloys.  It has been proven that many metals dissolve in it, filling it with its crystal lattice. </p>

    <p>  In the extraction and production of this element, Russia ranks first in the world.  This process is also carried out in countries such as: </p><ul><li>  China. </li><li>  SOUTH AFRICA. </li><li>  Kazakhstan. </li><li>  Georgia. </li><li>  Ukraine. </li></ul><h2>  Industrial use </h2><p>  Manganese is a chemical element, the use of which is important not only in metallurgy.  but also in other areas.  In addition to the metal in its pure form, various compounds of this atom are of great importance.  Denote the main ones. </p><ol><li>  There are several types of alloys that, thanks to manganese, have unique properties.  For example, <span>Hadfield steel is</span> so strong and wear-resistant that it is used for smelting parts of excavators, stone processing machines, crushers, ball mills, armor parts. </li><li>  Manganese dioxide is an indispensable oxidizing element of galvanic, it is used to create depolarizers. </li><li>  Many manganese compounds are needed for the implementation of organic syntheses of various substances. </li><li>  Potassium permanganate (or potassium permanganate) is used in medicine as a strong disinfectant. </li><li>  This element is part of bronze, brass, forms its own alloy with copper, which is used for the manufacture of aircraft turbines, blades and other details. </li></ol><h2>  Biological role </h2><p>  The daily requirement for manganese for a person is 3-5 mg.  Deficiency of this element leads to depression of the nervous system, sleep disturbance and anxiety, dizziness.  Its role has not yet been fully studied, however, it is clear that, first of all, it affects: </p><ul><li>  height; </li><li>  genital gland activity; </li><li>  hormones work; </li><li>  blood formation. </li></ul><p>  This element is present in all plants, animals, and humans, which proves its important biological role. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Item Information </h2><p>  Manganese is a chemical element, interesting facts about which can impress any person, and also make you understand how important it is.  Here are the most basic of them that have found their imprint in the history of this metal. </p><ol><li>  In the difficult times of the civil war in the USSR, one of the first export products was ore containing a large amount of manganese. </li><li>  If manganese dioxide is fused with <span>potassium hydroxide</span> and nitrate, and then the product is dissolved in water, then amazing transformations will begin.  First, the solution turns green, then the color changes to blue, then purple.  Finally, it becomes raspberry and a brown precipitate gradually falls out.  If you shake the mixture, then the green color will restore again and everything will happen again.  That‚Äôs why potassium permanganate got its name, which translates as "mineral chameleon". </li><li>  If fertilizers containing manganese are introduced into the ground, then plants will increase productivity and increase the rate of photosynthesis.  Winter wheat will better form grains. </li><li>  The largest block of rhodonite manganese mineral weighed 47 tons and was found in the Urals. </li><li>  There is a triple alloy called manganin.  It consists of elements such as copper, manganese and nickel.  Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it has a large electrical resistance, which is not dependent on temperature, but is influenced by pressure. </li></ol><p>  Of course, this is not all that can be said about this metal.  Manganese is a chemical element, interesting facts about which are quite diverse.  Especially if we talk about the properties with which he gives various alloys. </p>
