Sberbank: types of plastic cards</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Due to the wide development of the card market, great opportunities are opening up for bank customers.  In conditions of fierce competition, credit organizations present products that have additional capabilities and participate in affiliate programs.  Sberbank here is no exception and offers a wide selection of cards of the classic level, bonus, debit and credit cards.  Now we will discuss the question of what are the cards of Sberbank.  The views are quite diverse, let's analyze each separately. </p><h2>  How to choose a Sberbank card? </h2><p>  The choice of a <span>debit card</span> should be made based on your needs, financial capabilities and lifestyle.  In this case, you can fully take advantage of all the advantages of this tool and get the maximum benefit for yourself. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the types of Sberbank cards are completely different, their payment systems are mainly <span>Visa and MasterCard,</span> which are accepted for payment all over the world.  These payment systems differ in that "Visa" is more common in the USA, Latin America, Australia and Canada, and "MasterCard" - in European countries and Africa. </p><p>  Another difference is that the Visa payment system charges a commission of 0.65% of the total payment for currency conversion operations.  As for MasterCard, it does not charge a commission at all. </p><h2>  Instant Issue Cards </h2>

This requires a banking service agreement.  In addition, Sberbank offers types of plastic cards that do not have annual service.  And also you do not need to pay anything for the card itself.  This option is the fastest and most economical, allowing you to pay for purchases in stores and services, replenish and withdraw cash.  These cards are not registered, they can be used on the territory of the country, and they can also be used to make payments via the Internet. </p><h2>  Sberbank Youth Debit Cards </h2>

These are universal cards that allow operations in self-service areas throughout the region.  The annual card service is 300 rubles.  The daily withdrawal limit is only fifty thousand rubles.  If an amount above the established limit is required, then in this case a commission is charged in the amount of half a percent of the amount.  If you need to deposit or withdraw funds outside your region, a fee of 0.75% of the total amount will be charged.  What are the advantages of these Sberbank cards? </p><ul><li>  The types of such cards are relatively inexpensive. </li><li>  There are no commissions for withdrawing and depositing cash within the limits of being in the home region. </li><li>  The ability to make any payments, including via the Internet. </li></ul><p>  These cards are best used if you are not going to go anywhere outside the region so as not to pay commissions.  Otherwise, it is better to apply for another card to Sberbank.  Bank card types are very different.  Therefore, you can always choose the right option for yourself. </p><h2>  Classic cards of Sberbank </h2>

    <p>  All citizens who have the right to receive an <span>old-age pension,</span> disability, and loss of breadwinner can apply for such a card.  It enables its holder not only to store, but also to increase its savings by quarterly accruing interest on the balance of funds.  The interest rate is 3.5% per annum.  In addition, there are preferential terms of service provided by Sberbank.  Bank cards - types of social cards and the terms of their service - in principle, are no different from others, but at the same time they have free annual service.  Advantages of social cards: </p><ul><li>  The ability to increase their savings. </li><li>  The ability to make purchases in all places where there is a cashless service. </li><li>  The possibility of self-payment of utilities using ATMs and terminals. </li><li>  Free annual maintenance. </li></ul><p>  When using a card, it must be remembered that it is accepted for service only in the country.  Cards of this level cannot be used as salary cards of Sberbank.  Their types are diverse, and under the same conditions you can use any other. </p><h2>  Gold cards of Sberbank </h2>

    <p>  Cards of this level give their owners a huge amount of opportunities.  For this reason, you should spend a little more of your time and draw up just such cards of Sberbank.  The types of such plastic rectangles are no different from the rest.  They can be salary, personal and credit.  Making such a plastic is not at all difficult.  It is enough to simply come to any branch of the bank at the place of your registration.  If you do not have a permanent registration, then the request is considered individually by the head, and if he makes a positive decision, then the card will be issued. </p><p>  Be sure to remember the requirement that anyone who wishes to draw up a card must be at least 18 years old. </p><p>  With gold plastic cards, you can get a lot of privileges.  First of all, the card currency can be any, not necessarily ruble.  For this reason, these cards are great for people who are constantly abroad.  You can pay with Sberbank cards in all countries of the world where such an opportunity exists.  Sberbank is also in close cooperation with various organizations, which, accordingly, allows holders of gold cards to receive bonuses and discounts when servicing in these companies.  In addition, you can connect various services to the card, such as mobile Internet, Sberbank-Online and auto payment. </p><p>  These are far from all the benefits that Gold card holders get.  Card service is three thousand a year.  Of course, this is not so cheap.  But, despite this, the cards still remain in demand. </p>
