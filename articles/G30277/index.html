    <h2>  Ancient people </h2><p>  The most ancient people - primitive gatherers and hunters - appeared on the planet a very long time ago.  Researchers believe that this happened more than 2 million years ago.  The cradle of mankind is considered hot Africa, it was here that the first remains of Australopithecus and Pithecanthropus, the ancestors of Homo sapiens, were discovered.  They looked rude: flattened nose, heavy lower jaw, large superciliary arches. </p><p>  Thanks to modern computer modeling, it was possible to restore their approximate appearance on the skull, so the researchers claim that these people looked very much like monkeys.  They did not yet have a completely straight gait, had long upper limbs.  However, they were distinguished from monkeys by the ability to make and use tools.  These ancient people lived in large groups, which are commonly called primitive communities, led a semi-sedentary lifestyle, wandering in search of food and stopping for long parking.  The main sources of food are hunting and gathering. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Hunting and gathering - what is it? </h2><p>  In history, primitive gatherers and hunters played a crucial role, although these methods of obtaining food did not differ much from representatives of the animal world.  So, ancient people collected roots, fruits and seeds of trees, berries, snails, eggs of birds.  The hunt helped them get meat.  However, even in the early stages of the development of mankind, our distant ancestors managed to subdue the fire, which was carefully guarded by members of the tribe.  It began to cook food, which turned out to be much tastier raw.  The fire helped keep warm, scared away wild animals and midges. </p><p>  So, the first differences between primitive hunters and gatherers from animals were: </p><ul><li>  the use of primitive tools; </li><li>  mastery of fire. </li></ul><p>  And even though our distant ancestors did not yet know how to start a fire on their own, but still, its use was a major step on the path of civilization. </p>

    <h2>  On the path of evolution </h2><p>  Over time, primitive people - hunters and gatherers - developed, learned to make fire, mastered the skills of primitive speech, left the territory of sultry Africa and settled in Europe and Asia.  New, more advanced tools appeared, people began to make clothes from the skins of dead animals, build houses: dugouts or huts from branches and bones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Improved and tools.  So, a spear made of wood was replaced by a more powerful option - a weapon with a stone tip, which was tied to a pole with a vine or plant, which gave the ancient hunter a significant advantage over a wild animal.  Then people invented a bow and arrow, allowing to kill animals from a long distance, and the use of a harpoon made it possible to enjoy the taste of fish. </p><p>  The following representatives of the fauna often became prey: </p><ul><li>  horses; </li><li>  deer </li><li>  wild goats; </li><li>  <span>cave bears</span> ; </li><li>  <span>woolly rhinos</span> ; </li><li>  mammoths. </li></ul><p>  Hunting became collective, people realized that by joint efforts it is easier and safer to get rich prey than acting alone, so they began to drive animals into swamps or ravines and slaughter. </p>

    <h2>  First communities </h2><p>  In history classes in grade 5, primitive gatherers and hunters are studied in their development.  So, teachers tell schoolchildren that people gradually became more and more similar to our contemporaries, both in appearance and in the characteristics of life and life.  Humanity is rallying, moving to the next step after the herd - the tribal community.  She was distinguished by several features: </p><ul><li>  The presence of family ties. </li><li>  Clear internal hierarchy. </li><li>  Common home, food, stocks. </li><li>  Joint hunting, gathering and caring for offspring. </li></ul><p>  Often tribal communities came into conflict with each other.  Scientists believe that there could be a blood feud, when the whole community took revenge for the murder of its member. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Role distribution </h2><p>  The primitive <span>tribal community</span> was distinguished by the fact that each of its members was assigned certain responsibilities.  At the head was an elder, the oldest and wisest man who was endowed with management functions.  It was the elders who kept order, were the guardians of the customs and traditions of the community. </p><p>  The main function of men was to hunt.  Women prepared food, gathered roots and fruits, raised children, sewed clothes and kept fire.  They were respected and respected in the community.  Often the tribal community could have a totem - a kind of animal from which, as ancient people believed, they came from.  There was no hunt for a totem animal, although in some primitive modern tribes it is especially honorable to eat your "ancestor".  Most often, those animals that people constantly observed were used as totems: wolves, foxes, bison, bears and others. </p>

    <h2>  The origin of art </h2><p>  In the <span>era of primitive</span> hunters and gatherers, primitive art also appears.  So, ancient people began to decorate the walls of the caves with fantastic images of animals in their realism, sometimes anthropomorphic paintings are also found.  Sculptures were also made, first of all, the primitive sculptures of pompous women symbolizing motherhood. </p><p>  Music is born, and ideas about life and death are becoming more complicated, evidence of which is the use of jewelry, tools and weapons during burial as a sign that the deceased was noble and respected. </p>

    <h2>  Features of teaching topics </h2><p>  A lesson about primitive gatherers and hunters can be interesting for fifth graders and be left in their memory for a long time.  But for this, the teacher needs to use various methods and techniques of work.  It is best to start with a thoughtful introductory word, which should justify the purpose and objectives of the lesson, explain why students need to know the features of life and life of primitive hunters and gatherers. </p><p>  Graphic materials and illustrations, diagrams, maps will be a good help, this will help to visualize the material and facilitate its perception.  The most suitable teaching method is problem-searching, giving students the opportunity to independently find the answer to the question, show logic and train memory.  A good solution would be a proposal to solve a crossword puzzle, make a diagram, work in pairs or microgroups.  At the lesson, various questions should be answered, answering which the children will not only retell what they have heard or read, but also critically interpret the material.  You can build a lesson in the form of an exciting journey to the country of primitive gatherers and hunters. </p><p>  A good option would be to watch a movie with a student on a large screen with the projector using a projector: this will allow you to immerse yourself in the world of ancient culture and not only learn the material, but also get real pleasure.  Boring traditional methods should be abandoned, otherwise there is a risk of permanently taking students' interest in history. </p>

    <h2>  Verification work </h2><p>  So, the key topic that will open the <span>world of the history of the ancient world</span> is "Primitive Gatherers and Hunters."  In the 5th grade, it is imperative to conduct testing, which will reveal how well the students have learned the material.  A number of questions should be included in the verification work: </p><ul><li>  Which continent became the site of discovery of the first in the history of mankind the remains of ancient people? </li><li>  What is the name of the scientist who is busy digging? </li><li>  Mark a tag that is not related to the clan community. </li></ul><p>  The optimal number of answer options is 4. The student needs to find the right one and circle it. </p><p>  In addition to the test, you need to give students the opportunity to think.  So, questions can be included in the verification work, the answer to which involves a detailed discussion: </p><ul><li>  What was the difference between an ancient man and an animal? </li><li>  Why did primitive people pay attention to religious beliefs? </li></ul><p>  An additional task will be to work with graphic material and contour maps. </p>
