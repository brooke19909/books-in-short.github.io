And there were all reasons for this.  One of the most famous models released by the manufacturer was Nokia 7280, the opinions of which are very different. </p>

    <p>  This phone will be the subject of our today's review.  And first, let's talk about its positioning in the international mobile arena. </p><h2>  Expansion </h2><p>  A few years ago, the Finnish manufacturer chose the tactics of mass expansion, adhering to the trend of expanding the model range.  However, one of the shortcomings of such a policy was the destruction of the face of the apparatus.  Even whole series have been exposed to this.  What was the problem?  The fact is that in the field of design, not alternative, but similar solutions began to be applied.  This also applied to the introduction of a functional framework.  Thus, the phones of various models became similar to each other, like dolls. </p>

    <p>  Yes, the use of the same design solutions brought some benefit.  This helped to emphasize the similarities within the lineup.  However, the negative side of such a decision can be called the imposition of a sense of uniformity.  Probably, this was not reflected in sales in the best way.  The situation began to change only closer to mid-2004.  Then the trends changed, and the manufacturing company began to use internal identity while adding external differences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  On the way to success </h2><p>  Even at that moment, it seemed to many that the Finnish manufacturer had found a compromise, a middle ground, having decided what roles would be assigned to the appearance of the devices and technological fundamentals, as well as in what percentage ratio.  Experts said that the company was able to learn how to create truly balanced solutions.  The ergonomics of models once again became the determining factor. </p><p>  Yes, the changes were not so striking, but they really were, so no one passed them by.  By the way, the result of such a policy of changing trends was Nokia 7280, reviews of which you can read in this article. </p><h2>  How the Finnish manufacturer tried to highlight the model </h2><p>  It is not necessary to say that the most convenient keyboard made of an unusual design was used to create the device.  Here, engineers and designers tried to attract attention due to several other components.  Design elements were involved.  And here, changes in the past and present views of designers and engineers became noticeable to the naked eye. </p>

    <p>  And even with all this, the Finnish manufacturer at that time still could not refuse to manufacture and produce exclusively designer low-functional models.  They were intended for a limited segment of users.  These <span>Nokia 7280, the</span> description of which is given in the review, does not apply. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The Nokia 7280 model, which we are currently reviewing, comes with the device itself, the documentation for it (this is an instruction manual, and also a warranty card), a disc on which the software is recorded, a case made of leather, a special strap for safe transportation, stereo headset for playing music and connecting a radio. </p><p>  Well, the composition is completed by the charger, as well as the SIM card holder and stylus, designed to open the corresponding compartment. </p><h2>  Subtotals </h2><p>  If you look closely at the previous models (such as 7260, 7270) and deal with the main details, you can say that the Finnish manufacturer approached the creation of the series quite seriously, having prepared a whole range of appropriate measures.  The Nokia 7280 was the culmination of this sequence. </p>

    <p>  It was designed as efficiently as possible to occupy the corresponding niche.  Moreover, he had excellent returns, attracting a huge number of potential buyers. </p><h2>  Experimental approach </h2><p>  As you know, all three models were nothing more than a pure experiment.  And in such conditions, the developers of the device allowed themselves to move away from the unwritten rules, trying to create something that had not happened before.  Probably, they still managed to turn a standard mobile phone into something like that with a twist.  In principle, kitsch was a success, an attempt to create an unusual device was a success. </p><h2>  First look at the phone </h2><p>  You can often find questions of the following plan: "Nokia 7280: how to dial a number?"  A very strange question, because to send a voice call it is enough to go to the appropriate menu and enter the subscriber number there.  But what thoughts come to mind at the first glance at the subject of our today's review? </p>

    <p>  It immediately becomes clear that the model is not at all similar to the familiar mobile phone.  The device is made in a rectangular shape, and therefore some people tend to confuse the device with an ordinary voice recorder.  I would like to note that some super-important innovations by the developers of the device have not been applied.  I remember that in a similar form factor their devices were first launched by a company called Haier. </p><h2>  Dimensions and dimensions </h2><p>  Nokia 7280's parameters almost coincide with the creations of Haier.  If we talk about specific figures, then it is 32 mm wide and 19 mm thick.  And if in the case of the second company the devices were not very popular, then the Finnish manufacturer managed to realize the products as efficiently as possible, raising the general level. </p><p>  When creating the device, the Finns focused on the image segment.  That is why the corresponding materials were used for the manufacture. </p><h2>  Device features </h2><p>  There are several of them in the mobile phone.  Firstly, the screen of the model is made as if mirror.  If the device will be in standby mode, then we can enjoy the most that is a real mirror.  The second feature is the speaker grill.  Its designers covered with a special insert made of suede.  It should be noted that it is simply mounted in the case itself.  We can notice a similar element on the right side.  There he helps to use the device as a camera. </p>

    <p>  The disadvantage of suede inserts can be called the fact that they are extremely easily soiled.  It will not take long after the start of use, and you will already notice traces of dust, dirt and other minor troubles.  The inserts can be cleaned, however, this will require a special brush. </p><h2>  Reviews about the Nokia 7280 phone </h2><p>  So, what can we learn from the reviews of people who have purchased this phone model?  As noted, the sound capabilities are similar to those characteristic of the hardware platform installed, for example, in the 6230 model. One of the advantages is the speaker volume, which is enough for most situations.  It is also possible to activate a special mode.  The volume margin can always be used by connecting an equalizer. </p><p>  A common drawback is the volume of using factory tunes.  Especially for such cases, an additional library of sounds was added, some of which simulate the corresponding situations.  For example, you can hear the noise of the airport, followed by an announcement telling about the departure of a plane.  If you use a custom melody in MP3 format, then there should not be any special problems with recognition.  A significant drawback is a weak vibration alert. </p>

    <p>  This may also include the fact that there is no familiar keyboard.  Perhaps that is why questions like ‚ÄúNokia 7280‚Äù appear: how to dial a number and make voice calls? ‚Äù  Nevertheless, this causes inconvenience only at the beginning, until the user understands the basics of management.  In general, we can say that the Nokia 7280 model, reviews of which are mostly positive, has become a designer phone.  This device has every chance of existence. </p>
