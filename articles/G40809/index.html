How to get to Vnukovo airport? </p><p>  Aeroexpress is in transit for about forty minutes.  But since there are many security procedures, check-in and baggage waiting for you at the airport, it is advisable to board the train no later than two hours before the departure of the domestic flight, and at least three before the international flight. </p><p>  Some airlines offer the option of baggage check-in directly at the station.  This saves you a lot of time.

Although there is no direct flight between these airports, on the other hand, express travels to one of them to the Belorussky railway station, and from the other to Kievsky.  And between them it is easy to overcome the distance by metro.  Thus, in order to get from one hub to another, you will spend less than an hour and a half. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  If you buy a ticket for Aeroexpress to Vnukovo at the box office or through an automatic machine, then it will cost 500 rubles (1000 when traveling there and back).  And when purchasing travel documents via the Internet, the price will be slightly lower - 420 p.  one way and 840 both ways. </p><p>  If you want to ride in comfort in a business class, then it will cost you 1000 rubles one way.  Children under five are transported free of charge.  There are also discounted rates, for example, "Family" (two adults and three children under 14 can go for an amount that is barely more than 800 rubles).  And kids from 5 to 7 years old buy tickets for 130 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vnukovo airport how to get aeroexpress" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1892330.jpg" width="600"></div>
