    <p>  In order to find out the contents of chromic acid, you need to familiarize yourself with a certain theoretical course of chemistry.  If you have neither the desire nor the time for this procedure, then this article is especially for you.  Chromic acid is a <span>crystalline substance</span> predominantly red.  It is an electrolyte of medium strength and can be actively used in industry.  Although the substance itself does not conduct <span>electric current</span> , its solutions and melts have this ability.  In addition, chromic acid salts are quite toxic and are oxidizing agents. </p><p>  Solutions of chromic acid are used in various fields of human activity.  In a chemical laboratory, chromic acid sometimes becomes an indispensable substance, without which one or another experiment is impossible.  With its help get rid of organic residues, which are practically insoluble when using other reagents.  The most common use of chromic acid is to clean laboratory glassware of various chemicals that cannot be removed simply by rinsing with water.  This made it possible to obtain relatively clean dishes for experiments, which inevitably leads to significant cost savings. </p><p>  Chromic acid is a very important element of the etching process.  The chromium mixture can reveal the structure of many materials for the manufacture of conductive paths and membranes.  One of the most unusual areas of application of the substance is the artistic processing of materials, because due to its properties it is able to modify the outer surface of the processed materials.  Most often it is used to apply relief to metal, although other decorative materials are possible.  Products processed with chromic acid retain their aesthetic properties for a long time and do not react with the environment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the automotive world, chromic acid has also found its application.  The composition is mainly used to create catalysts.  In this case, thanks to it, there is a decrease in the production of harmful substances by <span>exhaust gases.</span>  This feature has allowed world-renowned automotive brands to create environmentally friendly cars with minimal exhaust emissions, which means with the least pollution.  In addition, another technology for the use of chromium is very often used - chromic acid processes parts that can be damaged during friction.  Acid and acid anhydrides in this case significantly increase the surface hardness of the part.  This effect is achieved as a result of the chromium plating process; the required thickness of the chromium layer is increased by the action of an electric current on it. </p><p>  Thanks to a solution based on chromic acid, metal corrosion can be reduced.  The <span>zinc oxide</span> film in this case sufficiently densely covers the treated surface, and the part itself acquires a slightly golden hue.  A protective oxide film on the metal is also created using the passivation process.  In this case, thanks to special solutions based on chromic acid, the metal is transferred to a passive state and becomes more resistant to external changes and the effects of an aggressive environment.  Another area of ‚Äã‚Äãapplication of chromic acid is the process of creating heavy-duty surfaces and materials.  Basically, it is especially appreciated when creating molding and core mixtures, which acquire new forms due to the heating process. </p><p>  Chromic acid has firmly taken its place in human life, it is now difficult to imagine <span>heavy industry</span> without this substance.  And if you take into account that this acid is not so expensive, then it does occupy a leading place in the formation of the industrial world! </p>
