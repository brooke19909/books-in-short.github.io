    <p>  Literally recently, certain changes have occurred regarding this document, namely: in accordance with one of the federal laws, single-type policies will now operate in Russia.  However, until now, some of our citizens do not have reliable information on how and where to change their medical policy.  Before proceeding with this procedure, it is necessary to know reliably who exactly and why POMS is needed. </p><h2>  Purpose of this document </h2><p>  So, immediately after birth, each person in the Russian Federation must be issued a <span>medical insurance policy.</span>  It is precisely because of the issue to absolutely everyone that he received the name of a binding document. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to change medical insurance policy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16984/346670.jpg" width="500"></div>

Including it will not be possible to call the local doctor if necessary.  Also, do not forget that if the law requires the issuance of certain medicines in a preferential manner, it will be impossible to obtain them without this document. </p><p>  That is, the <span>medical policy is</span> intended to confirm the state right of any person in our country to receive the necessary medical assistance without providing money in return. </p><p>  However, due to the fact that now our fellow citizens have a need to change the medical policy, <strong> </strong>  available on hand, many doubt that the old-style document can count on the provision of medical services in full. </p><h2>  Why replace a compulsory medical insurance policy <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to change the medical address policy" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16984/346742.jpg?1394098943813" width="200"></div></h2><p>  In fact, <span>medical care</span> is currently being provided to all people without exception who possess this document, regardless of its type. <br>  According to the information available today, all residents of Russia can change the old policy to a single new-type document until the onset of 2015. </p><p>  Such a long period of policy exchange opportunity is explained by the unwillingness to provoke excitement among the population, because not everyone knows even where to change the medical policy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, in short, why change the medical policy, the answer is simple - then, in order to be able to receive medical care if necessary, both in specialized institutions and at home. </p><h2>  Where to change a medical insurance policy </h2><p>  If we talk directly about this procedure, and more precisely, about the place of its implementation, then this can be done in two ways: </p><ul><li>  by contacting your insurance company or its branch directly; </li><li>  at the place of his work. </li></ul>

Therefore, in order to know exactly where to change the medical policy, you should first contact your supervisor directly, and only then the company where the policy was received.

    <p>  But there is a certain category of citizens who prefers to change the policy independently in any case, rightly believing <span>that this</span> method is much simpler, faster and more convenient.  In addition, information on where to change a medical policy <strong> </strong>  (addresses of insurance companies in particular) can be quickly found on the Internet. </p><p>  However, it is not enough to find a place; you still need to know exactly the reasons for replacing the policy.  Indeed, it is depending on them that the list of documents that must be provided will also change. </p><h2>  Grounds for the exchange </h2><p>  Currently, you can change an existing policy for the following reasons: </p><ol><li>  Replacing an old-style policy with a new one.  In this case, when you come to the insurance company, you must have your old policy, SNILS and passport with you.  After writing the application, the outdated document is considered invalid and disposed of, a temporary certificate is given in return, and a new document is issued a few days later. </li><li>  Exchange of an old policy due to a change in surname, name or patronymic.  In these cases, in addition to the documents required in the first version of the exchange, certificates may also be needed to confirm the officiality, reliability and legality of the changes made. </li><li>  Loss of document. </li></ol><p>  Now that we know where to change the medical policy and why to perform this procedure in general, a few words should be said about the features of the new medical insurance policies. </p><h2>  The nuances of using </h2><p>  There are two features of modern policies.  The first is that it is issued once and for life, not counting those cases when it is subject to replacement.  And the second feature is related to the fact that laminating this document, unlike the old one, is categorically impossible. </p><p>  Therefore, to preserve this policy, you should handle it with extreme care.  Otherwise, at the most inopportune moment, doctors may refuse to provide you with their services. </p>
