    <h2>  Easy way </h2><p>  If you are really interested in how to find out if a mobile phone is being tapped, then you should know that you can download many programs from the Internet that make it possible to record conversations and transmit to attackers from a victim‚Äôs mobile phone.  At the moment, devices that are running Windows Mobile and Symbiam can be classified as a risk group.  It is quite difficult for an ordinary user to find on his device a program that records his conversations.  However, it is worth mentioning the presence of certain symptoms that indirectly indicate the presence of wiretapping on the device. </p><h2>  Programs </h2><p>  So, if we talk about how <span>mobile phones are tapped,</span> then programs for these purposes should be considered.  They are conditionally divided into two groups. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The former record recorded conversations directly into the phone‚Äôs memory in stealth mode.  About five megabytes of free memory will be enough to record an hour's conversation.  Modern devices have 30-50 megabytes of free memory, which is enough for recording 6 hours.  Next, the finished data packets are transferred from the phone to the email address in any way.  Funds for data transfer will be debited from the device, which has undergone wiretapping, which will affect the payment of communication services. </p><p>  The result of the second method is less reliable.  When the listening device starts a conversation, the attacker receives an SMS message indicating the number of the incoming or outgoing call.  And after that, a call is made to the telephone you are listening to wedge into the conversation, that is, start the conference mode.  This method is imperfect, therefore it is used extremely rarely. </p>

    <h2>  What to look for </h2><p>  A hot mobile phone battery should definitely alert the user.  High temperature indicates that at this moment the battery is discharging quite actively.  This is normal if you have been talking on the phone for a long time, but if the device has not been used for several hours, then this may be a sign of an application that is actively consuming battery resources, and it may well be a spy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of work </h2><p>  If we continue to talk about how to find out if a mobile phone is being tapped, then it is worth paying attention to how it turns off.  The presence of a slight delay in this process may also indicate the presence of a spyware application.  Before turning off the power, the smartphone‚Äôs operating system terminates all background processes and also stops the applications that are currently running.  If you take into account that the spyware program records audio files, and also constantly checks for access to the Internet, the process of its work may end a little longer than the others.  Naturally, a long shutdown can sometimes indicate common problems in the software, but more unfavorable options are no exception. </p>

    <h2>  Side effects </h2><p>  Another indicator of whether mobile phones are tapped is the presence of radio interference.  During the conversation, sometimes various extraneous sounds appear on the line, for example, an echo, all kinds of clicks or hissing.  When the signal is weak, it is considered normal, but in the presence of such sounds constantly and for several days it is worth starting to worry.  If we talk about how to understand whether a mobile phone is being tapped, then radio interference can be considered a clear sign of this. </p>

    <p>  Another important point should be noted.  The antenna of the mobile device also creates interference for speakers and speakers, responding to them with an unpleasant sound.  In the normal state, the device rarely accesses the cell towers, which it currently has a connection to.  And if we talk about how mobile phones are tapped, then the presence of interference typical of a radio signal in the sound of the speakers most likely indicates the presence of a spyware program that connects to the Internet to transmit data packets. </p><h2>  Difficult paths </h2><p>  It is not easy enough to listen to a cell phone using special equipment.  The communication channel has such an encoding that intercepting it is quite problematic even for a very experienced craftsman.  Of course, there are methods, but they are very expensive and complex.  Such devices are called "interception systems."  And here it‚Äôs worth mentioning one important point: this method can only be used by special services when connecting network operators.  In this case, there is no answer to the question of how to understand whether a mobile phone is being tapped. </p>

    <p>  However, you should not despair, because you can simplify your life in this situation.  If you decide that your device is tapped with the help of an operator, then you can use some tricks.  It is worth using different telephones, as well as several SIM cards.  You can simply refuse mobile communication by replacing it with IP-telephony.  There is such a device as a scrambler, you can use it for your protection. </p><h2>  How to find out if a mobile phone is being tapped: a combination of numbers </h2><p>  So, you already know several ways to find out if a mobile phone is being tapped.  Code 33 can be used as one more.  To do this, dial the following combination on the device: * 33 * and several digits.  If you see the numbers you are typing on the screen, then everything is in order, otherwise you can be sure that they are listening to you.  However, many argue that this is a myth, and on phones, for example, Samsung, instead of numbers, a hyphen will always be displayed. </p>

    <h2>  Decreased listening likelihood </h2><p>  You can reduce the likelihood of such a difficult situation in completely accessible ways.  Do not send important and confidential information over the phone: credit card information, passwords, information about financial transactions and large payments, and so on.  A mobile phone is not the best way to conduct important business conversations, the results of which can have a strong impact on other people.  If you still need to carry out such a dialogue, then you should use either special devices or encryption systems. </p><p>  If we talk about the possibility of intercepting a telephone signal, then talking on a mobile phone in a fast moving car will be much more difficult to intercept, since you need to be in close proximity to the device.  And this can be used as one of the ways to find out if the <span>MTS mobile phone is being</span> tapped <span>.</span> </p><p>  Tell a reliable person false information.  If it is made public, you can be sure that they are spying on your device.  Now you understand how to find out if a mobile phone is being tapped?  The combination of numbers * 33 * can be your very first assistant. </p>
