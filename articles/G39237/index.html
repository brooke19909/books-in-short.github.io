    <h2>  4. Beatrix Real Estate </h2><p>  Beatrix is ​​another company included in the top 6 best in the ranking of real estate agencies in Moscow.  Over the past 20 years, the company has survived a global crisis and managed real estate transactions for several thousand satisfied customers.  The primary advantage is a good reputation and trust of people.  Founded in the early 1990s and led by Marianna Svechinskaya, from the first day Beatrix was based on the most stringent principles of managing Western business.  The company was formed, created and developed along with the Russian real estate market.  During the tumultuous post-perestroika Russia, Beatrix served the first immigrants who moved to Moscow.  The support of the first corporate clients - the newly formed independent media and the bold Dutch emigrant community (shortly afterwards the <span>diplomatic corps)</span> - provided indispensable business support and a solid launch pad.  So the name Royal Dutch came to be, and the mark of the highest quality was awarded.  Now the company is engaged in the sale of luxury real estate and has on its account several thousand regular customers.  People say that they are satisfied with the services of the company.  Beatrix Real Estate is proud to be one of the pioneers in the country's market. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow real estate agencies reviews ratings" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57358/1932290.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  5. Blackwood </h2><p>  Concern, the fifth in the rating list of real estate agencies in Moscow, was established in 1991.  It is one of the oldest and most experienced real estate companies in the Russian market.  The English name was chosen due to the fact that foreign groups are actively promoting themselves in the Moscow market.  Today, the main clients are foreign citizens who have arrived in Russia on a work visa.  Thanks to a respectable list of emigrants, the company entered the market and became a serious player at the level of international standards.  In 1993, PriceWaterhouseCoopers became Blackwood's first corporate customer.  At the same time, the company began working with a number of foreign embassies, diplomatic missions and large Western companies. </p>
