However, the buyer will not be full of flagships alone.  After all, not every one of us has so much money.  Therefore, the company is playing a game in the direction of the niche of budget smartphones.  Despite the fact that in recent years Samsung has been trying to make money on its brand, the company's devices do not become less popular.  These include the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Win GT-I8552, which we will review today. </p>

    <h2>  Brief Specifications </h2><p>  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Win GT-I8552 has a screen with a diagonal of 4.7 inches.  There are two cameras.  The main resolution is 5 megapixels.  The smartphone has a chipset with four cores.  The amount of internal RAM and long-term memory is, respectively, one and eight gigabytes.  As software, an Android operating system of version 4.1 is installed on board the device.  To work in a cellular network, you can install a SIM-card standard "Micro".  There are two card slots.  The battery is not the most capacious: only 2,000 milliamps per hour.  In general, we have a typical representative of the budget class. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Exterior </h2><p>  Samsung 8552, the characteristics of which we have just listed, is made in the traditional spirit inherent in this South Korean company.  It‚Äôs unlikely to talk about the features here.  However, let's look at the smartphone from possible angles and find out what it has.  Before us, in general, is a typical Samsung.  In it, the body is made in such a way as to ‚Äúmow‚Äù under the gloss.  A silver edging is laid around the perimeter.  The control circuit is made in a standard form. </p>

    <h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  Dimensions are also typical and similar to those of other devices in the segment.  In height, the device reaches 133 millimeters, in width and thickness - 71 and 10, respectively. Moreover, the device weighs 140 grams.  The model is wide enough.  That is why not all users will be able to work with it with one hand.  It is sometimes difficult to close the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe touch screen with your finger.  And this means that you have to connect to the work with your second hand.  A significant drawback of the case is its slippery.  Again, when working with one hand, it's quite easy to drop a smartphone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  From above </h2><p>  Above the screen of the Samsung Galaxy 8552, you can see a silver grille that protects the earpiece.  There is also a set of sensors.  Unfortunately, this model of the South Korean developer cannot boast of the presence of a light sensor.  Below we see the mechanical button needed to go to the main screen.  Two touch elements are located on the sides, allowing you to return and view a list of open applications.  They are equipped with a backlight, which is, although insignificant, but still a plus. </p>

    <h2>  Side view </h2><p>  Samsung Vin Duos 8552 also has other mechanical elements that are located on the side faces of the smartphone.  They allow you to adjust the sound level and change the sound mode of the device, as well as lock the screen.  The output for wired headphones is placed on the upper edge.  This is an ordinary 3.5 mm standard jack.  On the opposite side there is a microphone, as well as a connector for connecting a MicroUSB cable. </p>

    <h2>  Behind </h2><p>  There is a camera lens on the back cover.  He protrudes strongly in the center.  And this is not so good, as there is a risk of scratching the glass.  On the sides of the lens is an LED flash, as well as a sound speaker.  I would like to note that the rear panel itself is fixed (latched) tightly.  To remove it, you have to pry off from the side.  After that, you can find the Samsung battery.  On the sides of it there are connectors that are needed for the integration of SIM cards and / or an external microSD <span>memory</span> card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Like many devices of the line, the model received a screen that does not exceed a diagonal of five inches.  Moreover, the TFT variation is set as the matrix.  We are used to thinking that TFT TN is already the last century.  Yes, perhaps it is.  However, in this case, the use of such a matrix can be justified by the fact that the Samsung battery does not discharge after several hours of active use.  But back to the numbers.  A screen with a diagonal of 4.7 inches displays a picture in a resolution of 480 by 800 pixels.  It is stable, there is no distortion. </p><p>  It still looks better when compared with the Galaxy Grand.  Here the resolution is the same, but the screen size is larger.  That is why image distortion occurs.  Thus, a similar decision by the Koreans can be called a compromise.  At the same time, the minus of the TFT TN matrix will be the fading of the picture in the sun.  Perhaps this problem could be fixed by expanding the brightness range.  But this is not here, the range is small.  Therefore, get ready for the fact that reading in sunlight will be almost impossible. </p><h2>  The paradox of decisions </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the Samsung Vin 8552 lacks a sensor for automatic brightness control.  You can only change the value manually.  Given the fact that the smartphone has many other, not the most simple functions, the absence of this important component looks at least strange.  It seems impossible to understand why the developers worked hard on this for a long time, investing additional funds in the device, but in the end decided not to embed the <span>light sensor</span> . </p>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  At the point where the technical specifications are described, we said that the processor has a built-in processor based on four cores.  The frequency of each of them is 1.2 gigahertz.  As a graphics accelerator, Adreno 203 is used here.  RAM is not so much, just one gigabyte.  To store user data built-in 8 GB.  To expand this volume, you can use external drives up to 64 GB in size.  Samsung 8552 works with the preinstalled operating system of the Android family version 4.1.2.  She is relatively old.  Although not all users pay attention to this. </p><p>  The main thing is that the shell and OS work smoothly, without hangs.  Even despite the relative weakness of the chipset and graphics accelerator, a small amount of RAM, the interface does not "dull".  The same can be said about undemanding applications.  In general, speed should not disappoint us.  And many Samsung 8552 buyers liked this.  Fans of watching videos and movies using a smartphone will not be disappointed. </p><h2>  Interface Features </h2><p>  Let's look at the lock screen.  There you can notice a certain amount of service information.  There are also three shortcuts.  They allow you to use this or that application at the right time.  The selected widgets are displayed on the lock screen.  Each user can customize the wallpaper to his taste.  At the top is a line containing shortcuts needed to quickly activate or deactivate smartphone features.  There are several ways to unlock your device.  From simple to complex: this is unlocking with a finger gesture or turning on the front camera. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the device </h2><p>  So, it's time to draw a line under today's review.  Who is this phone for?  The device will appeal to people who often use just two SIM-cards at once and spend most of the time using a smartphone for talking and talking.  At the same time, a cover will become a necessary accessory for Samsung 8552.  I would like to note that the settings menu for SIM cards here has a considerable number of points.  Perhaps today in the smartphone market this is the best option for several cards. </p><h2>  Is there a choice? </h2><p>  Nevertheless, it is not so difficult to find an alternative for a similar price.  Given that the most weak points of a smartphone are its screen, resolution and picture quality, we can come to a simple conclusion.  Not everyone who likes to read electronic books, surf the Internet for a long time and watch movies, will want to purchase this model.  Performance is also not at the highest level, there are devices and more powerful.  However, the main thing is that the shell works smoothly, and the stability of the operating system is commendable.  If the user is not chasing the latest games, then an option such as Galaxy Vin will be a good solution for him. </p>
