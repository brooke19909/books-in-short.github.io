    <h2>  Guest reviews of the Gorki Panorama Hotel </h2><p>  For those who want to see the Caucasus Mountains with their own eyes, breathe fresh mountain air and rush along the snow-covered slopes with a breeze, a wonderful choice is a vacation in Gorki Panorama (4 * hotel).  Reviews of tourists, who have already accumulated quite a lot, directly indicate that the time spent in this hotel will pass in the best way. </p><p>  According to our compatriots, the hotel has a very convenient entrance and is in a very good location.  The staff here are very friendly, spacious and bright rooms are cleaned very high quality.  The views of the majestic mountains from the hotel rooms are also admirable, however, such beauty is not available in all rooms. </p><p>  At the same time, some former guests complain that in public areas of the hotel, for example, by the pool, in the locker rooms and in the gym, it is quite dirty and wet, which greatly spoils the overall impression.  Guests also notice tattered wallpaper and peeling paint, but attribute such flaws to minor details. </p>
