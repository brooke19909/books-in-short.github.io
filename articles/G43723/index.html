In order to be able to dispose of property, it is necessary to register the rights and make changes to the unified register.  Depending on the current situation, it is necessary to follow certain regulations in order to collect the appropriate package of documents when provided to authorized organizations.  An integral part of this procedure is the payment of state fees for registration of ownership. </p><h2>  National tax </h2><p>  This is a payment for legally significant services provided by the state, charged from organizations and individuals.  The legitimacy of payments is regulated by Article 333. 33 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  The state duty for registration of ownership of real estate is paid in case of need to draw up a contract of sale, gift, barter, inheritance, as well as other actions subject to mandatory registration in accordance with the law FZ-N 122 .. </p><h2>  Property Registration Process </h2><p>  At the moment, in addition to Rosreestr, you can register your property rights in multifunctional centers, which were created in order to offload the registration department.  At the same time, details of the <span>state duty for registering the</span> right of ownership through the MFC may differ. </p><p>  Registration cannot exceed the established deadlines without good reason, while the preparation of papers can take much longer.  Depending on the type of real estate, as well as the legal status of the property for which you are applying, the requirements for the documents presented may vary. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most common package of documents: </p><ul><li>  An application asking for a change of ownership with title documents (that is, on what basis does the current owner own the property, for example, a sales contract, certificate of inheritance, etc.). </li><li>  Technical and (or) cadastral passport. </li><li>  Passports of participants in the transaction. </li><li>  A notarized power of attorney, if it is not possible to have a personal presence of interested parties (It is important when transferring authority to correctly specify not only personal data. They also prescribe with respect to which object and in which organizations it is allowed to act on your behalf). </li><li>  Signed contracts and deed of transfer. </li><li>  Copy of personal account and information about registered persons. </li><li>  Confirmation of payment of state duty. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.belnovosti.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="The multifunctional center will answer all questions." class="if uuid-2377572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80440/2377572.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, the registrar receives information about the state duty crediting on his own, but it is recommended to provide this information along with the rest of the documents in order to exclude the possibility of rejecting or increasing the time for consideration of the application.  Until the payment is credited to the budget, the registrar will not start the process. </p><blockquote><p>  Information about the property is contained in the Unified State Register of Real Estate.  Having ordered an extract from the USRN, you can find out about the legal claims, restrictions and encumbrances established in relation to a particular object. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div></blockquote><h2>  How much should I pay? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wsj.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Payment of state fee by credit card" class="if uuid-2377202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80440/2377202.jpg"></div><p>  The size of the state duty for registering property rights for individuals and organizations has a significant difference. </p><p>  As of 2018, some of the most common registration fees are paid for such services: </p><ol><li>  Registration of restrictions (encumbrances) of rights to immovable property, such as the conclusion of a long-term lease, concession, etc., as well as an agreement on the alienation of immovable property (purchase and sale, barter, rent, gift, etc.) is the amount of: for individuals - 2000 rubles., Legal entities will pay 22000 rubles. </li><li>  The state duty on the share of property in an apartment building will be 200 rubles. </li><li>  For land plots having the purpose of individual housing construction, private partnership, for an individual garage, cottage, gardening, for a structure erected or being built on such a plot, you need to pay 350 rubles. </li><li>  Amendments to the USRN during registration of a mortgage will cost organizations 4000 rubles, the rest - 1000 rubles. </li><li>  Shared construction (registration of a new building): individuals contribute 350 rubles to the budget, and legal entities - 6,000 rubles. </li></ol><blockquote><p>  The state duty for registration of ownership of the house and the land under it is paid separately. </p></blockquote><h2>  Who can save on clearance? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="State Duty Savings" class="if uuid-2377488" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80440/2377488.jpg"></div><p>  Federal authorities, state authorities, local government bodies and low-income families are legally exempted from paying state fees for registering property rights. </p><p>  The registration of the right is paid by the buyer, and the number of buyers and receipts must be the same, since the amount of the state fee is distributed in equal shares between all applicants. </p><p>  For example, in the contract of sale 3 people are indicated by the buyer.

The electronic information that this service issues is legally binding, the same as when personally contacting the relevant organizations. </p><h2>  Refund Procedure </h2><blockquote><p>  Mistakes in depositing funds are made by both individuals (name, passport data, etc.) and legal entities (KPP, TIN, wrong name of the Office).  This becomes the reason for the refusal of the application to perform legally significant actions. </p></blockquote><p>  If an error occurred, or if the amount of the state duty for registering the right of ownership significantly exceeded the necessary, it is worth contacting the organization that was supposed to perform legally significant actions.  There is also a form for writing the application, which must be filled out by the payer or his authorized representative (only with an indication of these powers in the power of attorney).  It is allowed to apply for a refund within 3 years from the moment of making the money.  Online networks fill out an application form on the official website of Rosreestr. </p><h2>  Who to trust? </h2><p>  Do not forget: if for some reason you do not want or are not able to independently go through the procedure for registering real estate as property, any other adults can act on your behalf.  Notary power of attorney is not required to pay the state fee.  But for the entire procedure of registration and preliminary collection of some documents, a power of attorney is drawn up by a notary with a listing of all instances, as well as an indication of the boundaries of authority in relation to a specific situation.  As a rule, employees of trusted real estate agencies become reliable assistants for individuals. </p>
