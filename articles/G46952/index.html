Recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Until recently, the city of Sochi was associated only with summer vacations on the seashore, but now another concept is firmly connected with it - Krasnaya Polyana, a new ski resort.  Thanks to the sporting events of 2014, from a small, unknown village, this area turned into a real town in the mountains with well-developed logistics and infrastructure.  There are ski slopes of all difficulty levels, a bobsleigh complex, <span>cable cars,</span> shopping and entertainment centers with water parks, many food outlets - from the popular McDonald's to luxury restaurants with fine cuisine and picturesque views. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to new roads and railways, the question of how to get to Krasnaya Polyana from Sochi, Adler or more remote areas has ceased to be difficult, because now you can do it quickly and easily! </p><h2>  Where does Big Sochi begin? </h2><p>  Tourists from other cities are often lost in geographical names (especially the intricate Caucasian ones), have an erroneous idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe boundaries of the city of Sochi and the location of the ski resort.  Let's try to sketch a small outline of the city. </p>

    <p>  Greater Sochi begins with the village of Magri and ends with the village of Psou, stretching along the coast for almost 145 km.  The city includes 4 administrative units, which are located, starting from Magri, in the following sequence: Lazarevsky district, Central, Hostinsky and Adlersky.  In other words, Adler and Hosta are not separate cities at all, as many guests of the resort think, but only settlements within the city.  If you carefully study the city map, you won‚Äôt have to think a lot about how to get to Krasnaya Polyana on your own. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is Krasnaya Polyana located? </h2><p>  Our destination is in the <span>Adler district,</span> 42 kilometers from the coastal part of the city, at an altitude of 560 m above sea level.  How to get to Krasnaya Polyana from Sochi, Adler, will be described in detail below. </p><p>  Sochi itself can be reached by car, by train, or by plane.  Note that there is only one airport in Sochi; it is located in Adler.  But the <span>railway stations</span> and stations are in each of the administrative regions.  For those who decide to get to the city by car, a small warning: to get to the city, you need to overcome a rather complicated serpentine with sharp turns, sharp ascents and descents.  But the beauty of nature compensates for all the inconveniences in full! </p><h2>  We are going to Krasnaya Polyana: the train </h2><p>  When asked how to get to Krasnaya Polyana from Adler, most locals will answer: "By train!"  By 2014, a railway line was laid to the ski slopes, and for two years now a comfortable electric train Lastochka has been running on it.  What could be nicer than climbing the mountains under the measured knock of wheels in a cozy brand new carriage?  Yes, while admiring the amazing nature of the Caucasus Mountains! </p>

You can board them at any station in the city (after having looked at the schedule), and recently routes from Tuapse and even from Krasnodar have also been added.  Traffic intensity depends on the season: in summer there are fewer flights, in winter - more.  But it should be noted that the cost of such a comfortable ride is constantly growing.

Thanks to new interchanges, traffic jams are no longer a global problem.  And now buses run freely along the Krasnaya Polyana - Sochi route, and getting from Adler by bus is also not a problem.  We will orient ourselves in the routes. </p><p>  You can get to Krasnaya Polyana from Sochi by buses No. 105 and 105C.  Buses depart from the train station. </p><p>  Bus number 135 follows from Adler (also from the railway station) to the mountains. </p><h2>  How to get to Krasnaya Polyana from the airport? </h2><p>  If you need to get into the mountains immediately from the airport, you can wait for the Lastochka electric train or a bus with one of the rooms - 105, 105 or 136.

    <p>  Unfortunately, there is no bus that departs directly from the airport to Krasnaya Polyana: they all start moving in Adler or Sochi.  A more expensive but convenient alternative can be a taxi.  All taxi services in Sochi have passed mandatory accreditation; they have comfortable cars and experienced drivers. </p><p>  So, Krasnaya Polyana is not difficult to find.  The easiest way to go there is from railway stations, train stations or the airport.  If you suddenly happen to get confused in the location of these objects, any resident of the city will tell you how to get to Krasnaya Polyana from Adler or from any other settlement.  Sochi is a fairly simple city, and there are signs or schemes at almost every step. </p><h2>  How not to get lost in Krasnaya Polyana itself? </h2><p>  So, we have successfully figured out how to get to Krasnaya Polyana from Adler, Sochi, Lazarevsky or any other area.  We arrived at the destination.  Where to go next? </p><p>  Previously, there were two small villages on the site of the current ski resort: one was called Krasnaya Polyana, the other was Esto-Sadok.  They now exist with the same names, but new resorts appeared next to them. </p>

    <p>  The village of Krasnaya Polyana is the first on the way, then the new Gorki resort, a town with its Mountain Carousel cable car.  A little further there is a turn into the gorge - there are hotels of the Gazprom shopping center and the Laura <span>cable car</span> .  Well, when driving straight, you can get to the Rosa Khutor resort with the cable car of the same name. </p><p>  There are two railway stations near the hillsides.  One is closer to Krasnaya Polyana, but it is called Esto-Sadok, the other is near the Rosa Khutor resort, but it is called Krasnaya Polyana.  Here is such a small inaccuracy, which should be noted. </p><p>  Bus No. 63 runs to all resorts; there is also a private taxi service in Krasnaya Polyana with quite reasonable rates. </p><p>  For those who prefer a private car, it should be noted that parking spaces of the resort are not always enough for everyone, and in such cases, entry to Krasnaya Polyana by car is limited (road signs and mass media inform about this). </p>
