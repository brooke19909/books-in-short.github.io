Despite the contradictory assessments of this time by contemporaries, it remains one of the most significant factors in the formation of our recent history.  But not everyone can name the time frame in which the Sovdep existed, what it was for time. </p><h2>  Etymology of the name </h2><p>  According to the reference data, the Sovdep is the abbreviated name of one of the local authorities created in the first years of the existence of <span>Soviet power.</span>  They were created by elective means from representatives of the local population - deputies.  officially they were called "Councils of People's Deputies."  The first such advice came into being at the height of the civil war - in June 1918.  And after the end of hostilities, such councils became ubiquitous.  Thus, 1918 became the date of birth not only of the RSFSR, but also of the term ‚ÄúSovdep‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sovdep what is it" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1088989.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In those days, contractions were an integral part of life.  People willingly created various abbreviations, short forms of long denominations firmly entered the young Soviet life.  So there were the ‚ÄúSovnarkom‚Äù, ‚Äúcollective farm‚Äù, ‚ÄúSovdep‚Äù ... What it was, there was no need to explain - since 1918 magazines were full of these names, they flowed from reproducers, were used in official and colloquial speech.  The widespread use of this term is firmly included in the Russian language. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sovdep abroad </h2><p>  Every person had an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat the Sovdep meant.  Although the attitude towards the new state developed in different ways.  The transformation of the RSFSR into the USSR, the gradual establishment of relations between the young republic and other countries, the use of various foreign policy levers gradually raised the reputation of the USSR.  On the other hand, there were many people left who were on the other side of the barricade.  In the emigrant newspapers published in Brussels, Paris or Berlin, the word "Sovdep" also sounded in the speech of former White Guards and expelled representatives of the ruling classes.  What did this concept mean for an expat?  The criminal power that robbed him of his homeland, family, land, and rather significant fortunes. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="times of council" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1088998.jpg" width="369"></div>  Many people emigrated for ideological reasons or because of fears for their own lives.  Therefore, it is not surprising that this concept is always used with a negative or dismissive connotation and gradually replaces the words "Russia" or "RSFSR" in emigrant circles.  And the words "Sovdep" and "Sovdepiya" became synonymous with the country of the Soviets.

    <h2>  Sovdep in the years 70‚Äì90 </h2><p>  The gradual decline in industrial development drove <span>the Soviet economy</span> into a remote corner.  The quality of food, clothing, household goods and other goods made in the USSR left much to be desired. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What does Sovdep mean?" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1089001.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is another use of the concept of "Sovdep."  What did this word mean?  Low quality of goods, unsatisfactory services, constantly breaking equipment.  From the category of goods, the word gradually grew into the sphere of human relations.  The word "Sovdep" began to mean a rude, arrogant and uncultured person who does not respect generally accepted cultural values.  In this sense, this word has migrated to the modern vocabulary. </p>
