In this article, we will talk about Anapa, or rather, about Vityazevo.  Guest houses - ‚ÄúDolce Vita‚Äù, ‚ÄúArctic‚Äù, ‚ÄúAl Tair‚Äù and others - are quite popular among tourists from different parts of our vast country today.  This resort is recognized not only ideal for a beach holiday, but also convenient for living.  The climatic conditions of Anapa are simply perfect: there is no increased humidity, as in Sochi or the sweltering heat, as in Gelendzhik.  However, the biggest advantage of this resort is that the beaches here are not pebble, as in almost all the Black Sea resorts of the Russian Federation, but sandy, and the gentle entrance to the sea is ideal for families with children.  For convenient accommodation of families there are guest houses with all amenities, for example, Dolce Vita (Anapa / Vityazevo).  From the end of May, all of them open their hospitable doors to the guests of the resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolce Vita Vityazevo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27807/864340.jpg"></div>
