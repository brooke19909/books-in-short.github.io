Their other name is action cameras.  They are attached to moving objects, motorcycles, skiers, quadrocopters. </p><h2>  Nature does not tolerate emptiness </h2><p>  GoPro itself has evolved over several generations, but its high cost has left a niche for low-cost copies.  Inside, the GoPro is a stuffed surveillance camera paired with a fixed focal length lens.  All of these components can be purchased separately and placed in a transparent plastic case for a NoPro camera.  Previously, these anonymous fakes were of poor quality, but one manufacturer, SJCAM, is trying to become a new brand by releasing new models with specifications that match GoPro mid-range products for only a third of the cost.  SJCAM SJ5000 Plus Black, for example, will cost $ 169, and its Ambarella A7LS75 processor, used in the GoPro Hero3 Black, and a real 16-megapixel Panasonic sensor made a splash at the end of 2014. </p><p>  The situation with SJCAM is interesting because competitors prefer to fake this particular brand, rather than GoPro.  Numerous clones are difficult to distinguish from the original until it comes to tech support or firmware replacement.  This has led SJCAM to take steps to protect its brand, including packaging labels and an approved reseller certification system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Best budget action camera </h2><p>  SJ5000 Plus SJCAM is an inexpensive <span>waterproof FullHD camera, the</span> evolution of the SJcam SJ4000 with new hardware features, including the new 16MP Panasonic sensor and the new Ambarella A7LS75 processor, also installed on the GoPro Hero 3 + Black.  All this should please users, since they can now take real, rather than interpolated, as in the SJ4000, 16-megapixel images and shoot video in 1080p format at 60 or 30 fps and 720p at 120, 60 or 30 k / s, which allows you to slow motion. </p><p>  There are several versions of the SJ5000: </p><ul><li>  SJ5000 is the basic version, a simple successor to the SJ4000 without significant improvements, with the same Novatek chip. </li><li>  SJ5000 Wi-Fi - Wireless Version. </li><li>  SJ5000 Plus - SJCAM top model with Ambarella A7 chip, 16MP Panasonic sensor and Wi-Fi.  This version implements a number of deep improvements. </li><li>  SJ5000X Elite Edition - the best video camera in the line, records <span>4K</span> video at 24 fps, 2K - 30 fps and 1080p - 60 fps, has gyro stabilization, Sony 12.4 Mp sensor, Novatek 96660, 2 chip "-screen, Wi-Fi, supports Micro SD cards up to 128 GB. </li></ul><h2>  What to choose? </h2><p>  The SJCAM SJ5000 Plus camera is $ 60-70 more expensive than the SJ4000, but has much more efficient and high-quality hardware.  Provides <span>1080p resolution</span> at 60 fps and 16 megapixel photos with a Panasonic sensor.  If you don‚Äôt want to spend $ 160 or more, you can think of the Xiaomi Yi camera, which has about the same video quality as the SJ5000 Plus SJCAM and records in 2K resolution, but does not have a rear display, accessories and underwater case (it can be purchased separately for $ 15), and all this costs only $ 80. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The camera is waterproof with f / 2.8 aperture and Full HD resolution.  Noteworthy thanks to the new Panasonic MN34120PA 16MP CMOS image processor, which significantly improved the recording quality compared to the SJ4000.  This made it possible to shoot 60 fps Full HD video, 120 fps HD 720p and 240 fps 480p.  You can also take pictures with a resolution of up to 4608 x 3456 pixels or 16 megapixels.  The camera is equipped with a dual LED flash that improves video quality in low light conditions. </p><p>  Major improvements of the SJ5000 Plus SJCAM, compared to its predecessor, is determined by the Ambarella A7LS75 chip, so the quality of video recorded in 1080p at a speed of 30-60 fps is better than on the SJ4000.  The duration of the work is 60-80 minutes of recording in Full HD format with Wi-Fi turned off and the screen. </p><p>  SJCAM SJ5000 Plus differs from a number of analogues by the presence of a screen on the rear panel that allows you to see what is removed and easily navigate through the menus and settings, as well as Wi-Fi, a highly valued function that allows you to instantly transfer recording to a smartphone using the application.  In addition, like the SJ4000, the device is sold with many useful accessories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Features of SJCAM SJ5000 Plus are: </p><ul><li>  1.5-inch TFT LCD screen with a resolution of 960 x 240 pixels; </li><li>  HDMI output </li><li>  easily replaceable 900 mAh battery; </li><li>  built-in Wi-Fi; </li><li>  accessories and grips; </li><li>  a transparent case that allows you to immerse the camera in water to a depth of 30 m; </li><li>  microSD card slot for up to 32 GB. </li></ul><p>  In Drive mode, recording starts automatically when the car starts or when the motion sensor is triggered when moving objects enter the camera‚Äôs field of view.  <span>The</span> SJCAM SJ5000 Plus <span>wide-angle HD lens</span> , which has a 170 ¬∞ view, allows you to take spectacular shots.  In the timer shooting mode, the device takes pictures every few seconds (1, 2, 5, 10, 30 or 60 s), and then combines them into one video file without the need to do it manually. </p><p>  There is also the possibility of loop recording, in which it goes continuously by overwriting existing files.  This will come in handy in the car when using the camera as a DVR.  In the new high-speed mode, you can shoot in series of 3, 5, 10 and 20 photos per second. </p><p>  The dual stream mode allows you to record two videos simultaneously: one in high quality and the other in low, at 10 fps, which allows you to view files on your phone in streaming mode via Wi-Fi without having to download them. </p><p>  Dimensions - 24.7 x 60 x 41 mm, weight - 58 g. </p>

    <h2>  Wireless connection </h2><p>  SJ5000 + has Wi-Fi, which, using a special application for phones and tablets, allows </p><ul><li>  control the camera from an external device; </li><li>  enable and disable recording; </li><li>  take pictures; </li><li>  View live recordings on mobile phones or tablets. </li></ul><p>  In addition, video and photo recording can be played on the smartphone. </p><p>  The configuration file is recorded on the SD card and Wi-Fi only works with the inserted memory card.  To change the configuration, you must edit this file.  In open space, the wireless range is 30-40 meters. When Wi-Fi is active, the front green LED turns on, but you can turn it off in the menu. </p><p>  To work through a smartphone, you need to install the LinkinEyes application. </p><h2>  Accessories </h2><p>  Another feature that makes the SJ5000 + unique is its large number of accessories, such as </p><ul><li>  mountain bike mount </li><li>  underwater housing </li><li>  chest clip </li><li>  Charger, </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  stickers for helmets, </li><li>  tripod adapter </li><li>  various compounds, etc. </li></ul><p>  This greatly increases the value of the kit and eliminates the need for further purchases, saving time and money.  Compared to the SJ4000, accessories are stronger.  All of them are compatible with GoPro, as they use the same capture.  Therefore, if additional devices are needed, they will be easy to find. </p>

    <h2>  SJCAM SJ5000 Plus: instruction manual </h2><p>  On the front panel there is a Mode button, which is used to turn on the device and switch between recording, video playback, photo display, parameter settings.  Pressing it during recording makes the video erasable.  There are also two indicators in the form of narrow horizontal stripes: the lower one lights up when the camera is turned on, and the upper one, green, when Wi-Fi is activated. </p><p>  The top button on the right side panel is used to turn Wi-Fi on and off, and the bottom buttons are for scrolling through the menu and for enlarging.  On the opposite side are the HDMI connectors, micro-USB and microSD card slot. </p><p>  The button at the top serves to start recording.  When pressed during recording, an image is captured with a resolution of 2 megapixels (1920x1080). </p><p>  The batteries last for 55 minutes with the screen and wireless connection turned on.  After the SJCAM SJ5000 Plus firmware was improved (version 1.7), the battery began to work for 15-20 minutes longer. </p><p>  The maximum frame rate for files recorded using the SJ5000 Plus is 24 Mbps (1080p 60 fps) versus 15 Mbps in the SJ4000.  This means that files are less compressed, contain more information and are of higher quality.  Obviously, they take up more space on the memory card. </p><p>  In the menu, you can adjust the microphone volume, which should be set to 100% when using a waterproof case and at a level of 50-60% without it, otherwise the sound will be loud and distorted. </p><p>  Two new sensitivity settings have been added to the SJ5000 Plus in addition to the ISO 100, 200 and 400 in the SJ4000, namely 800 and 1600 ISO for shooting in low light conditions. </p><p>  If the camera is turned off by mistake during video recording, you can restore it using Recovery Movie if the file size is not too small. </p>

    <h2>  You have to pay for quality </h2><p>  The SJ5000 Plus, compared to the previous model, has significantly improved performance.  This was made possible thanks to new high-quality components - the Ambarella processor, also used in GoPro3 +, and a 16-megapixel sensor from Panasonic.  The camera allows you to shoot 16-megapixel photos and Full HD-video at a speed of 60 fps or HD at 120 fps with the possibility of slow motion.  4K or 2K video is not available, but for the money it would be too much.  Sound quality has also improved significantly. </p><p>  If the question is what to buy - SJ4000 or SJ5000 Plus, then the answer depends on the budget of the buyer.  The SJ4000 costs about $ 100, while the SJCAM SJ5000 Plus costs $ 160.  The difference in quality is huge, so the money will be well spent. </p><h2>  Sensor and optics of action cameras </h2><p>  The SJ5000 made a big leap in quality compared to the previous SJCAM SJ4000 model, whose 12-megapixel resolution was created by simply enlarging the file created by the 2-megapixel sensor.  Two basic models - SJ5000 and SJ5000 WiFi - are equipped with Panasonic's new 14-megapixel image sensor, and the SJ5000 Plus and even more - 16 megapixels.  The number of pixels says a lot, but it is worth recalling the requirements for the design of the optics of action cameras. </p><p>  Small overall dimensions and light weight are decisive factors.  GoPro aesthetics mean an ultra-wide angle view of action cameras with a fisheye effect.  This type of lens has a deep focus, so you can have a lens with a constant <span>focal length</span> so that the <span>depth of field is</span> maximum.  Such lenses for large SLR cameras are too heavy and expensive.  GoPro-style devices use a small and inexpensive optics option with the same small image sensor size.  The SJ5000 Plus has 1 / 2.33 "Panasonic MN34120PA CMOS. Its dimensions are tiny - 5.8x4.3 mm, like the iPhone 5 sensor, and much smaller than that of a digital SLR camera. </p><p>  For this reason, any assessment of image quality should be realistic and take into account the physical limitations of the device.  Even the best camcorder, due to the small size of the sensor, is invariably subject to more noise, especially in low light, high sensitivity and limited dynamic range. </p><p>  In ideal conditions, you can create an impressive picture on your mobile phone. </p><p>  A wide-angle view of action cameras unequally displays all objects: objects at an average distance seem very distant, and photographing in the vicinity significantly distorts faces. </p>

    <h2>  How to improve the video? </h2><p>  Professionals do not tolerate when the sky is not visible on the video.  Most of the material captured on action cameras using the default settings has terrible cloud spots or strange shades of color where the blue sky should be.  This is because the small sensor cannot handle the high dynamic range of many scenes, and the factory settings are designed to correctly transmit the main subject, giving the rest to chance.  In order to achieve the desired result, you should set the maximum exposure, which does not distort the sky, and bring the middle tones and shadows in post-processing.  For example, with an exposure of -1.0Ev, AWB, and ISO 100, the sky looks good, the clouds are detailed, and realistic blueness is visible.  At the same time, the shadows and the middle are too dark, they must be made brighter. </p><p>  Unfortunately, sometimes processing 8-bit video can lead to layering and excessive noise, but adjusting the SJ5000 Plus files did not have this effect. </p><h2>  Light weight </h2><p>  The first impression of the pictures is that they look grainy and noisy.  After processing by the graphic editor, halos of sharpness and other defects remain visible.  According to users, the inclusion of sharpening in the menu could largely prevent this at the post-processing stage. </p><p>  Buyers are pleasantly surprised by the work of an inexpensive lens, the price of which does not exceed $ 3.  Image detail reaches the edges of the frame, and there really is no need for an aggressive level of sharpness embedded in the camera.  Not surprising was the high level of chromatic aberration.  Its blue-yellow variety is clearly visible in the pictures.  The photo editor is able to remove it, but purple halos at the border of areas with high image contrast are much more difficult to remove. </p><p>  Like all cameras with a small sensor, the SJ5000 Plus has a limited dynamic range.  When using the default settings, the device tends to ‚Äúinflate‚Äù bright areas of the image, as a result of which the sky turns white and extraneous colors are present.  With an exposure set to -1.0EV, the sky looks pretty good, but light buildings still stand out a lot. </p><p>  Thus, with the use of light post-processing, quite suitable photographs can be obtained, provided that measures are taken to prevent overexposure.  Unfortunately, the professional use of the camera is hindered by aggressive image sharpness, which limits the size of the image when printing, but its quality is sufficient to display ultra-high definition on a TV screen. </p>

    <h2>  SJCAM SJ5000 Plus: reviews </h2><p>  Users have doubts about the accuracy of the automatic <span>white balance,</span> they note the presence of glitches and freezes, inadequate power management, unstable operation of the SJCAM SJ5000 Plus WiFi and the limitation of the waterproof case frame in 4x3 format. </p><p>  In the following models, customers want to be able to sharpen, automatically shoot, and scale hardware, able to reduce video ‚Äúon a chip‚Äù to use reduced sensor area and resolution, rather than clipping the output signal, which increases noise, defects and blurry parts.  A narrower field of view and a smaller fish-eye effect will be useful. </p>
