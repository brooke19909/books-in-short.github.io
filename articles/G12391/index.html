    <h2>  <span>The Natural Resort</span> 3 *: reviews of Russian travelers </h2><p>  Probably every tourist who has visited several countries knows about how important it is to plan in advance all the details of any trip abroad.  After all, this will help to avoid a lot of difficulties and problems while staying abroad.  Especially attentively experienced travelers are advised to approach the choice of a hotel where you will stay for several days or even weeks.  Therefore, you should collect as much information as possible about the hotels you like, in order to ultimately make the right decision.  Invaluable help in this, according to experienced tourists, is provided by familiarizing yourself with the reviews of those who have already stayed in a particular place.  Indeed, in their comments, former guests try to tell not only about the advantages of the hotel, but also talk about its shortcomings, which you may encounter during your stay here.  However, search and analysis of traveler reviews usually takes a lot of time.  To save time, we offer you generalized comments by Russian tourists regarding their stay at The Natural Resort 3 * (Phuket, Patong).  Just note that the overwhelming number of reviews of our compatriots are positive.  According to them, the hotel is well worth the money spent.  But we suggest you learn more about everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the natural resort 3 phuket" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1084226.jpg" width="600"></div>

They note that the rooms here are spacious, with freshly renovated and pleasantly decorated.  The guests liked the high-quality comfortable furniture, modern appliances.  In general, our compatriots assure that the rooms have everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Some guests note the presence of a ceiling fan as a plus.  It can be turned on if there is no particular need for an air conditioner.  Tourists also note that if you require a safe, hairdryer and iron, then these items can be taken for an additional fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the natural resort 3 reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1084227.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, free access to wireless Internet at The Natural Resort 3 * <span>(Phuket, Patong)</span> is available only in the lobby near the reception.  Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel for an additional fee, including rooms.  However, few people used this service.  So, tourists are advised to purchase a SIM card of a local mobile operator with a package of mobile Internet.  By the way, those who come to Thailand through major travel agencies often issue SIM cards during transfers from the airport.  Travelers can only replenish the balance. </p><h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  This item practically did not cause complaints from our compatriots.  So, according to the guests, the cleaning of the hotel rooms is carried out every day quite carefully.  Tourists were pleasantly surprised by the fact that linen and towels are also updated here daily.  And this is rare for some hotels of an even higher category.  In addition, maids bring bottled drinking water and replenish coffee and tea sets as needed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the natural resort 3 phuket" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1084228.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  A big plus of this hotel is the fact that in the event of an early arrival of new guests, in most cases they will settle in the rooms intended for them immediately.  Therefore, if you plan to arrive at the Natural Resort in the morning, then you are unlikely to have to wait for the keys to the apartment until two in the afternoon, as is the practice in many other hotels.  But note that when you check in you will be asked to make a deposit.  Its size is 1000 baht.  This money will be returned to you upon eviction from the hotel.  However, keep in mind that both depositing and getting back the amount can only be in local currency. </p><p>  As for the day of departure from the hotel, you should release the occupied room before noon.  If your departure is planned only in the evening, if you wish, you can extend your stay for several hours at an additional cost. </p><h2>  Location, Territory </h2><p>  Hotel The Natural Resort 3 * (Phuket, Thailand), according to travelers, has a rather large, very green and beautiful area.  There are two pools.  Next to them are sun loungers and parasols.  So hotel guests do not have to go to the sea if they want to swim and sunbathe. </p><p>  A big plus of the hotel in question, tourists call its location.  So, from here, according to our compatriots, it‚Äôs quite convenient to get to any part of the island.  In the vicinity of the hotel there are many large and small shops, supermarkets, souvenir shops, markets, massage parlors, excursion bureaus, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand 3 the natural resort" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1084229.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This hotel only includes breakfast.  According to the guests, every day the same dishes and products are offered here.  However, their choice is quite wide.  For example, in the morning you can eat fresh fruits and vegetables, scrambled eggs, sausages, sausage, pasta, rice, porridge, granola, pastries, juice, tea and coffee.  During the <span>day, tourists</span> can eat both in the hotel restaurant (for an additional fee), and in the many cafes located in the neighborhood.  According to our compatriots, here you can taste both traditional Thai food and the more familiar dishes of European and even Russian cuisine.  Prices are pretty reasonable everywhere. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  According to the guests, from The Natural Resort 3 * (Phuket, Thailand) you can literally walk to the sea in 10 minutes in measured steps.  Moreover, your path will run through the streets with lots of shops, cafes, massage parlors, etc. If you want to get to the beach, you can use the minibus provided by the hotel.  He drives off to the sea every hour.  Shuttle service is free. </p><p>  As for the beach itself, many Patong tourists liked a lot more than Kata Beach or Karon Beach.  According to them, the sea is calmer and the coast is cleaner.  In addition, if you want to enjoy crystal clear water, you can go a little further along the sea to the very beginning of Patong Beach.  The road will take about 20 minutes, however, according to many vacationers, it is worth it. </p>
