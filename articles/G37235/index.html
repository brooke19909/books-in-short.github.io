    <h2>  Geography </h2><p>  Sri Lanka is remembered by guests for its friendliness and exoticism.  In many respects, it owes its geographical features.  This is a small island, completely surrounded by the waters of the warm Indian Ocean, which determines its natural and weather conditions.  The country is warm and hot almost all year round.  The entire coast is occupied by beautiful sandy beaches, which are so popular with residents and tourists from all over the Earth.  In general, Sri Lanka is flat, but in the middle of the island is the Kandy Valley with its mountain plateau, where perhaps the best tea on the planet is grown. </p><h2>  Culture </h2><p>  Sri Lanka is a multiconfessional state, and this, perhaps, is its main difference from India.  The main religion on the island is Buddhism, but people also profess Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam.  From here religious intolerance is growing among the locals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, the life of the island is subject to classical Buddhist traditions.  They were reflected in the architecture, painting, sculpture and behavior of local residents.  On the island is a sacred Buddhist relic - the Bodhi tree, under which the Buddha attained enlightenment and to which today tens of thousands of people make pilgrimages in search of harmony and happiness. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the country has extremely low divorce statistics.  This is due to the fact that women do not work here, and from childhood are preparing to become wives and mothers.  They study not in secondary schools, but learn the art of cooking, weaving, sewing, embroidery, dancing.  Residents create strong and loyal families, which helps them live an average of 73 years (for men) and 77 years (for women).  The island is calm, good and harmony. </p>

    <p>  In the reviews of tourists about holidays in Sri Lanka, the country's tea traditions are always also mentioned, because it is Ceylon alpine tea that is considered the most delicious and high-quality in the world.  Excursions to the Kandy Valley will give a lot of interesting knowledge and vivid impressions. </p><h2>  Nature and weather </h2><p>  The flora and fauna of the state is truly delightful.  It is nature that attracts most tourists to this distant island.  Many Sri Lankan animals are endemic, meaning they can only be seen here.  The island is covered with magnificent beaches with fine white sand and many luxurious palm trees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A bright tropical climate reigns in the country, which gives either a serene paradise pleasure, or hurricanes mesmerizing with their strength.  The rainy season on the island divides it as if in half.  On the north-east coast, it pleases (or upsets) residents from October to May, on the south-west - from May to October.  The rainy season itself is not the most pleasant sight.  Showers can go 4 times a day, accompanied by strong winds and raging waves in the ocean. </p>

    <p>  Based on the reviews of tourists about holidays in Sri Lanka, we can conclude that the southwestern part of the island is much more in demand.  Further, we will focus on it. </p><h2>  Sri Lanka in November </h2><p>  This month opens the dry (high) season in Sri Lanka.  Although during this period there are still echoes of strong winds and rains from the wet season, they are, rather, a one-time character and simply can not interfere with a beautiful beach holiday.  Reviews of tourists about holidays in Sri Lanka in November are full of vivid photographs, great emotions and a harmonious mood. </p><p>  On the coast, the air temperature rises to +29 degrees, but in the mountains it can be much cooler.  November is more suitable for a leisurely beach holiday. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sri Lanka in December </h2><p>  This month on the island comes a true paradise for every tourist and local.  The air in Ceylon is warm and pleasant, the temperature is about 30 degrees.  Water in the ocean warms up to 29 degrees and above.  For a beach holiday, this is perhaps the most suitable time.  Short and warm rains may still occur at this time, but they quickly pass, leaving fresh pleasant air behind. </p><p>  Reviews of tourists about holidays in Sri Lanka in December are always full of stories and photographs of the migration of sperm whales and whales.  This is a very interesting and exciting sight, which can be seen only one month a year, and it is here.  So lovers of nature and animals should pay attention to the December Sri Lanka. </p>

    <p>  The weather is also suitable for pilgrimages to Buddhist temples, as well as for walks in the jungle and exploration of the local flora and fauna. </p><h2>  Holidays in Sri Lanka in January </h2><p>  The beginning of the year is a great time for outdoor activities on the island.  Windsurfers and divers will be delighted with the opportunities that it offers at this time of year.  For lovers of a relaxing beach holiday, Ceylon will prepare wonderful hot weather, moderately moist and fresh. </p><p>  But in the mountains on the <span>tea plantations of</span> the Kandy Valley in January it is better not to go, there the air will be dense and cold.  So lovers of such a holiday should arm themselves with warm comfortable clothing or transfer the trip to another more suitable month. </p><p>  Reviews of tourists about holidays in Sri Lanka in January are advised to visit the botanical garden and the tortoise farm.  At this time, you can see the migration of these marine inhabitants in search of food.  It is also interesting to go to the jewelry exhibition in Ratnapura, and even better to get there something beautiful for memory. </p>

    <h2>  Ceylon in February </h2><p>  Reviews about Sri Lanka and rest on it in the last month of winter are also always positive and positive.  February is distinguished by the fact that at this time the weather is beautiful absolutely throughout the island.  This month is ideal for a measured beach holiday with the whole family and children.  But surfers will have to wait for another period, since the ocean in February is harmonious and calm, like Buddha himself. </p><p>  In addition, at this time in the East a series of religious holidays is celebrated, and therefore carnivals and processions of elephants will also attract the attention of an inexperienced tourist. </p><h2>  Sri Lanka in March </h2><p>  The first spring month closes the dry season on the island.  The weather is getting hotter, the air is more humid.  Walks in the Kandy Valley are perfect for this time.  An excursion to tea plantations will perfectly diversify any beach holiday and give a lot of souvenirs and impressions. </p>

    <h2>  Sri Lanka in the rainy season </h2><p>  April is not the best time to visit the island: it rains all the time.  However, if the vacation is sightseeing and religious in nature, then why not.  At the beginning of the day, you can even steal some sun on the beaches of Ceylon.  Yes, and prices for trips are significantly reduced. </p><p>  Sri Lanka in May pleases with interesting holidays, although the weather from April does not stand out much for the better.  During this period, local residents celebrate Buddha‚Äôs birthday, which will be interesting not only to admirers of this religion, but also to any tourist who will remember the colorfulness and brightness. </p><p>  June is also not the time for a beach holiday in Ceylon.  But lovers of yoga and eastern spiritual practices will find <span>something to please themselves.</span>  This month, Sri Lanka celebrates the Full Moon Festival, where you can practice your skills and meditation skills.  July and August are also not suitable for a relaxing beach holiday; strong winds and rains are raging on the island. </p>

    <h2>  Island in autumn </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, a vacation in Sri Lanka in September is better to spend on the east coast.  It is there that the weather will delight the sun and heat.  Other areas are more prone to weather changes, but this is absolutely not critical for excursions and temporary visits to temples and botanical gardens.  Reviews of tourists about the weather in Sri Lanka in September are always full of bright positive emotions and beautiful beach photos.  That is why you can safely plan a vacation at the beginning of autumn. </p><p>  Fans of exotic travel often wonder: Is Sri Lanka worth the money spent in September and October?  And this is logical, since the flight to the country is quite lengthy, and the rest is expensive.  And if in September Sri Lanka is a resort with a warm calm climate and bright sun, then in October it is better to choose another place to stay. </p><p>  In mid-autumn, the island begins the height of the rainy season: in the north there are continuous tropical showers, in the west, although it is calmer, but at night rains are also inevitable.  At the same time, the whole of Ceylon becomes something like a Turkish hamam with a humidity of about 100%, which is transferred by an unprepared body is very problematic.  Among other things, the coast of the island is filled with poisonous jellyfish and unpleasant insects. </p>
