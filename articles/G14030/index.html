Considering that the rest of the peninsula belonged to the Crimean Khanate, which became its vassal three years later, historical references to the Black Sea as a “Turkish internal lake”, which it essentially was for the next three centuries, become quite justified.  In this regard, the annexation of Crimea to Russia under Catherine 2 met the most pressing requirements for Russian foreign policy of that period. </p>

    <h2>  Life Dictated Necessity </h2><p>  After the <span>fall of the Golden Horde</span> , Russia faced with particular urgency the task of restoring access to the Black Sea, which existed during the period of Kievan Rus and was closed to it with the establishment of the Mongol-Tatar yoke.  This was necessary, first of all, in the economic interests, since important trade routes to the Mediterranean countries went through the Black Sea. </p><p>  In addition, it was necessary to crush the Crimean Khanate, from the territory of which raids had been made for several centuries, the purpose of which was to capture the slaves and their further sale in Constantinople.  According to scientists, in the 300 years preceding the annexation of Crimea to Russia under Catherine 2, at least 3 million people were sent to Turkish slave markets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The first attempts to solve the Crimean problem </h2><p>  Attempts to conquer the Crimea were made repeatedly.  It is enough to recall the campaigns of Peter I in 1696-1698.  although they ended with the capture of the fortress of Azov, but did not solve the whole Black Sea problem.  In the reign of Anna Ioannovna, Russian troops twice triumphantly entered the peninsula: in 1735 under the command of B.H. Minikh, and four years later ─ Field Marshal P.P. Lassi.  However, both times they were forced to retreat due to lack of supplies and epidemics that broke out in the ranks of the troops. </p>

    <p>  A real opportunity to carry out the seizure of Crimea appeared only after the formation of New Russia in the second half of the 18th century, which included significant territories of the Northern Black Sea Region, annexed to Russia during the Russian-Turkish wars.  It is believed that it was from this that the story of the annexation of Crimea to Russia by Catherine 2. began. Using Novorossia as a springboard for a further offensive, the army of general-general V.M.  Dolgoruky in 1771 managed to break the resistance of the defenders of the Crimea and gain a foothold within it. </p><h2>  Independent Crimean Khanate </h2><p>  However, the <span>annexation of Crimea to Russia</span> under Catherine 2, briefly described below, was preceded by another very important stage, the need for which was dictated by a number of political and military circumstances of that time.  The victory of Russian weapons in the war with Turkey resulted in the signing of the Karasubazar Treaty in 1772, declaring Crimea an independent khanate, under the protection of Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The <span>Russian-Turkish war that</span> ended two years later put an end to Ottoman rule on the peninsula and opened for Russia the long-awaited access to the Black Sea.  Nevertheless, the successes achieved were only half measures and could not be considered as a final solution to the problem of Crimea. </p>

    <h2>  Political and military conflict with Turkey </h2><p>  As can be seen from the subsequent actions of Catherine 2, having achieved the independence of the Crimean Khanate from the Ottoman Empire, she did not abandon the thought of joining her possessions.  This was fully in the interests of Russia, since the peninsula had important economic and military-political significance for the whole country.  However, Turkey was extremely interested in restoring its dominance in Crimea.  Both warring parties made considerable efforts to achieve the desired goal, and for this reason the struggle between the Ottoman Empire and Russia at that time did not wane. </p><p>  In November 1776, the corps of Lieutenant General A. A. Prozorovsky, entering the Crimea, took up defensive positions on Perekop.  A division under the command of A.V. Suvorov arrived to help him from Moscow in a hasty manner.  Together, they managed to break the resistance of the troops of the Crimean <span>Khan Davlet-Girey</span> and force him to take refuge in Bakhchisarai, and then flee to Constantinople.  In his place was elected the new ruler Shahin-Giray, who became the last Crimean Khan in history. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tatar Khan, European-minded </h2><p>  The election of this man greatly facilitated the accession of Crimea to Russia under Catherine 2. Unlike his predecessors, he was a man of a completely European way of thinking.  Having studied in Venice and Thessaloniki, Shahin-Girey was fluent in several foreign languages, the rules were not confined to the Tatar customs. </p>

    <p>  However, attempts to transform the military and administrative-economic system of the khanate into a European way led to discontent of the local population and an open revolt, which was suppressed only with the help of Russian bayonets.  The decisive role in resolving the conflict was played by the appointment of A.V. Suvorov to the post of commander of all Crimean forces. </p><h2>  Crimean immigrants </h2><p>  Dividing the entire territory of the peninsula into 4 territorial districts and placing significant garrisons in the occupied fortresses, he deprived both the Turks themselves and their supporters from the local nobility of the last opportunity to influence the internal life of Crimea.  This was a significant step towards the annexation of Crimea to Russia under Catherine 2. </p><p>  The first among the inhabitants of the peninsula to go under the scepter of the Russian Empress were representatives of its Christian part of the population, Georgians, Armenians and Greeks, who moved to new places.  They were given land free of charge at the mouth of the Danube and on the coast of the Sea of ​​Azov.  During the spring-summer period of 1778, 31 thousand people left the Crimea, which dealt a tangible blow to the khan's treasury, since it was these people who were the most economically active part of the population. </p>

    <h2>  Report of Prince G. A. Potemkin </h2><p>  In 1781, the Turks provoked another uprising of the local population, dissatisfied with the rules imposed by Shahin-Girey, and again the Russian soldiers had to pacify the rebels, this time under the command of His Grace Prince G. A. Potemkin. </p><p>  In his report to the highest name, he wrote that, according to his observations, the vast majority of local residents are extremely hostile to Shakhin-Girey and would prefer to be under a Russian protectorate.  Undoubtedly, this remark by Potemkin played a certain role in the annexation of Crimea to Russia under Catherine 2. </p><h2>  The memorandum that decided the fate of Crimea </h2><p>  Being a very far-sighted politician, G. A. Potemkin understood the whole necessity of incorporating Crimea into <span>the Russian Empire,</span> since otherwise its territory could become a convenient bridgehead for future aggression by the Ottoman Empire.  In addition, the economic value of the fertile Crimean lands for the economy of the entire Northern Black Sea Region was quite obvious.  And finally, this would complete the expansion of Russia south to its natural borders.  His <span>Serene Highness</span> set out his point of view in detail in a memorandum sent by him in December 1782 to the highest name. </p><p>  After reviewing the received document, the empress in return sent her favorite the broadest powers to implement the project he had conceived and approved.  Thus, in the annexation of Crimea to Russia under Catherine the Great (year 1783), the key role belongs precisely to Prince Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin, for which he was granted the title of Tauride (Tavria is the ancient name of Crimea). </p>

    <h2>  Preparation of a historical event </h2><p>  The date of the annexation of Crimea to Russia by Catherine 2 should be considered April 8 (19), 1783, when the corresponding manifesto was signed by the autocrat.  However, at that time she ordered to keep it secret until the transition of the peninsula with all its population under the Russian scepter was a real event. </p><p>  By this time, the political life of the Crimean Khanate had undergone significant changes.  Shahin-Girey, so hated by the people, was forced to resign as the supreme ruler, and his place remained vacant.  This helped Potemkin through his agents to convince the ruling elite of the khanate in the benefits of moving under the protectorate of Russia. </p><p>  Following this, urgent measures were taken to equip the harbor in the southwestern part of the peninsula to accommodate the future squadron of the Black Sea Fleet.  A year later, a fortified city was founded there, named by order of the empress Sevastopol. </p>

    <h2>  Oath of allegiance to Russia </h2><p>  Finally, on June 28 (July 9), 1783, the highest manifesto was unveiled.  So for the first time (under Catherine 2), the annexation of Crimea to Russia became a fait accompli.  Many people know about the events of today, when this territory was secondarily transferred to the Russian Federation, so we will not dwell on them.  As for that time, on that day, His Grace Prince Potemkin, standing on the top of the Ak-Kai rock, took the oath of allegiance to the new subjects of her Imperial Majesty.  The first swearing oversight of the local community and persons of clergy, and behind them are all commoners.  The historical document ─ Manifesto on the annexation of Crimea to Russia under Catherine 2, whose photo is presented in the article, has been preserved to this day. </p>
