This is a terrain with a rather harsh climate.  Refers to the territory of Russia, to the <span>Sakhalin region.</span>  The name of the island is translated as "large."  That was the name of the Ainu, the people who lived in former times on the Japanese islands.  According to other versions, the name means ‚Äúcrowded‚Äù.  Although now it‚Äôs difficult to call him such.  The only settlement on the island of Paramushir is Severo-Kurilsk, the number of inhabitants in which barely exceeds two and a half thousand people. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Paramushir belongs to the northern group of the Kuril ridge of the islands, along with such as Onekotan and Traps.  Near, even to the north, is the smaller <span>island of Shumshu.</span>  The neighboring territories are separated by the Second Kuril Strait.  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãParamushir island is approximately two thousand kilometers; it is one of the largest in the archipelago. </p><p>  There are volcanoes, mountains, several lakes, the most famous of which is Mirror.  Climatic conditions are characterized by strong winds at any time of the year, sometimes they reach more than 200 km per hour.  Therefore, the island has few trees and large shrub plants, the forest zone is practically absent.  It is not easy for people here to live: in the winter season, the snow level exceeds the limit standards.  Often, residents have to shovel the entrance to the house littered with snow with a shovel.  Other problems: possible and periodically occurring floods, earthquakes, eruptions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  From the history </h2><p>  Until the beginning of the XVIII century on the island of Paramushir Ainu lived, not accepting the power of Russia.  The people refused to pay in-kind tax to the state until armed Cossacks arrived on the territory.  Then the Ainu obeyed the authorities.  From the 30s they adopted the Orthodox faith and entered into citizenship.  Subsequently, the population began to die out.  The reason is the smallpox epidemic.  In 1875, Paramushir was transferred to the Japanese, the area began to be inhabited again.  The first city appeared (now - Severo-Kurilsk).  The Japanese were engaged in fishing, founded a port.  And during World War II, the territory was occupied by the military.  Artillery was installed here, and an airport was established for air defense purposes. </p><p>  In 1945, Soviet paratroopers arrived in Paramushir, and the Japanese had to surrender.  The territory became part of the Soviet Union.  The settlements were renamed, the Russians began to move there, equip their homes, and housekeeping.  But the peaceful existence did not last long.  In 1952, a tsunami struck Paramushir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flood on paramushir island" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2042037.jpg"></div>  The lack of a warning system has caused a large number of victims of the elements.  Settlements were destroyed.  Recovery was slow.  Severo-Kurilsk was practically rebuilt.

Previously, the city was called Kashiwabora.  At a distance of several kilometers rises the volcano Ebeko.  Its peak is at an altitude of 1037 m. A little in the distance is Mount Nasedkina, ten meters above the volcano.  Other settlements remained on the island, there were about eight in total, but after the tsunami the existing buildings were not restored.  Because the villages are still empty.  Residents of the city are mainly engaged in fishing, there is a plant for its processing and processing of seafood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kuril Islands Paramushir" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2042033.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There are children's schools on the island of Paramushir, including a musical one. In the mid-70s of the last century, the House of Culture was opened, where concerts and celebrations are held.  In the 90s, a new hospital appeared.  Now there is even a small museum dedicated to the nature and history of the region. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  If we compare the species diversity of plants and living creatures of the island of Paramushir and the Kamchatka Territory, the number of species in the second territorial zone is much higher.  Island vegetation is poorer.  Of the shrubs, almost only one species is found - udska willow.  The plant is resistant to cold and wind.  It also grows in China, Yakutia.  Most often it can be found near rivers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the warm season, residents collect blueberries, lingonberries.  Alder and a variety of lilies, locusts also grow.  On the slopes of the hills you can find the Ivan-tea plant, widespread in Russia and extremely useful.  As for animals, a unique animal lives in these parts - the Paramushir shrew.  You can meet foxes, squirrels, brown bears dangerous to humans.  There are many fish; most of all, pink salmon and sockeye salmon are caught.  The depths of the sea near the island are the habitat of <span>Japanese whales.</span> </p><h2>  Volcano Chikurachki </h2><p>  On the Karpinsky ridge in the distance from the city you can see the stratovolcano.  Still active, periodically covering nearby terrain with ashes.  One of his last ‚Äúawakenings‚Äù occurred in July 2016. Ashes reached an area 100 km from the volcano, covered with a thin layer of a house and a car in Severo-Kurilsk.  Among the registered, the last eruption was noted in 2015. Experts say that for the residents of the city the volcano does not pose a great danger: it is located far enough away.  But there is a certain threat to flying aircraft. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paramushir island where is it located" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2042034.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The duration of the last weak eruptions usually ranged from a few days to a couple of weeks.  The last of the powerful occurred in 1986. Then the volcano threw out lava flows, and the ashes rose to a height of 11 kilometers.  The process lasted at least three weeks. </p><h2>  Cape Vasilyeva on the island of Paramushir </h2><p>  Crossing the island along its length, you can reach Cape Vasilyev.  On the way you will meet the Karpinsky volcano, several rivers that will have to cross ford.  There are a lot of equipment and structures from the time of the war.  There is also a lighthouse where several people live permanently.  In the district there are old aircraft hangars, a former Japanese airfield, pillboxes and other buildings.  You can see in these places Soviet tanks, tractors, various tools used in the Second World War and abandoned later.  The equipment is rusted and is now unsuitable for use. </p><p>  Behind Cape Vasilyev on the island of Paramushir of the Kuril Islands is Cape Kapustny (if you follow the direction from Severo-Kurilsk). </p><h2>  Element does not sleep </h2><p>  In these parts there are frequent earthquakes.  Locals are used to them and know what tactics to follow.  In September 2017, a large flood occurred on the island of Paramushir.  Part of the buildings and equipment in Severo-Kurilsk were hidden under water.  The cause of the flood was an increase in the water level in the river after prolonged rains.  The channel changed and went straight to the city.  Similar incidents often happen in Paramushira.  But the worst threat is another tsunami or typhoon.  However, people have already learned to predict such phenomena.  And, if something threatens human lives, everyone will be warned and prepared in advance.  Possible even temporary evacuation. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can sail to the island on a specially rented sea vessel.  For example, on a small boat for twenty to thirty places.  However, the cost of renting such a vehicle is quite high.  The starting point of the route is usually Petropavlovk-Kamchatsky, from the bay of which ships sail.  Getting from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is problematic: the distance is more than 1300 km.  Near the islands, passengers are transplanted to inflatable boats.  While the ship is going through the clearance procedure, passengers in boats approach the shore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paramushir island photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2042035.jpg"></div>  Subsequently, groups of tourists should also undergo a check carried out by border services.  The main thing is to have a passport with you (foreign - for residents of foreign countries).  Another way to get to Paramushir island is to do it by helicopter.  But changeable weather allows you to do this only on certain days.  The price of a flight (lease of an aircraft) is also extremely high.

    <h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  First of all, tourists arrive in Paramushir in order to see the unique places of untouched nature.  The raging sea, numerous waterfalls, peaks of mountains and volcanoes create a stunning landscape.  You can take great photos on Paramushir Island if the weather is nice.  Which, by the way, is quite rare.  It is best to visit places in August, this month is considered the warmest of the year.  A visit in February is undesirable: severe frosts and a significant layer of snow will not allow you to enjoy the beauties of nature. </p><p>  Travelers who are interested in the history and technology of wartime will be interested in looking at fortifications left over from the time when the land belonged to Japan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="North Kurilsk Paramushir Island" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2042038.jpg"></div>  But you should be careful when taking walks on the island: old shells that did not have time to burst can lie on the ground.  Another danger associated with meeting with bears.  However, animals try not to catch the eye of people.  Do not forget about the probability of eruptions.  You can learn about the rules of conduct in such situations from a guide or local residents.

    <h2>  Island walks </h2><p>  Before the trip, you need to stock up on food and medicine, as well as warm clothes and the most comfortable shoes.  Tourists who set themselves the goal of a multi-day hike with ascents should take into account that they will have to cross the river and streams along the route.  In the lowlands it is usually damp, there is fog.  Drizzling rains here are a constant tourist companion.  Caution should be taken by the Japanese wartime trenches.  Some pits are already overgrown, and they can easily fall through. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paramushir Island Cape Vasilyeva Kuril Islands" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2042031.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Crossing the territory to Cape Vasiliev, it is unlikely to meet people on the way.  Near the city there are small waterfalls up to 15 meters in height.  If you walk along the coastline, then you can see the 50-meter waterfalls of Paramushir island.  Where are located, you can determine the nearby rivers. </p>
