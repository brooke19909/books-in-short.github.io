    <p>  After entering the large market <span>Galaxy S6 Edge</span> , Samsung faced one interesting phenomenon.  Demand for this device is not that off scale, but it was at a very high level.  You could even say that this company did not expect.  So it turned out that demand exceeded the possible supply volume.  The engineers and other employees of the company had to get out of it somehow, come up with a new move that could correct the current state of affairs at that time. </p><p>  If we consider this situation in more detail, more specifically, it should be noted that the production of curved displays has been increased to a large extent.  The consequence was an increased release of models in which such components were used.  The emphasis that was previously placed on the Note product line was biased.  Thus, the corresponding devices simply ceased to be the main flagships and phablets of the company.  It is interesting that such a decision was made by the company without indicating any specific reasons.  This is what confused a huge number of buyers around the globe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, the <span>Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge</span> Plus, an overview of which is given in this article, is positioned as a flagship.  And this, therefore, means that the corresponding company is trying to implement the device with the greatest efficiency, based on the success of the previous model.  Engineers and designers, designers of the company made a lot of efforts in order to provide us, ordinary buyers of the device, with what we wanted so much.  On the other hand, this trend is inextricably linked with the rejection of more active PR line Note.  Of course, this will require the introduction of lightweight device configurations into the smartphone market. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2>

    <p>  Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, which we will review in this article, is a rather expensive device of the company.  At the same time, he can offer us a very interesting and original design.  We assure you that you will not find such a thing with any competitor of the company.  The flagship is designed for use by a mass audience.  But for whom was this device created? </p><p>  Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, the characteristics of which we will list below, has a slightly different positioning compared to the Note line.  The device was created for those people who were primarily interested in a beautiful design and a large screen.  Nevertheless, to call such an audience large will be quite difficult.  Any company that is engaged in or engaged in phablet sales, of course, knows that such devices, although they are sold, did not and do not have a tendency leading to a sharp increase in popularity (and, consequently, sales).  Although here in terms of Asian markets you can argue.  There phablets disperse, as they say, just with a bang.  But we must take into account the situation as a whole, right? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, to <span>summarize the intermediate result.</span>  The Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus smartphone, reviews of which will be given at the end of this article, is a device equipped with a large, impressive screen.  The device is based on a huge number of different functions that will appeal to many users.  Moreover, to successfully control the device does not even need a stylus. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  What will we see when we first open the packaging?  In the box, we can find, of course, a warranty card and a small instruction manual that has been unnecessary for a hundred years now.  Everyone has seen it, everyone knows it.  In addition, we will find a phone and a charger for it.  It is equipped with a removable USB cable - MicroUSB.  The package includes a medium-quality wired stereo headset.  Well, the composition is completed by a clip specially prepared for the smartphone owner, which will facilitate the process of removing the tray into which the SIM card is installed.  The case for the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, an overview of which is presented in the article, can be purchased separately in mobile phone stores. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  Probably, one of the highlights of this device can be called a screen curved on the sides of the case.  This makes the appearance of the smartphone somewhat unusual, and therefore interesting.  In fact, everything is so.  You can easily recognize the flagship in the device, and this is also a thoughtful move.  From the point of view of the image, this device attracts attention to itself, too.  On the smartphone market, nothing like this currently exists.  Nevertheless, we can take Edge Plus and its predecessor and compare their appearance.  In this case, we notice the almost absolute identity of the devices.  At first glance, it seems that this is one and the same model, without any noticeable differences. </p><p>  But such an opinion is erroneous.  Firstly, smartphone designers have worked (and not bad) on changing the shape of the case.  The kink that goes along the metal edging has become noticeable.  This is a well-thought-out decision by company employees.  What are the practical reasons for this?  With the help of a kink, it was possible to ensure that the case does not cut into the palm, but lies comfortably in it.  The predecessor of our current device could not boast of such.  Holding Edge Plus has become much more convenient.  At the same time, one should not even talk about the affected design. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  In all three planes, the dimensions of the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, the design characteristics of which we are analyzing at the moment, are 154.4 by 75.8 by 6.9 millimeters.  The mass of the device is about 153 grams.  Engineers of the company managed to achieve such dimensions directly due to the screen, or rather its bending.  Yes, and the edging has contributed to the common cause.  An interesting solution: even with such ‚Äúbiometric‚Äù data, with such a battery, the device still seems compact.  But the mass of the device really claims to be a market record.  If the company can create a similar smartphone with even less weight, then there will be no price at all. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge - iPhone 6 Plus (VS): Screen Protector </h2>

    <p>  The display of the device, as well as its rear surface, is protected by a layer of Corning <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 4. The metal chassis is quite massive.  But the role of the large corps in this situation becomes quite obvious.  The metal was changed, replaced with an aluminum alloy.  It is distinguished by a large margin of safety and lightness.  All this is a positive point.  Similar material was used in the iPhone 6S.  At the moment, nothing more practical and durable has been invented (at least for the corresponding device niche). </p><h2>  Color schemes </h2><p>  To date, there are several of them in the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus.  They, however, are identical to those used in relation to the predecessor of the device.  At first glance, you can even confuse devices with each other.  But this is under further consideration.  If you look at the devices closer, the dimensions clearly give out the subject of our review today. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The owners of the phablet have repeatedly noted the high volume of the speaker, as well as its excellent sound quality.  The device is clearly audible in a variety of situations, even with loud surroundings.  The strength of the vibrating alert is at an average level.  There are no achievements or breakthroughs in this direction. </p><p>  A good set and quality of communication modules.  Phone owners say LTE works well.  With wireless Wi-Fi, the device works quite well. </p><p>  The disadvantages are the absence of a memory card.  A very serious minus, to be honest.  You will have to either strictly filter the necessary and unnecessary data, or use cloud storage. </p>
