  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Which accounting option to prefer?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <strong><em>No one will argue that bookkeeping should be carried out with all responsibility, because the tax inspectorate and extra-budgetary funds are not asleep.</em></strong>  <strong><em>Individual entrepreneurs or LLCs may work with varying degrees of success or experience stagnation in business, but the deadlines for submitting reports must be respected.</em></strong>  <strong><em>There are different accounting options, and each of them suits someone more than the others.</em></strong>  <strong><em>How to decide?</em></strong> <br><br>  Immediately sweep <noindex>  <span>bookkeeping IP</span> </noindex>  or LLC yourself.  As practice shows, individual entrepreneurs without workers who report on UTII, PSN or STS "Incomes" manage to cope with documents with dignity.  The rest is awaiting difficulties.  So, an individual entrepreneur with employees is obliged to pay salaries twice a month, withhold personal income tax from it, once a quarter to submit reports and pay insurance premiums.  And also vacation, hospital ... It will be troublesome to master these subtleties, and everyone thinks about the consequences of a negligent attitude to reporting at the enterprise. </p><p>  So, the first option worth considering is to find an accountant in the state.  Such a specialist has all the rights and obligations of a hired employee: he needs to pay salaries and vacation pay, pay for it with funds.  It will require the arrangement of a workplace, the purchase of hardware and software.  Moreover, there are no guarantees that the accountant will always be "at hand" at the right time: he can go on sick leave, on vacation or go on maternity leave. </p><p>  You can reduce the cost of this option by contacting a specialist who works in a remote format or comes to the office from time to time.  Most likely, it will not be necessary to equip such an accountant with special programs, and he will take a fee for services less than a staffer.  A factor of additional savings is the presence of an IP status for an accountant, because in this situation with the funds, he is calculated from his wallet. </p><p>  ‚ÄúOwn‚Äù accountant is convenient, but it all depends on the skills, experience and personal qualities of the specialist, on whom the choice will fall.  A good accountant will not only help <noindex>  <span>pay taxes sp</span> </noindex>  or LLC is correct, but will worry about the common cause.  On the other hand, it is extremely rare to meet accountants who are versed in all areas of their work.  A specific specialist may well have problems with a particular accounting area. </p><p>  The second option is to connect to the online accounting service.  A fairly popular scenario among those businessmen who are well versed in modern technology and can find time to study the laws and regulations in their schedule.  Online accounting tools are debugged and convenient, however, it should be understood that no system can absolutely replace a person, which means that you will have to rely on yourself - your memory, attentiveness, knowledge.  The option is good, rather, as an auxiliary. </p><p>  The third option is to outsource accounting.  In this case, it is possible to completely relieve itself of responsibility for the result of accounting calculations: problems with the tax, if any, will have to be eliminated by the accounting company with which the entrepreneur has concluded an agreement.  If you recover material damage from a hired employee for a long time and troubles, then an unfavorable situation is resolved quickly.  In addition, by contacting an accounting company, an entrepreneur can be sure that highly specialized professionals will work with his documents, and in which case he will be replaced by another experienced accountant. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that accounting companies do not require a lot of money from customers.  The fact is that they usually have flexible pricing schemes.  You can choose the most profitable format of cooperation, outsourcing only those operations that are really difficult to cope without relevant knowledge.
