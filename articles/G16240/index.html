  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Celle (Germany) - Museum City</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Celle is a small German town.  A little more than 70 thousand people live here.  It is located in Lower Saxony, on the banks of the Adler River, in the southern part of the L√ºneburg Heath, 35 kilometers from Hanover.  The city attracts tourists with its medieval architecture, which did not even suffer during the Second World War. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="52.6175963" data-lng="10.0628514" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/5/8/5/4585.png"></div><h2>  Historical excursion </h2><p>  The first mention of the city of Celle in Germany dates back to 986.  Here for a long time the ducal residence was located.  And in the XI century, the city minted its own coins. </p><p>  The historical foundation of the city was laid in the XIII century, under the rule of Duke Otto Strict.  From 1666 to 1705, a real cultural boom was observed in the town.  Here beautiful gardens and parks are broken down, a palace theater is being built.  But with the passing of the life of Duke George William, everything calms down, and Celle in Germany turns into an ordinary provincial town. </p><p>  Since 1705, the city has become a district of lawyers and officials.  To this day, the Land Court of Social Security, the highest land court of Lower Saxony, operates here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="magazynswiat.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãbeauty" class="if uuid-2555146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2555146.jpg"></div><h2>  "Raceputz" </h2><p>  However, the city is famous not only for architecture and officials, but also for a special kind of schnapps called ‚ÄúRaceputz‚Äù.  It has been manufactured on these lands since the 19th century.  The peculiarity of the drink is that ginger is added to it, which has a good effect on the digestive tract.  Schnapps, produced in Celle in Germany, is very strong - 58%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Peter Weidmann first cooked it back in 1877.  Since then, ‚ÄúRaceputz‚Äù has been an integral part of all feasts of local residents and is known throughout Lower Saxony. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ar15.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kind of schnapps" class="if uuid-2555149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2555149.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Celle in Germany is more than 500 houses that were built back in the 16th century.  They are perfectly preserved and did not even suffer during the Second World War.  A significant part of the medieval buildings is located in the Alstadt area.  It is here that you can see half-timbered houses, in some of them people live to this day, although most of them have already been converted into shops and restaurants. </p><p>  The most colorful building is the Hoppen house, its facade is decorated with unique ornaments that resemble plots from fairy tales. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.orangesmile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="streets of the city" class="if uuid-2555145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2555145.jpg"></div><h2>  Other interesting places </h2><p>  The building of the Old Town Hall, which is made in the Renaissance style, is considered to be unique in beauty. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main shrine in the city of Celle Germany is the Church of St. Ludwig (1838).  The building is made in the best traditions of the classical style.  The temple has two white towers.  Inside, old frescoes and stucco work, some elements with gilding, are preserved. </p><p>  Arriving in the city, you should definitely go to the French Garden, which was created in the XVIII century.  A tragic story is associated with its creation.  The garden was broken for the wife of the Danish king, who he exiled to the city, suspecting her of treason.  The king‚Äôs wife died in tragic circumstances at the age of 23.  In her honor, a monument is erected in the park.  Today, the French Garden is a resting place and cultural center of the city, where interesting events are held. </p><p>  There are two interesting museums in the city that are nearby: the Bomann Museum and the Fine Arts, where you can see paintings and sculptures by contemporary masters of the country.  By the way, the museum building is very beautifully illuminated at night. </p><h2>  Castle </h2><p>  This is the former residence of the family of the Dukes of Braunschweig-L√ºneburg.  The castle is the largest in the entire southern part of Lower Saxony. </p><p>  Initially, in 980, a defensive tower was erected around which there was a moat, and it was called "Kell."  In 1292, Duke Otton II the Strong decided to expand the fortification and actually built a castle.  The remains of the old tower (basement vault and first floor) are located under the castle theater. </p><p>  After construction, the castle was first mentioned in 1315.  Later, the palace in Celle in Germany was rebuilt several times, and in the XVI century the bastion and ramparts were removed.  Since 1705, when the city is part of the kingdom of Hanover, the castle has lost its political significance.  During the Second World War, the castle housed the house of officers.  Now it is a museum where baroque halls and the interior are preserved in its original form.  Also on the territory of the castle (eastern part) there is a branch of the Bomann Museum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="9staedte.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Celle Castle" class="if uuid-2555147" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2555147.jpg"></div><h2>  Traditional festivals </h2><p>  Interesting photos of Celle in Germany are obtained during traditional festivals.  One of the highlights of the event is the Horse Parade.  It is held annually in September.  The first stud farm in the city was opened in 1735, and from that moment on, local stallions are considered one of the best in Lower Saxony and throughout Germany.  Today the plant is home to about 1.5 thousand horses. </p><p>  An unforgettable sight when the horses solemnly walk along the main streets of the town with beautiful carts and teams.  Before the event, horses are trained for a long time.  The program also includes a horse square dance, fair and all kinds of competitions. </p><p>  You can come to the city for Christmas holidays, these days it is being transformed, everywhere there is colorful illumination and many tents with treats and souvenirs. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the city may seem very calm, it is here that you can see firsthand the national flavor and German traditions that the locals have managed to preserve to this day. </p>
