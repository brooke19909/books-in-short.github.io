    <h2>  Gadget culture </h2><p>  Due to the congestion of megacities with cars, the likelihood of a traffic accident increases sharply.  Unfortunately, there are often situations when the violator fled the scene of the accident and cannot find out who is to blame.  For this reason, the use of DVRs has become widespread and has become something of a tradition. </p><p>  According to reviews, Cardinal G3 qualitatively captures what is happening on the video, so it‚Äôs enough to take care of the file‚Äôs safety to identify the culprit of the accident. </p><h2>  Device </h2><p>  The first thing that attention is usually paid to (at start-up), according to owners' reviews of Cardinal G3, is the quality of the video.  It is often difficult for a driver to prove his case, because excellently shot video means a lot.  Enough positive comments about the device: the picture is excellent, the numbers of cars are clearly visible (even at night), and the faces of passers-by are clearly distinguishable - shooting is carried out down to the smallest detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In principle, it is clear why video quality plays such a role, and it is not surprising that this is what motorists first of all pay attention to. </p>

    <h2>  Product Features </h2><p>  The price of this device varies within 10,000 rubles (depending on the online store).  The figure is fully justified, considering how many functions are included in this small device. </p><p>  Reviews of the 3 in 1 Cardinal G3 dashcam indicate that it has all the necessary functions that should be present in the gadget with the status of "best": </p><ul><li>  The presence of a GPS module.  Promotes fast location, tracking, and speed.  It is very useful for protection from road scammers who try to substitute themselves under the car, provoking an accident. </li><li>  Modern radar detector.  Alerts the driver about the presence of devices that record speeding.  Reacts even to advanced modern devices such as "Arrow".  Warns of approaching for the first time for 1 kilometer to the radar, the second time for 600 meters.  Range can be adjusted in the settings. </li><li>  The product is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera.  However, the night mode is not present on the G3, but on a modified model labeled G5, the description of which will be below. </li><li>  The product is conveniently mounted in the cabin and does not interfere with the review.  The friendly Russian-language interface makes it possible for anyone to understand the settings of the ‚Äúcardinal‚Äù.  The display is hinged, which makes operation very convenient and comfortable, and recording is done on a 32 gigabyte card. </li><li>  According to reviews of Cardinal G3, many are content with a two-inch display diagonal, the maximum possible resolution of 720 pixels. </li><li>  Importantly, the database is updated via a personal computer by connecting via a USB drive.  There is a G-sensor, which is a very big plus of the device. </li></ul>

When you purchase, the kit comes with a USB cable for connecting to a PC, a cigarette lighter for a car, a mount and, of course, an instruction manual. </p><p>  The Cardinal G3 dashcam also has a 1-year warranty.  According to official representatives, the device rarely returns back to the store. </p><h2>  pros </h2><p>  As already mentioned, there are more positive reviews for the Cardinal G3 than negative reviews.  Owners note the high quality of the video, the excellent operation of the GPS navigator, the high performance of the gadget as a radar detector. </p><p>  Many really like the user-friendly interface - you can easily understand any settings. </p>

    <h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Despite a lot of advantages, there are also negative feedback about this model.  So, some note the incorrect operation of the temporary ‚Äústamp‚Äù - for some reason, the time is incorrectly displayed on the video.  Perhaps this is due to incorrect time zone settings in the device itself. </p><p>  Other owners note that the anti-radar is not triggered for 1200 meters, as stated in the description, but only for <span>120 meters.</span> Perhaps, it is also a matter of settings. </p><p>  A number of comments <span>state the fact of</span> absolutely unsatisfactory quality of the video recording, while it is indicated that the product was purchased at a price of about 5000 rubles.  The conclusion is obvious: most likely, either the review was erroneously indicated (and such was intended for another model), or an outright fake was simply bought.  It should be remembered that the cost of the product is approximately 10,000 rubles. </p><p>  The remaining negative reviews about Cardinal G3 are either left by competitors or simply unlucky customers who did not bother to understand the principles of the gadget. </p><p>  For example, complaints that the card is only 32 gigabytes.  The solution is obvious: purchase a larger microSD.  And also a complaint about the lack of sound when playing on a PC: you just need to check for the latest drivers on your computer and make sure that the system correctly supports playback of the AVI and MOV formats. </p><p>  Someone does not like the price, but this can not be attributed to negative reviews.  Cost is a subjective matter, because someone can afford it, but for someone it can not afford.  That does not detract from the merits of the product. </p><h2>  Advanced model </h2><p>  According to reviews of the 5 in 1 dashcam, Cardinal G3 also has an upgraded version under the G5 marking.  Characteristics do not differ much.  For example, the ‚Äúfive‚Äù has a night mode, the maximum possible <span>video resolution</span> is not 720 pixels, but as many as 1080. And also the display diagonal is not 2 inches, but 2.7 and the range of detection of the radar has been increased to two kilometers.  The remaining differences between the models are exclusively visual. </p>

    <h2>  G-sensor </h2><p>  An important advantage of any gadget is the presence of an electronic accelerometer.  This is an accident sensor that records the exact time of increasing the load on the car and a sharp decrease in speed.  If the car stood still, then an increase in speed and pressure at the same time is recorded. </p><p>  So the ‚Äúaccident point‚Äù is noted in the time period.  Thanks to this function, it is possible not only to determine the moment of an accident up to a second, but also to protect important video materials about this accident from erasure or overwriting.  Drivers appreciate these gadgets, according to reviews of the Cardinal G3 dashcam. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Cardinal G3 owners' reviews state that a truly worthy product has appeared on the automotive gadget market, which can be described as the optimal ratio of price and quality.  The multifunctional device has become a great friend and assistant to any motorist. </p><p>  It should be noted that the ‚Äúculture of gadgets‚Äù has taken root very tightly among Russian drivers.  And this has its advantages.  For example, the likelihood of finding detailed video material has increased to carefully understand the details of a traffic accident. </p><p>  If before the court did not consider such video files as evidence, when the gadget was not properly registered, then after legislative amendments of May 7, 2016, the judge accepts the video material. </p><p>  If there are traces of video editing, the fraudster will immediately be punished, because forgery of evidence is criminally prosecuted.  Therefore, to avoid this, you should remove the card from the gadget in the event of an accident and seal it in an envelope for further transfer to a law enforcement officer. </p><p>  Good luck to everyone on the road. </p>
