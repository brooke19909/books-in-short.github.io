  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Napkin pompons: different manufacturing options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, a fashionable trend has become the decoration of rooms with pom-poms from napkins or other tissue paper.  You can decorate any feast with magnificent balls; they look beautiful at a wedding celebration.  Purchased products cost a lot of money, but do-it-yourself ones look just as good. </p><p>  Pompoms from napkins can be made completely round, like balls, or you can expand the paper not completely, creating hemispheres.  They can be placed on the surface of the festive table, decorate with them shelves or tables for gifts or flowers. </p><p>  You can create a craft as a single-color, and multi-colored.  To do this, you need to choose harmonious colors and shades.  Balloons will look beautiful both at an adult holiday and at a children's party. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make pom-poms from do-it-yourself napkins, how to diversify them, what material is best to choose, how to hang them on a wall or ceiling. </p><h2>  First manufacturing method </h2><p>  For work, you need to choose a monophonic dense and multilayer napkin, you can take several pieces.  First, they need to be deployed in one layer and laid on the surface of the table with an even bundle.  Then they fold a thin "accordion" with their hands, performing smooth, even thin folds of equal width forward and backward.  When all layers are laid and smoothed, the paper is folded in half, defining the center point of the craft. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="napkin making option" class="if uuid-2629120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2629120.jpg"></div><p>  Further actions are performed in different ways: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  You can bandage the center of the napkin with a strong thread to match the paper. </li><li>  To minimize wrinkles in the center of the craft, the middle of the napkin is cut with corners from above and below, and only then a thin part is tied with thread. </li><li>  You can tie it with a thin satin ribbon.  And leaving the long ends, subsequently for them and fasten the pompoms from napkins to the ceiling. </li></ul><h2>  The next step </h2><p>  The outer edges of the napkins, folded in an accordion, are cut off with sharp corners over the entire width, thin ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù, rounded off with scissors, as in the photo above, or cut into several small corners.  Then, carefully lay out all the layers of paper.  Care must be taken not to tear the edges. </p><div class="photo" data-original="misskopykat.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorating the room with pompons" class="if uuid-2629104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2629104.jpg"></div><p>  After all the sheets are arranged in a circle, a magnificent ball is obtained.  Such pompoms from wipes can be made of different sizes, using products of various sizes to work. </p><h2>  Second way </h2><p>  Now consider another popular and easy way to make balls from napkins.  Products are stacked in a pack in several pieces, without deploying. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make pompoms from napkins" class="if uuid-2629131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2629131.jpg"></div><p>  In the middle of the clerical stapler, two brackets are placed with a cross.  When the bundle is firmly fastened, the edges are cut with scissors around the circumference.  It turns out a multilayer circle.  Its edges can be cut into small ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù or sharp corners, small semicircles will also be beautiful. </p><p>  Then it remains only to carefully lift each layer of paper and take it with your fingers closer to the middle.  Thus, the metal cross from the brackets is hidden from view, and from the pack a magnificent pompom is obtained. </p><p>  In the article we told in detail how to make pompoms from napkins in different ways.  For manufacturing, only a few napkins, a thread and a ribbon are required.  As you can see, making them is quite simple and cheap.  And pompons look very festive and spectacular. </p>
