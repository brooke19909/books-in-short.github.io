    <p>  The hotel belongs to the famous Italian line of Besta Hotels and Resorts.  Europeans and Americans love her, especially for a calm and serene pastime and low cost of living.  Tourists value the hotel highly enough, as evidenced in their feedback about this place. </p><h2>  Marsa Alam region - why is it interesting? </h2><p>  The coastline of this new Egyptian resort stretches for seventy kilometers.  And mainly four- and five-star hotels are being built along the sea.  One of them is Resta Reef Resort 4 * <span>(Egypt, Marsa Alam).</span>  From all corners of the earth, those who cannot live without diving and snorkeling are trying to come here.  The clear turquoise water of the sea, the richest coral reefs are the main wealth of this resort.  Its only drawback, from the point of view of some tourists, is too strong isolation.  There is virtually no infrastructure, clubs, cafes and parties.  Therefore, hotels are trying to make up for this shortcoming on their own territory.  But excellent service, comfortable accommodation, deserted beaches and beautiful fish - this is such a bonus of Marsa Alam, which, perhaps, no other Egyptian resort can boast of.  However, prices bite here, and the region is designed primarily for wealthy tourists.  Therefore, according to reviews, Resta Reef Resort is good because its prices are acceptable for middle-income people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resta reef resort marsa alam" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1071286.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Hotel Resta Reef Resort 4 * is located far from the airport of Hurghada.  The transfer from there is quite tiring.  But this is Marsa Alam, with its clear water, pristine beaches and <span>coral reefs of</span> such colors that you do not need to go to Sharm.  It takes more than four hours to get from Hurghada International Airport to the hotel.  But if you fly directly to Marsa Alam (this hub opened not so long ago), then you should go to it for about ten to fifteen.  The airport itself also delighted tourists.  Unlike Hurghada, no lines, crush.  Very quickly everyone draws up, including a visa.  The transfer is often similar to an individual - also due to the small number of people.  Around the hotel there is a desert and several ‚Äúfives‚Äù: on the one hand there is a hotel of the same ‚Äúchain‚Äù of Grand Resta Resort, and on the other there are three luxury complexes of the Iberotel chain.  Nearby there is a supermarket and several shops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resta reef resort marsa a 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1071287.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea, beach, pools </h2><p>  The hotel has its own sandy beach.  Nearby is a coral reef.  There is a pier from which the sea abysses open.  The water is very clean and clear.  This attracts tourists to the Resta Reef Resort 4 * hotel.  Reviews in 2015 assure that the corals are alive, and during snorkeling you can observe such rare fish as angels, butterflies.  Near the open sea is a lagoon, where moray eels, rays, octopuses live.  The beach has a diving center and sports facilities.  But if you just swim with a mask, then the sensations, according to tourists, are simply indescribable.  The fish themselves surround you and swim very close.  In the open sea, the depth is very large, water is visible for tens of meters.  If the weather is nice, then you can swim near the pier, and when big waves - then in the lagoon.  In strong winds, a ladder on the pier is hoisted and a black flag hangs.  The lagoon is up to two meters deep, the water temperature there is always above twenty-four degrees Celsius.  However, the sea can be entered only in "coral slippers."  There are two pools on the territory of the Resta Reef Resort Marsa Alam 4 * hotel.  Both of them are in the open air, and one of them is heated. </p><h2>  Surroundings, trips </h2><p>  Near the Resta Reef Resort 4 * hotel (Marsa Alam) is the Abu Dabab Nature Reserve, where there are luxurious corals and rare fauna - dugongs, <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãcows.</span>  You can still go to the island of turtles, or Mars Mubarak.  There really are huge, up to a meter long, reptiles that completely do not pay attention to people, swim, relax, eat.  If you want to take a walk, then tourists are advised to go to Port Ghalib, where there are excellent cafes, and the yachts of the local rich are on the pier.  This ideal eco resort, specially designed by artists and designers, is worth exploring in itself.  Alleys, fountains, parks, architecture, repeating literally every relief of ancient Egyptian buildings - this is worth a look at least once.  ATV tours are also organized there.  Since Marsa Alam is located in the south, it‚Äôs close to Aswan, and you can even get to Lake Nasser or the Abu Simbel temple rock complex. </p>

    <p>  The temple with the colossal figures of the pharaohs on the shore of the reservoir is still amazing.  And if you manage to get on the light and sound show, then you will never forget this trip to Egypt.  One of the most exclusive trips in these places is a visit to the Wadi Hammamat Valley, which once ran along the route of trade caravans to India and China.  Here you can see old inscriptions and cave paintings. </p><h2>  Prices and Shopping </h2><p>  Of course, those who come to the Resta Reef Resort <span>Marsa Alam 4 *</span> hotel are eager to bring something with them as a souvenir.  So, experienced tourists do not advise buying souvenirs at the hotel itself, but recommend hiring a taxi for twenty dollars and going to Port Ghalib.  Here you can buy masks, and flippers, and <span>coral slippers,</span> and various Egyptian little things five times cheaper than in shops at the hotel.  In addition, here you can buy everything that is usually brought from Hurghada - towels, shells, books, spices, jackets and t-shirts made of cotton, magnets, Bedouin scarves, galabeys and so on.  Eastern sweets are also good in Port Galib, which you need to buy not in the bazaar or in the supermarket, but in special pastry shops in order to avoid fakes.  A trip to Wadi Hammamat will cost about thirty dollars.  ATV excursion in the desert - about sixty. </p><h2>  Resta Reef Resort Marsa Alam 4 * - reviews </h2><p>  Tourists say that this hotel, although small, is very neat, comfortable, with well-trained and caring staff and good services, for which it requires a very reasonable price.  Almost half of the tourists are from Germany.  The rest are Italians, Poles, Swedes, French.  Almost no tourists from Russia and Ukraine.  Transparent water, a fabulous sea, a mass of various fish that you will not see in Hurghada.  It is very quiet and calm, and here come those who do not like to relax too noisy.  The food is tasty, satisfying and gourmet.  Rest Hotel Resta Reef Resort 4 * provides a fabulous, with maximum warmth, comfort and pleasure.  According to tourists, he deserves five "stars". </p>
