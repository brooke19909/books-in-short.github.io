This problem applies to TVs.  It may be such that when you press the power button, a relay click is heard, the indicator lights up in red, the TV does not turn on.  The causes of the breakdown and symptoms may be different.  More on all of this below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alpengeist-tvrepair.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips TV does not turn on the indicator does not light" class="if uuid-3199835" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/3199835.jpg"></div><h2>  General issues </h2><p>  The main malfunctions associated with the inability to turn on the TV can be divided into four categories: </p><ul><li>  The power indicator is on or blinking, but the device does not respond to the power button. </li><li>  The diode on the device lights up red, but it does not respond to pressing any buttons. </li><li>  The indicator is off, the TV does not turn on. </li><li>  When you try to turn on the TV starts to make uncharacteristic sounds and does not turn on. <div class="photo" data-original="mainharga.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung TV does not turn on the indicator does not light" class="if uuid-3199837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/3199837.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  Despite the fact that most types of such equipment have different designs (namely, LCD, plasma or electron beam), due to structural differences, they can also differ in size.  But the above problems and methods for solving them are suitable for any type of device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to do if the diode blinks and the TV does not turn on? </h2><p>  Most modern models, having discovered some kind of error, transmit its code with this blinking.  Usually you can understand what‚Äôs the matter by the number of blinks.  Information about the error code can be found in the user manual or on the official website of the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gumtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Toshiba TV does not turn on" class="if uuid-3199839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/3199839.jpg"></div><p>  If the TV is connected to a computer or laptop, it is possible that the PC went into sleep mode.  Accordingly, the TV will blink, indicating that there is no signal.  To do this, you need to move the mouse or press any key on the keyboard. </p><h2>  What to do if the LED is on and the TV does not turn on? </h2><p>  There are times when the Toshiba TV does not turn on and the indicator is on.  It is logical to assume that the lamp glow on the device means that electricity is being supplied to the control unit.  If problems with turning on the TV arise when using the remote control, it is worth checking whether everything is okay with it.  Try turning on the device using the button on the case. </p><p>  If the TV turns on, you should make sure that the remote control is working.  First you need to find out if the batteries are dead in it, if their contacts are oxidized.  Inspect the IR transmitter for dirt or damage.  Disassemble the remote control to clean it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mainharga.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the TV does not turn on the indicator lights up in red" class="if uuid-3199838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/3199838.jpg"></div><p>  If the remote control is flooded with liquid, then it is necessary to return it for repair or replace it.  In the event that the device could not be turned on from the button on the case, there are two reasons for this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.varagesale.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="does not turn on" class="if uuid-3199841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/3199841.jpg"></div><h2>  Protection worked </h2><p>  The cause of such malfunctions can be a normal voltage drop or a power outage while the TV was in sleep mode.  Also, a similar problem can manifest itself in the form of a short-term inclusion of the TV. </p><p>  So, the TV does not turn on, the indicator does not light.  What to do?  To exit this emergency mode, it is enough to disconnect the device from the power supply for a while.  It is likely that after some time, the device will recover.  If voltage drops or power outages occur quite often, it is better to purchase a stabilizer or uninterruptible power supply.  In extreme cases, you can use at least a network filter. </p><h2>  Damage to the processor or control unit </h2><p>  The TV may stop turning on due to a short circuit on the board.  In the event of such a malfunction, it is categorically not recommended to undertake an independent repair.  It is better to contact the service.  Unauthorized repair attempts can cause permanent damage to the device. </p><h2>  What to do if the indicator is off, the TV does not turn on? </h2><p>  This type of malfunction is caused by a lack of power in the electrical network of the device.  It may be that even the expensive Samsung TV does not turn on, the indicator does not light, but the problem may be not only in the device itself.  To begin with, it is worthwhile to analyze the possible causes of malfunctions in the device that can be solved independently: </p><ul><li>  Electricity is not being supplied.  The wire, the socket itself, or the machine in the shield can simply be turned off.  If possible, make sure the integrity of the cable, test the socket, for example, using another device, or turn the machine on and off several times. </li><li>  Extension cord damage.  If you use an extension cord to connect to the power supply, and the Philips TV does not turn on, the indicator does not light when connected through it, it is worth trying to connect the TV directly to determine that it is the problem that caused it. </li><li>  The power button on the TV is not turned on.  A similar problem can only occur when using the remote control. </li><li>  Another mode is on.  It is possible that with the previous use of the TV, AV or HDMI mode was left active on it.  Due to the lack of signal, the device goes into sleep mode. </li><li>  Failure of one of the components.  To diagnose such a problem, it is better to seek help from specialists so that they test the operability of all components of the device and, if necessary, carry out repairs. </li><li>  <span>Blown fuse.</span>  <span>Fuses are</span> now found mainly on older devices.  So, if your old Samsung TV does not turn on, the indicator does not light, then it is worth checking the condition of the fuses.  If necessary, you can replace the burned ones. </li></ul><h2>  What should I do if the TV does not turn on, the indicator does not light, and extraneous sounds are heard? </h2><p>  In some cases, when you try to turn on the TV, there are clicks, hum and other noises.  The most common causes of such sounds are: </p><ul><li>  Protection system.  It is triggered by various malfunctions of the internal components of the device.  It is she who clicks, disconnecting the electric circuit of the TV. </li><li>  Clicking the case immediately after turning it on or off is associated with heating or cooling of the case.  This is absolutely normal for any TV. </li><li>  Overload in the power supply.  In this case, it is necessary to call the specialists of the service center, since this problem can not be solved independently. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If your Philips TV does not turn on, the indicator does not light, or it makes strange sounds - this does not mean that the cause of the malfunction is in the device itself.  When such situations occur, you do not need to panic.  It is better to diagnose the device for breakdowns and solve the problem yourself, if possible.  In the event that the components of the device itself are faulty, then without hesitation it is necessary to contact specialists. </p>
