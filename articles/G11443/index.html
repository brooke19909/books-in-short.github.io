Nobody will demand exorbitant payment for the service, and it doesn‚Äôt take much time to repair beloved clothes, but the complex center for sewing and repairing clothes is not always located near work or home.  In this case, you will have to change the button yourself. </p><h2>  What is a jeans button </h2><p>  Such a small, but extremely necessary attribute appeared along with denim clothes.  Incidentally, things familiar to everyone and everyone from the beginning initially served as forms for hard physical work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": jessyratfink, "><img itemprop="image" alt="change the button on the jeans yourself" class="if uuid-3192792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/3192792.jpg"></div><p>  Coarse fabric must be fastened with reliable fittings, which means that the button is fixed directly to the material, otherwise no thread can withstand the load.  Yes, and the button itself has high-strength requirements, which is why they are made of metal. </p><h2>  Button device </h2><p>  Before talking about how to change the button on jeans, it is worth figuring out what this hardware looks like.  The hat and carnations form the jeans button directly, but it can already have various sizes and methods of fastening. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The button shape is determined by the hat: </p><ul><li>  square; </li><li>  round; </li><li>  square, having rounded corners; </li><li>  Hex. </li></ul><p>  The most convenient form is considered to be round, it is them that are easy and quick to put into loops. </p><p>  The following caps can be found directly: </p><ul><li>  convex; </li><li>  concave; </li><li>  direct; </li><li>  semicircular. </li></ul><p>  Sizes are determined by diameter and range from 14 to 40 mm. </p><h2>  Features of fasteners and types of studs </h2><p>  Before describing the process of how to change the button on jeans, we must also mention the types of fasteners: </p><ul><li>  the presence of a fixed leg; </li><li>  a floating or broken leg, this feature allows the button to not lose mobility after it is attached to the product. </li></ul><p>  If we talk about cloves, then the following types are found: </p><ul><li>  having a round notch - are among the most reliable methods of fastening; </li><li>  all-metal or smooth; </li><li>  hollow smooth; </li><li>  double or with a pair of spikes. </li></ul><p>  Hats are solid or with a through hole in the middle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.axminster.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove a button from jeans" class="if uuid-3192819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/3192819.jpg"></div><p>  Anyone who is thinking about how to change a button on jeans himself should know one nuance.  Buying jeans accessories in parts is not the best option.  The characteristics of such important parts will depend on the size, materials and manufacturer.  Even if the parts are the same size, but they were made by different manufacturers, then it is far from a fact that they will fit together. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Button Installation </h2><p>  Sewing production involves the installation of accessories using a specialized mechanism - the press.  If the enterprise has small volumes of production, then they use manual equipment - these are levers or percussion mechanisms.  Large factories use electromechanical devices. </p><p>  Manual installation of jeans buttons requires the following tools: </p><ul><li>  awl - they pierce the fabric in the place where the installation of accessories is supposed to be; </li><li>  a hammer; </li><li>  pliers; </li><li>  bolts (if the button has a through hole); </li><li>  metal tubes to fix the floating foot. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.axminster.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to change a button on jeans" class="if uuid-3192824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/3192824.jpg"></div><p>  It is important to remember that the workplace must be stable, and it is best if it has a surface of wood. </p><h2>  Installing buttons with a stable foot </h2><p>  How to replace a button on jeans?  First, the fabric is pierced, then a nail is inserted into the puncture site and hammered into the top of the button.  This must be done very carefully so that the hat is not pierced right through. </p><p>  For accessories with a through hole, the tip of the nail sticking out of it is first shortened using pliers.  If this operation is impossible, then you can make a tab of plastic - it is installed between the tip and the cap. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": jessyratfink, "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to replace a button on jeans" class="if uuid-3192807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/3192807.jpg"></div><p>  The sharp part of the nail should be flattened.  To do this simply with a bolt having a suitable diameter.  It is inserted into the hole, then it is necessary to gently tap the bolt with a hammer until the nail tip is flattened. </p><h2>  Installing buttons with a broken leg </h2><p>  You can install such accessories on a smooth carnation, all-metal or hollow.  Here, the work is complicated by the mobility of the button, the smoothness of the nail makes it difficult to install. </p><p>  To facilitate the task, you can take a tube having a diameter of a floating leg.  The tube is placed on the leg and, thus, the latter is fixed in a flat position.  It remains only to install a nail. </p><p>  There are special kits that include plastic presses - fasteners, with their help the button installation process is greatly facilitated. </p><h2>  Double-leg Button Replacement </h2><p>  Such accessories do not have holes, and therefore you will need to make them yourself.  Here you can use an awl or an ordinary nail. </p><p>  The sequence of work is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Pierce a couple of holes in the fabric where the spike legs will be inserted. </li><li>  To put a hat on a leg. </li><li>  Bend the end of the spikes inward through the through hole on the cap.  This is done using an ordinary screwdriver. </li><li>  Fasten the button using a bolt according to the method already described. </li></ol><h2>  How to remove a button from jeans </h2><p>  You will need to carry out such work if a broken pin remains on the clothes.  The remains of the part are bitten off using side cutters or pliers.  To remove the hat after this procedure is not difficult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": Brittany McCrigler, "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to change a button on jeans" class="if uuid-3192785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/3192785.jpg"></div><p>  So, the article described how to change a button on jeans.  By the way, the fittings are considered very reliable and will not let you down, even if long-term loads are expected for clothing.  Strength is ensured by securing the buttons directly to the fabric.  Very often, buttons are decorated with various engravings, which allows them to perform a decorative function. </p>
