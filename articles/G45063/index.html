It is 50 km from Antalya Airport (south-west).  The distance from Kemer to Kirish is 7 km.  The resort village is surrounded by mountains and the river Aqua, behind which you can see another cozy town - Camyuva.  The coast of Kirish is characterized by geographic isolation: on the one hand it is covered by rocky mountains, and on the other - the river Aqua, resembling a creeping snake.  The Antalya-Kemer highway is located on the back of the village.  From the top of the Toros Mountains bordering the spa town, a magnificent panorama of Kemer opens.  The relief of Kirish is diverse: the transparent sea and golden sandy beaches are surrounded by pine forests, pomegranate, citrus trees and steep cliffs.

The map clearly shows that the village is located between Kemer and Camyuva.  A small resort town has its own history.  Previously, there was a fishing village of the same name - Kirish.  Turkey in the I millennium BC  e.  was subjected to numerous attacks by enemy states.  In the beginning, there lived solims and terms, which were subsequently supplanted by the Lycians.  They founded a new state called Lycia, which included about 70 cities.  In the VI century.  BC  e.  he was conquered by the Persians.  In the 4th century  BC  e.  the state came under the rule of A. the Great, and in the 1st century it became part of the Roman Empire.  In the XI century, Lycia was conquered by the Turks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kirish turkey map" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/441469.jpg" width="341"></div>  The area where Kirish is now located at that time was called the Old Village.  This name was not chosen by chance.  It is connected with the geographical position of the settlement: there were many swamps and mountain villages.  Among the local population there is a legend that in ancient times there lived a monster named Chimera, which caused suffering to the inhabitants of the Old Village.  Over time, the settlement turned into a fishing village, and later into a small resort town with cozy hotels.
