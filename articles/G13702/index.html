Having begun its work in December 1957, the runway of the Kuybyshev State Airport was the most modern in the Soviet Union and was intended to receive high-speed aircraft. </p><h2>  History of Kurumoch Airport </h2><p>  Since the opening, the Kuibyshev airport has been used to train pilots to operate medium-range IL-18 and An-10 aircraft.  In February 1961, the first cargo flight from Kuibyshev to Moscow was carried out.  And since May of that year, regular passenger flights were launched on high-speed planes from Kurumoch Airport to Tashkent, Leningrad, Adler, Sverdlovsk and Tbilisi.  After 2 years, the air hub began receiving and sending freight and passenger flights on Tu-124 and An-12 aircraft. </p><p>  In 1970, the airport received and sent about 27,000 tons of mail and various cargoes and more than 700 thousand Soviet passengers.  After the reconstruction of the airport facilities in 1986, a new runway was launched, and in 1990 the passenger flow increased to 3.7 million people per year. </p>
