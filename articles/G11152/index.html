Nevertheless, the main flow of tourists falls on the hot season.  But recently, the tourism business in Turkey began to actively develop in the direction of winter recreation.  Now you can have a great time here in winter.  Moreover, the prices for the New Year 2018 in Turkey make a good impression. </p><h2>  Turkey in winter </h2><p>  Winter tourist Turkey, of course, is very different from summer.  In winter, many entertainment venues, water parks, open discos and various water activities do not work here.  The sea is very cool, and not at all hot.  But on this, perhaps, the cons end. </p>

    <p>  There are many more advantages.  For example, in winter there is not such a large influx of tourists, and you can safely walk along the coast in solitude or sit in a quiet cozy restaurant, as well as use the hotel services for free, which you will have to pay for in the summer: a sauna, a pool, a gym, a Turkish bath.  In winter, in Turkey you can just relax in a coastal hotel or go to the thermal springs in Denizli to improve your health.  You can play a lot of golf in Belek, visit the ski resorts or slowly enjoy the sights of Istanbul.  For especially seasoned tourists, even swimming in the sea is available, and marine healing air will benefit everyone, without exception.  And you can also have a wonderful New Year in Turkey. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the Turkish New Year </h2><p>  In Muslim Turkey, New Year became an official holiday not so long ago - in 1935.  Moreover, citizens of the country only January 1 is a day off.  The Turks do not celebrate Christmas, and the real New Year in this country is still March 21, when Muslims celebrate Navruz.  However, in all major tourist centers in Turkey these winter days, hotels, restaurants, shops and clubs are decorated with European Christmas attributes: Christmas trees, garlands, snowflakes, balls and figures of Santa Claus. </p>

    <p>  During the Christmas and New Year holidays in Turkish cities, it is not only very beautiful, but also fun.  All restaurants and nightclubs will surely offer special holiday treats and shows.  National television broadcasts holiday programs throughout New Year's Eve.  It should be noted that due to the globalization of the modern world and the integration of various cultures, many Turkish families gather at the New Year's table, decorated with a traditional turkey in Europe, however, with the obligatory accompaniment of <span>national Turkish dishes.</span> </p><h2>  New year weather </h2><p>  In Turkey, the Mediterranean climate prevails, which means mild winter weather, especially compared to the harsh Russian winter.  Of course, this is not the usual hot Turkish summer.  The temperature in Turkey for the New Year in different cities ranges from +11 to +18 degrees Celsius during the day.  It becomes much cooler at night, but the thermometer rarely drops below zero.  Water in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas cools down to +18 degrees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
