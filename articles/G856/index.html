    <h2>  Camp name </h2><p>  "Artek" - a camp that received its name at the location.  The children's center is located on the banks of the Artek River in the tract of the same name.  There are different opinions regarding the origin of the Artek token.  Some researchers believe that it dates back to the Greek words άρκτος (bear) or o oρτρκια (quail).  In Arab historical sources there is a mention of the country “Artania” inhabited by the Rus, located in the Black Sea Rus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the children's center itself, the version about the quail origin of the name of the camp is popular.  There is a song called "Artek - a quail islet."  This stable expression has firmly entered the vocabulary of guests and workers of the children's camp. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Artek Pioneer Camp in Crimea initially served as a sanatorium for children suffering from tuberculosis.  The initiative to create such an institution belonged to Zinovy ​​Petrovich Solovyov, chairman of the Red Cross Society in Russia.  For the first time, the camp opened its doors to young guests in 1925, on June 16.  In the first shift, Artek was visited by 80 children from the Crimea, Ivanovo-Voznesensk and Moscow.  In 1926, foreign guests appeared here - pioneers from Germany. </p><p>  Initially, Artek residents lived in tarpaulin tents.  Two years later, plywood houses appeared in the camp.  The 30s of the last century were marked for Artek by the erection of a winter building in the upper park.  In 1936, pioneers of order-bearers who were awarded government awards arrived in the camp, and in 1937, guests from Spain. </p><p>  In the difficult years of the Second World War, the camp was evacuated to Stalingrad, and later to the city of Belokurikha in the Altai Territory.  In 1944, after the liberation of Crimea from fascist occupation, Artek began to rebuild.  In 1945, the camp area increased to modern sizes. </p><p>  Since 1969, Artek is a camp in which there are 3 medical centers, 150 buildings for various purposes, the Artekfilm film studio, a school, a stadium, 3 swimming pools and several playgrounds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Prestigious award </h2><p>  Artek camp, vouchers for which in Soviet times were considered a prestigious bonus for special achievements in the study and public life of the country, received approximately 27,000 children annually.  The camp’s honored guests were personalities known to the whole world: Yashin Lev, Tereshkova Valentina, <span>Tal Mikhail,</span> Spock Benjamin, Ho Chi Minh, Togliatti Palmiro, Skoblikova Lydia, Schmidt Otto, Javaharlal Nehru, Khrushchev Nikita, Kekkonen Urho, Gandari Indira, Gandari Indira <span>, Brezhnev</span> Leonid, Jean-Bedel Bokassa.  In 1983, in July, American Samantha Smith arrived at Artek. </p><p>  For a long time "Artek" was the place of reception of delegations from the countries of near and far abroad. </p><h2>  The history of modern "Artek" </h2><p>  Artek is a camp owned by Ukraine until recently (March 2014).  In it children from poor families, invalids, orphans and gifted children had a rest free of charge or on a subsidized basis.  The full cost of living in Artek for three weeks was $ 1050-2150.  Recent years have been difficult for this children's center, it has ceased to be year-round, in the summer, its occupancy reached only 75%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now there are nine camps in Artek, some of which were planned to be reorganized into family pensions and youth centers.  In 2008, in September, it was announced that the famous children's camp would become the training base of the national Olympic team.  These plans were not destined to come true, but in 2009 Boris Artek’s general director said that due to funding problems the children’s center could be closed forever.  The camp really stopped working, and its leader went on a hunger strike in protest.  In 2009, a rally in defense of Artek was held in Moscow.  It was organized on the initiative of people who at one time had a rest in the camp. </p>

    <h2>  Structure </h2><p>  Artek is a camp with a complex and ramified structure that has changed with the development of this children's center.  At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Artek included five camps that could accommodate 10 pioneer squads: Cypress, Azure, Coastal, Gorny and Morskoy.  This structure has been preserved to this day, but now the former pioneer squads are called children's camps, and the coastal and mountain corps are called camp complexes.  In addition, Artek has two mountain camp sites: Krinichka and Dubrava. </p><h2>  Museums "Artek" </h2><p>  Many attractions are located on the territory of the Artek International Children's Center.  The camp has several museums.  The oldest of them - local history - has existed since 1936. </p><p>  Artek's guests are invariably attracted by the aerospace exhibition created on the initiative of Yuri Gagarin.  Here you can see the spacesuits of the best cosmonauts of the country - Leonov Alexei and Gagarin Yuri, and examine the existing equipment on which the first astronauts trained. </p><p>  In the “Artek Museum of History”, opened in 1975, you can get acquainted with the main stages of the camp’s development, see the gifts presented to the children’s center by various guests and delegations. </p><p>  The youngest museum in Artek is the Maritime Exhibition.  Its exposition will tell about the history of the Russian fleet. </p>

    <h2>  Historical sites </h2><p>  Before the revolution, the vast territory on which the Artek camp is located (photos you can see in this article) belonged to nobles of various classes.  The Suuk-Su Palace, erected in 1903, testifies to this.  This ancient building in 1937 was included in the Artek.  Now it hosts concerts and celebrations, organizes meetings and exhibitions. </p><p>  In the family crypt of the owners of the estate - Olga Solovyova and Vladimir Berezin - a landfill was built in Soviet times.  Now the burial place has been cleared, on its walls you can see a fresco depicting saints Vladimir and Olga. </p><p>  Many ancient architectural monuments have been preserved on the territory of Artek: the Eagle's Nest hotel, the building of the communications center, the greenhouse, the pump room and others.  They were erected at the turn of the XIX-XX centuries. </p><p>  Even older buildings are located in the eastern part of the camp.  Their names are associated with the names of the owners of local lands: Metalnikov, Wiener, Hartvis, Potemkin, Olizar.  Now the buildings continue to function as premises for economic and cultural needs. </p><p>  In the western part of Artek you can admire the ruins of the Genoese fortress protecting the local coast from the 11th to the 15th centuries.  In the cliff of Genenevez Kaya, on which the structure was erected, a tunnel has been preserved, punched to observe the sea. </p><h2>  Natural objects </h2><p>  Ayu-Dag, or Bear Mountain, is a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of the southern coast of Crimea.  The eastern border of Artek rests against it.  Thanks to this mountain, the camp is protected from strong winds blowing from the sea.  Ayu-Dag firmly entrenched in the minds of Artek residents as part of the culture and life of the famous camp.  The first inhabitants of Artek climbed this mountain and in the huge hollow of a hundred-year-old oak growing in the forests of Ayu-Dag left messages for the next shift.  Bear Mountain is dedicated to many songs and poems. </p><p>  In the books of Ilyina Elena, “Bear Mountain” and “Fourth Height”, it tells of the adventures of the Artek people during campaigns on this mountain.  The teddy bear - a symbolic designation of Ayu-Dag - became one of the talismans of the Artek camp, receiving it as a gift was a great honor for the honored guests of the camp.  The comic rite "Initiation to Artek" is still traditionally held on the slopes of the famous mountains. </p><p>  The surroundings of the Artek camp are decorated with two sea cliffs.  They are called "Adalars", and they are also a symbol of the <span>Crimean peninsula.</span>  Each unit at the end of the shift is traditionally photographed against the background of these rocks. </p><p>  Noteworthy are also “Chaliapin Rock” and “Pushkin Grotto”.  These remarkable objects are connected with the life and life of our two wonderful compatriots. </p>

    <h2>  Parks </h2><p>  The true decoration of the international children's center are parks.  Their significance was emphasized by the founder of the camp, Soloviev.  Park construction began even before the construction of a children's health resort in the tract "Artek".  The camp, the Crimean natural splendor of which is striking in its colorfulness and diversity, is decorated with various types of shrubs and trees.  Sequoia and pine, cedar and cypress, magnolia and oleander grow on the territory of Artek.  Here the olive grove rustles and the lilac blossoms fragrant.  Alleys and paths are woven into a fancy pattern, complemented by the strict silhouettes of stone stairs.  Artek parks are filled with bushes trimmed in the form of funny animals, they have real green labyrinths in which you can really get lost. </p><p>  In the "Square of Friendship", located on the territory of the camp "Lazurny", 48 cedars grow, planted by children from forty-eight countries.  They symbolize peace and friendship between peoples of different countries. </p><p>  Artek parks are monuments of landscape gardening art. </p><h2>  “Artek” in the art of cinema </h2><p>  Since its foundation, Artek has been actively used for filming various films.  Due to the abundance of sunny days in the year, the diverse exotic flora, the mountainous terrain, the picturesque seashore, the proximity of <span>the Gorky film studio</span> branch and the free children’s extras, the Crimean coast of Artek camp has become a favorite place for domestic directors.  The pictures were shot here: “Odyssey of Captain Blood”, “Empire of Pirates”, “Nebula of Andromeda”, “Hearts of Three”, “Matchmakers-4”, “Hello, Children!”, “Three”, “In Search of Captain Grant” and many others. </p>
