  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tools of primitive people. Occurrence, use</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The beginning of the history of the formation of human society was marked by that distant time when the first implements of primitive man's labor began to appear.  Our ancestors (Australopithecus), engaged in gathering, did not use any objects - neither unprocessed, nor processed. </p><h2>  Tools of <span>primitive people.</span>  Prerequisites for the occurrence <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the first implements of primitive man" class="if" height="201" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/316837.jpg" width="200"></div></h2><p>  According to a number of scientists, <span>humanoid apes</span> (human ancestors), who migrated to the ground from trees, used sticks and stones "processed" by nature in the process of survival and <span>struggle for existence</span> to protect them from predatory animals.  Subsequently, the items found began to be used for food extraction.  At the same time, at first they were used only as needed, and after use they were discarded.  But in the course of biological development and the continuous accumulation of experience, humanoid monkeys became more and more convinced that not always necessary tools can be easily found.  This, in turn, led to the idea that the objects needed by the ancestors should be somehow preserved.  In addition, there was a need to use more convenient items.  As a result, the instruments of labor of primitive people, instead of temporary ones, became permanent.  Along with this, the ancestors gradually began to accumulate and save the found objects. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Machined tools of primitive man <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tools of primitive man" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/316836.jpg" width="246"></div></h2><p>  In this or that situation, it was not always possible to find objects that would be convenient to break a nut, for example, or deliver an effective blow to the enemy, or dig a root or tuber in the ground.  Gradually, humanoid monkeys begin to understand the need to give the implements the necessary form.  So began to appear processed items.  It should be said that the processed implements of the labor of primitive people had little difference from the uncultivated ones found in nature. </p><p>  Over time, experience began to accumulate, the ancient ancestors began to make small hand chopped.  This subject has long been a universal tool of labor of primitive people and has been used in a wide variety of activities.  Among wooden objects, a digging stick, which had a pointed end, was widespread.  With its help, <span>ancient people</span> dug larvae, roots, tubers from the ground.  A little later a club and a club appeared.  For a long time, the first was used as a shock, and the second as a throwing weapon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="implements of primitive people" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/316835.jpg" width="305"></div>  These items were used during gathering, and during hunting, and to protect against predator attacks.  A little later, a primitive man makes a spear.  Gradually, it replaced the club and the club.  Together with the chopper, various tools made of stone appear and become quite common.  So, there are scrapers, chippers, knives, discs, spikes, tips for spears, cutters and more.

    <h2>  How were the tools of labor of primitive people made </h2><p>  Simple objects were holistic.  They were made from one stone or wooden piece.  Subsequently, composite products began to appear.  So, a flint, and then a bone tip, began to be attached to the end of the spear, using a leather belt as a retainer.  Wooden handles were attached to choppers.  Such tools became the prototype of a hoe, a hammer, an ax. </p>
