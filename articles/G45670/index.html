    <h2>  Design and ergonomics </h2><p>  Developing the appearance of the <span>Sony Alpha</span> A3500, the developers made the main emphasis on compactness and simplicity.  Be that as it may, the model looks very solid and strict.  On the case there are a number of control buttons and changing device parameters, as well as connectors for installing memory and connecting it to a computer.  The biggest drawback on the case is the lack of a rotary display, because there is quite enough space for its placement.  Most likely, this is due to the desire of the manufacturer to reduce the cost of the model.  On the back of the camera is a three-inch LCD screen.  It boasts a good picture and brightness, so viewing the created pictures on it is quite nice.  Due to its large dimensions, the camera cannot be compactly hidden.  Despite this, thanks to the handle in his hands, he lies comfortably and does not slip out.  Convenience is noted in many customer reviews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony alpha a3500 camera" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/969606.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The Sony Alpha A3500 digital camera has an Exmor HD CMOS sensor with a resolution of 20.1 megapixels.  It allows you to not only create high-quality images, but also record videos in Full-HD format.  In addition, thanks to such a matrix, sensitivity also increases.  In other words, the amount of noise is reduced, so the picture quality does not suffer even in low light conditions.  The device is also equipped with a fairly fast and advanced Bionz processor, which provides online image processing. </p><h2>  Lens </h2><p>  Interchangeable optics is considered one of the key features of the Sony Alpha A3500.  The responses of the device owners in most cases characterize the lens that comes in the standard kit, which was developed specifically for this model, as very mediocre, and at the same time universal.  With its help, you can easily make good snapshots and panoramic pictures or portraits.  There is a ‚Äúplus‚Äù to this, because the camera provides the user with great freedom for creativity, since currently a wide range of interchangeable lenses from Sony and Carl Zeiss are on the market. </p>

    <h2>  Photo quality </h2><p>  The Sony Alpha A3500 camera provides the ability to create photographs in both amateur (JPEG) and professional format (RAW).  The only unpleasant feature in user reviews is that in the second case it takes about twice as much time.  The stationary memory in the camera is enough to accommodate no more than five pictures, so you need to purchase additional media (cards with a capacity of 32 GB are enough for about one thousand photos).  The resulting images as a whole can be called clear, and the objects are well drawn.  In the event of such a need, the user can independently achieve the effect of a blurred background.  As noted above, the low noise level and high sensitivity when shooting in a variety of situations were the result of the use of a large matrix in the model.  At night, the pictures are also worthy.  The developers managed to achieve this largely due to the powerful flash in combination with ISO, the maximum value of which is 12800. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony alpha a3500 reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/969607.jpg" width="600"></div>

Their maximum resolution is 1920 √ó 1080 pixels.  You can create video in several modes.  To start recording directly, just click on the ‚ÄúMovie‚Äù button on the case, after which the device will immediately start shooting in Full HD format.  Due to the fast focusing, even moving objects are constantly in the frame.  The video is accompanied by stereo sound, and the picture can be zoomed in and out directly during the shooting process. </p><h2>  Work with the device </h2><p>  Thanks to the presence of an electronic viewfinder, which completely covers the frame, there are no problems with cropping using this device.  It also displays all kinds of useful information that will help the user in this.  Any changes in <span>white balance</span> or composition on the Sony Alpha A3500 can be viewed instantly, which greatly simplifies image composition.  Fifteen modes are provided for image processing, allowing you to create many interesting and original effects. </p>

    <h2>  Some other interesting features </h2><p>  The device implements proprietary technology of the manufacturer Triluminos Color.  Its essence lies in the fact that the user can view the footage on any TV with the appropriate screen in rich, natural colors. </p><p>  Very well, many device owners respond to the Clear Image Zoom feature.  It is recommended to activate it if necessary, as close as possible to the subject.  If the image is doubled, any defects or distortions in the image will be invisible at all. </p><p>  Stunning results in almost any environment, including poor lighting, can be achieved with Auto ISO.  This is also facilitated by some other technologies (for example, noise reduction of a specific image area), which previously successfully passed tests on modifications of the Alpha A-99 from the same manufacturer. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the Sony Alpha A3500 camera, the cost of which in domestic equipment stores is about 15 thousand rubles, is almost an ideal solution for that kind of money.  At the same time, the fact that the standard lens is included in the indicated price is noted in the customer reviews.  The camera is perfect for people who need a reliable device with interchangeable lenses that can shoot in professional RAW format and create high-quality videos.  The reviews also note that it has its drawbacks, which are mainly associated with the desire of developers to save money and make the model as accessible as possible.  Be that as it may, novice and semi-professional photographers are unlikely to pay attention to them. </p>
