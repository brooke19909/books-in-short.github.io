    <p>  Since the opinion of people who have already been here is the best characteristic of the complex, let's discuss the reviews of the Malecon Hotel (Adler).  I want to start from the location of the hotel, which has several advantages.  On the one hand, the hotel is located on a quiet street (this is the second line from the sea), but on the other hand, there is a stone's throw to the promenade.  Around there are cafes and shops, but at the same time the hotel is quiet and calm.  There is absolutely no this fuss inherent in crowded places.  At night, you can relax peacefully, music does not rattle here until the morning, as in first-line hotels.  This is a very significant plus of the complex.  Therefore, families with children can safely come here.  If you want to take a walk and relax on the promenade in the evening, then there is no problem.  Reaching the coast is easy.  The sound of noise from a neighboring street does not reach the hotel at all. </p><p>  I would also like to emphasize that, in the opinion of people, a very decent contingent is resting in the hotel.  Here you will not see violent companies, mainly couples with children, youth. </p><p>  The hotel area is closed, outsiders are not allowed here, which is very good, you can not worry about children in the yard.  In addition, there is a private guard, working around the clock, everywhere there are surveillance cameras.  Perhaps such measures are superfluous, but you feel order in everything.  It is very disposable. </p><h2>  Quality of service </h2><p>  What distinguishes the hotel from the total mass of such establishments in Adler is its excellent staff.  According to vacationers, workers are very courteous.  They always answer all questions with a smile and are ready to help, even if it is not in their competence.  The attendants do their job well, but they are neither audible nor visible.  If any problems arise, the administration tries to solve everything right away.  Such care for vacationers is very pleasant. </p><p>  Housekeeping is provided daily.  Towels are also changed every day.  Gels, shampoos, soaps are updated every morning.  In general, the rooms are all clean and tidy.  The furniture is new, it has not yet been broken.  The bathroom equipment is especially pleasing.  There are all accessories and cosmetics, as well as a bathrobe and slippers.  As a rule, even in five-star hotels there are not always such things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malecon hotel 3 adler reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1420933.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Check in the rooms is very fast, the reception works smoothly. </p><h2>  Food and Beach Reviews </h2><p>  The food at the hotel is very good.  Breakfast is included.  Lunch and dinner are available at the restaurant.  They cook tasty and varied, but at the same time they are very pleased with the prices.  Meals are quite cheap. </p><p>  The hotel has a small pool that saves the situation if there is a storm at sea.  As for the beach, an excellent option is a pass to the territory of the neighboring sanatorium.  The clean coast, the sun, warm water and sand make the stay simply unique.  On the beach you can enjoy water activities.  For a change, you can try other places on the coast, perhaps you will find something more interesting for yourself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malecon Adler Hotel Photos" class="if" height="254" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1420937.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <p>  A good option for a healthy stay is to visit the spa next door.  A vacation will be unique if you pay yourself a little attention, enjoying the magical procedures, after which you will feel an incredible surge of vitality and energy.  Unfortunately, such services can not be obtained at the hotel, however, such treatment programs are available in the neighboring complex, where guests from Malecon are always welcome. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Malekon Hotel (Adler), the photo of which we provide in the article, is made in an interesting style.  The interior <span>design of the hall is</span> initially very impressive.  The building itself is small and compact, the courtyard also has a modest size, but at the same time everything is so well-groomed that you unwittingly tune in to rest.  The hotel has everything you need for a good vacation.  Not far from the complex is the city market and <span>large shopping centers.</span>  Nearby are many shops, there are ATMs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malecon Hotel Adler Address" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1420951.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <p>  Pleased with the presence of balconies in the rooms, since it is difficult to do without them.  Some apartments have windows overlooking the private sector, but this is not critical.  But in the evening it‚Äôs quiet and calm around. </p><p>  For a quiet family vacation, you simply can‚Äôt find a better place, especially since the hotel accepts even the smallest children.  But staying in a complex with animals is prohibited. </p><h2>  Natural beauty </h2><p>  Adler district is a very special place, there is nothing to even compare it with.  No matter what time of year you come here, you will be struck by the abundance of greenery.  It is not just that the Black Sea coast is called the place of eternal spring.  The local climate is due to the presence of mountains that protect the coast from the strong influence of northerly winds.  The sea also has its influence, the warmth of which softens the winter.  In addition, the area is rich in famous healing mud and mineral waters, therefore in Adler they not only relax, but also improve their health.  According to scientists, the diversity and richness of natural and climatic conditions makes this area unique.  There are not many similar places on earth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malecon hotel adler reviews" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1420947.jpg" width="464"></div>

    <p>  Resting in Adler, you can rise high from the sea into the mountains and then fully see how different natural zones will change before you.  It is simply amazing when you can observe such an unusual phenomenon in one small region.  The territory of the Adler region stretches from the Black Sea itself to the snow of the Caucasian ridge. </p><p>  Adler has now become a modern resort city, where you can see not only natural beauty, but also Olympic attractions. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Is it possible to recommend "Malecon" (3 * hotel, Adler) to vacationers?  Reviews of tourists confirm the high level of service and food.  This means that the hotel can be a great place to spend a vacation with young children.  And the sea and the sun will make the rest wonderful. </p>
