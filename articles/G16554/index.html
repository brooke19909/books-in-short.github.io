    <h2>  Briefly about the city </h2><p>  In the northwestern part of the Krasnodar Territory, the small town of Primorsko-Akhtarsk is located.  The map of this settlement clearly shows that it is located on the shore of the Gulf of Akhtars.  This city is a climatic resort.  There are mineral and hydrogen sulfide springs, as well as healing mud.  Currently, about 32,000 people live in Primorsko-Akhtarsk.  The status of the city was obtained in 1949.  The territory of the settlement covers an area of ​​almost 19 square meters.  km </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As mentioned above, the main areas of the economy are fishing, processing and breeding of underwater vertebrates.  A few years ago, the tourism business began to develop rapidly, so recreation centers and sanatoriums began to be massively built on the coast.  Currently, the city operates a flour mill, pasta factory and dairy plant.  However, we can say that these industries are in decline, so they practically do not affect the environment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Primorsko Akhtarsk rest prices" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1417758.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  There is only one centralized beach in the city.  It has a fairly large size.  Therefore, even in the midst of the season there is no flea market.  The length of the equipped area for a beach holiday is almost 1 km.  It is 30 meters wide. The beach is covered mainly with sand with a small percentage of pebbles, there are places with shell rock.  Depth is ideal for people who cannot swim.  For 30 meters from the coast, the water does not rise above a meter.  That is why many families with young children choose Primorsko-Akhtarsk.  Rest in the summer season is very comfortable, as sea water resembles fresh milk. </p><p>  The infrastructure on the beach is well developed.  For entertainment, there are water slides, deck chairs, umbrellas.  For active pastime you can rent scooters and catamarans, as well as ride a banana.  There are numerous cafes and kiosks selling souvenirs around the beach.  Near the coast, hotels, entertainment complexes and restaurants have been built.  If you walk along the coast, you can find cozy wild beaches, though with a muddy bottom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  Everyone who wants to take a break from the bustle of the city needs to choose Primorsko-Akhtarsk.  Leisure (prices compared to other resorts are quite low) is ideal for both young people and those over 40. Tourists can stay in coastal hotels, <span>recreation centers</span> and in the private sector.  Locals offer to rent houses or rooms.
