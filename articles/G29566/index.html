Cost of services</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cost is an important indicator, in monetary terms, reflecting the actual costs of production, the provision of services and the implementation of the final result.  Using the cost price, you can calculate the unit price of a product.  The indicator is formed in the context of a specific production and reflects individual expenses, technological conditions.  Each industry has its own well-established calculation example.  The cost price of the service will make it possible to make a more accurate impression of the importance of the indicator for the economic justification of efficiency, determining profitability. </p><h2>  Cost indicator in planning and cost reduction </h2><p>  To expand the scope of production, increase payments to engineering and technical personnel and workers, it is very important to save money.  The result is a significant reduction in production costs, which affects the increase in savings to increase production capacity and increase the welfare of employees. </p>

    <p>  You can not overestimate the role of accounting, which produces at a certain stage the calculation of production.  A special methodology for calculating the cost of services will make it possible to take timely care of the introduction of appropriate measures to reduce production costs, to identify inefficient and inappropriate use of material resources. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cost types </h2><p>  When planning and conducting cost analysis for the production of various types of final products or services, estimated cost indicators are used: </p><ul><li>  planned; </li><li>  normative; </li><li>  actual. </li></ul><p>  The target is calculated based on projected output volumes, and economic norms and rules apply.

    <p>  Actual reporting indicators are identified on the basis of accounting information after the end of the reporting period and at the end of the production cycle, as the calculation example determines.  The cost of the service includes actual expenses for the release of goods or work performed.  It is this <span>type of cost that</span> is the basis when conducting an economic <span>audit, planning</span> future short or long periods of production. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Costing </h2><p>  Under the calculation refers to the interaction of the selected techniques and methods that allow you to calculate the cost per unit of goods, services or work.  Costing is a calculation of the cost of a service.  An example of its compilation allows you to show how to get the price of many independent accounting objects.  Costing is done for the monetary value of all the components of general accounting at the enterprise. </p><p>  Costing is the basis for calculating unit prices, taking into account the costs of its production.  At each enterprise, based on the specifics of production, units of goods are subject to calculation.  It can be 1 piece, 1 meter, sometimes tens or hundreds of parts are taken as a unit if they are produced in one cycle. </p><h2>  Types of Costing Articles </h2><p>  Each specific costing reflects the characteristics of production, but common in all cases are certain items for which the cost of various services is calculated: </p><ul><li>  materials, raw materials, components, fasteners; </li><li>  fuel and energy resources used in the performance of the technological cycle; </li><li>  the size of the wages of workers in the production of workers; </li><li>  payroll taxes of production workers; </li><li>  expenses for the organization of general production; </li><li>  other production costs; </li><li>  private and commercial expenses. </li></ul><h2>  Costing Object </h2><p>  Using the calculation, the price of the service is determined, as the calculation example shows.  The cost of services is calculated depending on the actual price of a selected product.  In this case, not only the cost of the final product is determined, but also the costs of the initial, intermediate cycles, as well as technological phases can be calculated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

In this order, the cost of the service is calculated.  Example - Excel is an electronic calculation program that is the best suited for determining the cost of a unit of production. </p><p>  The return of production waste in cash is calculated as a percentage of the total amount of used materials and components.  The number of percent is determined by the economic justification of production for previous periods.  To find out the amount of the cost of paying an additional salary, they take the basic salary and calculate the percentage (for a salary of more than 200 thousand rubles, the required amount will be 10%, less than 200 000 will raise the amount to 15%). </p>

    <p>  When calculating salary accruals, the additional 10% introduced from 2015 is not taken into account.  30% of the total amount of the additional and basic salary is included.  Maintenance of production equipment is considered at a rate of 5% of the basic wage.  The amount of <span>general business expenses</span> is 9% of the average salary.  General production indicators of expenses are taken in the amount of 18% of the amount (25% of the main salary and 75% of the additional). </p><p>  The production cost is calculated in the amount of the above costs and charges, only the amount of waste returned to the warehouse is taken from it. </p><p>  Non-production costs are considered to be 3% of the cost of production.  An addition to the cost of the costs incurred is the cost of services.  The calculation formula will be incomplete if the profit determined as a percentage of the total cost is not taken into account.  To calculate the wholesale price, the manufacturer‚Äôs profit and total cost are added up, VAT is determined from the obtained indicator. </p><h2>  Calculation of the cost of transport services </h2><p>  In order to profitably use the services of a transport company or company, the employing company needs to have information about the cost of 1 machine-hour of the mechanism. </p>

    <p>  This indicator ultimately determines the cost of services.  The calculation formula takes into account the following criteria: </p><ul><li>  the cost of transport when setting it on the balance; </li><li>  the amount of deductions for depreciation of the mechanism; </li><li>  expenses for scheduled and sudden repairs, maintenance and diagnostics; </li><li>  the cost of lubricants and fuel materials; </li><li>  the salary of the driver or driver, taking into account the required contributions; </li><li>  amount of overhead. </li></ul><h2>  Example of calculating the cost of one machine hour </h2><p>  Next, the cost of a machine-hour is calculated and an example of calculation is given.  The cost of services is defined as follows: </p><ul><li>  the initial cost of a truck crane is 9.9 million rubles; </li><li>  period of use - 59 months; </li><li>  the average number of working hours per month is 164; </li><li>  approved maintenance cost rate - 20%; </li><li>  fuel consumption for 1 machine hour - 13.9 l; </li><li>  tariff rate for payment of work - 145 rubles per hour; </li><li>  the price of 1 liter of fuel and lubricants - 35.0 rubles; </li><li>  rate per 100 materials - 2.1 l of lubricant; </li><li>  lubricant price - 155.6 rubles; </li><li>  overhead costs - 90% of the salary fund. </li></ul><p>  The cost of fuel and lubricants is calculated at the indicated norms and prices, the amount of payment at the rates and overhead costs are added.  The amount received is divided by the hours worked to determine the cost of a machine-hour. </p><h2>  Estimated cost of bath services </h2><p>  The calculation of the cost of bath services is made on the example of one institution, which houses 45 visitors.  The planned customer arrival per year is calculated from the number of 5,600 people.  <span>Direct costs</span> include a salary of 825.2 thousand rubles and accrual to the payment fund - 249 000, which in total will amount to 1074.2 thousand. </p><h2>  The composition of the workshop bath costs </h2><p>  To determine the amount of additional costs for the maintenance of the shop take (in thousands of rubles): </p><ul><li>  fuel (fuel oil) at 1100; </li><li>  water at 17.5; </li><li>  electricity consumed by 119.4; </li><li>  payment of sewage by 15.2; </li><li>  general business expenses by 101.2; </li><li>  labor protection measures - 14.2. </li></ul><p>  The total amount is 1367.5 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  This is an estimate of the cost of the service.  An example of the calculation will continue with the fact that direct and workshop expenses are added up, and the cost of funds for maintaining the bathhouse per year is 2441.7 thousand rubles.  Approximately according to this scheme, the cost of hairdressing services is calculated, an example of which consists of the same cost items as for a bath. </p><h2>  Cost of medical facilities </h2><p>  The technology used to calculate the cost of medical services, using the example of simple treatment in an outpatient clinic, is given below.  To do this, use the standard prevailing concepts, namely: the time of the procedure, the number of health workers, their qualifications, financial costs for the necessary medicines.  The cost of a simple service in the medical industry is determined by the addition of: </p><ul><li>  salary of a medical worker per one procedure; </li><li>  tax charges for this amount; </li><li>  direct costs for the provision of services (medicines, equipment, dressings); </li><li>  the amount of overhead received calculated according to the approved methodology. </li></ul><p>  In order to calculate the cost of medical services as an example of complex treatment, it is necessary to follow a certain procedure.  First of all, the obtained costs of simple procedures that are part of a complex treatment are added up, and a separate calculation is made for each of them. </p>

    <p>  The determination of the cost of a whole set is calculated as a completed case of treatment.  For inpatient hospitals, this cured case is a cured patient.  Outpatient facilities and clinics provide various services (examination, procedures, massage, injection course, physiotherapy analyzes, etc.). </p><p>  Sometimes it is necessary to calculate the cost of a whole complex of services, which include several complex and simple procedures.  In this case, the calculation takes into account the cost of each service separately, then they are added. </p><p>  In conclusion, it is worth saying that the calculation of the cost of services of any institution or manufacturing enterprise is carried out without fail by accounting staff.  In connection with an increase or decrease in the market value of materials, a change in the procedure for payroll or taxation conditions, the calculation should be carried out taking into account new data.  This is necessary so that the company can clearly determine the profitability of its work, and customers or buyers receive a reasonable cost of the service rendered to them or the purchased goods. </p>
