Magnificent parks with many winding paths, blissful meadows inviting to lie down on their silky grass cover, majestic castles that look like a wedding cake or tremble reminiscent of medieval dungeons - all this has made the region a place of pilgrimage for millions of tourists.  A secluded location contributed to the flowering of not only nature but also art.  Leonardo da Vinci, the titan of the Renaissance, created here, staged his plays Moliere, searched for subjects and surroundings for A. Dumas novels.  Today, the Loire Valley is one of the few places where you can look into the shy face of real France.  The crowded Paris attacked by tourists has long lost its true French charm.  Only in such a slightly naive, patriarchal province is the charm of the grassing nation still preserved. </p>

    <h2>  The Untouched Valley of the Loire (France): Promised Land </h2><p>  Geographically, this region is located in the very middle of the country.  The impenetrable thickets of the forest and the shallow depth of the Loire River, too shallow for ships, sheltered it from the wars that torn the country in the Middle Ages.  The most famous and large-scale battle took place near the walls of Orleans, glorifying the heroic Joan of Arc.  Perhaps this is why the Loire Valley has been preserved in its medieval beauty.  Time seems to stop here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to the fact that in close proximity to the region is Paris, the Loire Valley was the focus of aristocratic life.  Literally at every step you can meet at least a small, but a real castle.  According to rough estimates, there are only about three hundred of them.  Royally luxurious and simplest, the castles of the Loire Valley make this land look like a fabulous country. </p><h2>  Outpost Castle Amboise </h2><p>  Located at the crossing of the <span>Loire, the castle of</span> Amboise was of great strategic importance.  This is a real military fortress with many towers, massive gates and impregnable thick walls.  At the same time, thanks to the harmonious combination of Gothic and Renaissance elements, this castle is one of the most beautiful buildings in France.  Leonardo da Vinci is buried in his chapel, decorated with elaborate carved bas-reliefs and colorful stained-glass windows. </p>

    <h2>  Chambord Castle Maze </h2><p>  This is one of the most famous structures that the Loire Valley is rich in.  Photos of this castle most often adorn guides to the main attractions of the region.  The architect of this eccentric building was Domenico de Cortona.  According to rumors, Leonardo da Vinci was also involved in its creation.  Construction cost a lot to the treasury, but King <span>Francis I</span> did not stop even when it was completely empty, ordering gold to be melted by its subjects.  It can easily get lost in it, so intricately and exquisitely its internal structure: 426 rooms, 77 stairs, 282 fireplaces.  This ingenious architectural decision was made so that numerous minions could not collide with each other, flanching from the king‚Äôs bedroom into their own.  Around the castle is a magnificent park, in which Louis XIV was so fond of walking.  Since 1981, Chambord has been protected by UNESCO. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Chenonceau - the abode of the beautiful </h2><p>  This charming building was owned almost exclusively by women: queens, favorites and just the wives of wealthy landowners.  One of his most famous mistresses was the beloved of King Diane de Poitiers.  It was she who ordered the bridge over the river to be attached to him, because of which it seems that the castle is floating above the water.  Intellectual receptions were often held here, artists, writers, and musicians were welcomed.  This could not but leave its mark on the interior of the castle.  In its halls you can find a collection of paintings by Poussin, Rubens, as well as Flemish tapestries of the 16th century. </p>

    <h2>  Cheverny - Citadel of Family Values </h2><p>  Castles in the lands of the Loire Valley were literally designed for hunting fun.  One vivid example is Cheverny.  For many centuries, he passed from generation to generation of the same family.  True, the favorite of King Diane de Poitiers lived in it for some time, but the rest of the time it was carefully kept by descendants of an ancient family.  That is why the interiors and the building itself are so well preserved.  The original paintings of the times of <span>Louis XIII,</span> a trophy room with deer horns, a kennel with hundreds of hunting dogs - everything here remains as it was many centuries ago. </p>

    <h2>  The Revived Middle Ages: Lange Fortress </h2><p>  This castle is one of the earliest surviving witnesses of the French Middle Ages.  Its walls preserve the memory of legendary historical characters such as Richard the Lionheart and Fulk Black.  Here you can see firsthand what has long sunk into oblivion: Gothic chandeliers, a drawbridge (which still functions!), Tapestries of the XV-XVI centuries, ancient sculptures and paintings.  But the pearl among his exhibits is, of course, a wax composition depicting the marriage of Charles VIII and Anna Brittany.  This event marked the beginning of the union of Brittany and France. </p>

    <h2>  Fairytale Castle Usse </h2><p>  This castle is closely associated with literature.  According to legend, it was in him that Charles Perrault in his famous fairy tale imprisoned Sleeping Beauty.  In one of the towers, several wax figures are now installed illustrating the episodes from there.  Chateaubriand worked in it on his ‚ÄúGrave Notes‚Äù, and Prosper Merimet admired his beauty so much that he insisted that in 1861 Usse Castle be included in the state list of historical monuments in France. </p>

    <h2>  To help the traveler </h2><p>  The Loire Valley can be viewed from three cities: Blois, Tours and Angers.  A train ride from Paris takes only about an hour.  For further travel it is best to rent a car, as only this vehicle will fully enjoy the picturesque places.  If you like outdoor activities, use a bicycle, since all the conditions in the region have been created for this: a large number of bicycle paths will allow you to travel quite comfortably.  In some castles you can stay for the night if you do not have time to get to the hotel. </p><p>  The best time to visit the Loire Valley is considered to be early autumn - the main flow of tourists will already subside, and in cafes and restaurants there will already be wine, which is famous for this fertile land. </p><h2>  Wine break </h2><p>  The Loire Valley is famous not only for its castles and natural beauties, but also for its magnificent wines.  About a third of all French wine products are produced in this region.  The reason for special pride is the incredibly diverse palette of wines produced.  The variety of microclimates allowed the French to grow so many grape varieties here that an inexperienced sommelier can become agonized by just listing them.  The banks <span>of the Loire River</span> are divided into zones by type of soil, of which there are only four.  This is what affects the variety of berries.  In fact, all wines can conditionally be divided into three groups at the place of their production - Upper, Central and Lower Loire.  The grape of each territory has its own special aroma and taste. </p>

    <p>  There are not many places left on earth where you can enjoy the unspoilt beauty of the past.  Modern buildings are gradually replacing historical buildings, drowning their magnificent appearance with their typed architecture.  You can feel the breath of time by visiting the magnificent castles of the Loire Valley.  France is rightfully proud of this region, which has long become a mecca for tourists. </p>
