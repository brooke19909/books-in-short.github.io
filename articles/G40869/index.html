Magnitogorsk: climate, ecology, attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern people have long been accustomed to living in one area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city and going to work in another, but the inhabitants of Magnitogorsk have their own characteristics.  After all, they go daily to work in Asia, and in the evening they return home to Europe.  No matter how strange it may seem, but it really is.  And this is due to the fact that the city is located on both banks of the Ural River, and industry is mainly concentrated on the left (Asian) bank.  It is worth noting that Magnitogorsk is one of 12 cities that are simultaneously located in two parts of the world.  Local residents have long been not surprised at their constant movement from one mainland to another with the help of bridges, but city guests are unable to hide their amazement. </p>

    <h2>  City geography </h2><p>  Regardless of whether a person has heard or not about a city like Magnitogorsk, which region is this - few can say.  After all, attention, as a rule, focuses on other features of the city, of which there are many.  Many even think that the Magnitogorsk region exists, but this is not so. </p><p>  In fact, the city belongs to the Chelyabinsk region and is located in its southwestern part, near the border of Bashkiria.  370 square kilometers - this is exactly the area the city of Magnitogorsk occupies.  What area - you already know, it remains only to add that the city is administratively divided into 3 districts - Right-Bank, Leninsky and Ordzhonikidzevsky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate Magnitogorsk </h2><p>  In Magnitogorsk (as locals often call their city), the continental climate reigns.  The city has long, cool winters and relatively warm summer months.  In January, the average temperature here is -15 ¬∫, and in July - +19 ¬∫.  The annual rainfall is 377 mm. </p><h2>  Ecology of Magnitogorsk </h2><p>  An unfavorable environmental situation is the most acute problem that modern Magnitogorsk has encountered.  What area is it - today it is not the most relevant for the reason that people do not want to go there due to too high levels of pollution.  Scientists at the American Blacksmith Institute ranked this city among the cities in the world with the worst environmental conditions.  In the atmosphere, a concentration of formaldehyde was found that is 4 times higher than the maximum permissible rate.  There are many other harmful substances in the air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Magnitogorsk what area" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14056/532792.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The metallurgical plant is the main reason for such an unfavorable environmental situation, which distinguishes Magnitogorsk.  Chelyabinsk region does not have a single city so polluted than this.  Often over Magnitogorsk you can see a cap of gray-brown-raspberry dust and smell the pungent smell of hydrogen sulfide.  But, despite this drawback, the city has many interesting places to visit and objects worth seeing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The city was founded in 1743.  Initially, it was a fortress village located on the banks <span>of the Yaik River.</span>  As of 1759, this village consisted of 110 residential yards and 300 residents.  It was this year that iron ore deposits began to be developed.  The first ore processing plant called Beloretsky was built in 1874.  At that time, 2.5 thousand people worked on it.  Magnitogorsk, Navarinsky, Chernihiv, Yangelsky, Trebiat villages and the settlements of Verkhnekizilsky, Bobrykinsky, and the Bold in 1881 supplemented Magnitogorsk.  Probably no one remembers what region or region it was in those years, but it is known for sure that after the accession of the above mentioned settlements, the population increased to 10,000. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Magnitogorsk city which region" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14056/532795.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To establish a connection with Beloretsk in 1915, a railway was laid in Magnitogorsk.  1929 was the year of construction in the city of a metallurgical plant, which turned Magnitogorsk into the center of metallurgy in the country.  Since 1932, the first school, pedagogical institute, theater, runway, several tram lines, a cement plant and a music school appeared in the city.  In 1940, the population of the city amounted to 147 thousand inhabitants.  The 50s became a period of growth of Magnitogorsk - its area increased significantly, many new residential buildings were erected. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to get to Magnitogorsk </h2><p>  In the city itself there is no airport, it is in the distance, however, it is here that local residents and guests who want to visit Magnitogorsk fly there.  In what area this city is located, it is not necessary to know, however, it is important to familiarize yourself with the modes of transport with which you can get here and the schedule of its movement in advance.  Moreover, the local airport already belongs to the Republic of Bashkortostan, located only 14 km from Magnitogorsk.  You can get from the airport to the city using one of the city buses, and fly by plane from Orenburg, Moscow, Antalya, Mineralnye Vody. </p><p>  You can come to Magnitogorsk by train, but you will have to spend 36 hours on the road from Moscow.  As for the railway connection with such cities as Sibay, Ufa, Kartalov, Beloretsk and others, it is also excellent here. </p><h2>  City infrastructure </h2><p>  Today, the Magnitogorsk deposit is practically left without reserves, <span>Magnitnaya Mountain</span> is no longer there, however metallurgy plays a key role in the city‚Äôs economy.  The metallurgical capital of the country is what Magnitogorsk is often called.  Which region has the largest metallurgical plant is known not only in Russia, but also in many CIS countries. </p>
