How to get there</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A rare example of the oldest manor estates in the <span>Smolensk region</span> was the Griboedov Khmelita estate, made in the Baroque style.  She passed to the Griboedovs in the 17th century from the ancient Buinosov-Rostov clan.  This place has always possessed original Russian beauty, full of quiet provincial landscapes.  The history of the estate of Griboedov (Khmelity) is an interweaving of many fates of the Russian aristocracy of tsarist Russia.  She is full of intrigue and secrets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="boltologiy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Khmelit Manor" class="if uuid-2712605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2712605.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The village of Khmelita was first mentioned in historical documents in 1680.  It got its unusual name from the river flowing here with the name Khmelitka.  Its banks were full of hops, which looked picturesque.  These places were chosen by the nobility, which turned them into the Russian nest of the aristocracy.  The first owner of the estate is S. Griboedov, the great-grandfather of the famous writer.  He was the favorite of Princess Sophia, an actor of the court theater.  His son, Timothy, was the Dorogobuzh commander of Peter I. The manor building itself was built in the 18th century by F. A. Griboedov, he was the writer‚Äôs grandfather.  It was he who organized the richest collection of books, the theater.  Regular banquet feasts held here attracted the best representatives of the aristocracy of the Russian Empire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical events </h2><p>  The main house was built in 1753.  Six years later, the temple of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God was erected here.  Until 1812, the future playwright spent his childhood here. </p><p>  When Napoleon attacked, the French, led by Murat, stopped at the estate.  When the French were driven out, there were Russian partisans led by Major General I. M. Begichev. </p><p>  The miracle saved the estate from the horrors of the civil and World War II. </p><p>  Twenty years after these events, the estate was thoroughly reconstructed.  Features of the Empire style were added to the house, replacing the details left over from the Baroque. </p><p>  By the end of the 19th century, the estate was deprived of most of the furniture, in decline.  In 1894, it was acquired by Count Heiden.  He was engaged in the restoration of the ancient palace.  The paintings of V. Lisinov, Koro and many others were also stored in the Khmelite estate of Griboedov.  It was the richest collection of the time.  When the October Revolution came, it was completely transported. </p><h2>  Soviet time </h2><p>  In wartime, Khmelita, the estate of Griboedov in the Smolensk region, became a convenient place for the Nazis.  Here for a long time their headquarters was located.  Then there were fierce battles. </p><p>  And in 1954, other dramatic events took place on the estate.  Then the collective farmers made a bonfire right on the territory of the central building.  The fire spread to the entire estate.  The original appearance of the house, which was built by unknown masters a long time ago, has not been preserved. </p><p>  Subsequently, ancient buildings were destroyed.  The temple was disfigured, the outbuilding was demolished, the refectory and other buildings were destroyed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Nevertheless, the efforts of connoisseurs of antiquity of the <span>architect Baranovsky</span> and his apprentice Kulakov, the estate of Griboedov Khmelit was restored.  Already in the 1990s, they organized the Griboedov Museum here. </p><h2>  Impact on the writer </h2><p>  Only with the release of ‚ÄúWoe from Wit‚Äù, the witty comedy of Griboedov, did the local aristocracy recognize itself in the main characters of the comedy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sweet-georgia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander Griboedov" class="if uuid-2712630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2712630.jpg"></div><p>  Moreover, the author denounced the musty environment of the old nobility in very bold terms.  He spent his childhood, actually observing the complacency and boasting of aristocrats, which resulted in the features of Khlestakov, Khryumin, Famusov in the pages of his books.  They contain descriptions of relatives and secular acquaintances of his mother, who always tried to hide the constraint of their situation due to the messy ties of their husbands, former insignificants.  They tried to observe aristocratic customs, not lagging behind the high society. </p><h2>  Description of the estate of Griboedov Khmelity </h2><p>  The main attraction of this ancient and having seen a lot of tragedy place is the main house.  Baroque style is emphasized by risalits full of arched and triangular pediments.  Their combination with columns ascended on high pedestals and elegant applicative decorative elements is interesting.  Unusual and original was the installation of pair staircases here in the park facade.  The brick walls were plastered and were blue in color, while individual elements were bleached. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Almost every element is complemented by Baroque drawings, where emphasized castle stones, ears and earrings stand out.  This place has rightfully become the most important <span>attraction of the Smolensk region.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="magput.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Theatrical performance in Khmelit" class="if uuid-2712600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2712600.jpg"></div><p>  The preserved spirit of the old era allows holding cultural events in the style of Griboedov readings with actors and directors from various regions of Russia. </p><p>  Griboedov's friend, Lykoshin, described the estate as his most beloved family home.  From his handwritten memoirs, much also became known about the playwright‚Äôs childhood and youth, about his environment, reflected in the pages of his works.  From these memoirs it is known that Alexander was always distinguished by wit, joked over the whole district and even ‚Äúplagued his relatives‚Äù.  So there were Famusov, Chatsky, Repetilov.  Then he met with the Decembrists Yakushkin and Kakhovsky. </p><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  Already in the XXI century, a route for tourists was created around the estate of Griboedov Khmelity, which affects the estates of neighboring villages.  The owners of these estates were the prototypes of the playwright's works. </p><p>  The culture of the era described was considered a manor.  Along with generations of aristocrats, A. S. Griboedov himself was brought up on it. </p><p>  The population of these places of that period, however, was distinguished by a high cultural level and similarity to each other.  So, in the district to this day the remains of the estates of the Lykoshkins, Khomyakovs, Sheremetevs, Volkonskys have been preserved.  The history of their construction dates back to the 18th century.  Here lived and worked the mastermind of Slavophilism A. Khomyakov, the famous architect N. Benois. </p><p>  The buildings that have survived from that era also have high cultural value.  Some of them became the scene of the novel by L. Tolstoy "War and Peace." </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the village is the small homeland of Admiral Nakhimov.  Despite the fact that his house was not preserved, his museum is destroyed here on the site of the former oil mill.  The collected collection reflects the amazing size of the personality of the legendary naval commander. </p><p>  It's amazing how many sights and cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãyou can visit here at a time, just sitting on the swallow "Moscow-Vyazma".  The road from Moscow will not take more than 3 hours.  Getting here is easy and by car. </p><h2>  Bogoroditsky field </h2><p>  This place in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe estate of Griboedov Khmelita gained notoriety during the tragic events of World War II.  In the fall of 1941, in these fields during the "Vyazemsky Cauldron", a large-scale operation, the Soviet units fell into a real meat grinder.  They were surrounded by fascists, and the battles here were bloody.  With particular bitterness, Soviet fighters resisted Hitler's plans for a blitzkrieg. </p><p>  The commanders did not spare their lives.  So, when General Efremov, together with his army, fell into this environment on Vyazma, Stalin sent a plane for him.  The doom of all who ended up in the boiler was obvious.  But the general, refusing to escape and leave his fighters, sent the wounded on the plane.  Soon he was wounded in battle.  Avoiding captivity, the general shot himself at a time when the entire leadership of the 33rd army had already been killed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cont.ws" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="After the battles in the Vyazemsky boiler" class="if uuid-2712626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2712626.jpg"></div><p>  The Germans who found the remains of Efremov admired the qualities shown by the general.  He was buried by them with all honors.  There is information that the Wehrmacht officer said that in order to defeat the USSR, they need to fight like this Russian commander fought for his homeland. </p><p>  According to the memoirs of Marshal Zhukov, it was thanks to this resistance that the Germans' plans were frustrated at the cost of the lives of those people.  Later, a memorial was set up in memory of those events.  There are many burials, a stele and a walkway of memory.  Together, this is a kind of open-air museum. </p><h2>  How to get to the estate of Griboedov Khmelity </h2><p>  The estate is located in the <span>Smolensk region,</span> 260 kilometers from Moscow. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.40444399999999" data-lng="33.88999990000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/3/3/0/7330.png"></div><p>  In addition to the trip on the swallow "Moscow-Vyazma", the automobile route is also very popular.
