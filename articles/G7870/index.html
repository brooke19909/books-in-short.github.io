    <p>  Dissatisfied customers did not manage to move into this guest house at all.  Several vacationers are advised not to pre-book rooms here, but to purchase them upon availability.  The fact is that it happens quite regularly that people who pre-booked a room in Liliya were refused on arrival.  They were told that there were no available rooms, and tourists had to look for other places to stay. </p>
