    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  When buying this device in a store, be prepared that it will not weigh a little.  The Bork x500 bread machine weighs more than seven kilograms.  This is a large but elegant rectangular box made in a minimalist style.  Most of the device is coated with gray metal, which makes the furnace even more attractive. </p><p>  On top, two-thirds of the device is a lid, under which a baking dish is placed for two types of bread - round and brick.  Through the plastic window located in the center of the lid, you can look at the state of your masterpiece.  The Bork x500 bread machine is controlled by the commands entered on the small screen, which is located on the top left.  It has a small LCD display, six soft buttons and a list of possible programs. </p><p>  The front of the furnace is completely gray.  It has a convex inscription - the logo of the Bork brand.  It looks beautiful and not annoying.  On the same side is a handle for easy opening of the lid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The sides are made of heat-resistant black plastic.  On the right side are the engine cooling holes. </p>

    <h2>  Programs </h2><p>  Most of all, the Bork x500 bread maker reviews its programs.  The device has 12 pieces, including a mode of kneading dough, quick baking and a mode that allows you to cook gluten-free pastries.  Also, the stove allows you to cook French loaves, desserts and pastries.  Thanks to the metal blades, it is possible to cook jam and even condensed milk (although you still need to look for the recipe for it). </p><p>  Moreover, the Bork x500 bread machine allows you to adjust the color of the crust from light to roasted. </p>

    <h2>  Delayed start </h2><p>  This function is useful for those who want to get a loaf of fragrant bread for their return home, for example, from work.  It allows you to set a timer that will automatically start the execution of a given program after a certain time, a maximum of 24 hours.  Thanks to her, you can be sure that the bakery will be ready for a strictly scheduled date.  This is especially true for all kinds of sweet products like muffins, in the case of which it is desirable that they are hot at the time of serving. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Touch control panel </h2><p>  Another positive side of this bread maker is the presence of a touch panel through which baking programs are controlled.  What is convenient for such a performance?  Firstly, you can change the program at any time, even if your hands are dirty or wet.  Secondly, there is no wear of physical or mechanical elements, which positively affects the overall service life of the device. </p>

    <h2>  How to use two buckets </h2><p>  An interesting feature of this model is the presence of two different buckets - one in the form of a standard molded ‚Äúbrick‚Äù bread, and the other round.  Each of these buckets can be used to prepare specific items.  It is worth noting that, depending on what form is used, the properties of the baking program also change.  Therefore, we can safely say that in this model there are not 12, but all 24 programs, each of which is unique and suitable for a specific task. </p><h2>  Bread Service </h2><p>  Do not forget that the Bork X500 bread maker, the photo of which you see on this page, is as technically sophisticated as any other equipment in the kitchen, and therefore requires special care.  If you adhere to certain operating rules outlined in the instructions, you can significantly extend its service life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For example, the bucket should be washed thoroughly after each use of the bread machine.  This is necessary so that the bread does not burn during baking.  However, this operation not only allows you to make the finished product more palatable, but also maintains the durability of the non-stick coating on the mold.  It is worth noting that buying a new form for this model is not a cheap pleasure, so try to keep the factory buckets in good condition as long as possible. </p>

    <p>  The second tip also concerns the durability of the bucket.  A shaft passes through its bottom, on which a knife is put on to knead the dough.  In turn, this shaft rotates on the bearing, and the gland provides full isolation of the bucket.  If the load is too large, the shaft can rotate unevenly, at an angle, which will lead to rapid wear of the elements and, as a result, to the shaft wedge.  To avoid this, always observe the proportions indicated in the recipe, and do not overload the form with food.  If the mixture is too thick, this will contribute to the rapid failure of the shaft. </p><p>  If you notice that the shaft began to rotate tighter than usual, this is a sign that it is time to replace the form.  What is fraught with its further use?  For a while you can still bake fragrant bread, but at the same time the engine will work out of tune due to problems with the form.  As a result, it can fail, and the cost of repairs will increase significantly if it does not become completely unprofitable. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the bread maker </h2><p>  On the Internet, on many sites, the activity of users of such a technical kitchen assistant as the Bork X500 bread machine is noted.  Reviews are of the most varied nature.  Based on the study, we can highlight the main positive points that most users of this gadget like. </p><p>  1. High durability of the case structure.  The case itself is made of high quality metal and is a monolith, which inspires confidence in its strength.  This property was liked by many users due to the external attractiveness and practicality of operation. </p><p>  2. The presence of a touch panel, many buyers also described as a virtue.  The only nuance was the weak sensitivity to touch.  However, in general, the control module works well and copes with its functions. </p><p>  3. Good baking quality.  The main task of the Bork x500 bread machine, the characteristics of which are given above, is to provide a pleasant product that tastes good, and this model copes with it perfectly.  A large number of programs allows you to not only cook fragrant bread, but also to indulge yourself and your family with all kinds of desserts. </p><p>  4. The presence of two buckets of different shapes allows you to experiment with different recipes and bake beautiful bakery products. </p><p>  These are the main points that users with experience have noted as positive.  As you can see from them, the Bork x500 bread maker, the instruction for which is available on the manufacturer‚Äôs official website, completely copes with the main tasks.  However, she also has a number of unpleasant moments that did not pass by buyers. </p>

    <h2>  The negative sides of the model </h2><p>  Among the minuses noticed by users, the main one can be called a rather high cost.  Compared with competitors, the bread machine turned out to be much more expensive with the same parameters.  It is worth noting that this may be due to the presence of a metal case and a second bucket, but still this fact pushed many away from this model. </p><p>  The second negative aspect is the smell of plastic that occurs during cooking.  However, this problem does not appear to all users.  Therefore, we can assume that it is inherent only in a certain batch, which the manufacturer for unknown reasons did not want to withdraw, despite complaints. </p><p>  The third minus is a rather small resource of the form itself and the difficulty in finding a replacement.  The shaft begins to rotate tighter over time and subsequently completely wedges.  You can solve this problem either by completely replacing the mold, or in an unofficial service center where you can replace the sleeve, bearing and stuffing box.  However, both options are quite expensive, although restoration of the bucket will cost less than its full replacement. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The considered Bork X500 bread machine, the customer reviews of which we analyzed, is ideal for those who want to get an impressive device with a clearly durable case.  However, at the same time, it is not designed for permanent work, so it is better to use it no more often than 6-8 times a month, then it can last much longer. </p><p>  If you yourself are familiar with the technique, and the warranty is already over and you need to fix some kind of malfunction, then disassembling the Bork x500 bread machine will not be difficult for you, since the case is made as simple as possible. </p>
