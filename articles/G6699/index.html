    <p>  At the beginning of the game, a fee is paid for participating in the distribution - it is called ante.  Next, bargaining begins.  Everything is in the order of the queue, starting with the dealer, either bet or pass. </p><p>  After the bidding, players can change either several cards, or all 5 at the same time, 1 time.  Now the players are looking at how strong their combination is and whether it’s worth the risk.  If the player’s layout does not suit, he has the right to pass.  But when the combination is standing, you can raise the bet.  After negotiating bets, all cards open. </p><h2>  Card combinations </h2><p>  Consider all combinations of cards.  They go on seniority.  That alignment, which is least likely to come across, is the strongest, and defeats other players.  All other players give the pot to the winner. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  So, let's start with the simplest, absolutely without a winning combination - high card, and get to the piano flush. </p><ul><li>  High card.  All cards of different values ​​and suits.  There is one king, queen, or any one card older than the others that will participate in the draw. </li><li>  A pair.  Two cards of the same "weight" in draw poker.  That is, two dozen, for example. </li><li>  Two pairs.  There are already two cards of the same value on hand. </li><li>  Three (or Set).  These are 3 identical cards.  And 2 others are not taken into account.  This alignment is already “stronger” than the previous 2 pairs. </li><li>  Straight.  Five cards have a strictly consistent meaning, but a different suit.  Street poker can be different.  It can start from 9 and end with a king.  And this alignment is not the weakest.  Straight in poker comes across quite often, because there are several such combinations.  Therefore, many people bet a lot on seeing 3 or 4 cards in a row at the first deal. </li><li>  <span>Flash.</span>  <span>A flush</span> is called a suited layout.  All 5 cards must be of the same suit, but may be of different values. </li><li>  Full house.  So they call a combination of 3 cards of one value, and 2 - of another. </li><li>  Four (four).  When 4 cards of one "weight" out of 5 were collected in the hands. The oldest four are 4 aces.  The probability of such a “gift” of fate is already not so great out of 52 cards - 13 of the same suit, and in your hands - 5. Jokers in the casino do not use. </li><li>  A straight flush in poker cannot be “outplayed".  <span>This is a combination</span> of 5 cards in order, with the same suit.  But without an ace. </li><li>  Royal straight flush in poker is the oldest combination.  This street of the same suit necessarily starts at 10 and ends with an ace. </li></ul><p>  The more experience a player has, the better he already knows what combination you can count on after exchanging cards.  After all, those cards that are exchanged exit the game.  You can try to calculate the probabilities, but often in the game you have to rely on chance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Poker street </h2><p>  Since street is quite common, and there can be many combinations, we will dwell on its study in more detail.  There are different types of straight in poker, it all depends on the value of the cards and suit.  All of them need to be delimited by the players in order to know exactly which layout is leading in the “battle”.  Let's start with a simple one, that is, the least in value and strength: </p><ol><li>  Iron Street.  It starts with an ace, followed by 2, 3, 4 and five.  The weakest of all straights. </li><li>  Normal street.  Any 5 cards in sequence. </li><li>  Royal Street (or also called a straight flush).  A very rare card combination that has already been described. </li><li>  Royal straight flush.  There is no older combination. </li></ol>

    <p>  According to statistics, the likelihood of a combination like Royal Street Flush is very small.  It can fall into the hands of a person only 1 or 2 times in his whole life. </p><h2>  How to judge the same combination? </h2><p>  There are situations in poker when players have the same layouts on their hands.  But still, in order to somehow resolve disputes, there are rules that govern the outcome of the game.  The combination where the cards are older always wins. </p><p>  For example, if 2 players in poker have the same street combination, then the players will split the pot in half.  But if the players have a full house, the winner is the one with the top three.  If both have fours, then who has the dignity of these cards is older.  When exactly the same two pairs fall out, the player with the highest 5 card wins.  The same rules apply to any <span>kind of poker.</span> </p><h2>  Types of Poker </h2><p>  The more the popularity of the game grew, the more diverse the rules became, in each country they prefer their own kind of poker.  Now the most popular types of games are: </p><ol><li>  Texas Hold'em. </li><li>  Draw poker. </li><li>  Omaha. </li></ol><p>  American Texas Hold'em is the most common and gamble of all.  It is played in several rounds - there must be 4 rounds of bidding before the cards show up.  After each raising of bets, that is, after each round, 1 common card opens.  On hand 2 cards are issued.  The remaining cards are common. </p>

    <p>  All the same <span>combinations in poker: a combination of</span> straight, flush, full house - all existing in draw poker, are valid here.

    <p>  This means that if you have a good card, do not rush to bet a lot right away.  Otherwise, you can immediately lose.  First you need to find out which card fell to others.  And this can be done, judging by the intentions of the rivals.  The plans of other players may also be displayed on the face. </p><p>  Easily coping with the <span>basic strategy,</span> you can explore others and find the most beloved.  But you need to start learning poker with her, then the player immediately understands the psychological mood of the opponents.  Sitting down at the table, he evaluates whether it is possible to bluff with them, or play tough, or continue a wait-and-see strategy.  But before planning a strategy, it is important to know all the combinations as a keepsake.  You need to navigate without errors: what does the combination of four of a kind, which means straight in poker, flash, etc. </p>
