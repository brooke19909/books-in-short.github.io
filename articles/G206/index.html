    <h2>  First research </h2><p>  The island was discovered by French and English sailors in the fifties of the XIX century.  And 20 years later, the island was examined by a Russian expedition led by Captain Babkin.  But it cannot be said that at the beginning of the 19th century the island of Reineke was completely uninhabited.  Local historians believe that in ancient times the Manchus lived here, and later the Hunhuzes - the Manchu pirates.  And the island was then called differently.  Namely Sarbachou-tun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reinecke Island attracted special attention of the Russian authorities at the end of the 19th century.  Then he got a modern name.  What is known about the man after whom the island is named? </p><h2>  Michael Reinecke </h2><p>  The island discussed in today's article is Russian.  However, it is named after a person with a German surname.  This is not surprising, because before the revolution in our country, there were much more personalities of German and French origin in power than Russian. </p><p>  Michael Reinecke came from an old Saxon family.  Born in Liflyadn province, that is, in the Baltic states.  Educated in St. Petersburg.  In 1814, Mikhail Reineke entered the cadet corps, a year later became a midshipman. </p><p>  He devoted many years to the service and study of the open spaces of the sea.  For hydrographic surveys conducted in the early thirties, Reinecke was awarded a high salary, and in 1832 he was promoted to the rank of captain-lieutenant.  Mikhail Reineke studied the waters of the Baltic Sea for six years, but his biographers say nothing about the exploration of Peter the Great Bay. </p><p>  A scientist and naval officer passed away in 1851 in Frankfurt am Main, as director of the Hydrographic Department.  The island is named after him in 1862. </p>

    <h2>  Menard Enterprise </h2><p>  At the end of the 19th century, the island was leased to a Vladivostok merchant of French origin.  August Menard organized a dairy farm, a sika deer nursery, and the extraction of natural granite.  Things went well with the entrepreneur.  Over time, the farm and the nursery inherited the son of a merchant.  However, after the revolution, all this was nationalized.  However, Menard Jr. continued to work on the island and even wrote a small work based on his own experience of observing deer.  The book is called "Antler economy." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Menard, of course, did not have to do his favorite thing until the end of his days.  In 1937, he was arrested and executed as an enemy of the people.  The construction of the landfill began on the island.  The military exterminated most of the deer. </p>

    <h2>  Reineke Village </h2><p>  In the thirties, a fish factory was built on the island, in which about three thousand people worked.  Then, a village appeared with a school, a kindergarten, a hospital and a club.  The island was actively fishing for herring, flounder, crabs, scallops.  Algae were also harvested here, which served to prepare agar-agar. </p><p>  After the end of World War II, the island was inhabited mainly by captured Japanese.  It is noteworthy that they moved through the territory of Reynek quite freely.  The Japanese worked at the fish factory, in the quarries, fished, gathered mushrooms - they led a full-fledged lifestyle.  It was impossible to leave the island. </p><p>  The plant closed in the seventies.  The barbaric fishing of fish led to the fact that its stocks were significantly reduced.  Local residents were unemployed, they had to move to the mainland. </p><p>  From the building of the fish factory there were only ruins.  From the military training ground, which was founded in the early fifties, - the destroyed base, which tourists call the "Mummy Troll House".  Probably in honor of the founder of the famous group Ilya Lagutenko, who often visited here. </p>

    <h2>  Island flora </h2><p>  The nature here is virgin, wild.  The island attracts many tourists, especially in the summer.  Here, meadow flowers rhododendron and rose hips grow.  Steppe vegetation goes well with the red cliffs and the remains of a sunken ship, once thrown ashore by the waves.  This ship was called "Relight" and for many years served as a target for military bombing. </p>
