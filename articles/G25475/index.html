One of the most attractive countries for tourists remains a colorful and sophisticated Spain.  Today we will get acquainted with the southern part of the country - the Costa del Sol. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  In the very south of the country is a picturesque and sunny <span>coast.</span>  <span>Spain,</span> Costa del Sol - the region of the autonomous community of Andalusia, which also includes the settlements of Malaga, located on the coastline. </p><p>  The coast stretches as much as 300 km.  Sandy beaches, slightly diluted with cliffs, which sometimes approach the very edge of the Mediterranean Sea, have picturesque views and a pleasant atmosphere.  There are all conditions for a good and comfortable stay.  People with any income will be able to find a suitable option. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of the region is a high average annual temperature of +19 degrees Celsius.  But it is worth noting that the cold Atlantic current crosses coastal waters, which is why the water temperature is about 20 degrees above zero.  And only in the midst of summer, in July, it can warm up to 23. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the coast is quite warm and stable weather, 320 sunny days a year.  It has a longer swimming season than anywhere else in the country. </p><h2>  The capital of the coast </h2><p>  Malaga is a city and a municipal center, which is part of Andalusia.  The city is characterized by an amazing microclimate, which exists thanks to the rocks surrounding it.  There are so many sunny days that it seems as if it never rains. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  If you do not tolerate the heat, then it is worth remembering that in summer the average air temperature is +30, and the maximum can be higher than 40. In autumn and spring, the climate becomes milder and more pleasant.  In the evenings, when it becomes easier to breathe and you can relax from the beaches, it is worth visiting the historical part of the city.  Unfortunately, now it is not too large, and one day is enough to see all the sights. </p><p>  Tourists are lucky enough to see one of the oldest theaters, the history of which began in the 1st century BC.  e., and an amazing example of Arabian architecture is the Alcazaba Palace, built in the 9th century.  Walking through the labyrinth of narrow courtyards, you can see strange plants, amazing flowers and many fountains. </p><p>  There is everything to get acquainted with the culture of the country and find out what it is - Spain.  Costa del Sol offers a great opportunity to relax and learn a lot. </p><h2>  Torremolinos </h2><p>  In the early sixties there was a real tourist boom.  And the first to receive massive flows of people was Torremolinos due to its proximity to <span>the Malaga airport.</span>  But today, various tours (Costa del Sol, Spain) offer relaxation in this beautiful city.  Cozy hotels from three to four stars, located on the first line, are always ready to receive guests.  The proximity of the airport is not noticeable to residents - no noise, because all aircraft land from the other side. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you look from the sea on the coast of Torremolinos, you can visually divide it into 2 parts: eastern and western.  Between them lies a rock. </p><p>  If you prefer lively beaches, easy hustle and bustle, then Bahondillo will suit you, otherwise you will need Playamar not far from it.  It is quite calm and not too crowded here even at the very peak of the season.  It is worth noting that this place is perfect for families with children and people who do not differ in swimming skills.  The entrance to the water is quite gentle and long. </p><p>  Whichever option you choose, know: all the beaches are urban, so you do not need to pay for visiting them. </p>

    <h2>  Benalmadena </h2><p>  The next city after Torremolinos is located close enough - so much so that it is difficult to pinpoint the border.

Everything here is in order, always clean and comfortable. </p><p>  Many eminent people choose holidays in <span>Benalmadena (Spain,</span> Costa del Sol).
