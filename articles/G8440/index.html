But not everyone can clearly articulate what it is connected with and what it symbolizes by itself.  But the fact is that today the reconnaissance ship Vasily Tatishchev of the Russian Navy plows the ocean and often gets into the media.  But there is a reason why glorious designers chose this name.  And here is an ulterior motive!  And this man was outstanding, and for connoisseurs of history - a real symbol.  And the ship of the Baltic Fleet "Vasily Tatishchev" has no less extraordinary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vasily Tatishchev" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14483/1070793.jpg" width="524"></div>

    <h2>  What do we know about the ship? </h2><p>  The ship was built not so long ago, in the 80s of the twentieth century.  And today he is not even thirty years old, because he was launched in November 1987.  On the 27th, a shipbuilding shipyard in the city of Gdansk launched the communications ship SSV-231.  Almost a year later, the flag of the USSR was hoisted on this ship by order of the commander of the Twice Red Banner Baltic Fleet.  This was in the near future, "Vasily Tatishchev."  The ship with the collapse of the country of destination did not change, but in 1998, the command of the average reconnaissance ship concluded an agreement with the leadership of Kuibyshevazot JSC in the city of Tolyatti on patronage ties.  And that was a fateful decision.  Since two years later, the vessel was renamed to the SSV "Vasily Tatishchev" due to the persistence of the mayor of the city of Tolyatti, whose founder is considered to be this historical figure.  Having such a short history, the reconnaissance ship of the Baltic Fleet "Vasily Tatishchev" still managed to go on 22 campaigns along the route across the Atlantic Ocean, the Baltic and North, as well as the Mediterranean Sea.  According to public data, its "mileage" is 340 thousand <span>nautical miles.</span>  But the travel time is a total of only three years, since the ship's displacement is 3.4 tons, they will not be chased without need.  What else can "Vasily Tatishchev" surprise?  The ship is one of eight vessels built under the project 864 Meridian in the Soviet Union.  But to this day it is the crown of military shipbuilding, designed to receive any information through the interception of radio communications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reconnaissance ship Vasily Tatishchev" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14483/1067015.jpg" width="600"></div>

At all times, spies in this game provided very powerful help and sometimes played a decisive role.  In our computer age, electronic spies have replaced humans, and electronic intelligence systems have replaced embedded scouts.  Such systems are diverse - from the tiniest types of equipment to aircraft and ships.  Such a system for collecting intelligence is the Baltic Fleet reconnaissance ship Vasily Tatishchev.  Recently, the ship has shown itself most vividly in supporting aircraft and other Russian intelligence groups in Syria.  He left the Baltic Sea, his permanent place of residence, and according to some media sources was sent to the shores of Syria in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea.  The main task of the crew was to monitor the situation on the air not only of Syria, but also of the neighboring countries.  Apparently, territorial waters and the free zone were no exception.  The reconnaissance ship Vasily Tatishchev is not the first to leave the Baltic.  There is evidence that the <span>war in Yugoslavia was</span> also under the supervision of this scout.  Therefore, one can hardly believe that such a glorious and large ship travels from the Baltic Sea over long distances simply for pleasure or general informational purposes.  The ship is able to make up for the absence or loss of ground bases if their very active use is necessary.  Such constructions of engineering as the ship "Vasily Tatishchev" will always be impressive.  The photo below is absolutely not exclusive.  But when he saw him not in the Baltic latitudes, the whole world can only be wary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reconnaissance Ship of the Baltic Fleet Vasily Tatishchev" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14483/1067028.jpg" width="600"></div>

But these people embodied a real genius, were interested in various areas and left behind a huge amount of invaluable material that today, if not the whole institute, then the department can envy such a volume.  Along with the well-known name of M.V.  Lomonosov is also the personality of Vasily Nikitich Tatishchev.  He was, by type of activity, an official-administrator under Peter I. By education, he was an engineer.  But by the nature of his hobbies - historian, economist, geographer, enlightener, champion of printing and general education of the population. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tatishchev Vasily Nikitich contribution to history" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14483/1067044.jpg" width="220"></div>  Such a keen understanding of where and what is the future of the country, already at the beginning of the XVIII century, focused on important issues, which, unfortunately, have not yet begun to be addressed.  Yes, and Vasily Tatishchev sacrificed a lot.  But his contemporaries could not appreciate, could not but provoke his actions and make denunciations, could not appreciate the power and apply such advanced and ahead of time ideas.  Although it is with such personalities that progress in history begins.

Educated in Moscow, graduating from the Artillery and Engineering Schools.  He began his career under Peter I as a soldier, participating in the Northern War at the beginning of the 18th century.  At the end of the war, Tatishchev began to draw up geographical maps, being carried away for life both with history and geography.  Continuing his career in the civil service, Tatishchev receives a referral to the Urals as the manager of state-owned factories.  Then he headed the Coin Office for some time.  In addition, he was still the head of the Kalmyk and Orenburg commissions.  In total, public servants Vasily Tatishchev spent 42 years, ending his career in 1745, five years before his death.  Being removed from his post as governor of Astrakhan, Vasily Nikitich was exiled to the Boldino estate in the Moscow Region.  Here, in a calm atmosphere, he completes his ‚ÄúRussian History‚Äù, the materials for which he collected all his life.  But let's take it in order and in more detail. </p><h2>  Vasily Tatishchev.  Discoveries </h2><p>  Wherever a genius is and no matter what he does, his talent and creativity will always be embodied in deeds and actions.  So, having twice headed the Ural factories, an engineer by training both times tried to reorganize the extractive industry and launched large-scale projects.  It was far from Moscow from here, but it was necessary to resolve issues with it.  Delivery of correspondence at that time took many months, which in no way could satisfy an energetic and seriously minded figure.  Tatishchev developed and even began to implement a new type of mail, completely alien to Russia.  And the contribution of Vasily Tatishchev to the opening of schools and the organization of education for the general population simply cannot be overestimated.  He also manages to arrange fairs and almshouses.  In connection with his occupation, the plant manager could not but influence the creation of mining laws.  It is also being introduced into the development of new crafts.  As a senior manager, Vasily Tatishchev performs not only direct duties, but also assumes the functions of governor, judge and even governor.  Do you know who was the founder of Stavropol (now Togliatti), Yekaterinburg and Perm?  That's it - Vasily Nikitich Tatishchev. </p>

Deforestation was so barbaric, illiterate, cruel that over the next 50 years of such an attitude in the Urals there would simply not be a single tree.  And to restore such a forest without human help and in such a short time is simply impossible.  It can be seen that environmental problems have always followed the person and progress.  Perhaps the gratitude of the descendants for everything should be just such an indifferent and attentive person as Vasily Nikitich Tatishchev, who opened the eyes of officials and authorities to environmental problems as early as the XVIII century and developed a project for mining management.  In the duties of the chief, he put a paragraph on the need to conserve forests.  Moreover, according to the issued decree, deforestation in the vicinity of the newly emerged city of Yekaterinburg was strictly prohibited and punishable by death.  It is in this city that there is a unique monument where Peter I, the autocrat and the thunderstorm of Russian history, proudly rises hand in hand with his younger associate - Vasily Tatishchev.

    <h2>  Hobbies that have become science </h2><p>  Vasily Tatishchev did not forget about his hobbies in history and geography and directed to their development any opportunities that the life of an official and travel around the country provided him.  Any historical written sources, as well as the first Russian maps of the Urals and Siberia, an outstanding historian and cartographer collects.  And due to its capabilities, it makes copies of such materials and distributes them in a useful direction.  He sends out maps to surveyors to draw up new maps.  At the same time, it organizes a search for minerals, personally collects ore samples, forcing, among other things, to describe and make drawings of the deposits themselves.  The only wide flow of information allowed Tatishchev to collect extensive and diverse scientific material.  The organizer of this work was able to perpetuate and preserve countless information on Siberian geography and archeology, but at the same time on history, ethnography and even linguistics.  The scientist combined every business trip with scientific research, sometimes even scientific expeditions.  He studied the language, life and customs of the local population, nature and the environment, collecting entire collections of minerals and plants.  He carefully examined the Kungur cave and was interested in mineral springs.  With such a volume of work and with such organizational skills, few can compare. </p><h2>  Advanced thinking Tatishchev </h2><p>  Everyone knows that people who care about the future always think broadly and thoroughly.  Such personalities are always no longer concerned with the problem of <span>daily bread,</span> but with important and global issues.  Vasily Tatishchev, who opened the opportunity for understanding Siberia, fascinated by history and science, first of all thought about the descendants and their future.  Is it really great wisdom to understand that, developing science, production, construction, military affairs, we need specialists to implement and support all this?  And to instill the necessary qualities and raise people who know their job, you need from childhood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vasily Tatishchev. Discoveries" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14483/1070812.jpg" width="367"></div>  Already in the first years of his administration in the Urals, Tatishchev opened schools for teaching geometry and mining.  Schools were publicly accessible, but already required knowledge of literacy.  <span>In pursuance of</span> this, an obligation was assigned to zemstvo police officers.  So that they prepared in each settlement a room for the school, where clergymen could teach at least ten peasants reading and writing.  Later, a mining school was opened in Yekaterinburg, which allowed combining theoretical training with the practical application of knowledge at the plant.  This was an innovation even for Europe.  But even Peter the Great did not fully share this enlightenment approach with Tatishchev.

    <h2>  Relations Tatishchev and Peter I </h2><p>  Vasily Nikitich was a very emotional and unusual person.  He thought outside the box and quite broadly.  The autocrat listened to the original thoughts of his associate, but sometimes the scientist's judgments went beyond what was allowed.  Painfully they were free, and the minister of the tsar himself was not afraid to enter into an argument with the lord. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tatishchev Vasily Nikitich. Main works" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14483/1067026.jpg" width="200"></div>  Knowing the nature of Peter I, it was unlikely that he liked it.  So Vasily Tatishchev insisted, for example, that the opening of simple schools should be a priority in education.  After all, this is simply necessary for the preparation of first-stage students, in order to later have the opportunity and human resources to master science already at the Academy.  Because otherwise, there simply will not be anyone to teach when professors from Germany and Sweden arrive at the invitation of the king.  Then science will come to Russia to engage in itself, but there will simply be no one to teach.  Unfortunately, Peter I did not heed the advice of Tatishchev, and the situation in the future developed exactly that way.  The biography of Vasily Tatishchev, among other things, is also replete with ill-wishers.  There were many of them at the court.  They successfully whispered to the tsar about the misconduct of a distant Ural extraordinary official, which the culprit himself might not have suspected at all.  The breadth of the latter‚Äôs thoughts, idealism and integrity have always frightened opponents.  And how could one not be afraid of such transcendental fantasies, and even with such influence on the sovereign?  This explains the ongoing charges, harassment and litigation.  And although all this ended with Tatishchev‚Äôs excuse, he didn‚Äôt let him live and work calmly, constantly distracting from business and taking time.  But be that as it may, but Peter I still supported and encouraged the affairs of Tatishchev.

    <h2>  Tatishchev in Europe </h2><p>  The death of Peter I found Vasily Tatishchev in Sweden, where an executive official carried out the assignment of the king.  But after the change of power, our hero was left completely without support and without money, so that there was even something to return to his homeland for.  But Vasily Tatishchev was not particularly upset about this.  He got acquainted with the scientific elite of Sweden, read and corrected all articles about Russia in Gibner‚Äôs dictionary ‚ÄúLexicon ...‚Äù.  Scientific work did not stop at him for a minute.  <span>The Russian historian</span> wrote in Latin and published an article in Sweden about the mammoth bones found in the Kungur cave.  He closely interacted with academics, especially interested in the Swedish economy.  His interest was practical, so that later this knowledge could be used in Russia.  It was thanks to Tatishchev that the Swedish poetess Sophia Brenner wrote a poem about Peter I according to a short description of the king‚Äôs great works compiled by Tatishchev. </p><h2>  Retirement and the last years of life </h2><p>  Returning home, Vasily Tatishchev was no longer able to regain his former position and influence.  The Empress takes him all the time from place to place, each time moving away from the capital.  But in every new place Tatishchev successfully mastered and even began to implement the reforms of his sphere.  For example, in the Moscow Coin Office, he proposed a reform of the then Russian monetary system.  Later he was thrown to resolve conflicts with Kazakh tribes, Kalmyks, and even sent to the Bashkir rebellion.  And the denunciations continue to fly to the capital, and at the insistence of the Senate in 1745, the empress issued a decree on the dismissal of Tatishchev from his post, and also imposed a ban on him to come to St. Petersburg and leave her villages.  So Tatishchev, already weakened by disease, falls under house arrest and settles in his estate near Moscow.  But a true genius never calms down and does not despair.  Boldino becomes like a branch of the Academy of Sciences.  Until the last, Tatishchev Vasily Nikitich remained active and incorrigible.  The main works and achievements of this period were identified in the publication of the History of Russia, its own writing, as well as in preparation for the publication with the commentary of Tatishchev of the book ‚ÄúThe Judicial Book of Ivan the Terrible‚Äù. </p><p> In addition, the scientist‚Äôs notes on the eclipse of the Sun and Moon, a proposal for the publication of an alphabet with figures and inscriptions, as well as comments for correcting the Russian alphabet were submitted to the academy.  The scientist continues to reflect on tolerance, which often angered the highest circles of power.  The thinker also analyzes and makes his suggestions for improving the legislation of Russia, guided mainly by the belief that people tend to care only about themselves most of all, not remembering others.  And about the common good, it was not at all appropriate for ordinary people to worry.  Also, proposals and projects were made for the reformation of the economy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Contribution of Vasily Tatishchev" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14483/1070838.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Despite the vicissitudes of fate, Vasily Tatishchev never parted with optimism and vigorous activity.  Not receiving anything in return, he gives twice as much as was even required.  Never getting tired or complaining of anything.  But the career did not succeed, there was no family life as such, there were very few friends, and a host of enemies.  Like any other genius, Tatishchev surpassed his time.  But he did not dutifully wait, but acted as the instigator and passionate servant of everything that was completely not accepted by contemporaries, but as a result it became a reality.  Although Tatishchev himself did not see the fruits of his labors, but without him these achievements would have come to Russia even more late.  There would be more such people now and fewer sticks in their wheels. </p>
