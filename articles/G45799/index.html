But especially often, such thoughts are visited by those who have small children.  After all, kids are real inventors.  They are constantly in search of new discoveries.  For this reason, many mothers like to craft various crafts with their children.  For example, boys love to make funny little men out of acorns, and girls love rag dolls. </p><p>  But at some point, the needlewoman‚Äôs fantasy may run dry.  And then she will come to a standstill, perplexed to create something else interesting.  Well, mothers who are never fond of hand-made crafts may have no idea where to start. </p><p>  That is why in the article we offer a step-by-step master class, which will tell you in detail about how to sew a doll. </p><h2>  The most soulful doll </h2><p>  On the Internet, you can often find photos of interesting crafts with somewhat symbolic facial features.  They look very nice and good-natured, and are performed quite simply.  But most people appreciate them because such textile dolls are considered the guardians of the hearth, powerful amulets and favorite toys of many children.  They are called Tildas.  And a resident of Norway came up with them a little less than twenty years ago.  How to sew a doll with your own hands, we'll talk a little later.  In the meantime, find out what it is. </p><p>  To begin with, not only people are represented among Tilds, but also animals.  That is why many beginners write in reviews that they recommend starting mastering the skills with these dolls.  And this is not surprising, because you can not help falling in love with the Tilda doll.  If the reader doubts our words, he should take a look at the picture below.  Didn‚Äôt you want to sew the doll Tilda with your own hands? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="doll step by step" class="if uuid-2469963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2469963.jpg"></div><p>  Here is one of Tild.  It is completely made of fabric.  However, white material cannot be used.  After all, this product has a beautiful "tan."  Without which it will be the most ordinary doll. </p><p>  If the reader wants to know how to make a Tilda doll with his own hands, we suggest that he continue reading the article.  Therefore, as below we will answer all possible questions in detail. </p><h2>  Tilda doll at home </h2><p>  At the preparatory stage, it is necessary to take care of the tissues.  The best option would be a cut of cotton.  But you can replace it with calico or wool in some cases flax, fleece and flannel are acceptable.  We also need a pair of beads to indicate the eye.  Tilde‚Äôs hair can be made from knitting <span>threads,</span> felting <span>yarn</span> or you can find tressa in specialized stores - natural or artificial hair.  With the latter, of course, the doll looks incredibly elegant, but getting them is not easy.  And not every beginner can stick it.  Therefore, most experienced needlewomen mention in the reviews a special yarn that is designed specifically for Tild's hair.  You can buy it in handicraft shops. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thus, we fully understood what should be prepared in order to sew a doll with our own hands.  A pattern of the necessary details will be proposed next. </p><p>  In the meantime, one more important point should be clarified.  How to stuff Tilda and what material to make clothes for her.  Let's start in order. </p><p>  Experienced needlewomen in the reviews recommend stuffing the toy under study with a synthetic winterizer or holofiber.  Both materials can be bought, or can be taken from an old blanket or an unnecessary pillow.  But you can dress a doll in clothes made of any available material.  How to sew clothes for a doll?  Pretty simple!  But the most important rule is the following nuance - the fabric must certainly be monophonic, and if with a picture, it must be small so that it does not distract attention from Tilda herself. </p><h2>  How to color a craft </h2><p>  We already mentioned earlier: the described doll has a special sign - a beautiful chocolate tan.  And experienced needlewomen know how to achieve it.  But newcomers very often rush to the shops, unsuccessfully trying to find material of a suitable color.  Therefore, in the presented master class for beginners ‚ÄúHow to sew a doll‚Äù, we are obliged to touch on this topic. </p><p>  In order to make a real Tilda, you must: </p><ul><li>  to purchase a piece of snow-white fabric in the department of goods for needlework; </li><li>  then go to the grocery store and find the cheapest instant coffee there (note that the price is a very important indicator: the lower it is, the more stable the color can be achieved); </li><li>  now we return home and pour one liter of water into the basin (the temperature should be quite hot so that the coffee dissolves better); </li><li>  add one tablespoon of ordinary salt to it; </li><li>  and then pour two and a half tablespoons of coffee; </li><li>  mix everything well, achieving complete dissolution of both components; </li><li>  then we lower the fabric into the prepared solution: it is very important that it is completely in the water; </li><li>  in any case, we do not leave the material, but constantly turn it over so that the color lies evenly, we continue similar manipulations for fifteen to twenty minutes (depending on the desired saturation of the doll‚Äôs skin tone); </li><li>  after which we pull out the fabric and rinse it in cold water; </li><li>  wring out, not much twisting; </li><li>  and hang to dry, attaching clothespins to the edge, but only slightly. </li></ul><h2>  Tilda Pattern </h2><p>  How to sew a doll described in the previous paragraph?  Both experienced needlewomen and beginners vied repeatedly insist in numerous reviews that there are absolutely no difficulties in this matter.  After all, Tildas, like good-natured angels, bring joy both at the time of cutting out the details, and during assembly, coloring and dressing.  For this reason, fans of such a rag crafts every year becomes more and more.  In addition, Tilda is not only an interesting rag creature, but also a profitable thing.  After all, the cost of an author's handmade doll varies from two to twenty thousand rubles.  And this is another reason why you should take a chance and try to sew a doll with your own hands.  We offer a pattern of details below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="clubook.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="doll pattern" class="if uuid-2469965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2469965.jpg"></div><p>  So, we transfer the pattern first to a sheet of paper or cardboard, and only then to the fabric.  We pay attention to the indicated amount of each part so as not to confuse anything.  Then we cut them out and go to the assembly. </p><h2>  How to sew Tilda </h2><p>  When the material is painted and the details are prepared, you can proceed to the most interesting process - the "revitalization" of the doll.  We sew the details with a seam over the edge, it is recommended to use threads that are most suitable for the color of the fabric.  Then we stuff the doll and get such a figure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.patronesmil.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself tilda" class="if uuid-2470171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2470171.jpg"></div><p>  Its height is a little over thirty centimeters.  And even despite the absence of the outlined features of the face and clothes, in the craft human features are already guessed.

Now you can move on to decorating. </p><h2>  How to make Tilda </h2><p>  Many beginners believe that the hardest part is left behind.  However, experienced needlewomen constantly dissuade them in their reviews in this proposition.  After all, it‚Äôs not difficult to prepare the foundation, it‚Äôs much more difficult to put the soul into the doll.  To do this, you need to sew her eyes.  At this stage, we would like to ask the reader to look again at the original Tilda presented by us above.

Their experienced needlewomen are advised to attach with glue or thread with a needle.  Secondly, it is extremely important not to forget to decorate the cheeks of the finished doll with a blush.

And thirdly, you should take care of Tilda's outfit.  About how to sew doll clothes with your own hands, we will describe in the next paragraph. </p><h2>  Essential little things for Tilda </h2><p>  Most needlewomen prefer to come up with outfits for their dolls, because the product is copyrighted.  Therefore, I want to think through even the smallest detail, if only Tilda would turn out the way she wants to see her.  However, beginners often can not figure out how to find a dress for their creation.  And they prefer to make clothes according to already proven patterns.  It is for this reason that in the current paragraph we invite our reader to perform the following outfit for a stitched doll. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clothes for dolls" class="if uuid-2470191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2470191.jpg"></div><p>  The instructions for its implementation are quite simple: </p><ol><li>  To make a blouse and golf, you need to take a doll pattern as a basis.  Then every thing will certainly fit. </li><li>  To complete the cap, you will need three small skeins of yarn in blue, blue and white.  We collect 80 loops on the knitting needles, distribute them into four knitting needles and knit the first fifteen rows with 1x1 rubber, then go to the front surface.  We reduce the loop, focusing on the size of the head. </li></ol><h2>  Flirty dress for Tilda </h2><p>  So, we figured out the accessories, now you need to find out what you need in order to please your darling with an interesting dress.
