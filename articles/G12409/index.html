    <h2>  Zhukov Vladimir: biography </h2><p>  Born in the Kagalnitsky district near Rostov in 1922.  His family was ordinary peasants and lived in the small village of Vasilyevo-Shamshevo.  From an early age he worked hard, helping his family with household chores.  Upon reaching the age of eighteen, he is called up for military service in the ranks of the Red Army.  They are sent to the city of Oryol to take courses at an armored school.  The next year, the war begins.  The Soviet army is critically short of qualified personnel.  First of all, these are officers and representatives of specific military specialties.  Vladimir Zhukov undergoes an accelerated training course and is sent to the front already in the autumn of that year. </p><h2>  The Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  Vladimir Zhukov received baptism of fire in the territory of the Byelorussian SSR.  There the Nazis struck the hardest blow.  In the swampy terrain, Soviet tank crews had to withstand trained and battle-hardened German mechanized brigades.  After the retreat, the Zhukov brigade began to re-form in the suburbs.  The soldiers received new tanks made at the Stalingrad plant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Zhukov Vladimir participates in defensive battles near Orel, where he had previously served.  The division under the command of Katukov here takes the battle from one of Hitler's best commanders - Heinz Guderian.  To deter superior enemy forces, the Red Army resorted to the tactics of tank ambushes in small settlements. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beetles Vladimir" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1327122.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the cold autumn of the forty-first, a fierce battle erupts near Orel.  Both sides regularly retreat and counterattack.  Zhukov‚Äôs tank brigade succeeded several times in dropping the Eberbach strike force beyond the river, thereby delaying the advance for a week.  The team showed its best side.  Quite quickly, the success of the wards of Katukov in battles against the genius of the German tank tactics of Guderian became known in Moscow.  At this time, the capital itself was in danger.  By Stalin‚Äôs personal order, the first guards <span>tank division was</span> transferred to Moscow.  Tankers restrain the German offensive and then even carry out several counterattacks.  Zhukov Vladimir fights on the same sector of the front with the famous "Panfilovites".  As a result, on November 12, the Red Army launched a decisive attack and pressed the Germans from the capital.  The decisive role in the environment and defeat was played by the Katukov tank brigade.  For this, she was awarded the honorary title "Guards."  But the battles for Moscow continued for another six months. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Defense of Kharkov </h2><p>  After the battle for <span>Moscow, Zhukov</span> Vladimir goes to the Kalinin front.  The hardest battles for Kharkov continue there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beetles vladimir biography" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1327125.jpg" width="600"></div>  The winter of forty-two was very harsh.  The crew of the tank worked to the limit.  Due to the constant raids of enemy aircraft and bad weather, ammunition and provisions were not delivered on time.  There were problems with medicines.  After bloody battles, Kharkov still fell.

    <p>  Officer Vladimir Zhukov becomes commander of a tank battalion.  He took a direct part in the largest battle in the history of mankind - the battle of <span>Kursk.</span>  The guardsmen were advancing along the Oboyan direction.

    <h2>  End of the battle path </h2><p>  Zhukov Vladimir with his brigade went through the whole war.  Guards tankers have always flown to the hottest spots.  The Supreme Headquarters always counted on them, so the fighters did not even have a few weeks of rest.  After the victory near Kursk, Soviet tanks of the first brigade liberated Kiev and crossed the Dnieper.  Then Lviv was liberated by their efforts.  In the spring of forty-fifth, the Red Army invades Pomerania.  The end of the battle route awaits in Berlin.  Here, during the battle for the airport, Vladimir Zhukov died.  Hero of the Soviet Union posthumously, he is buried in a mass grave in Germany. </p>
