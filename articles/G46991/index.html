But before talking about this event, it is necessary to understand what this system was.  The card system was widely used by many states during the crisis periods of wars, economic downturns, and revolutions.  The abolition of the card system testified to an improvement in the economic and social conditions in the country. </p><h2>  What is a card system? </h2><p>  The card system implies a certain mechanism of food distribution among the population.  In the developed <span>capitalist countries</span> in the twentieth century, this system served to provide food for socially vulnerable segments of the population.  Cards (or coupons) were issued at the rate of monthly consumption by a person of certain products.  With the abolition of the card system, food was once again in free sale. </p>

    <h2>  The history of the card system in the world </h2><p>  The first mention of the standards for the issuance of products appeared in ancient Rome.  In the Roman documents that have come down to us, they speak of "tesseras" - bronze or iron tokens, in exchange for which ordinary citizens could receive a certain measure of olive oil, wine and grain.  The card measure was very popular during the years of the French Revolution (1793-1797).  The French received cards that gave them the right to purchase vital products.  At first coupons were issued only for bread, and then this system spread to soap, sugar, meat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The card system in the modern sense was used in Europe during the First World War.  Not all states have resorted to this method of distributing food, but several warring powers have effectively used it.  The cancellation of the card system occurred some time after the end of hostilities.  This system again became popular in the years of World War II and in the hungry months after it.  In the last century, this system was used to combat food shortages in the countries of the socialist camp. </p>

    <h2>  Card system in pre-revolutionary Russia </h2><p>  In our country, food was issued for coupons for the first time under Emperor Nicholas II.  This was a necessary measure caused by severe food shortages as a result of the war.  In the spring of 1916, cards were introduced in many provinces. </p>

    <p>  Lovers of sweets were especially hard to do: because of the large-scale hostilities, Poland found itself in occupation and was unable to supply Russia with products from its sugar refineries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Issuing coupon products in the USSR </h2><p>  04/29/1917, the Provisional Government decided to use this system.  In a number of large cities, a "bread monopoly" was introduced.  In accordance with the requirement of the government, all grain was considered the property of the state.  Thus, farmers harvesting grain lost their primary source of income. </p>

    <p>  Later, the uncontrolled issue of printed money led to the collapse of the financial system.  Trying to find a way out of the crisis, the government decided to continue to use the card system and even expand it.  Already in the summer of 1917, meat, cereals and butter were issued on coupons.  In the fall of the same year, the card system spread to chicken eggs and vegetable oil.  In winter, confectionery and tea disappeared from use. </p><p>  The first cancellation of the card system in the USSR (date - November 11, 19121) was due to the transition to a new economic policy (NEP).  This measure was proposed by leading Soviet economists.  Its goal was to stabilize the situation in foreign and domestic markets.  This monetary reform and the abolition of the card system was a very successful political move and could restore the country's economic system, if not for the rash actions of the communist government. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 1929, the second wave of the coupon system was approaching.  Growing like a snowball, it soon acquired the character of a centralized large-scale event. </p><p>  In 1931, almost all <span>food products</span> were covered by the <span>card system</span> <span>,</span> and a little later industrial products were also absorbed. </p><h2>  The system of distribution of coupons among the population </h2><p>  An interesting fact is that products and other essential goods were issued in strict accordance with class affiliation.  Cards of the first category were intended for the working class (800 g of bread per day).  Family members of workers were given 400 g of bakery products per day. </p><p>  The second category extended to employees who received 300 grams of bread for themselves and for dependents.  The most difficult thing was the ‚Äúunearned element‚Äù.  Representatives of trade and clergy generally did not have the right to receive coupons.  Peasants and persons who were deprived of political rights were also deleted from the system. </p><p>  Thus, residents of the country who do not receive cards made up 80% of the population of the USSR.  This unfair system has been functioning for 5 years.  The cancellation of the card system occurred on January 1, 1935.  However, it did not become easier for people, since literally a few days after the abolition of coupons, prices for flour and sugar almost doubled. </p><h2>  World War II and the card system </h2>

    <p>  When the Great Patriotic War began, the state had to take tough measures to save the country's thousands of people from starvation.  During the Second World War, many states participating in the battles had to switch to the card system.  Products were issued in exchange for coupons in Japan, the UK, USA, Canada and several other countries.  So, in the United States of America in 1942, people could receive meat products, sugar, gasoline, car tires, bicycles, and much more using cards.  For a week, an American citizen relied on 227 grams of sugar, and with a deterioration in the food situation - 129 grams.  The rules for issuing gasoline to persons not involved in defense activities were very strictly regulated (11-13 liters of gasoline per week). </p><p>  The card system was canceled in the year of the end of World War II, but not for all products.  As the food and industrial markets recovered, coupons were gradually canceled. </p><p>  In fascist Germany, the card system was introduced back in 1939 and included more than 60 items of goods that were not available for regular sale. </p><p>  In 1939, the card system was introduced in the Czech Republic.  There, on coupons, fuel, bread, sugar, fabrics, and even clothes and shoes were issued.  The abolition of the card system after the war in this country did not occur; coupons existed until 1953. </p><p>  A similar situation was observed in the UK.  Cards for fuel, sweets and meat were canceled only in 1950-1954.  Japan abandoned the card system in 1949, and in 1952 the state ceased to totally control prices in the domestic market.  In Israel, the card system lasted only three years (from 1949 to 1952), but was quickly canceled due to its inefficiency. </p><h2>  The toughest stage of the card system in the USSR </h2><p>  In 1941, the third wave of the use of a centralized card system begins.  This summer, coupons for many food and some industrial products were introduced in Moscow and Leningrad.  By the end of 1942, the receipt of products in exchange for cards was already carried out in 57 large cities of the USSR.  After the war, another cancellation of the card system occurred, the date of which fell on 1947. </p><p>  This meant that the country was slowly getting out of the hunger crisis.  Factories and factories resumed work.  The abolition of the card system in the USSR, which began at the end of 1945, became final in 1947.  First, bread and cereals were no longer issued on coupons, and sugar cards were the last to be canceled. </p><h2>  Fighting food shortages in the USSR </h2>

    <p>  The fourth wave of the coupon system has overtaken our country relatively recently, so many remember all the inconveniences associated with life "on the cards." </p><p>  A little-known fact is the introduction in 1983 of coupons for sausages in Sverdlovsk.  On the one hand, purchasing food products on cards was a lot of inconvenience, but on the other hand, residents of many regions could not buy sausages at retail stores. </p><p>  In 1989, the card system spread to all regions of the USSR.  A distinctive feature of this period is the lack of uniformity in the distribution of coupons.  In each region, the system was built taking into account economic and industrial features.  Some factories gave out their products only to those who worked in their production. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance of coupons </h2><p>  Cards for products and industrial goods were printed in huge numbers, so it didn‚Äôt get to the design frills when they were issued.  However, Russian coupon collector Y. Yakovlev claims that original cards were issued in some areas. </p><p>  So, in Chita, the so-called "hedgehogs" (universal coupons) were popular.  In the Zelenograd region, next to the name of the product, its image was applied.  In Altai on the vodka coupons there was an inscription ‚ÄúSobriety - a way of life‚Äù, and in Bratsk on green vodka coupons flaunted green little devils with glasses in their paws. </p><p>  They quickly got used to the card system.  The abolition of the card system in the USSR, the date of which was gradually approaching, no longer looked so tempting.  There was an opportunity to get high-quality imported goods on coupons.  ‚ÄúBarter‚Äù spread everywhere when markets purchased goods at exorbitant prices on cards.  The abolition of the card system in the USSR, this time the last, occurred in 1992 in connection with the spread of free trade. </p>
