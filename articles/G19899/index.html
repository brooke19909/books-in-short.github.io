They confirm their reputation from year to year.  A vivid proof of this is Rixos The Land of Legends 5 * in Turkey in Belek.  This is the world where a fairy tale comes to life.  The concept of the park, located 500 meters from the hotel, was created in a creative tandem with Franco Dragone, a world-famous director.  His grandiose show for Cirque du Soleil amazes with its entertainment.  In Belek, he created a magical country with incredible heroes and characters that surround tourists.  Vacationers are transported into a beautiful world of fantasies.  Even adults can plunge here into a joyful carefree childhood.  This place is the embodiment of luxury and pleasures, magic and science fiction.  The sun and the Mediterranean Sea, Mount Toros and pine groves - all this perfectly complement the landscapes of this fairy tale.  Here, water canals await tourists, which combine the park into one mini-city, an embankment arranged in the style of “unreal reality”, an area with thematic buildings, towers, fountains, many colorful, thematically decorated pools. </p>
