Water from taps can boast of drinking quality, which is good news.  By the way, the plumbing is all new, good, sparkling with cleanliness. </p><p>  The beach is excellent - clean and spacious.  The same can be said about the pool.  The water is moderately chlorinated and very comfortable in temperature.  There are enough deck chairs for everyone. </p><p>  In general, the hotel is good.
