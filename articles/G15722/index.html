Sea holiday</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Summer is a wonderful time when many people go on vacation and go to resorts.  But sometimes there are difficulties with choosing a place to stay.  Some, for example, simply do not know which is better - Anapa or Gelendzhik.  This question haunts them, and they cannot dwell on any one option.  But is it even possible to answer it unambiguously?  Probably not.  After all, each resort has both advantages and disadvantages.  And before the trip, you need to find out about them in order to make the right choice and not be disappointed. </p><h2>  The most famous Russian resorts </h2><p>  Gelendzhik and Anapa have long been loved by many residents of our country, and most tourists choose these cities for recreation.  All year they dream of visiting the Black Sea, and one day there comes a time when their dream comes true.  Different people come here: youth, old people, spouses with children.  What is remarkable about Anapa and Gelendzhik?  Do they have similar features or are they completely different? </p><h2>  Anapa </h2><p>  This resort town is located in a flat area, in the vicinity there is not a single hill.  The climate here is almost always comfortable, unexpected temperature differences are not observed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa or Gelendzhik" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/468132.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, it should be noted that the weather may seem a little cool for babies who run the risk of catching a cold.  Often a pretty strong wind blows.  But this does not stop parents who boldly go with their children to the Black Sea.  Anapa, in their opinion, is the best place for a family vacation.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sea and beaches </h2><p>  The sea is shallow here, so that the water level reaches at least the middle of the body, you need to go far enough.  Parents, seeing this situation, believe that nothing threatens their children, and allow them to freely frolic and swim.  The beaches here are different: there are pebble and sand. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that urban infrastructure is at a fairly high level, and it is focused mainly on children.  In the city there are, for example, attractions and a huge water park.  In addition, children have the opportunity to have fun right on the street, because there are slot machines everywhere.  Motorcycles and cars are also available for rent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Black Sea Anapa" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/468130.jpg" width="600"></div>  There are so many opportunities for an interesting pastime that you just can‚Äôt list everything!  But of course, the <span>Black Sea</span> attracts people the most <span>.</span>  <span>Anapa</span> became famous throughout the country precisely thanks to him.  Perhaps there is no such person who would not have heard at least a little about this city.

    <h2>  Cinema and shopping complex </h2><p>  In addition to the kids, in Anapa there are many teenagers who prefer entertainment of a slightly different kind.  Some times during your vacation you can visit the local cinema to enjoy a fascinating movie.  By the way, there are all conditions for people with disabilities - you can get into the building on <span>a wheelchair of</span> any size.  Also noteworthy is the modern shopping complex, which was built recently.  There is also a cinema and a large number of shops.  It is difficult to say which city is more attractive in terms of shopping - Anapa or Gelendzhik.  In both, you can make many good purchases. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  As for housing, there should not be any difficulties with this.  The city has a lot of apartments and hotel houses for rent, there are also wonderful sanatoriums.  To verify this, just go to Pionersky Prospekt.  It literally replete with children's camps, resorts, holiday homes, expensive and not very hotels.  In a word, the city has everything that a person needs.  Many tourists also note comfortable transitions and paths paved with even tiles.  It is important that they are supplemented with ramps.  Some people wonder which city is more comfortable - Anapa or Gelendzhik.  In fact, there are many different opinions on this subject.  Everything is determined by the subjective perception of a person.  Some people think that Anapa is a thousand times better, while others argue that Gelendzhik is unrivaled. </p><h2>  Gelendzhik </h2><p>  If there are no elevations at all in Anapa, then they are present in Gelendzhik.  The climate here is also very comfortable, but unexpected temperature changes are not ruled out. </p>

It is a good place for those who want silence.  Deep relaxation is possible here.  The only thing that can spoil the impression is a small amount of dirt formed as a result of enclosed space.  The fact is that water is rarely replaced here.  The sea in Gelendzhik is deeper.  No need to go far from the shore so that the water level reaches the very neck.  The beaches at this resort are exceptionally pebble.  Perhaps this is the answer to the question of which city is preferable for relaxation - Anapa or Gelendzhik.  In the latter, people simply have no choice, they are forced to relax on the same beaches.  And in Anapa, the situation is completely different.  This is its undoubted advantage.

    <h2>  Paradise for outdoor enthusiasts </h2><p>  People who have ever visited Anapa note that the infrastructure there is better than in Gelendzhik.  But here it‚Äôs still not so bad.  The city is famous for its wonderful promenade, where musical performances, competitions, dances are regularly held.  You can definitely say for sure that this resort is not aimed at kids.  Mostly adults come here who like active rest, calculated on their age.  The city also rents a lot of housing, which can be easily rented.  But there are few resorts here.  But there are private buildings, guest houses and hotels. </p><p>  From the foregoing, it can be concluded that married couples with children are better off traveling to Anapa, while young and mature people who want to have fun should prefer to go to Gelendzhik. </p><h2>  Anapa: accommodation prices </h2><p>  You should not be mistaken in thinking that <span>rest in Anapa</span> will be cheaper than in other resorts of the Black Sea.  But this does not mean that the tourist will go broke.  You can try to save money by coming here at the beginning of the season (from mid-May to early June), as well as in September or October. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa prices" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/468135.jpg" width="500"></div>  During these periods, the lowest cost of living in the most modest rooms will be 250 rubles per day, while it should be borne in mind that a tourist who is relaxing alone will have to pay a double price, because there are only double rooms.  You can, of course, rely on luck - it is possible that they will provide a small discount.  But some people who came here without company find it more reasonable to sleep on the beach than to pay for a double room.
