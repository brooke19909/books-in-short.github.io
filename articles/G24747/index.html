A beautiful swimsuit is undoubtedly a beach attribute, but is it not in a swimsuit to go to the beach?  But a beautiful, crocheted beach dress made of linen or cotton thread will actually attract the attention of vacationers.  This article is about how to knit a beach dress and look amazing in it. </p><h2>  What do fashion designers offer? </h2><p>  Summer is coming, and thoughts about vacation are already beginning to warm the hearts of fashionistas.  And on this occasion there are many new interesting ideas for the beach.  Outfits for the summer of 2018 are beautiful, colorful beach sundresses, tunics and a pair of light, airy materials.  But a special emphasis is made, as in previous summer seasons, on knitted dresses.  There are no analogues in the world of fashion handmade dresses combining practicality and sophisticated lightness.  Fashion designers do not miss the opportunity to please fashionistas with new models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fiapodejaca.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet Beach Dresses" class="if uuid-2504972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2504972.jpg"></div><p>  Crocheted <span>beach dresses are in</span> demand not only for hiking on the beach.  They are perfect for everyday wear, for example, for an evening promenade, attending cultural events.  So that they do not look too frank at such events, a cover is sewn under them on straps made of light fabric.  As in the last season, white and all its shades are fashionable in 2018.  But this does not mean that dresses of other colors will not be in trend.  Summer is full of different colors, including bright colors of dresses, tunics, sundresses. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Blue beach dress </h2><p>  Knitted dress can be purchased in the market and in the store, can be ordered in a knitted atelier.  But you can also tie it yourself if you are a needlewoman and know a lot about crocheting.  In the photo above, a blue dress with rhombuses.  It may seem difficult to knit until you figure out the sequence of work.  The first is to make a dress pattern.  As can be seen in photo No. 1, the dress consists of 28 identical squares - 14 each fall on the front and back of the product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern for a knitted dress" class="if uuid-2506652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2506652.jpg"></div><p>  These squares are crocheted according to patterns.  A beach dress is created from two types of patterns.  They are presented in photo No. 2. </p><ul><li>  The motif of the square consists of columns and air loops.  Finished squares are crocheted or stitched. </li><li>  The border motif is supposed to be placed at the bottom of the hem - 9 rows, the hem of the sleeve - 4 rows, along the neckline - 3 rows. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The scheme of knitting squares and a shuttlecock on the bottom" class="if uuid-2505068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2505068.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Loin base in summer dresses </h2><p>  Openwork dresses crocheted with the so-called loin base became the favorite clothes of avant-garde designers.  This is a mesh translucent texture, combined with any decorative techniques.  It can be completely made by the grid of the product or, as, for example, in the photo below, combining the alternation of stripes.  For the summer, a pastel color scheme and white in any shade option would be a great choice.  They elegantly emphasize the beauty of the tan and look equally advantageous in short models and in a long version of the dress. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Crochet Beach Dress </h2><p>  We begin the job description with the preparation of the yarn necessary for knitting.  It will need about 600 grams at the rate of 120 m / 50 g. For work, we use a 3 or 3.5 hook and a needle for stitching knitwear. </p><p>  Before knitting, calculate the density of the fabric.  For this, a sample of half columns and a sample of lace are knitted.  A sample of 10 * 10 cm should contain a certain number of loops and rows.  With these calculations, you will always knit a product that will be perfectly tailored to your size. </p><p>  For example, the density of knitting lace, you get 20 loops and 12 rows in a square of 10 * 10 cm. So, in 1 cm - 2 loops and 1.2 rows.  We start work with a chain for the bottom of the dress.  With a bottom size of 60 cm, 120 loops are typed. </p><p>  In the future, all calculations must be carried out based on the sizes indicated on the pattern.  It is necessary to calculate how many rows you need to knit to the armhole.  If you consider that the density of knitting of half-columns and lace is different, you need to calculate how many repeating motifs will be from the hem of the skirt to the armhole. </p><p>  For example, the number of rows of a crocheted openwork pattern of 10 cm is 12 rows, and in half-columns it is 16 rows.  It turns out that the motif of the two patterns will be of 28 rows (20 cm).  If the length should be 80 cm, then you need to knit 4 motifs in 28 rows. </p><p>  The dress consists of stripes.  Choose the width of the strip that suits your opinion.  It can be the same strip width or more openwork and less than half columns, or vice versa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stylowi.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet summer dress" class="if uuid-2505131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2505131.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitting dresses </h2><p>  The front (back) is knitted in straight and reverse rows from bottom to top of the length that is needed before the armhole (in photo No. 1, the parameter is 60 or longer).  At the height of the armhole on both sides of the knitting, you need to add such a number of chain loops that is equal to the size of the sleeve (in photo No. 1 it is 25 cm).  By tying 25 cm, you can finish knitting. </p><p>  The cutout on the dress will look beautiful if the work is finished with half columns.  Having connected 2 details of the dress, they are sewn together with a needle or from the wrong side with columns without a crochet.  Sleeves are sewn 25 cm on both sides.  The neckline, the edges of the sleeves and the hem are tied with a "dog step", that is, columns without a crochet from left to right. </p><p>  Crochet openwork pattern begins on an already connected fabric consisting of half columns.  Let us arbitrarily denote the motives: </p><ul><li>  A - 3 tbsp.  with nak., 2p.  air., 3 tbsp.  with nak .; </li><li>  B - 1 tbsp. With nak., 1p.  air., 1 tbsp.  with nak. </li></ul><p>  1st row: <strong>*</strong> in the loop of a row of columns we knit the motif A;  skip 4 p. on the chain;  in 5 p. knit motive B;  skip 4p * (repeat knitting from * to *). </p><p>  2nd row: knit 2 p.  for lifting;  * in the arch of 2 p.  knit motive A;  in the arch of 1 p.  knit motive B * (repetition of knitting from * to *). </p><p>  The spruce decided to perform 4 rows of lace, you should connect 1 and 2 rows and repeat the pattern of 1 and 2 rows again. </p><p>  You can make openwork stripes with any pattern.  For example, like the one in the photo below.  Even for beginners, crocheting a beach dress is not a problem using this pattern.  Here, just as in the previous pattern, the motif consists of 4 forward and reverse rows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork pattern for a summer dress" class="if uuid-2506537" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2506537.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of patterns for summer dresses </h2><p>  Chic crochet pattern for a summer beach dress, very similar to Irish lace.  The pattern is called the "royal square".  Many needlewomen can take this find to their collections.  The drawing is simple.  Yarn is best for a summer dress to take cotton or linen.  You can arrange the squares as shown in photo No. 1 in the article above. </p><p>  Summer is coming soon.  And so you need to do your wardrobe.  Of the options for summer beach dresses listed in the article, you can find a suitable option for yourself.  Let your dreams and vacation plans by the sea come true! </p>
