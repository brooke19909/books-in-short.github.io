It is considered the sunniest place on the Bulgarian coast and gained fame thanks to excellent balneological health resorts.  Tourists planning a <span>vacation in Bulgaria</span> try to come here for treatment with the help of the famous Pomorie mud. </p><h2>  Pomorie </h2><p>  For 500 years BC, the ancient Greeks came to this region and founded the city of Anchialos (the name translates as ‚Äútreasure of salt‚Äù).  For millennia, salt has been mined there (the largest deposit in the Balkans). </p><p>  In 1934, the ancient name of the ancient city was replaced by the Bulgarian name Pomorie. </p><p>  Today, this small resort town with a population of 15 thousand people has become a well-known balneological center due to deposits of salt and other minerals, which are washed away by the water of lakes and springs and form unique muds with an unrivaled therapeutic effect. </p><p>  Therefore, many tourists who seek not only to relax, but also to receive health benefits, travel to <span>Pomorie (Bulgaria).</span>  The map of the famous resort shows a very good location on a narrow peninsula that goes far into the sea (five kilometers) and has many cozy bays and bays, protected by isthmuses and a sand spit. </p>

    <h2>  Beaches and climate </h2><p>  The length of the sea coast in this area is about 4 kilometers.  The beaches are well equipped for relaxation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The rocky shore contributes to the transparency of sea water (since the waves do not raise sand from the bottom).  In the beach area, the sea is warm (average temperature is 26 degrees) and not very deep, with a magnificent view of the <span>Balkan Mountains.</span> </p><p>  Consider the most popular hotel - Interhotel Pomorie 3 * It can boast its own private beach with good sand, located on the first coastline (100 meters from the sea).  Entrance to the beach is free for hotel guests (but you will have to pay 12 leva for 2 sun loungers and an umbrella). </p><p>  Summer in Pomerania is hot (up to thirty warmth), but it is not at all stuffy here thanks to the fresh wind from the sea. </p><h2>  Health resorts </h2><p>  Near the salt lakes there are many boarding houses and sanatoriums that provide various services for general health improvement, as well as the prevention and treatment of many diseases. </p><p>  Tourists coming to Pomorie (Interhotel Pomorie 3 *) can take a course of rehabilitation using unique mud and bathing in mineral springs, which help restore health in the following problems: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ violation of the functions of the musculoskeletal system; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ cardiovascular disorders; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ skin diseases; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ stress and nervous disorders; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ oncological diseases; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ disorders of the respiratory system. </p><h2>  Interesting places </h2><p>  In the old churches and monasteries you can see the picturesque frescoes and ancient icons that Bulgaria is famous for (including Pomorie).  Also in this city, the international festival of the Holy Virgin takes place annually, at which the best Orthodox choirs from different countries perform.  The constant interest of tourists is the reserve of old houses and the Thracian mausoleum.  Excursions to the Salt Museum and the Black Sea Gold winery are popular. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interhotel Pomorie </h2><p>  Interhotel Pomorie 3 * (Bulgaria) is located in the Old Town on a quiet, cozy street.  The hotel is located near the airport "Burgas" (13 km).  The center of Burgas is also very close (21 km). </p><p>  In 2012, the hotel was renovated.  Now tourists are accommodated in two buildings.  The old building of the Pomorie Hotel (7 floors, 136 rooms) resembles a sea liner.  It is surrounded on three sides by water.

    <p>  There is no language barrier in talking with people on the streets, and the menu in the restaurants is in Russian. </p><p>  The hotel is conveniently located - close to beaches, health resorts, shops, restaurants and travel agencies. </p><p>  Pomorie has many small cafes and taverns (often with live music), where you can have a tasty and inexpensive lunch or dinner.  It is interesting that soups are very popular in Bulgaria - everywhere you can find 6-8 types of first courses.  It is convenient for people who monitor their health. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is a market (20 minutes walk).  Locals sell a variety of fresh and cheap fruits (the cost of nectarines, cherries and pears is from 20 to 50 rubles per kilogram).  There are many original shops where excellent local wine is sold (2-40 levs per bottle). </p><p>  The hotel staff is attentive and friendly, employees always try to solve problems. </p><p>  The ancient villages and temples of which Bulgaria (Pomorie) is famous are very interesting.  Photos reflect only part of the entire solar palette and charm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria seaside photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/520095.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Among the excursions, trips to Patissimo, Balchik, Aladzhu, the Bulgarian village (national dishes, everyday pictures, dances on hot coals) and the old Nessebar with an amazing church, a wine shop (with tasting) and magnificent sea views from the cliff are popular. </p><p>  It is interesting to visit the Pomorie Center, which is located next to the hotel and is known for its beautiful alleys and an abundance of company shops and fashionable restaurants. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Monotonous food is noted (although this is a common thing for three-star hotels), and some tourists complain that only the fruits on the table are oranges, bananas, apples and peaches. </p><p>  During the summer heat in the old building it is very stuffy (air conditioning is only in the new building), and in the rooms below the third floor there is a smell of algae, since the sea surrounds the hotel on three sides.  For the same reason, the cries of gulls and albatrosses are heard early in the morning outside the window. </p><p>  The rooms do not have an electric kettle and a hairdryer (although they are not declared in the hotel‚Äôs advertisement), there are few free sockets (there is no bathroom at all), which also do not indicate voltage.  In the bathrooms you can see the mold. </p><p>  Although the hotel‚Äôs description has its own beach, tourists say that it simply doesn‚Äôt exist - there are only concrete slabs that go into the sea, and there are several umbrellas and sunbeds on them. </p><p>  To the city beach to go 10 minutes.  Mud sometimes floats in the sea, on the shore there are broken shells, which can be injured. </p><p>  During algal bloom, the coast is covered with green bloom.  In addition, there are many jellyfish. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  ‚Ä¢ The currency should be changed only at exchange offices in large cities (there are a lot of scammers on the street and in the markets, and hotels have an unprofitable rate), and keep a certificate issued at the same time (bordereaux), which may be required upon departure. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Plastic cards are accepted only in expensive hotels and restaurants.  They can also be used to purchase airline tickets over the Internet.  In general, plastic cards are not popular in Pomorie. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ You can withdraw money from the card at ATMs, which are available only in large hotels. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ You need to keep track of things, and carry bags over your shoulder (they are often snatched out on the streets). </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Taxi drivers at airports are overpriced, so it‚Äôs better to check with local people for the fare to the right place, and then firmly insist on this amount in a conversation with a taxi driver (charge a fee in advance, before boarding). </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Keep valuables with you (suitcases are often opened at airports). </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Take tea bags with you. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ All that is needed can be reported to the cleaning lady - she will give out soap, shampoo, and so on. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ It should be remembered that products cannot be taken out of the hotel restaurant (during a free breakfast or lunch with the all-inclusive system).  There is a fine of five euros for taking out food. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ On beaches, rocky shore - shoes are needed. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ It is cheaper to buy an umbrella at a local store than to rent on the beach (then you can sell it to other tourists). </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ It is better to organize excursions after arriving in Pomorie (rather than paying in advance for the tour operator) - in local offices everything is much cheaper, and even better to travel independently. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The level of service in Bulgaria cannot yet be called European; rather, it is close to the Soviet one.  And for spoiled tourists who prefer five-star hotels, Interhotel Pomorie 3 * (Bulgaria / Pomorie) is hardly suitable. </p><p>  But picky and active people who spend more time not in a hotel, but on the sea, salt lakes and excursions, will be quite happy with their stay, take a course of rehabilitation on Pomorie mud and get a wonderful experience. </p>
