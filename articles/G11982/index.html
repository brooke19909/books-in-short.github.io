    <h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Pattaya resort is more than a hundred kilometers south of Bangkok, on the shore of the <span>Gulf of Thailand.</span>  Now consider the location of the hotel Woraburi The Ritz 4 *.  Pattaya has a simple "chess" division of the streets.  The main avenue is Central Street.  Perpendicular to him, but parallel to the embankment are streets with the uncomplicated names First, Second and Third.  Such a tradition here.  Our hotel is located between Second and Third Street, very close to the central avenue.  So there is enough urban infrastructure around the hotel.  Nearby there is a Big S supermarket.  According to reviews, within walking distance there are many restaurants and cafes.  An incredibly delicious tom yam soup is being prepared right across the road from the hotel.  The municipal beach, as well as the famous Walking Street, can be reached on foot or in tuk-tuk.  Also, by public transport you will have to get to the pier to relax on the island closest to the city called Ko Lan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya Woraburi The Ritz 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1194901.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, it does not have any territory - land in the center of Pattaya is worth its weight in gold.  Between the buildings is a swimming pool with an artificial peninsula, which is seated with palm trees.  It is laden with sunbeds.  There are no umbrellas there, and they are not needed.  As the guests say in their reviews, the sun does not look into the pool at noon.  The rest of the day, the shadow of one of the buildings falls on him.  This makes the pool only swimming.  Many tourists even liked this fact.  Usually there are very few people, it seems that this is your individual pool.  It is very convenient, having arrived with an excursion, to plunge into its cool waters.  The pool is open until eight in the evening and is beautifully illuminated in the dark.  By the way, all rooms overlook the courtyard, where it is usually quite quiet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4 Woraburi The Ritz 4 (Pattaya, Thailand)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1194907.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What they say about the ‚ÄúWooburi The Ritz‚Äù in Pattaya </h2><p>  Basically, most tourists praise the hotel Woraburi The Ritz 4 *.  Pattaya (reviews repeatedly mention this) is a very noisy and bustling city.  But the hotel rooms are extremely quiet.  The guests get the impression that they are in a world of peace and tranquility.  Breakfast at the hotel is not bad, you can always choose something to your liking.  The rooms are cleaned well.  The hotel specializes in hosting organized groups.  These are mainly Chinese, who are taken on excursions early in the morning, and brought only in the evening.  So in the afternoon the hotel is generally completely quiet. </p>
