And this is understandable, because such devices are becoming increasingly compact.  Seven-inch devices easily fit in the inside pocket of a jacket.  Why not replace the smartphone with them?  At least for a while.  Such an idea visited every person who has a small tablet computer.  But is this idea feasible?  And is it convenient to call from a tablet? </p><h2>  Theory </h2>

But it is not so.  There are many pitfalls.  A tablet computer is very similar to a smartphone.  But this is not an overgrown smartphone, as many believe.  Many of these gadgets have a 3G module.  However, remember laptops and netbooks.  They also often have a SIM card slot.  But you can‚Äôt call them.  Why is that?

    <p>  You may be wondering how to call from an Explay tablet or some other.  But no one will give you an exact answer.  The fact is that most often tablet computers do not have a GSM module.  Namely, it is necessary for making calls on mobile networks.  A SIM card in such devices is installed only to gain access to the Internet.  The rejection of the GSM module freed up space for other components to be placed in it.  But most often it is not involved at all.  It turns out a kind of air gap, contributing to the cooling of the processor or GPS chip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tricks </h2><p>  Do you still have the hope of knowing <span>how to call from your tablet?</span>  In principle, you are right, do not despair.  Some gadgets are still equipped with a GSM module.  This is especially true of older models that were assembled using smartphone technology.  This is very good news for those who are wondering how to make a call from the Lenovo tablet.  After all, it was Lenovo that at one time produced several tablet computers with the ability to call on mobile networks. </p><h2>  Why has the situation changed now? </h2>

    <p>  Gradually, such tablet computers began to produce less and less.  It seems that manufacturers began to save on pennies.  GSM-module weighs very little, and its cost is calculated in cents.  Why did they stop installing it in modern tablets? </p><p>  Most often, developers simply do not go to bother with an extra antenna.  The GSM module itself has tiny dimensions.  But he has a decent antenna, which not every tablet computer can fit.  And it can transmit a signal very poorly (due to the aluminum case). </p><h2>  Caring for users? </h2><p>  There is an opinion that the waves going to the cell towers are dangerous to health.  Tablet manufacturers, of course, also own this information.  That is why they decided to get rid of the GSM module.  In their opinion, waves with Internet traffic affect human health less.  A highly controversial statement. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Perhaps the manufacturers, if they were asked how to call from a Lenovo tablet, would answer with a question to the question: ‚ÄúWhy? This is terribly inconvenient!‚Äù  Say, a seven-inch device is even difficult to hold in one hand.  And if you also bring it to your ear ... That's right, if it weren‚Äôt for one thing: they forget that there is a speakerphone and a <span>wireless headset.</span>  Because of this ‚Äúconcern,‚Äù the forums are full of questions about how to make calls from the tablet.  Yes, people are very surprised that it is impossible to call from him. </p><h2>  Digital technology </h2>

It is impossible to make calls only on GSM networks.  But no one has canceled all kinds of Internet calls!  Now there are many Internet services with which you can call from any device with a microphone.  And now it is available in every tablet computer.  The trouble is that the quality of the microphone is sometimes very disappointing.  You may be hard to hear as if you were calling from under the water.  Similar microphones were installed in old cassette audio players.  It is surprising that for many years the situation has not changed much for the better.

    <p>  Only <span>the best tablets</span> are equipped with a decent microphone.  If you have a mid-range device, then this does not matter.  Buy a headset, communicate with it.  You can even purchase a wireless model, since almost every tablet computer has a Bluetooth module. </p><h2>  Most popular services </h2>

The most popular resource for making Internet calls is now Skype.  It supports video communication, so when using it, the <span>front camera is</span> very useful to you <span>.</span>  If it‚Äôs missing, don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll only spend less traffic.  Keep in mind that Skype should not be kept open in the background.  Run it only if you are going to call someone.  Otherwise, the application will quickly drain the battery.

    <p>  Other services have not yet gained particular popularity.  But they still need to be mentioned.  First of all, you should not forget about the Fring application, designed for iPad tablets.  Among users of Android products, the ooVoo and Viber applications are well known.  With their help, you can also talk with your friends and colleagues through the tablet.  If you need to call a mobile phone, then the same Skype or Line2 will come to the rescue.  However, be prepared to fork out.  Both services allow you to call mobile and landline numbers for a fee. </p>
