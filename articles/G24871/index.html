One of such concepts is the Preobrazhensky order, which performed the role of a detective and governing body in the XVII - XVIII centuries. </p><p>  The complexity of the issue lies in the fact that the term “order” over the past centuries has changed its meaning.  For this reason, many students are lost when they receive the assignment: “Expand the meaning of concepts.  Preobrazhensky order - what is it? ”  In this situation, a gross mistake is an attempt to answer a question based on modern language. </p><h2>  The term “order” - a requirement or authority? </h2>

    <p>  To find out the meaning of the concept “Preobrazhensky order” and to find out the role that he played in the formation of the Russian Empire, you need to understand the origin of the term “order”.  The modern explanatory dictionary explains this word as follows: "an order subject to strict execution."  However, such a formulation has come into use relatively recently.  In Russia, starting from the end of the 15th century, the order called the central authorities responsible for a certain part of state concerns.  So, Prince Ivan III, having completed the unification of disparate Slavic principalities, transformed the Russian government system, transferring executive powers to orders - prototypes of modern ministries.  <span>The ambassadorial order,</span> Local, Yamsky, Pushkarsky ... With each new prince or tsar the system was supplemented, but up to <span>Peter I</span> never ceased to exist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The appearance of the Preobrazhensky order </h2><p>  This authority owes its appearance to two small villages near Moscow - Semenovsky and Preobrazhensky, where in 1682 the young Tsar Peter and his mother were exiled.  All power was concentrated in the hands of the regent, Princess Sophia, and two “amusing” regiments were allocated for Peter's entertainment.  The management of all economic and other issues of these regiments was transferred to the Transfiguration Order specially created for this purpose. </p>

    <p>  However, over time, as young Peter began to take part in the government of the country, this “amusing” order changed its meaning.  Companions of the young Peter rallied around him, plans for the first serious reforms were developed in it, and the need for military campaigns against Turkey was discussed.  Peter Alekseevich led one of his closest friends, Prince Fedor Yuryevich Romodanovsky, to direct the order. </p><h2>  The first serious affairs of the Preobrazhensky order </h2><p>  In 1689, <span>Princess Sophia</span> made an attempt to seize full power and become the queen.  She was supported by the archery regiments stationed in Moscow.  The amusing regiments led by Prince Romodanovsky were forced to enter their first serious battle and won.  Sophia was exiled to the <span>Novodevichy Convent,</span> and the Preobrazhensky order from a small business organization turned into one of the most important bodies of state power.  He was in charge of order in Moscow, the investigation of political crimes, in 1698 he was granted the exclusive right to trial any crimes against the tsar or the tsarist government. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It was this powerful organization that the reign of Peter I owed several suppressed riots, the persecution of political opponents of Peter and the bloody executions.  The very concept of “Preobrazhensky order” has become a household name, for many years it has been popularly associated with terrible torture chambers and cruel reprisals. </p><p>  However, in fact, the functions of this order were much wider: until the creation of the Senate in 1711, he was the main governing body of the country during the absence of the king.  For example, during the participation of Peter I in the Great Embassy in Europe, it was the Preobrazhensky order that dealt with the solution of all internal problems. </p>

    <h2>  The role of the Preobrazhensky order in suppressing the Streltsy uprising </h2><p>  One of the most serious cases in which the subordinates of Prince Romodanovsky had a chance to participate was the Streletsky Uprising of 1698.  The regiments sent (instead of the promised rest) to serve in Velikiye Luki refused to obey orders.  And they set about releasing Princess Sophia - who, unlike Peter, "was affectionate with them."  The Streltsy uprising was brutally crushed.  At the behest of Peter, more than 300 archers were arrested and taken for interrogation to the Preobrazhensky order.  The significance of this event for the development of Russia was enormous: it was after the rebellion of 1698 that the <span>Streltsy army</span> was disbanded and ceased to exist forever. </p><p>  Across the country, there was a search for sympathizers for the archers.  Many of the participants in this uprising perished in the dungeons of the Preobrazhensky order, and even more was publicly executed on Red Square as a warning to the rest.  This tragic event was captured by Vasily Surikov in his painting “Morning of the Archery Execution”. </p>

    <h2>  Empire Age </h2><p>  In subsequent years, the Preobrazhensky order became more and more the central detective and judicial body.  Since 1702, they began to interrogate everyone who “said the sovereign's word” (that is, had information about a plot being prepared or seditious conversations). </p><p>  In 1718, the Secret Chancellery was created in St. Petersburg, which received the functions of the Transfiguration Order in the north of the country, and a few years later both of these organizations merged into one.  It was here, in the Peter and Paul Fortress, where the Secret Chancellery was located, that the case of Tsarevich Alexei, the son of Peter I, was accused of treason.  The interrogation methods involving torture were not changed even for <span>Alexei Petrovich,</span> and a guilty verdict was soon passed.  However, the heir to the throne did not live to be executed: on June 26 he was found dead in his cell. </p><h2>  The last years of the Preobrazhensky order </h2><p>  Throughout the Petrine era, the Transfiguration order was the main pillar of the tsarist government.  His powers expanded, the name changed: so, in 1702, the organization temporarily became known as the “General Court”.  Towards the end of Peter I’s reign, this order had the power to search and try political criminals, investigate criminal cases, execute executions, and even control the sale of tobacco.  Fedor Romodanovsky was replaced by his son, Ivan Romodanovsky, Andrei Ushakov was appointed to lead the criminal investigation. </p>

    <p>  Peter's brainchild began to lose its significance only after his death.  Catherine I renamed the organization into the Transfiguration Chancellery, retaining most of her powers.  And in 1729, Emperor Peter II finally abolished this authority, dismissing its chief and transferring all matters to the Senate and the Supreme Council. </p>
