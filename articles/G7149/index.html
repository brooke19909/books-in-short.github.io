    <p>  Hotel Alan Xafira Deluxe Resort Spa 5 * stands out for its favorable location.  It is located in a picturesque resort village called Turkler.  About 5 km is another coastal town Konakli.  The lively center of Alanya, with its shopping centers, markets and entertainment venues, is only 15 km away.  The equally famous resort town of Antalya is 110 km away.  It is worth saying that the nearest airport is in the city of Gazipasa, which is 60 km away.  But most tourists arrive at <span>Antalya Airport</span> , which is about 100 km away.  Naturally, travel agencies provide a transfer from the airport, but you should prepare for a long trip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What does the complex look like?
