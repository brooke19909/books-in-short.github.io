    <p>  A simple, translated, flip "Fool" begins with the preparation of the deck.  Usually use the one in which 36 cards, in rare cases, play 52-piece. </p><p>  Cards need to be well shuffled.  Usually the dealer, holding the deck in his hand, hands it to the player sitting to his left with the words: "Remove the cap from the fool."  This must be done, because the dealer can "cheat" and peek at the last card or put himself a trump card. </p><p>  These are the rules in the game "Fool."  The loser is appointed as the dealer in the next horse.  Take part in a tabletop battle from 2 to 6 people. </p><h2>  Distribution and moves </h2>

    <p>  After the deck is shuffled, 6 cards are dealt to everyone.  He puts the first manager of the deck to the participant sitting on his left hand.  When one card is dealt, also in a circle, clockwise, it is dealt in the second.  And so on until everyone has 6 cards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The next card from the deck is turned upside down and placed on the table.  This is a trump card, the remaining pile is stacked on it perpendicularly. </p><p>  The one with the smallest trump card begins to walk.  The goal of the game is to get rid of your cards as quickly as possible.  Whoever does this first is declared the winner.  The latter remains in the "fools", loses and deals cards for the next con. </p><h2>  Flip option </h2>

    <p>  These are the general rules in the game "Fool".  It is interesting to learn about certain nuances that correspond to different variations of the tabletop competition.  Just as in the simple, translated, flip variant, you can walk with 1-4 cards of the same value.  For example, with sixes or ten. </p><p>  The one to whom they are intended must beat them.  You can put the same suit of the highest value or a trump card.  When they are all repulsed, the one who walked has the right to give a similar one.  That is, if there is six on the table, he will throw 6 other suits. </p><p>  When the walker has nothing to throw, this is done by the next player sitting on his left hand.  That is, the one who is behind the beating.  He has the right to give so far only 1 card.  After it is beaten, the right to throw a card passes again to the one who walked.  It is very important to know the rules of the game in the ‚ÄúFool‚Äù thrown in order to comply with the detailed sequence.  Indeed, often the players try to quickly discard the cards they have, which leads to hustle and bustle.  There are more than 6 of them on the table. But in a single move, you can throw up only this number of cards.  But in this case, the batter can choose which card to cover. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the players have nothing to throw, they say that it‚Äôs ‚Äúbeaten,‚Äù and the move goes to the person who has just beaten off.  If he could not fight back, he must take all the turn cards and thrown. </p><p>  The rules of the game in "Fool" say that the first move should consist of no more than five thrown cards.  Cards from the deck get also in the order of the queue - first this right is granted to the walker, then, sitting on the left hand of him, clockwise. </p><p>  This is evidenced by the rules in the game "Fool."  The loser is announced when no one has cards left, and he has them. </p><h2>  The translated "Fool" </h2><p>  A very interesting kind of game.  First, in the same way as in the first case, cards are dealt.  The first move is carried out according to the same canons.  Starting from the second one, one or more cards of one denomination can be transferred.  So, if they went for six from you, you can put one or two sixes of another suit and transfer them to the one who sits on the left hand. </p>

    <p>  If he also has a six, he can translate it and those that lie on the table to the player sitting next clockwise.  These and some other rules of the game in "Fool" remain unchanged.  But there are others that need to be agreed upon before the start of an intellectual battle in order to reach a consensus. </p><p>  So, some offer to exchange an ace of trump, lying open under the deck, for a trump six.  You can come up with such additions to the rules that make the game even more exciting and interesting. </p>
