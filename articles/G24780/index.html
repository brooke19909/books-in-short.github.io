Five languages ‚Äã‚Äãare spoken here!  In Italian, French, Spanish, English and, of course, in Arabic.

The hotel allows children with absolutely any age and even offers discounts.  For example, if a child is not yet 12 years old at the time of residence, then only 25% of the total amount will have to be paid for him.  And if the little guest is very young, that is, he is not even two years old yet - he is accommodated for free and even provided with a cot.  The only caveat is that only one extra bed is possible in the room.  And two for children.  Only this should also be agreed in advance with the hotel.  Perhaps the only thing the hotel does not approve of and does not allow is the placement of pets.  But this can hardly be called a significant minus. </p><h2>  Reservation Information </h2><p>  If you decide to stay at this place, you should be aware of certain nuances of the reservation.
