    <h2>  Amazing city </h2><p>  This is not an exaggeration.  Nerja (Spain) developed as if autonomously, outside the new trends in the real estate market, the creative research of builders and promoters of tourism.  As a result, he grew up in one of the most attractive places on the Costa de Sol.  The town is located in the province of Malaga, the district of Andalusia.  Its area is very small, only 85 km2.  The population of Nerja (Spain) is only 22 thousand people, in Russia there are much more suburban villages.  But there is something to see here. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  If you have not been to Spain, we recommend you to go.  The history of this city is rooted deep in antiquity.  Even by the Romans, Nerja was founded.  Spain in those days divided its territory among many peoples who came to explore these blessed places.  The first name of the city has already been lost, and it received the modern one from the Arabs who came here in the VIII century.  In translation, the name means "heady spring."  Anyone who has seen the stunning nature of the resort <span>towns of Spain</span> understands well what is at stake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city developed rapidly, its strengths were agriculture and the production of silk products.  It was only in the 15th century that the <span>Spanish flag</span> was set here <span>,</span> despite the revolt of the Arabs who were deported from the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nerja Spain Attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1944469.jpg" width="530"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  If you have visited this blessed place at least once, then you probably want to repeat the trip again.  One of the main factors is the weather in Nerja.  Spain has a mild climate, which is especially noticeable in this area.  The unique microclimate makes the temperature in the sea a little warmer than in other places of the country.  Sudden changes in temperature are also not characteristic.  It is always warm and comfortable, but not too hot.  And the white sand on the beaches will delight adults and children. </p><h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  This is truly a world of sun and light, sea and heat.  Landscapes characteristic of the Mediterranean.  Palm trees, rocks and white sand are everywhere.  The beaches of Nerja (Spain) stretch for 16 km.  Most of them are decorated with a blue flag.  Sometimes tourists are confused by this symbol.  It means only one thing, here you can sunbathe and swim without any fear.  This insignia is placed by a special FEE commission to control the purity of water and sand.  Inspection takes place annually. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the vast territory there are semi-wild beaches that have retained their original appearance, as well as modern recreation areas equipped with all possible attributes of the tourist infrastructure.  Nature has created an amazing, bumpy terrain.  All beaches are separated from each other by picturesque, rocky ledges.  This makes them protected from wind and prying eyes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="caves nerja spain" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1944471.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to go to sunbathe </h2><p>  Beaches are what the city of Nerja is rightfully proud of.  Each year, Spain welcomes hundreds of tourists, discovering for each of them an amazing world of better relaxation under the gentle sun. </p><ul><li>  Playa El Playazo is the most western beach of the municipality, located away from urban infrastructure.  Large, comfortable and spacious, it is very successful.  During the summer holidays, night festivities are held here.  If you visited Spain in June, be sure to join.  This is a bright and amazing show. </li><li>  Playa La Torrecilla is relatively small, but very cozy, it is the second most visited.  It is only 300 meters long, 40 meters wide, and attendance is very high, so lovers of a secluded holiday should choose a different option.  The sand here is dark, there is parking for a car and a promenade for a walk, a toilet and a shower.  Umbrellas and sunbeds are available for rent at an additional cost, but you can sunbathe in the sand.  There are <span>beach restaurants.</span> </li><li>  Playa El is a tiny city beach, 200 meters long and 20 meters wide.  It is very popular among tourists.  It is located in a cozy bay surrounded by a natural coast.  There are houses cut down right in the rock, and narrow streets go straight down to the sand, giving a unique charm. </li><li>  Salon Beach is one of the most beautiful places on the coast that has witnessed a sad history.  When the region of Magali was conquered by Christians, Jews and Muslims were expelled from these lands.  For this, a number of large vessels arrived and took away those who refused to accept Christianity.  Here people forever said goodbye to friends and relatives. </li></ul><p>  It is impossible to list all the beaches, there are too many of them.  Therefore, we will stop at this and consider the rest of the sights of Nerja.  Spain is ready to open its arms in front of you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  World celebrity </h2><p>  Of course, we are talking about amazing caves.  They were opened in 1959 by local boys.  They became a great find for archaeologists due to the huge galleries and cave paintings.  In the distant Paleolithic times, these caves served as shelters and warehouses in which meat and skins were stored.  Today, the tourism industry has developed around: restaurants and cafes, parking and souvenir shops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nerja spain reviews" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1944474.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cave schedule </h2><p>  Nerja (Spain) is flooded with tourists all year round, and everyone wants to see stone grottoes and underground halls with their own eyes.  For the convenience of guests, a schedule has been worked out that regulates visiting hours.  From January to June, you are expected here from 10:00 to 14:00, as well as from 16:00 to 18:30.  July - August are the high season when the influx of tourists is the largest.  Caves at this time are open from 10:00 to 19:30.  From September to December, the schedule becomes the same. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  Not to be here means not to see Spain.  The sights of Nerja fascinate tourists at a glance, and years later they claim that if it is worth going somewhere, then only on these sunny shores.  Inspection of the cave is an immersion in a new world, in the unknown.  It formed about 5 million years ago.  Water penetrated through the cracks of the rock, gradually destroying it, washing out a huge cavity.  Gradually, water found a new path through the cave system and the formation of huge stalactites and stalagmites began.  The largest column in the world is located here, its height is 49 meters and its width is 18 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nerja spain hotels" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1944467.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Two halls </h2><p>  The cave is naturally divided into two parts.  Concrete walkways are laid in the interior rooms.  From the entrance, tourists descend 8 meters and enter the first hall, which is called the lobby.  Here you can see the exposition of objects that were found during excavations. </p><p>  By the way, it is impossible to get lost here, so you can take an independent trip.  And in order not to miss significant places, take a map.  After the first hall, you find yourself in Bethlehem, and then in the concert hall, where 100 seats are installed.  Further, tourists pass through the Phantom Hall and the Cataclysm Palace.  As you move through the cave, you can see the perfectly preserved cave paintings with stories of hunting animals.  The first people came to these places about 25,000 years BC, and lived here until the Bronze Age.  In the area, evidence was found that they kept pets and made dishes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in nerja spain" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1944470.jpg" width="555"></div>

    <h2>  Balcony of Europe </h2><p>  The highest point on the coast of Nerja (Spain).  Every tourist is simply obliged to take a photo for memory.  This magnificent observation deck today plays an exclusively decorative function, allowing you to explore the surroundings and make beautiful shots.  And once this platform, hanging over the sea, played a key role in protecting the city from attack.  There was a Watchtower and guns to deter the enemy.  Why is this site bearing such an interesting name?  It indicates that Europe ends here and on a clear day you can see Africa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nerja spain beaches" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1944472.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Aquila Aguila </h2><p>  Probably, there is no person in the world who would not admire these grandiose structures, the legacy of the Roman era.  Amazing their size and functionality, grandeur and efficiency, because even today they can perform their direct duties.  This water supply is located on the outskirts of the city.  It was built in the 19th century to supply the sugar factory with water.  Currently, the four-story aqueduct, consisting of 38 arches, continues to function and provides water for irrigation of residents of neighboring villages.  Do not deny yourself the pleasure of seeing this miracle in full working condition. </p><h2>  Watchtowers </h2><p>  The coastline used to be dotted with numerous watchtowers, which today are almost all destroyed.  They stood close together and could transmit signals in the event of an attack.  Today you can see: </p><ul><li>  Macaque Tower - 12 meters high, it is not without grace and beauty.  At one time, she defended the city from naval attacks. </li><li>  Maro Tower - controlled the Mediterranean Sea and surrounding land. </li></ul><p>  This excursion will especially appeal to history buffs.  The informative and fascinating stories of an experienced guide will make her even more interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nerja spain photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1944475.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  We are looking for the best hotels </h2><p>  Nerja (Spain) has a budget holiday.  This distinguishes it from many other resort towns on this coast.  Consider only a few of them, which annually collect the most tourist reviews: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúVilla Flamenco‚Äù - despite three stars, this is a great place for a family vacation.  Numerous reviews emphasize the perfect cleanliness of the rooms, the sparkling whiteness of the plumbing and bedding, and the exceptional courtesy of the staff.  The cost of tickets from 5000 rubles per day.  The stop is almost home, which attracts tourists.  Tourists are offered a 24-hour reception, a rental office offers to take bicycles and go for a walk, and in addition, there is a beautiful <span>roof terrace.</span> </li><li>  Chaparil Nerja Hotel - guests rate the quality of services as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù.  Only 10 minutes walk separates it from the main attractions and the Donkey Sanctuary.  The cost of accommodation is from 3300 rubles per day.  The hotel offers a wide range of services, including a 24-hour reception and a business center.  On the ground floor there is a wonderful restaurant, and within walking distance there are several cafes and eateries. </li></ul><h2>  Opinion of experienced tourists, reviews </h2><p>  Nerja (Spain) is almost a paradise on Earth, this opinion is confirmed by all who have already rested on this coast.  A wonderful climate, an abundance of opportunities for walking excursions, magnificent nature, amazing monuments of architecture, impressions will last for a year in advance.  Judging by the reviews, the local climate is also pleasing.  Soft, without drops, it is ideal for walking and sunbathing.  Children can frolic on the beach at least all day, and warm water in the sea beckons with its radiant surface.  Cons could not be found in Spain, with the exception of the wishes of Russian tourists, so that here too the hotels had rest on an all-inclusive basis. </p>
