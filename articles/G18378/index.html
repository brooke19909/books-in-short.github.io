    <p>  The concept of "learning technology" appeared in pedagogy in the 50s of the last century.  Initially, ‚Äúpedagogical technology‚Äù was related to learning, and the technology itself was learning using various technical means.  That is why many specialists distinguish the modern stage in pedagogical technology, which means the transition from traditional media (television, radio) to the so-called new technologies.  New <span>pedagogical teaching technologies</span> are computers, microelectronic and laser devices, computerized information storage systems, <span>communication channels</span> , etc. </p><p>  Teaching technologies in pedagogy are a set of methods, forms, educational tools and <span>teaching methods that</span> are systematically used in the educational process.  This is one of the significant ways to influence the learning, education and development of the student.  On the other hand, teaching technologies in pedagogy represent a whole science of the methods that a teacher uses to influence students through technical or information tools.  Each teacher can be considered the creator of technology, let this creation and will be with borrowings.  For a teacher who has learned to handle technology, in his developing state, the main process will be the cognitive process. </p><p>  <strong>Classification of educational technologies</strong> </p><p>  Studying pedagogical literature, one can notice that the teaching technologies in pedagogy are classified in different ways.  Below will be held the classification method G.K.Selevko, which is the most famous in pedagogical science. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  ¬∑ Depending on the level, such technologies as general pedagogical, private methodological and local are distinguished. </p><p>  ¬∑ On a philosophical basis, the following technologies are distinguished: dialectical and metaphysical, idealistic and materialistic, religious and scientific, theosophical and anthroposophical, existentialist and pragmatic, inhuman and humanistic, coercion and free education. </p><p>  ¬∑ According to the main factor of mental development: psychogenic, sociogenic, biogenic, idyllic. </p><p>  ¬∑ By orientation to personal structures - self-development technologies, information technologies, emotional-artistic, emotional-moral, heuristic and parish. </p><p>  ¬∑ By the <span>nature of the structure</span> and content - educating and teaching, religious and secular, technocratic and humanitarian, comprehensive and penetrating, industrial, private, as well as monotechnologies. </p><p>  ¬∑ By the type of management and organization of cognitive activity - classical lecture training, training using audiovisual technical means, training using the training book, program training, as well as systems of "small groups", "consultant", "tutor". </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be noted that an important aspect of pedagogical technologies is the attitude of adults to the child, as well as the place (position) of the child in the educational process.  Based on this, the following teaching technologies in pedagogy are distinguished: </p><p>  ¬∑ Authoritarian - the teacher acts as the sole <span>subject of the educational process,</span> for the student - this is only an ‚Äúobject‚Äù. </p><p>  ¬∑ Didactocentric - the subject-object relationship between the teacher and the student dominates, while the predominant education is education. </p><p>  ¬∑ Person-oriented learning technologies - at the center of the entire <span>educational system is</span> the child‚Äôs personality, ensuring conflict-free, safe and comfortable conditions for its development.  The personality of the child, based on this technology, is a subject of priority. </p><p>  ¬∑ Human-personal relations - a humanistic essence, a psychotherapeutic focus on supporting the individual. </p><p>  ¬∑ Technologies of cooperation - democracy, partnership, equality in the subjective relations of the student and teacher. </p><p>  ¬∑ Technologies of free education - emphasize providing the student with independence and freedom of choice in the field of his life. </p><p>  ¬∑ Esoteric technologies - they are based on the doctrine of esoteric knowledge - the truth and the paths that lead to it. </p>
