    <h2>  What are microwave ovens? </h2><p>  Modern household stoves are divided into three categories.  The first of them includes devices in which only microwaves are used to heat products.  These include solo microwaves.  In the second type of devices, a grill is provided.  They are also heated by microwaves.  In the third category, there is a combination of the possibilities of grilling, microwaves, as well as convection.  There is another special kind of kitchen appliances.  These are <span>invertor furnaces.</span>  They are being developed by Panasonic.  Before deciding which microwave oven to choose, you need to familiarize yourself with the existing types of kitchen assistants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Microwave device </h2><p>  Solo microwave ovens are the simplest.  That is why they belong to the products of a low price category.  Such furnaces are equipped with microwaves only.  This makes it possible to use them exclusively for heating and thawing food.  Dishes that you can cook using this appliance will be an amateur.  In fact, the products are boiled in this oven in their own juice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a microwave" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/338820.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is impossible to bake them in such a device.  If you need a microwave only for heating, defrosting, and also for preparing the most simple dishes (for example, boiled potatoes), then the ‚Äúsolo‚Äù option will suit you.  It does not make sense to overpay for additional features (grill and convection) if these functions are not used.

    <h2>  Microwaves combined with grill </h2><p>  The second category includes devices equipped with additional functions.  This, for example, is a microwave oven with a grill.  Customer reviews indicate the great capabilities of the device.  In such an oven you can bake meat, as well as poultry, make sandwiches, toasts and much more.  The grill, which is an additional function in such devices, is produced in two types.  The first of them is TENovy, and the second - quartz.  Each species has its own advantages.  Each of them has disadvantages. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many microwave ovens are equipped with a TEN grill.  It is a tube with a heating element located inside.  It is placed in the working chamber, or rather, in its upper part.  There are electric heating grills.  They are easy to move.  At the same time, they can be installed either obliquely or vertically.  This is especially convenient when cooking various dishes in the grill mode.  A camera with a movable heating element is much easier to wash.  Microwave models have been developed where, in addition to the upper grill, there is also a lower one. </p><p>  Reviews of microwave ovens equipped with a quartz lamp indicate the compactness of the placement of the heating device. </p>

    <p>  Such a grill is located on the upper wall of the device.  This allows you to increase the usable space of the inner chamber.  Quartz grill is more economical and able to quickly gain operating power.  Moreover, the effect of cooking in such a microwave oven is reminiscent of the effect of open fire. </p><h2>  Convection, microwave and grill appliances </h2><p>  This is a cooking technique that belongs to the third category.  Convection microwave oven is chosen by those buyers who want to receive a wide range of possibilities from the device.  Such models are equipped with a grill and a built-in fan.  There is also a ring-type heating element in the devices.  When you turn on the microwave, the fan starts to work.  Its functions include uniform distribution of heated air inside the chamber.  Thanks to this action, the products are fried and baked.  If you do not know how to choose a microwave, then look at the reviews of customers who have already purchased these models.  Consumers praised the wide opportunities offered by their use.  In the device, where the microwaves, convection and grill modes are combined, you can not only stew meat and bake chicken in high quality, but also fry pies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And this is not a complete list of those dishes that such a microwave can cook.  Manufacturers point to the possibility of these models to become an equal substitute for the oven. </p><h2>  Inverter Domestic Ovens </h2><p>  Panasonic uses advanced technologies that have been used to create technology.  One of them is inverter.  The principle of this technology is to install a specific mechanism that allows for a gradual increase or decrease in the output power of the furnace.  In other types of microwaves, this process controls the pulse mode. </p><p>  Cooking in inverter ovens takes less time.  At the same time, the products warm up more naturally and retain their texture as well as nutritional characteristics as much as possible.  This is made possible by the soft penetration of microwave energy.  Inverter furnaces also have a large chamber volume, as they are equipped with compact parts. </p><h2>  Microwave Control Type </h2><p>  Models of microwave ovens currently available can be equipped with mechanical or sensor systems.  The type of control depends on the complexity of the model.  How to choose a microwave?  What type of management is preferable?  Each of them has its own specific advantages and disadvantages.  So, mechanical control involves the use of mechanics alone.  The stove is equipped only with rotary handles.  With their help, a certain grill mode, power level is selected, and the time on the timer is also set.  This system is more reliable in operation.  Moreover, its disadvantage is manual control and independent selection of the necessary parameters. </p>

It is no coincidence that such models of kitchen appliances are very popular among consumers today.  A microwave oven equipped with a touch control panel has a more attractive appearance.  Its main advantage is the ability to accurately set the necessary time and parameters for preparing a variety of dishes.  However, mechanical control is considered more reliable in operation.

    <p>  Recently, the most modern microwave models have been produced.  They are equipped not only with electronic control, but also with the possibility of dialogue with the owner.  The main advantages of these developments is a minimum of buttons with a large number of operating modes. </p><h2>  Microwave volume </h2><p>  Before answering the question of how to choose a microwave oven, you need to decide on the main parameters of the device.  One of them is the useful volume of the camera.  There are various models on the market.  Their volumes can range from thirteen to forty-two liters.  There is a certain pattern between this parameter and the type of microwave oven.  Microwaves of the solo category are usually small in size.  Their volumes, as a rule, are not more than twenty-five liters.  Microwaves equipped with convection and grill have larger dimensions.  Their volume usually exceeds twenty eight liters. </p><p>  How to choose a microwave?  Reviews of Russian consumers indicate the most popular devices with a volume of twenty-seven liters.  When buying a furnace, you should pay attention to the diameter of the existing pan.  It hosts dishes.  The larger the pallet is, the more products can fit on it. </p><h2>  Microwave oven power consumption </h2><p>  Usually all types of microwaves consume a very large amount of electricity.  The leaders in this matter are models equipped with convection and grill.  When using all these functions, power is summed up simultaneously.  In this regard, when deciding on how to choose a microwave oven, it is necessary to take into account its energy intensity.  Check necessary and wiring in the house.  For a three-function device, it will need at least ten amperes. </p><h2>  Inner coating </h2><p>  A special material must be applied to the wall surface in the working chamber.  Most often, enamel is used to coat microwave ovens.  It is durable and smooth.  Moreover, such material is convenient to clean. </p>

    <p>  In microwave ovens belonging to the premium class, the walls of the chamber are made of stainless steel.  This material is most resistant to damage and high temperatures.  That is why such a coating is more durable and reliable. </p><h2>  Additional functions and operating modes </h2><p>  The selection of a kitchen assistant model should be based on many parameters.  Attention should be paid to additional functions and operating modes of the device.  Many microwave ovens are equipped with automatic heating programs.  Moreover, they are designed for certain types of products.  The same functions exist for automatic defrosting and cooking.  They are designed for the set of products that is most common. </p><p>  Some microwave models have the ability to create their own programs.  Subsequently, they can be entered into the memory of the device.  This is convenient if standard programs do not meet your culinary needs. </p><p>  An additional function of almost all microwave ovens is a sound signal.  It indicates the end of the device.  On some models, the signal is continuous.  Some types of stoves are equipped with short repeating bells. </p><p>  The choice of a microwave oven may also depend on the presence of an audio timer in it.  It is not related to the operation of the device, but helps the user to detect the time necessary for cooking. </p><p>  Some companies (for example, LG) equip their microwave ovens with double boiler.  This is a stainless steel lid fixture that prevents microwaves from entering products.  The main function of the device is to heat the water in the lower compartment and turn it into steam.  Samsung's appliance models make it possible to cook at two levels simultaneously.  The LG microwave, equipped with the steam dish function, has a specificity - even eggs can be cooked in it. </p><p>  The manufacturer can equip the device with a multilevel plate grid.  This device will allow you to heat more dishes.  The plates will be placed one on top of the other. </p>

    <h2>  Built-in appliances </h2><p>  Most people associate microwave ovens with appliances that take up a lot of space on the table.  However, many manufacturers began to produce devices in a different design.  <span>The built-in microwave</span> does not reduce the working space of the kitchen.  It is located, as a rule, in kitchen furniture.  At the same time, the much-needed space is saved on the table.  In addition, if the furnace is placed at eye level, it will greatly facilitate the loading and removal of products from it. </p><p>  The main thing that built-in microwaves need is to ensure that there is enough airflow to remove heat.  Otherwise, the device may overheat and fail. </p><p>  <span>The built-in microwave is</span> always equipped with a cooling fan.  And to make the device work as efficient as possible, you should leave a gap between the microwave and the back wall.  Such a space is necessary for unhindered flow of cold and outflow of heated air. </p><p>  <span>Microwaves</span> can be <span>placed in the kitchen in</span> various ways.  Sometimes the appliance is suspended above the work table, and sometimes it forms a column with an oven.  A microwave can be integrated among drawers of kitchen furniture.  In any case, the location of the device is a matter of taste for the owners. </p><p>  Many models of free-standing microwave ovens can be integrated into kitchen furniture.  For this, special frames are produced.  They are produced in various colors to harmonize with the design of the kitchen. </p><h2>  Microwaves Daewoo </h2><p>  Currently, the company "Daewoo" is the undisputed leader among manufacturers of household appliances.  Moreover, the company's products have a number of distinctive features.  So, Daewoo microwave ovens combine low price and decent performance.  Among the models there are solo devices, as well as more universal equipment. </p><p>  All Daewoo microwaves have a stylish design.  Consumers like the simplicity of their management and high power.  The company has developed a wide range of devices.  At the same time, on sale you can see all types of furnaces - from "solos" to combined ones.

There are models that allow you to bake pancakes. </p><p>  For cooking home-made pizza or heating frozen food in such ovens a special compartment is provided.  In this regard, in such devices several dishes can be placed at once.  This can significantly save time and energy. </p><p>  The Daewoo company has developed a universal heating system.  It is called 3D Power.  Such furnaces are equipped not with two, but with three heating elements.  They are placed on top, bottom and sides of the working chamber. </p><p>  Models are produced in which forced convection is carried out.  This allows air to circulate evenly in the cooking chamber.  Food with a crispy crust will help prepare models equipped with a grill.  The company also offers solo furnaces.  The choice of such devices is recommended to those consumers who see the main purpose of the equipment in heating and defrosting products. </p><p>  One of the most popular models is the KOR-6L05.  The device has a chamber volume of twenty liters.  It is freestanding, but it does not take up much space.  Such a microwave oven will serve as a wonderful helper for a young family.
