    <p>  The ancient cities of Turkey are of interest to tourists due to the preserved monuments of historical heritage of various eras.  Many travelers begin their voyage through the territory of the former <span>Ottoman Empire</span> with a visit to Istanbul.  But the <span>resort towns of</span> Turkey, located along the picturesque Aegean coast, where tourists can visit the ruins of Pergamum and Troy, Miletus and Ephesus, Didima and Priene, are especially attractive.  Thanks to the development of tourist infrastructure, travelers will be able to choose an excellent hotel on the Aegean or Mediterranean coast for accommodation, and then combine a beach holiday with exciting excursion programs that allow you to see amazing masterpieces of architecture. </p><p>  Russian tourists most often choose such cities in Turkey as Antalya and Alanya for recreation, where there are many places of nightlife, discos and clubs, restaurants of Turkish and international cuisine.  Alanya is famous for its sandy and large-pebbled beaches, and tired of relaxing on the beach, travelers will be able to go on sightseeing.  These include the Red Tower and the Alanian fortress erected in the 13th century, the ruins of the Roman city of Justiniano, the ruins of ancient Syedra and a shipyard, as well as a stalactite cave. </p><p>  Considering the best cities of Turkey for summer holidays, we can distinguish the town of Side, located at a distance of seventy kilometers from Antalya and is often called the "open-air museum".  The resort is famous for its sandy beaches, restaurants and hotels along the coast, casinos and cafes, as well as interesting sights.  The old part of the city is surrounded by well-preserved city walls, and inside the historic quarters you can go through the city gate, next to which are two powerful towers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among the attractions is the Nymphaeum fountain, an ancient agora, which in ancient times was a slave market, and restored ancient Roman baths.  Beyond the walls of the resort town is the famous cemetery "East Necropolis", the ruins of the temples of Athens and Apollo, the picturesque waterfall Managvat.  And if desired, travelers can go to the ancient cities of Perge and Aspendos located in the vicinity of Side. </p><p>  If you are not attracted to the <span>large cities of Turkey,</span> you can go to the resort village of Kemer, located not far from Antalya, which until recently was a small fishing village.  It is located on the site of Ancient Lycia, and its territory can be examined during short walks. </p><p>  <span>Kemer's attractions</span> include the Yoruk Park entertainment center, the design of which resembles the ancient nomad camp, and visitors will be able to observe the work of the craftsmen and dine in a restaurant made in the form of a yurt.  Tourists will also like Moonlight Park, where there is a dolphinarium, small shops and golf courses.  During <span>a vacation</span> in Kemer, travelers will be able to go on excursions to the burning Mount Yanartash, to the ancient cities of Demre and Phaselis, to the island of Kekova. </p><p>  Choosing the cities of Turkey for winter holidays, you can pay attention to Bursa, located just thirty-five kilometers from the resort of Uludag, where excellent conditions for skiing are created.  Staying in Bursa, tourists can combine <span>skiing</span> with sightseeing from the Ottoman Empire.  This is the Green Mosque built in the 15th century, located next to the temple of the Mausoleum of Mehmed, the tomb of Gazi Osman, medieval caravanserais and many minarets.  To feel the national color of Bursa, you need to go to the Charshi area, where you can buy the finest lace, silk products, luxurious fabrics and all kinds of souvenirs in the eastern bazaar. </p>
