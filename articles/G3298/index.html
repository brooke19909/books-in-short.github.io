History of Rus before Baptism</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Vedic Russia ... How many know this concept?  When did it exist?  What are its features?  It is known that this state existed in the pre-Christian period.  <span>The history of</span> Vedic <span>Russia</span> has been little studied.  Many facts are distorted to please the new rulers.  Meanwhile, Russia of those times was a developed civilized society. </p><p>  Thus, value in ancient Russian society was considered not numerous wealth, but faith in the gods.  Russ swore with their weapons and their God - Perun.  If the oath is broken, then "we will be golden," said Svyatoslav, despising gold. </p><p>  The ancient Rusichs lived with reliance on the Vedas.  The Vedic past of Russia is shrouded in many secrets.  But nevertheless, the researchers did a lot of work and already today a lot of interesting information can be told about that far pre-Christian period.  The history of Vedic Russia will be told further. </p><h2>  What is the Vedas </h2><p>  The Vedas are scriptures, revelations of God.  They describe the nature of the world, the true essence of man and his soul. </p><p>  The literal translation of the word is "knowledge."  This knowledge is scientific, not a selection of myths and fairy tales.  When translating a word from Sanskrit, and this is the native language of the Vedas, it means "apaurusheya" - that is, "not created by man." </p><p>  In addition to spiritual knowledge, the Vedas contain information that helps people live happily ever after.  For example, the knowledge that organizes a person’s living space from building a house to living without disease and in abundance.  The Vedas are knowledge that helps to prolong life, explain the connection of the human microcosm with the macrocosm, and much more, up to the planning of important initiatives in life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Vedas originated in India, becoming the beginning of Indian culture.  The time of their appearance can only be assumed, since external sources appeared much later than the Vedas themselves.  Initially, knowledge was transmitted orally for many millennia.  The design of one of the parts of the Vedas dates back to the 5th century BC.  e. </p><p>  A detailed record of the Vedas is attributed to the sage Srila Vyasadeva, who lived in the Himalayas more than fifty centuries ago.  His name “Vyasa” translates as “editor,” that is, one who was able to “split and write.” </p><p>  Knowledge is divided into the Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda.  They contain prayers or mantras and knowledge in many disciplines. </p><p>  The oldest manuscript is the text of the Rigveda, written in the 11th century BC.  e.  The fragility of materials - wood bark or palm leaves on which the Vedas were applied, did not contribute to their safety. </p><p>  We learn about the Vedas through the mnemonic rules of memorization and their oral transmission, based on the Sanskrit language. </p><p>  The knowledge transmitted by the Vedas is confirmed by modern scholars.  So, even before the discovery of Copernicus in the Vedas, using astronomical calculations, it was calculated at what distance are the planets of our system from the Earth. </p>

    <h2>  Russian Vedas </h2><p>  Scientists speak of two branches of Vedic knowledge - Indian and Slavic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Russian Vedas survived less due to the influence of various religions. </p><p>  By comparing the linguistics and archeology of Russia and India, you can see that their historical roots are similar and can be shared. </p><p>  The following examples can be used as evidence: </p><ul><li>  The name and archaeological features of the city of Arkaim, whose remains were discovered in Russia in the Urals, are similar to Indian cities. </li><li>  Siberian rivers and rivers of Central Russia have Sanskrit names. </li><li>  The similarity of pronunciation and features of the Russian language and Sanskrit. </li></ul><p>  Scientists conclude that the flowering of a single Vedic culture took place on the territory from the shores of the northern seas to the southernmost point of the Indian Peninsula. </p><p>  Slavic-Aryan Vedas are considered to be Russian - this is the name of the collection of documents reflecting human life on Earth for more than 600,000 years.  The Slavic Vedas also include the Veles Book.  According to the scientists N. Nikolaev and V. Skurlatov, the book contains a picture of the past of the Russian-Slavic people.  In it, Russians are presented as “grandchildren of Dazhdbog”, the forefathers Bogumir and Ohr are described, the story is about the resettlement of the Slavs on the territory of the Danube.  It is described in the Veles Book about farming Slavic-Russes and about a system of peculiar worldview and mythology. </p>

    <h2>  Magi </h2><p>  Magi were considered to be wise people with knowledge.  Their activities extended to many areas of life.  So, witches were engaged in household affairs and rituals.  The word "after all - ma" meant "to know" and "mother" - "woman".  They “knew” matters that could be solved with the help of household magic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Magi-sorcerers, called Dyds or grandfathers, were well versed in sacred legends.  Among the sorcerers of magicians there were representatives of both the simplest quackery and owners of serious scientific knowledge. </p><p>  The Magi of Vedic Russia became famous among the Slavs for their instructions, help in establishing life and in the desire to understand God's Faith.  They were considered sorcerers who were well acquainted with herbalism, fortune telling, healing and prediction. </p><p>  In the "Word on Igor's Regiment" there is a mention of <span>Vseslav Polotsky, also</span> called the Magus Vseslavievich.  Being a princely son, Vseslav the Prophet had the ability to turn into a gray wolf, a clear falcon or bay tour, as well as to guess and arrange obsessions.  The prince's son learned from the Magi, where his father gave him to study. </p><p>  With the advent of Christianity, the Magi revered in Russia participated in oppositions against the new faith.  Their activities were recognized as illegal, and they themselves were called evil sorcerers, criminals and warlocks, apostates.  They were accused of being associated with demons and of wanting to bring evil to people. </p><p>  The well-known and described in detail event occurred in Novgorod, when the rebellion against the new religion was organized by the sorcerer.  People sided with the sage, but Prince Gleb Svyatoslavich did a vile act.  The prince hacked the organizer of the rebellion with an ax.  The name of the sorcerer is unknown, but the strength of faith of the sage and his supporters is impressive. </p><p>  Before the baptism of Rus, the popularity of the Magi was often greater than the popularity of the princes.  Perhaps it was this fact that influenced the eradication of paganism in the Slavic lands.  The danger to the princes was the influence of the Magi on people as <span>spiritual mentors.</span>  And the representatives of the Christian church did not doubt the witchcraft and magical abilities of these people. </p><p>  Among the magi there were people who were called scammers, guslars and baeniks.  They not only played musical instruments, but also told epics and tales. </p>

    <h2>  Famous Magi </h2><p>  The Old Russian singer Boyan the Prophet is involved in the Magi.  One of his gifts was the ability to transform. </p><p>  The famous Magi - priests include the Bogomil Nightingale.  He was so called for his eloquence and for the execution of pagan narratives.  He gained his fame for organizing an uprising against the destruction of the temple and pagan shrines in Novgorod. </p><p>  With the advent of Christianity in Russia, the magi were persecuted and destroyed.  So, in the 15th century in Pskov, “prophetic wives” of twelve people were burned.  By order of Aleksei Mikhailovich, in the 17th century, magicians were burned at bonfires and chests were buried in the ground, as well as “wise” people were exiled to monasteries. </p><h2>  When and how did pre-Christian Russia arise </h2><p>  The exact time when Vedic Russia arose was unknown.  But there is information about the erection of the First Temple by the wizard Kolovras, there is also a date calculated by astrologers - 20-21 millennium BC.  e.  Built of rough stones, without the use of iron, the Temple towered on Alatyr Mountain.  Its appearance is associated with the first exodus of the Rus tribe from the north. </p><p>  The Arians who came from ancient Iran and India as early as the third millennium BC settled on Russian soil.  e.  they settled on Belovodye, where Bogumir taught them art and craft.  He, being the forefather of the Slavs, divided people into soldiers, priests, merchants, artisans and others.  The capital of the Aryans in the Urals was called Kayle - a city, now it is called Arkaim. </p>

    <h2>  Society of Vedic Russia </h2><p>  Initially, Russ developed centers of development - the city of Kiev in the south and the city of Novgorod in the north. </p><p>  The Russians have always shown goodwill and respect to other nations, and were distinguished by their sincerity. </p><p>  Before the baptism, Rus were in Slavic society and slaves - servants from captive foreigners.  The Russians traded servants, but considered them the youngest members of the family.  Slaves were in slavery for a certain period, after which they became free.  Such relationships were called patriarchal slavery. </p><p>  The place of residence of the Slovenerans was clan and inter-clan settlements, up to 50 people lived in large houses. </p><p>  The community was headed by a prince, subordinate to the national assembly - the veche.  Princely decisions have always been made taking into account the opinions of military leaders, “didovs” and elders of the clans. </p><p>  Communication based on equality and justice took into account the interests of all members of the community.  Living according to the laws of the Vedas, the Rus possessed a rich worldview and great knowledge. </p><h2>  Culture </h2><p>  We know about the culture of Vedic Russia from preserved cathedrals, archaeological finds and monuments of oral narratives - epics. </p><p>  The cultural level of the Rus can be judged by the statements of Princess Anne, daughter of Yaroslav the Wise, who became Queen of France.  She brought books with her and considered “enlightened" France a large village. </p><p>  "Unwashed" Russia impressed travelers by the presence of baths and the cleanliness of the Slavs. </p><p>  Numerous temples and sanctuaries amazed with their magnificence and architecture. </p>

    <h2>  Vedic temples </h2><p>  Above each settlement, a temple dedicated to the <span>Vedic God was</span> towering <span>.</span>  The very word "temple" meant a mansion, a rich house.  The altar was named after the sacred mountain Alatyr, the elevation of "pulpit" for the priest to give a speech came from "mov", which means "to say a speech." </p><p>  The most beautiful churches of Vedic Russia towered above the Holy Ural Mountains near Konzhakovsky stone, over Azov - a mountain in the Sverdlovsk region, over Iremel - a mountain near Chelyabinsk. </p><p>  Many Christian churches preserved images of pagan gods, mythological animals and Slavic symbols.  For example, on a stone bas-relief of the Dmitrov Cathedral there is an image of the ascension of Dazhdbog. </p><p>  You can get acquainted with the examples of temple art of the <span>ancient Slavs</span> in the temple of the ratar - approved in Retra. </p><h2>  Legends </h2><p>  Many tales and legends of Vedic Russia were transmitted orally.  Some have changed over time.  But even now, the texts of the Veles Book, The Words of Igor’s Regiment, Boyan Hymn and Dobryn and the Snake recreate the picture of the past, the legendary history of Vedic Russia. </p><p>  Restored by the writer G. A. Sidorov, these written monuments amaze with the treasury and depth of knowledge of the Russian Orthodox.  In the collection of the writer you can get acquainted with the Dead Heart, the daughter of Lada, the legends about the temple of Svarog, Ruevita, volot, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Symbols of Vedic Russia </h2><p>  <span>Pagan symbols</span> are associated with the secret meanings of priestly art.  They were not worn at all for decoration, as some think, but to achieve a magical effect and sacred meaning. </p><p>  Highest wisdom and justice is attributed to the Bogodar, the symbol of paternal guardianship and patronage of the Human race.  A symbol especially revered by the guardian priests of Wisdom and the Human race. </p><p>  The symbol of the Theotokos corresponds to the Eye of God, which helps people.  It consists of the eternal protection of the Light Gods for developing and spiritually perfecting people.  With the help of the Light Gods, the actions of the universal elements are realized. </p><p>  The symbol of Belobog is attributed to bestowing good and good luck, love and happiness.  The creators of the world are the <span>Gods Chernobog</span> and Belobog, who is also called Belbog, Svyatovit, Svetovik, Sventovit. </p>
