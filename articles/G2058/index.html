They do not like the lack of musical accompaniment in the restaurant during meals.  The water in the pools is cool.  Children refused to bathe in it.  There is no equipped descent to the sea.  I have to use the track of a neighboring hotel. </p><p>  The quality of data transfer in the local network, according to tourists, is disgusting.  There are also complaints about room cleaning.  Dust is not wiped daily.  Maids neglect mopping.  In the morning there is no pressure of hot water.  The hotel is compared with a Soviet sanatorium.  There are a lot of pensioners in it.  The main audience are visitors from the UK.  There are few Russians. </p><p>  The water in the pools smells strongly of bleach.  Many rooms need redecorating.  Food in restaurants does not correspond to the 5 * hotel category.  The apartment has worn furniture and old equipment.  According to the guests, there are holes and spots on the carpet in the hall and corridor.  Boring in the evenings.  Discos in the hotel are not held.  The restaurant is sometimes dirty.  In the morning, cool food is served. </p>
