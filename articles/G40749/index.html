What they just do not use for their work ... Bright flowers from satin ribbons, a gingerbread house, acorns from coffee beans, a <span>basket of newspapers,</span> crochet, patchwork ... In this article we will talk about how to make an Easter egg in do-it-yourself quilling technique. </p><h2>  Quilling technique </h2><p>  Quilling is a type of needlework.  The source material is long thin strips of paper of different colors.  They are twisted into spirals from which voluminous compositions are created.  Elements are glued together, as a result, very interesting models are obtained.  This technique can be used to decorate a room, create jewelry, decorate gifts. </p><p>  For this needlework there is no need for large expenses, no special tools are required.  Any work can be done with handy colored double-sided paper, glue, scissors, tweezers, pair of compasses, a ruler, a pencil, a stencil and a rod. </p><p>  In addition, this type of needlework requires accuracy and perseverance.  Before you begin to perform work in this technique, you must first master the basic types of twisting.  There are about thirty spiral twisting elements.  All of them involve three steps: roll up, glue, pinch.  Finished spirals are pinched into different shapes, from which the final work is then created. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Quilling Easter egg.

    <h2>  Easter symbol </h2><p>  The egg is a symbol of the main religious holiday of Orthodoxy.  It symbolizes life, since it is itself the source of a new life.  The red color in which the <span>Easter eggs are</span> painted symbolizes the blood of the crucified Christ.  Thus, Orthodox Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus.  One of the most beautiful legends is associated with the tradition of dyeing <span>eggs for Easter</span> .  The Roman emperor Tiberius received an egg from Mary Magdalene with the words "Christ has risen."  He was surprised and said that no one could be resurrected.  And then the egg began to blush. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Smart easter egg </h2><p>  The Easter egg made using the quilling technique is very elegant.  The master class offers a step-by-step instruction on how to complete this craft. </p><p>  First, make a blank.  To do this, take a raw egg, apply a puncture from two ends with a thin needle and blow out the contents.  Leave for a day or two to dry. </p><p>  At the next stage, we proceed to the manufacture of curls.  They will need so many to complete any drawing.  We will make a chicken on a background of blue sky and grass, so we will prepare the following amount: blue and green pieces of 10-15 each, depending on the size of the original workpiece;  2-3 white for clouds;  two yellow and two red for the chicken;  6 pieces of red and yellow for stand. </p>

    <p>  Now you can decorate our egg.  First, make a stand.  We will give the curls a look of a drop and glue them together, for which we use PVA glue. </p><p>  Next, at one end of the egg we lay out two rows of grass and put the egg on a stand.  It should be placed on a small sheet of paper and now you can easily rotate it to stick the rest of the picture.  We put a chicken on the grass, then there is a sky with clouds.  We give our craft to dry well and the quilling Easter egg is ready.  The photo shows what a wonderful decoration of the festive table it will be. </p><h2>  Different ideas </h2><p>  Different may be an Easter egg using the quilling technique.  The master class shows several ways to make this craft. </p><p>  You can decorate a wooden egg blank with a plot pattern or simply decorate it with flowers. </p><p>  You can make decoration for the festive table in the form of a basket with Easter eggs.  As a basis for it, we use a cheese box, which we decorate with paper curls at our discretion.  We make the handle out of cardboard and also decorate it.  We glue the bottom of the box with velvet paper and cover it with weed cut from green paper.  Now we are doing the quilling Easter egg.  How to make it, consider in more detail.  From colored paper we wind 16-20 pieces of washers.  They must be tight.  Then carefully squeeze out half of the egg from each washer and glue 2 pieces together.  It turns out a bright Easter egg using the quilling technique.  The master class demonstrates how it is carried out.  We fill the basket with these elegant eggs and use it as a decoration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY quilling Easter egg" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1095545.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The application will be performed on white cardboard, its edges can be decorated with curly scissors. </p><p>  Now prepare the curls: 4 beige with a diameter of 15 mm, from which we make triangles;  6 purple bend in the form of a drop and glue a flower from them;  2 blue and 2 pink with a diameter of 25 mm bend into a drop;  if there are empty places, we will prepare for them a few tight curls.  We lay out the application on the cardboard in the form of an egg and make a stand of three yellow curls.  It turned out a very original Easter egg using the quilling technique, the master class of which is quite simple to manufacture. </p><h2>  Gift </h2><p>  Creating original things with your own hands from thin colored stripes gives a joyful mood.
