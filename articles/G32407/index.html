Few people know where most of them came from and what they owe their appearance to.  But to get acquainted with the most interesting of them and find out how the catchphrases “Geese of Rome saved” and “money doesn’t smell” arose. </p><h2>  The Roman Empire </h2><p>  Sounds absurd, right?  But this is only at first glance, if a little deeper into the story, everything will immediately become clear.  This expression appeared in the days of the Ancient Roman Empire, when this country was not yet considered a great power.  In its capital, Rome, the first sprouts of trade and other features were just beginning to appear, which gave impetus to progress. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how winged expressions of geese rome rescued" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/390052.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  During the period of its rise, Rome had to survive many attacks of enemy tribes, at which time the winged expressions “the geese of Rome saved” and others appeared.  One of the attackers was the Gauls, the tribes who became the progenitors of the modern inhabitants of France.  According to legend, the Gauls decided to attack Rome in order to conquer a country whose wine they liked. </p><h2>  How geese rome saved </h2><p>  The Gauls under the command of Brenn almost captured Rome, and the surviving inhabitants hid on Capitol Hill.  He was impregnable, so it was impossible to get there unnoticed.  However, there was a secret path, which the Gauls at first was not aware of, but they soon found out and went to besiege the people on the hill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When the Gauls tried to make their way along the path, the Romans were already sleeping in a dead sleep and only geese could save them.  How?  They just made a fuss when the enemies got up and woke the sentries, that's how winged expressions arose.  “The geese of Rome were saved,” the etymology of these <span>winged words</span> is still unknown to many, although they are used quite often, so you should remember the act of “geese-heroes.” </p><h2>  Money doesn't smell </h2><p>  Pecunia non olet (lat. “Money does not smell”) is a well-known expression, the origin of which few people are aware of. </p>

His son Titus was very surprised by his father’s behavior and was deeply indignant when he learned that his father was ready to take such desperate measures to replenish the state treasury.

    <p>  When the first funds received from taxes on latrines were delivered to Vespasian, he showed them to his son, Titus, and asked if they smell.  Money, of course, did not smell, although, as the emperor himself put it, they were received from urine. </p><p>  This is how the catchphrases “geese saved Rome” and “money don't smell” arose.  To date, both of these expressions are well known and widely used. </p>
