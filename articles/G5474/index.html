    <h2>  Device Overview </h2><p>  Notebook ASUS EeeBook X205TA is often called an ultraportable device - because of its very modest dimensions.  The display of the device is also quite compact - its diagonal is 11.6 inches.  The device belongs to the category of budget decisions, and therefore the target audience of its customers is represented by a variety of social groups.  But saving on the purchase of a laptop, the user may be faced with the need to invest in the purchase of an optical drive, which is not in the device. </p><h2>  Regional modifications </h2><p>  It is worth noting that there are several regional modifications of such a device as a laptop ASUS EeeBook X205TA - FD027BS, FD015BS, FD005 BS.  What does it mean? </p><p>  Notebook ASUS EeeBook X205TA FD015BS, in particular, is common in the Russian market.  Other devices also have a regional specification.  The name of the laptops may contain the name of the largest American search engine Bing - the device data is thus configured to search in the corresponding system by default. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  For example, a laptop localized for the market of the Russian Federation and Belarus may have the name ASUS EeeBook X205TA Bing FD027BS.  There is another modification of the corresponding device common in the Russian Federation.  Its name is ASUS EeeBook X205TA Bing FD015BS.  What other laptop modifications can be found on the market? </p><p>  In particular, the ASUS EeeBook X205TA FD005BS device is often found in catalogs of stores selling abroad.  That is, in particular, outside the EAEU.  Of course, the device may also be called the ASUS EeeBook X205TA Bing FD005BS.  It is worth noting that there is practically no significant technological difference between the noted modifications of the device.  Notebook ASUS EeeBook X205TA FD207BS will generally have the same characteristics and features as other versions of the device.  The determining parameter in this case is the X205TA index. </p>

    <p>  But those laptops that have Bing in their name, for example, ASUS EeeBook X205TA Bing FD015BS, will differ from those that do not have a search engine name, focus on the corresponding service.  Devices that do not have the word Bing in their names can by default use another search engine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Now consider the key features of the laptop ASUS EeeBook X205TA.  These can be represented in the following list: </p><p>  - the laptop display, as we noted above, has a diagonal of 11.6 inches, and its resolution is 1366 by 768 pixels, it is equipped with LED-backlight; </p><p>  - the device has an <span>Intel Atom Z3735F processor installed,</span> which has 4 cores, operates at a clock frequency of 1.33 GHz (which can be overclocked to 3.3 GHz), has a 2-level cache memory of 2 MB and operates at a power of 2.2 W ; </p><p>  - The laptop video subsystem is represented by the Intel HD graphics module; </p><p>  - the amount of RAM installed in the device is 2 GB, RAM is represented by modules of the DDR3-1333 type; </p><p>  - storage of files on a laptop is carried out using a solid-state drive with a capacity of 32 GB; </p><p>  - The webcam with which the device is equipped has a resolution of 0.3 megapixels; </p><p>  - the device has Wi-Fi and Blueotooth wireless modules; </p><p>  - The device‚Äôs battery has a capacity of 4850 mAh. </p><p>  The device is controlled by Windows 8.1 in 64-bit version. </p><h2>  What tasks can a laptop do? </h2><p>  Based on the above characteristics, we can assume that the laptop ASUS EeeBook X205TA has not the most outstanding performance.  Indeed, there are very few processor resources and RAM modules installed in the device.  Therefore, using the device as a gaming platform (from the point of view of launching modern gaming products on it), most likely, will fail. </p>

    <p>  You can, of course, try to run a game on a laptop with minimal graphic parameters - but if we talk about the latest games, then even with them the user will most likely not get much pleasure from spending time with the device in question. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another thing - there are a large number of games, albeit quite outdated, but still popular.  These can be strategies or quests, since they are usually not too demanding on the schedule.  But in some cases, on a laptop, games in the genre of action, simulators can also run quite well. </p><p>  There is a point of view according to which laptops, even the most high-performance ones in terms of the characteristics of the processor and RAM, are in principle undesirable to consider as devices adapted for games.  In most cases, in the appropriate mode of use, they will be ahead of the speed and quality of work of ordinary PCs with the same cost.  Therefore, from this point of view, a powerful, expensive laptop may not have any real advantages over a budget solution - since the range of tasks solved on them will be brought closer as much as possible due to insufficient performance of both in games.  But what tasks can we talk about? </p><p>  If you do not consider games, the ASUS EeeBook X205TA laptop (user and expert reviews presented on various thematic portals confirm this) is quite suitable for working on the Internet.  Antiviruses, the presence of which is highly desirable for fans of hanging out online, are installed on a laptop without problems. </p><p>  There will be no particular restrictions on the use of basic Internet services: the device‚Äôs performance will be enough for visiting websites, communicating via Skype, and watching videos on video hosting.  It is also possible to launch undemanding flash-games.  Launching office applications, and in some cases those designed for processing graphics, web development, and some types of programming, does not involve any difficulties. </p><p>  Of course, the laptop is not very suitable for game development either because it is not optimal for their launch - you need resources for testing, appropriate scripts, which implies a heavy load on the processor. </p><h2>  Storage Optimization </h2><p>  The device in question, as we have defined above, has a 32 GB hard drive.  This indicator looks extremely modest.  Indeed, even the most budget laptops today have a hard drive of several hundred gigabytes. </p><p>  However, the small capacity of the ASUS EeeBook X205TA hard drive (reviews by many users confirm this) as a whole does not play a role in terms of the tasks that are typical of the device.  So, those people who are used to using the Internet, as a rule, actively use <span>cloud</span> file <span>storage</span> .  The speed of loading and downloading data on modern lines, in principle, is comparable to that which characterizes the operation of the hard drive.  In turn, on cloud storages, the user often has completely free disk space available, far exceeding that available in the hard drive. </p><p>  Therefore, if you place the files in the "cloud", then the 32 GB hard drive that is installed in the laptop in question may be more than enough. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The sound subsystem of the device is controlled by an integrated audio data processing module.  Therefore, the quality of audio playback on a laptop musician with experience may not be called the most outstanding.  However, the corresponding subsystem performs its basic functions well, providing, where necessary, bass reproduction, in other cases - low and medium frequencies.  Therefore, when using high-quality audio equipment, the user will be able to listen to music or immerse themselves in the atmosphere of games with tangible pleasure. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Regarding the battery of the device - it has a capacity, as we noted above, corresponding to 4850 mAh.  It is impossible to remove it from the device in a way familiar to many users - to replace the battery, you will have to unscrew the bottom cover of the device. </p><p>  The indicated battery capacity provides autonomous operation of the laptop for 10-12 hours, unless, of course, you download applications or games demanding on the resources of the processor and RAM on it.  But even in normal use, this indicator can be considered more than decent. </p><p>  It can be noted that the laptop comes with a miniature and lightweight charger, which you can always take with you and, if necessary, recharge the device. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  We will now study the most notable features of the laptop display.  It has, as we already know, a diagonal of 11.6 inches and a resolution of 1366 by 768 pixels.  In general, the corresponding indicators are pretty standard for an ultrabook.  The device screen provides good color reproduction, allows you to work comfortably behind a laptop at an angle, and is characterized by a fairly high brightness.  Of course, it is not recommended to use the device in direct sunlight.  But the same can be said of most other devices, including those that are several price segments higher. </p><h2>  Design and appearance of the device </h2><p>  Even taking into account the relatively modest price, users and experts rate the design of the ASUS EeeBook X205TA laptop very positively.  There are no sharp corners on the device case.  There are no noticeable backlashes - the build quality of the laptop can be described as the highest.  The body of the device is made of colored plastic.  For example, there are models of red, blue colors, they look very impressive. </p>

    <p>  In addition, as some users note, the material of the laptop is very pleasant to the touch - it is moderately hard and at the same time smooth.  Rubber legs are installed in the lower part of the device‚Äôs body, and speakers are in the same area.  The laptop is very light - its weight is less than 1 kg. </p><p>  Under the cover are the touchpad and keyboard with black keys, which can be attributed to the island type.  A webcam is located above the screen - everything is standard here. </p><h2>  Keyboard and touchpad </h2><p>  Consider in more detail the hardware components of the laptop ASUS EeeBook X205TA, start with the keyboard and touchpad.  What are their features? </p><p>  As for the keyboard - it is made of inexpensive plastic, has a soft key travel and provides a quick response.  The symbols are painted on the surface of the buttons with white paint, and this ensures their good visibility in the dark, despite the fact that the laptop is not equipped with a backlight.  The touchpad is very large, despite the modest dimensions of the device.  However, this is not a sensation for ultrabooks.  The touchpad is located in the central part of the case, and many users find it very convenient. </p><h2>  Communication opportunities </h2><p>  The next aspect in which it will be useful to study the ASUS EeeBook X205TA laptop is the communication options that are implemented in it.  These generally correspond to the needs of modern users. </p>

    <p>  The laptop is equipped with 2 USB 2.0 slots, a slot for connecting microSD memory cards, slots for connecting devices via HDMI and external audio devices.  By the way, the laptop does not have a network card adapted for wired connections.  But there is a Wi-Fi module.  On the one hand, the ports in the device, of course, are few.  On the other hand, there are all the necessary communication connectors and interfaces. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Now let's study what users say about the ASUS EeeBook X205TA laptop.  User reviews can be divided into the following main groups: </p><p>  - opinions on the design, ease of device management; </p><p>  - assessment of the stability of the laptop; </p><p>  - opinions regarding the performance of the device; </p><p>  - assess the functionality of the device. </p><p>  We will study them in more detail. </p><h2>  Reviews about the comfort of using the device </h2><p>  Regarding the design and ease of use of the laptop, user opinions are extremely positive.  Especially laptop lovers are impressed by the fact that the device looks great, regardless of what belongs to the budget segment.  A similar phenomenon is a rarity in the modern electronics market.  Users note that the laptop is equipped with a comfortable keyboard and a particularly convenient touchpad.  And this is expressed not only in its optimal central location, but also in quick response to pressing, smooth movement of the pointer controlled by it, and the absence of noticeable malfunctions.  The keyboard, of course, is also characterized as a very convenient and reliable hardware component. </p><h2>  Laptop stability reviews </h2><p>  Reviews on the stability of the laptop ASUS EeeBook X205TA are also very positive.  The device, of course, may freeze, but this is typical only for cases when the user tries to run a game or application on it that require completely different hardware capabilities.  If you download on your laptop the programs for which it is designed: a browser, a text editor, a media player, then there should not be any difficulties using the appropriate software. </p><h2>  Device Performance Reviews </h2><p>  The next aspect of user opinions is laptop performance.  We said above that the device objectively cannot be used as a tool to download modern games, especially when it comes to demanding 3D solutions.  Users understand this and are not particularly trying to launch a fresh version of another action on the laptop.  But if we are talking about downloading on it those applications for which it is designed - then there are no significant performance problems.  On a laptop, you can easily play most varieties of media content, listen to music, and edit documents.  The device‚Äôs capacities are enough to launch the corresponding software. </p><h2>  Laptop Functionality Reviews </h2><p>  Another aspect of the opinions of users of the ASUS EeeBook X205TA is the functionality of the device.  We noted above that the laptop is not equipped with an <span>optical drive</span> and a wired network card that are familiar to many users.  But from the point of view of ordinary tasks solved with the help of an appropriate device, this is not a significant problem - this is generally believed by users.  For the same reason, laptop lovers are not inclined to consider the modest amount of hard drive as a significant drawback of the device. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So, what conclusions can we draw by examining the main features of the ASUS EeeBook X205TA, as well as the feedback from the owners of the device? </p><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that a laptop with an exceptionally attractive combination of quality and price is at the disposal of the user.  Even taking into account the dollar that has risen in price, its value in the catalogs of Russian retailers is about 25 thousand rubles.  For an ultrabook, especially with such a stylish design - this is more than an acceptable indicator. </p>

    <p>  The laptop has a rather modest performance, but it is quite sufficient for solving basic user tasks, such as, in particular, working on the Internet, creating and editing text documents, viewing multimedia content, and performing certain stages of web development.  At the same time, if you take not too new games, then you can completely try to run them on a laptop, at least at the minimum graphics settings. </p><p>  As for the functionality of the device, it fully meets the actual needs of modern users.  Again, if we talk about typical tasks for a laptop, the device provides all the resources for their solution - the ability to run the main programs and ensure their stable operation, provides the user with tools to access the Internet, install the necessary anti-virus solutions.  Most of the tasks associated with using online resources can be solved via Wi-Fi connection - the laptop is equipped with the appropriate module, and this hardware component works stably. </p>
