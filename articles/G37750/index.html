As usual, we will start with an introduction that will tell us about what the history of the device was, what it actually is, and how the company positions its brainchild on the international arena of mobile devices. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  <span>Nokia C5, the</span> firmware of which may be required for the phone to work correctly, is a variation of the device called <span>"Nokia 6303".</span>  Only in our case can we absolutely safely talk about the presence of the C60 platform, as well as about a larger keyboard.  Although the Finnish manufacturer of mobile phones has taken care of embedding the platform inside their device, it‚Äôs just that the language will not be called a significant advantage.  And the problem is the screen size.  The diagonal of the display is not so large, so we will not notice any special improvements. </p>

    <p>  During the very first sales of <span>Nokia C5, the</span> price of the device was about 135 euros.  Now it has fallen to 4.5-6 thousand.  It all depends on the store offering the product, as well as on the modification of the model itself.  The cost of the device at the very start was quite attractive, which played into the hands of the Finnish manufacturer of mobile phones.  This is one of the steps that allowed the company to move forward in the market, attract a new audience, thereby ensuring stable sales growth.  At least until a certain point. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, the price of the device was higher than the predecessor of the subject of our review today.  The model turned out to be a niche, segmented one.  Such a solution, of course, could compete (and quite successfully) with other devices of the corresponding category.  However, the attempt to fight with the neighboring segment for the ‚ÄúNokia S5‚Äù was marked by the defeat, which she suffered miserably.  If we talk about the situation within the category, then we can say that there the model turned out to be really popular and in demand. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  If you are a fan of classic monoblocks and phones equipped with truly large and well-lived keys, then this solution will definitely be interesting for you.  Of the functionality, nothing special can be distinguished.  The device was developed for those people who really use a mobile phone for its intended purpose.  And this includes making voice calls and text messaging.  For such purposes, the device is perfect. </p>

    <p>  On the other hand, the Finnish manufacturer knows that the key to success is the precisely selected price-quality ratio, which is the basis for the creation of devices.  And the company copes with this no worse than the South Korean company Samsung, only occasionally for some reason making an exception to the rule.  Here, the logic of the Finns, of course, is not very clear.  However, our goal today is different - to understand what Nokia C5 is and what kind of rating you can put on the phone.  Note that separately for the Chinese market, the manufacturer released a model under the same name.  However, her camera characteristics were changed, as a result of which the device was called Nokia C5 5MP. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the monoblock is the most real and boring to the horror as a form factor.  However, just one glance cast in passing on the device is enough to understand that the Nokia C5 case is very, very accurate.  In addition, the appearance can be characterized by such a word as "calm."  No challenges or anything else - the model looks businesslike. </p>

    <h2>  Color schemes </h2><p>  To date, two phone designs are available in stores.  This, of course, is a classic of the genre.  The first design is in white, the second is in dark gray.  If we take a model to which the second color scheme is applied, we notice an extended border on the front side.  It is made, by the way, of plastic, which is chrome plated with a special additional layer.  The keyboard is made in the same color as the rest of the body.  Of course, metal acts as a material for manufacturing the back cover.  A silver paint is applied to the panel, on top of which there is an additional layer of matte spraying.  If you scratch it, it will certainly begin to wear out day after day.  However, nothing can be done about it.  The only thing you can do is simply treat the phone more respectfully and accurately, do not drop it or throw it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  In principle, there is no particular problem with this.  Even if an extra layer of matte spraying peels off the back cover, it will still look pretty pretty.  The thing is that it looks uniform in both cases.  Although there is spraying, even if it is not.  These are all ordinary trifles that are taken seriously by a small audience, which probably makes up a pitiful five percent of the total number of users. </p><h2>  Right side </h2><p>  On the right side of the phone is a volume rocker.  These are two buttons that are paired together.  They allow you to adjust the level of music playback in the audio player, as well as the volume when watching video clips.  In addition, the rocker can be used in a telephone conversation.  It is not uncommon when an interlocutor simply breaks the spoken speaker with his voice.  Then the volume keys are used. </p>

    <p>  The rocker is soundly recessed inside the case, and this causes some inconvenience.  To use the buttons, you will have to make a little effort.  On the right side is also a slot that is provided for installing external drives in the phone.  We are talking about flash cards format MicroSD.  For additional protection, Nokia engineers equipped the port with a plug.  It is also not very easy to pull out.  You will have to sweat a little before the stub yields and creeps out, opening access to the treasured memory card. </p><h2>  Top end </h2><p>  Here we have a 3.5 mm standard connector.  It is necessary to connect a wired stereo headset to the phone.  She, in turn, will be used by the multimedia player in the application, as well as analog radio as an antenna device.  A MicroUSB connector sits nearby.  It can also be used as a charge.  Another option is to synchronize a mobile phone with a laptop or personal computer with it. </p>

    <h2>  Dimensions and dimensions </h2><p>  The mass of the Nokia S5 mobile phone is only 89 grams.  The dimensions in three-dimensional space are as follows: in height - 112, in width - 46, and in thickness - 12.3 millimeters.  In a shirt pocket, for example, the phone fits nicely.  And in a jeans pocket it is quite convenient to transport it with you.  There are no complaints about the device, and should not arise in any case. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The screen resolution of the model is 240 by 320 pixels.  This is the so-called QVGA quality.  The device has a built-in display with a diagonal of 2.2 inches.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using TFT technology, color reproduction - up to 16 million different colors and shades.  If we talk about the brightness of the picture, then it is average.  Nevertheless, in a variety of conditions - from night darkness to sunlight during the day - the picture is displayed on the screen quite high quality. </p>

    <p>  In natural light, it fades slightly, you can read information from the display without much effort.  At the same time, three service lines and no more than eight lines of text are displayed on the screen.  Some modes allow you to display six more.  A separate word needs to be put in place about fonts.  They read well, and this could not be ignored.  If the display sizes were larger, it would be possible to cope with the burnout of the picture.  But since this was not done, we get a decrease in the brightness of the image in natural light.  Not critical, but the fact remains. </p><h2>  Conclusion and owner reviews </h2><p>  We remind you that you can easily find applications and games for Nokia C5.  In the meantime, we move on to the final part of the review, namely, to the analysis of the reviews of people who purchased the device.  Let's look at the comments and list the main advantages and disadvantages of the phone. </p><p>  In the role of pluses, today we have a fairly loud speaker of the device.  This also includes the quality of communication.  The cellular network does not disappear just in a way that pleases.  There will be much more minuses.  One of them is the lack of a Wi-Fi module.  The second minus is a poor-quality speaker.  Yes, it has a good volume, but the sound quality of the music leaves much to be desired.  Well, it completes all the instability of the software.  There are still a bunch of small flaws, for example, an easily erasable spraying on the rear panel, but this is not critical. </p>
