Sometimes the photos on the hotel website look pretty attractive, but the reality is disappointing.  Therefore, you should take information from the reviews of vacationers.  But you should also be critical of them.  After all, the concept of quality rest is subjective.  Give someone some fun partying, while another wants peace and quiet.  The same can be said about the territory of the hotel, its rooms, beach, pool, food, animation ... almost everything.  And what is the hotel "Alara Star 5 *" (Turkey)?  We will talk about this in our article.  No advertising - just a thoughtful analysis of the reviews of tourists. </p>

    <p>  This hotel (as, indeed, the entire region of the Anatolian Riviera) is loved by visitors from Russia.  This fact has its advantages.  People with poor knowledge of foreign dialects will not feel lonely here.  Indeed, almost all the staff speak Russian.  Minuses due to the influx of compatriots, as the reviews claim, were not noticed.  The audience here is decent, mostly families with children.  But the youth at the hotel have a place to turn around.  Many tourists warmly recall the cheerful animators, smiling staff, the vast, well-groomed area and the cleanliness of the rooms.  And all this affects the popularity of Alara Star <span>5 * (Turkey, Alanya).</span>  The hotel guest rating gives this hotel eight and a half points out of ten possible.  But let's now talk about everything in order. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort area Incekum </h2><p>  The Anatolian Riviera is divided into sections.  One of such resort areas is Incekum.  Its very name, which is translated from Turkish as ‚Äúfine sand‚Äù, sets up for an excellent beach holiday.  And in this paradise, our Alara Star is a 5 * hotel.  Incekum <span>(Turkey) reviews</span> are called the ideal place for children.  Its bays are protected from the wind, warm up quickly, and the beaches are famous for their soft sand and gentle entry into the water.  The newlyweds, lovers, and just lovers of romance feel great here.  Reviews claim that gigabytes went to capture the local sunsets.  Pine forests come close to the sea.  The aroma of heated needles has a beneficial effect on people suffering from sleep disorders, diseases of the bronchi and lungs.  The popular resort of Incekum stretches for eight kilometers along the sea.  On a map of Turkey, it is located between Alanya and Side.  The hotel is only twenty-five kilometers from the first city.  The season at Incekum resort lasts from mid-April to the end of October.  But some of the "five" do not close for the winter.  In the ‚Äúoff season‚Äù prices become low to indecent, which attracts budget tourists to the resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel alara star 5 turkey hotel reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1032150.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Incekum resort area, in turn, is divided into several villages.  Each of them has its own specifics.  The easternmost (closer to Side) is the village of Okurcalar.  And in the west of the resort area is Avsallar.  In this vibrant resort village, among other comfortable hotels with four and five stars, Alara Star 5 * is located.  Turkey is famous for its wonderful water parks.  One of them is located in Inzekum, exactly between its center and the Okudzhalar village. </p>

    <p>  Avsallar attracts vacationers with its unforgettable nature, developed tourist infrastructure and vibrant evening life.  Almost every "five" has a thalasso center and spa.  Avsallar is the warmest place on the Anatolian Riviera.  The rugged coastline reliably shelters the village from the winds, and the sea in the bays quickly warms up.  In Avsallar, even small but very sweet bananas ripen.  Our hotel is located on a small hill outside the village.  The rugged coast formed a peninsula on which the Alara Star 5 * hotel (Turkey) rises.  Reviews of the hotel warn that you will have to go down the serpentine stairs to the beach.  The height of the cliff is somewhere with a four-story house.  But the hotel has three beaches at once.  And the sea from the rooms is wonderful. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  Closest to the hotel among the cities of the Republic of Turkey is Alanya.  The Alara Star Hotel (5 stars) is only twenty-five kilometers away.  But the lion's share of tourists from Russia arrive in the country through the international airport of Antalya.  And this is already a long way - more than one hundred and forty kilometers.  A long transfer from the airport is the only negative that tourists indicate in their reviews of the hotel.  Firms deliver their customers to various resorts and hotels.  It so happens that Alara Star guests are among the last to arrive at the vacation spot.  Transfer from the airport to the hotel often takes about three hours.  But, comforted reviews, the road is easily overcome.  Often stops are made at the cafe, and the guide interestingly talks about Turkey and the sights floating outside the window.  You can also get in another way, from various international airports of the country.  Buses are well developed in Turkey.  Comfortable cars with seats that are laid out to a reclining state will take you to Alanya or Side from Istanbul, Izmir, Marmaris.  And until the very Avsallar from nearby cities shuttle buses, which are called "dolmushi" here.  The fare in them is from five to ten lire one way. </p><h2>  Turkey, Alanya: Hotel Alara Star 5 * </h2><p>  In fact, this is not even a hotel, but a complex.  On the top of the rocky peninsula there are two hotels: the five-star Alara Star and the budget three with the same name - Alara Hotel.  Since the owner of the hotel complex is single, visitors can use the entire infrastructure: beaches, pools, bars.  Animation and entertainment are also common.  This, of course, is a greater bonus for Treshka guests than for those who have chosen the 5-star Alara Star Hotel for their holidays.  Alara Star (Turkey) consists of one six-story building with an elevator.  Eighty percent of the rooms in this building have direct or side sea views. </p>

    <p>  Alas, the reviews warn that at the height of the season it may happen that you will be accommodated in those rooms whose balconies "look" towards the mainland.  Then you will hear the busy Alanya-Side highway, passing nearby.  The territory of the hotel complex is very large (forty thousand square meters), but everything is thought out so that amenities are at hand.  The park is carefully groomed, shady.  Even the descent to the sea and the rise to the buildings did not cause negative emotions in the hotel guests.  The hotel building itself was built in 2004, but has since been repeatedly restored and updated. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  All reviews of <span>the Alara Star 5 * hotel</span> (Alanya) recall spacious rooms with balconies.  These rooms are comfortable and well-equipped.  There are no balconies in only five rooms, which are designed for guests with disabilities or tourists traveling alone.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a room is fifteen square meters.  One hundred eighty rooms of the Standard category are designed for two people.  Their area is 25 m <sup>2</sup> .  There are ten more luxury rooms.  They are two-bedroom apartments with a unique design with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãforty-two square meters.  For those tourists who have gone on vacation with their whole family, twin rooms are provided.  They are two adjacent rooms "standard", interconnected by a door.  Each, even the simplest room, is very comfortable.  The floor is carpeted.  The bed is large, comfortable.  Plasma TV broadcasts satellite channels (including two Russian).  Silent air conditioning saves tourists from the summer heat.  The bathroom is equipped with a bathtub and hairdryer.  There are also rooms in the rooms for which a separate fee is required.  This is a safe and a minibar.  Tourists mention that they changed their bedding three times a week, and cleaned daily.  Whether to leave a tip is up to you, but the cleanliness of the room does not depend on such a promotion. </p><h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  Since the hotel complex rises on a cliff, you have to go down to the sea.  The path is short.  Reviews assure that the steps are interspersed with gentle paths.  On the way there are benches for relaxation.  But still, parents with prams experienced some inconvenience.  But due to accommodation on the peninsula, the hotel has as many as three private beaches.  All of them are equally good: with a golden sand, a gentle approach to the sea.  Three bays are sheltered from the wind.  There are no big waves.  But, what is rare for the Mediterranean Sea, is living creatures.  So reviews are advised to bring <span>a diving mask</span> with you <span>.</span>  All beach equipment - umbrellas, sunbeds, towels - are free on the beach.  The same situation is on the sun terrace by the outdoor pools.  There are two of them - for adults and children.  They are located near the building of the Alara Star 5 * hotel (Turkey).  And if weather conditions do not allow swimming in the fresh air, you can plunge into the indoor pool and enjoy water treatments in any season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alara star 5 category hotel incekum turkey reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1032156.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù - these two words attract Russian tourists like butterflies fire.  And this is what attracts them to resort Turkey.  Alanya ("Alara Star 5 *" geographically belongs to this resort) in this sense is not inferior to the untwisted Antalya.  Upon arrival, they put on bracelets, and these wrist jewelry open the doors to all restaurants and bars.  What are these power points?  In addition to the main restaurant, where all meals are served in buffet style, there are three more a la carte options.  They specialize in cuisines: fish, Turkish and Italian.  You can visit the restaurant for free only once after a reservation has been made.  Sign up for a romantic dinner at the hotel reception.  The lobby bar is reminiscent of the atmosphere of ancient Turkey.  Here you will be poured alcohol locally and imported.  Refreshing drinks and fresh fruit will delight you at the counter by the pool and in the "Aqua Bar".  In the cafe at the hotel there are always a variety of snacks that can satisfy the hunger between the main meals.  But the bar, where parties are held daily, serves customers for a fee.  It is located on floor -1, so the sounds of discos do not interfere with the rest of the guests' restful sleep. </p><h2>  Services and entertainment </h2><p>  Hotel Alara Star 5 * (Turkey) offers all the conditions for an unforgettable, delightful vacation.  A whole day, from morning to evening, a team of young animators entertains the guests of the complex, encouraging them to do water aerobics, play <span>beach volleyball</span> and the like.  And in the evenings, guys and girls organize real shows with lotteries, competitions, performances and comic programs.  Whoever remains resistant to the requests of animators and prefers to indulge in bliss can fully taste it at the spa.  There is a cabinet of a professional masseur, sauna, hammam, jacuzzi. </p>

    <p>  Keeping in touch with the homeland will help fast Wi-Fi.  If you arrived at Alara Star (5 * hotel, Turkey) by car, you can leave your iron horse in a free guarded parking lot.  The hotel also has a laundry room and a doctor's office.  Wanted to shop?  Turkey is unthinkable without this.  At the entrance to the hotel there is a shopping street where they sell textiles, beautiful lamps, shoes and souvenirs.  And sports lovers are waiting for free tennis courts, a gym and training grounds. </p><h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  Both youth and families choose the five-star Alara Star hotel (Turkey, Alanya) as their vacation spot.  Reviews of tourists mention that the hotel pays a lot of attention to children.  They are engaged in special animators.  They hold master classes with the kids, draw with them, sculpt, hold competitions, and in the evenings organize discos for them.  Many tourists wrote that their child simply disappeared day-to-day in a mini-club.  Despite the fact that besides the Russians, Germans and British are resting here, the children did not experience any language barriers.  Experienced animators for each child could find an approach.  Near the adult pool there is a children's "paddling pool" so that the child can remain under the supervision of parents all the time.  From two to four in the afternoon in the cafe they bring ice cream of different varieties, which, incidentally, is available not only to children.  As for food, in restaurants there are always high chairs for babies.  Food for babies, of course, you need to bring with you, but children from two years old may well find a lot of goodies for themselves.  As befits in hotels of this category, in Alana Star you can hire a personal nanny for a fee. </p><h2>  "Alara Star 5 *" Turkey: reviews </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, the hotel in the ranking of holidaymakers' sympathy won eight and a half points out of a possible ten.  And if you separately evaluate the cleanliness of the cleaning, the decoration of the rooms, the food and the quality of the beach, then in these categories the hotel earned the highest praise - 10. Of all that vacationers say about the hotel, it is very difficult to get at least one negative review.  ‚ÄúOh, Hotel Alara Star 5 * <span>(Turkey, Alanya)!</span>  We will definitely be back to you next summer! ‚Äù  - this is the main refrain in a laudatory choir.  But in every barrel of honey there is a fly in the ointment.  As disadvantages, tourists mention a long transfer from the airport and the road to the beach and (especially) back.  Also, some did not like the countryside location of the hotel.  Indeed, to Avsallar and Inzhekum ‚Äã‚Äãhave to overcome more than three kilometers.  But these shortcomings, you see, do not depend on the administration and hotel employees.  Otherwise, you will find smiling staff, delicious and varied food, spacious and clean rooms and the wonderful <span>nature of Turkey.</span>  Tourists are advised not to neglect the historical and cultural attractions of this country.  You can take advantage of the proximity of Alanya to visit the ancient fortress of this city.  There are many ancient monuments in the vicinity of Side.  All excursions can be booked at the hotel reception. </p>
