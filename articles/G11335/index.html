Let this categorical statement not scare beginners.  They do not need to strain their imagination at all and try to create a complex masterpiece at the limit of possibilities.  There are many patterns and models that are extremely easy to manufacture and at the same time allow you to achieve impressive results. </p><p>  In order to knit a product such as a crochet jacket (the pattern can be solid or openwork), it is important to choose the right yarn, calculate the pattern repeatings and observe the given sizes.  All these stages in due order will be covered in this article on the example of two products of varying degrees of complexity. </p><h2>  Simple rectangle jacket </h2><p>  The photo shows the simplest model of a sweater that you can imagine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater for beginners" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1240766.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  It is based on a rectangle sewn in a special way.  By and large, this item can be called rather a cardigan.  However, it can be called a sweater.  This is often done by fashionistas, taking into account that this is clothing for the upper part with a detachable front part.  In fact, any <span>sweater jacket</span> (the scheme does not matter) implies the presence of two shelves with or without a fastener.  As a rule, its length reaches the waist or slightly lower.  Longer models should already be called cardigans.  In modern magazines <span>, pullovers, sweaters</span> and even tops are often called <span>blouses</span> . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to get a high-quality and beautiful sweater with a crochet for beginners (the scheme of the used pattern is given below), you need to take measurements.  Should be clearly marked: </p><ul><li>  Product Length (CI). </li><li>  Sleeve Length (DR). </li><li>  The width of the back, the distance between the shoulder blades (AL). </li><li>  Sleeve circumference (OP). </li></ul><p>  It is also necessary to make a control sample, according to which the jacket will be calculated. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  The chain of air loops from which the knitting begins, in the finished jacket will be located along the bottom edge. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater crochet scheme" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1240761.jpg" width="531"></div>  The length of the first row (like all the others, because we knit a rectangle) is equal to the planned length of the sleeve, multiplied by two and added to the width of the back (DRx2 + ShS).  Such a crocheted openwork jacket - patterns may be different - plays the role of both a warm product and a purely decorative one.  Its purpose depends on the pattern and the chosen yarn: wool, cotton, viscose. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet summer sweatshirt" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1240883.jpg" width="316"></div>

At this stage, work on the scheme is terminated.  The item must be steamed with an iron and steam.  It is necessary to act on the canvas exclusively with steam, without putting the sole of the device on it.  Then the rectangle is folded along a long edge and the short sides are sewn from the open edges to the fold line.  Only a part of the canvas, the length of which is equal to half the circumference of the sleeve (OP / 2), is left un sewn. </p><p>  At the final stage, the open edges of the canvas are tied in several rows of a dense pattern.  If we are talking about crocheting <span>warm sweatshirts</span> (the schemes are used more dense), then the binding can be just plain crochet.  When the product is intended for use in the summer, the plank becomes an independent decoration.  Often, the main fabric is made with some simple pattern, and the strapping is made wide and openwork.  Its upper part becomes a collar.  This distinguishes both summer and warm crocheted sweatshirts (different schemes are used, but there is only one model). </p><h2>  Blouse of motives </h2><p>  The complexity level of such models is slightly higher than the previous one.  Here, the fabric is formed by sewing separately related motifs.  They come in different shapes, but for simplicity, an example with square fragments will be used.  Such a <span>crocheted</span> jacket <span>(the motif scheme</span> can be completely different) perfectly serves as a cape on a top, T-shirt, sundress or dress.  Most often, cotton or linen becomes the material for the manufacture of such models.  Although mixed types of yarn also look good: cotton with acrylic, polyamide, microfiber or nylon. </p><p>  Below in the photo are options for patterns for knitting squares. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="warm sweatshirts crochet patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1240762.jpg" width="384"></div>

    <h2>  Work with motives </h2><p>  The production of fragments begins from the center, with three or five initial air loops that close into a ring.  Further, the work is performed in a circle.  Each row begins with lifting loops and ends with a connecting column.  In the manufacture of motifs, maintaining the symmetry of each element and maintaining its flat shape is of great importance.  A common mistake among beginners is the uneven thread tension.  The result of knitting too tight is a domed, convex motif, and a weak one - excessively wide edges (ruffles). </p><h2>  Jacket crochet: diagram and description of the assembly of motives </h2><p>  The photo shows a pullover blouse unfolded. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork sweater crochet scheme" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1240764.jpg" width="564"></div>

    <p>  Here the fragments are interconnected, but the side seams and sleeves remained unstitched.  Such a scheme is the most common.  In fact, here you can observe four large rectangles: details of the front, back and sleeves.  An interesting idea is the use of two different squares in one product.  In this case, they were staggered, but striping can be used.  The front part can be detachable, then you should plan to knit the strap with buttonhole.  When the seams are completed, the product is as follows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stitched jacket" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1240767.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  The harness on the bottom edge and on the sleeves will give the jacket accuracy and completeness.  Such a summer sweater jacket (the scheme may contain large holes or be practically continuous) is very practical, it becomes indispensable during the off-season. </p>
