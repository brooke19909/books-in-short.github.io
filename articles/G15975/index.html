    <h2>  What is MTS Bonus? </h2><p>  In short, this program allows you to save on communication services and mobile entertainment, paying not with money, but with accumulated bonus points. </p><h2>  What are bonuses awarded for? </h2><p>  At MTS, points can be obtained in several ways. </p><ol><li>  When you register in the program, fill out a questionnaire and confirm your email address, you will immediately receive 100 bonuses. </li><li>  You will receive additional MTS bonus points if you invite a friend to participate in the program. </li><li>  The main way of accumulation is the use of communication services from MTS.  This includes phone calls, messages, mobile Internet. </li><li>  Purchases in the MTS online store or specialized communication stores will also bring a certain amount of points. </li><li>  The costs of home Internet and television are another source of replenishment of the bonus account. </li><li>  Another way is to pay for your purchases in various stores with plastic cards.  Here is their list: MTS Money, MTS-Raiffeisenbank VISA, MasterCard MTS of Sberbank of Russia, MTS-Citibank MasterCard, as well as MTS-Bank Russian Standard </li><li>  And the last way to get MTS bonus points is to convert the ‚Äúpluses‚Äù and bonus rubles of such systems as ‚ÄúSvyaznoy Club‚Äù and ‚ÄúUral Airlines‚Äù. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS bonus points" class="if" height="211" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/428914.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  Where can I see my points on MTS? </h2><p>  How to check bonus account?  This question appears as soon as you decide to register in the program.  After all, before you start spending them, you need to know how many of them are in total.  You can view the charges in several ways. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  MTS personal account.  This page is intended for registration in various programs of the company and the use of self-service services.  However, here you can check your balance and balance on the bonus account. </li><li>  Personal page of the MTS Bonus website.  On it, you can not only see the remaining points, but also see all the accruals and write-offs, learn how to spend MTS points, and, in fact, order a reward.  It is also possible to use not only a PC, but also a mobile version of the site. </li><li>  You can send a free USSD request to * 111 * 455 * 0 #.  Remember to press the call key.  In response, you will receive a message where your points on MTS will be indicated. <strong></strong></li><li><strong></strong>  How to check the bonus account, you can find out if you install the application "Personal Account MTS" in one of the social networks: "Classmates", "VKontakte", Facebook. <strong></strong></li><li>  Another way to find out how many points are left is to send a message to 4555. In the SMS you need to write the word ‚ÄúBonus‚Äù.  In the home network, the message is free, but outside of it, a tariff for roaming services is charged. <strong></strong><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to spend points mts" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/428916.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  What is the reward for accumulated points on MTS? </h2><p>  How to check the bonus account is not the only and far from the most interesting task when participating in this program.  It‚Äôs much more fun to spend bonuses.  So, how to spend MTS points?  There are a lot of rewards in the bonus program.  These are communication services, such as minutes of calls to numbers of MTS subscribers in the home region, SMS and MMS messages, and mobile Internet.  For bonuses, you can also purchase access to mobile content catalogs.  You can get discounts from MTS partner companies.  Such stores include OZON, Detsky Mir, M-Video, L'Etoile, SportMaster, Foodpanda and others.  In addition, MTS Bonus points can be exchanged for in-game currency in online games.  But that is not all.  Participation in the program allows you to obtain certificates for the purchase of products in MTS stores.  Those for whom cinema has not yet replaced reading, can take this opportunity and purchase e-books in the online store ‚ÄúLitRes‚Äù, having paid bonus points for them.  But the rewards described above are not permanent.  The list is expanding all the time, because the company seeks to cover the interests of as many of its subscribers as possible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Give good to the children </h2><p>  Among the opportunities to spend points, it is worth highlighting one more.  You will not receive any material reward, but thanks to your bonuses you will render all possible assistance in saving the life of a child.  A separate item in the program reward catalog is charity, where the amount of points you donated is equivalent to the same amount in rubles.  And, who knows, maybe this <span>money is not enough</span> to cure a seriously ill baby.  This item in the catalog is not always present, but only at those moments when the collection is open for one or another baby. </p><h2>  What do you need to get a reward? </h2><p>  You can spend the accumulated bonuses again in several ways. </p><ol><li>  First, it‚Äôs worth going to the personal page on the MTS Bonus website.  Go to the "Reward Catalog" or "How to spend points" page.  Choose what you like from the list, click "Add to Cart".  In the window that appears with brief information, you must check the box "I have read the conditions", return again to the "basket".  After that, click "Place an order."  The application will be processed within 24 hours (but, as a rule, this happens much faster), and you will receive your reward. </li><li>  Secondly, you can send a free message (if you are not in roaming) with the code of the necessary product to number 4555. </li><li>  Thirdly, it is possible to send a USSD request. </li></ol><p>  Before exchanging points for MTS, it is worth remembering that certificates, MTS options, equipment, mobile content, including GOOD'OK, can be ordered only on the personal page of the MTS Bonus website.  Through SMS and USSD-request it is possible to purchase only packages of minutes, messages and Internet traffic. </p>

    <p>  After the application is processed, points will be deducted from the bonus account. </p><h2>  Extra way to earn / spend points </h2><p>  If you are a member of the MTS Bonus program, but so far no remuneration is appealing to you, you can present your accumulated points to a friend.  Conversely, if you don‚Äôt have enough to order the reward you like, another MTS subscriber can transfer MTS points to you. </p><p>  There are two ways to do this. </p><ol><li>  Send a message to the number 4555 with the text ‚ÄúGIFT number of the subscriber the sum of points‚Äù.  Example: "DAR 89105746655 500".  Or the text may be: "GIFT phone scores."  Example: "GIFT 89105746655 500". </li><li>  In the second option, the same MTS Bonus personal page will come to the rescue, where by filling in a specific form and indicating the recipient's phone number, accumulated points can be transferred. </li></ol><p>  After that, the subscriber who received the gift must accept it.  To do this, click on the ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù button on the personal page or send a message with the text ‚ÄúACCEPT the sender‚Äôs phone‚Äù.  Example: ‚ÄúACCEPT 89155675435‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Attention! </h2><p>  In conclusion, it is necessary to mention another very important point.  Once you can go to your personal page to check the balance of your bonus points, and see that there are fewer than expected, although you did not spend anything.  The thing is that bonuses are valid for a year from the date of accrual.  And after 365 days, they begin to gradually burn out.  That is, if, for example, you earned 50 points for September 2013, then in September 2014 they will no longer be valid.  So we advise you not to neglect the MTS Bonus program and take the opportunity to save on mobile communications or to get nice gifts. </p>
