From this article it will be possible to get detailed characteristics and indicators of the two companies and find out the answer to the question of which <span>batteries are better</span> - Durasel or Energizer. </p><h2>  Batteries: what is it? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="lifeboat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which batteries are better durasel or energizer" class="if uuid-3152601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131937/3152601.jpg"></div><p>  We do not hesitate to turn on the TV from the remote control, find out the time by the working wall clock, use a desktop calculator, and for us this happens naturally.  But these devices work with the help of small elements, the existence of which greatly facilitates life and saves our time. </p><p>  And of course, talk about the battery.  It is a power source that produces electricity.  And this happens under the influence of the ongoing chemical process.  The principle of action is based on the use of a chemical reaction of two metals (possibly their oxides) in an electrolyte with the simultaneous occurrence of an electromotive force.  Since such reactions are irreversible, they are called "primary". </p><h2>  Types of batteries </h2><p>  The labeling of chemical power sources occurs in accordance with the composition of the electrolyte and active metal, which is used in their device.  According to this parameter, there are five types of round (cylinder-shaped) batteries, but two can be considered as the most common and often used: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1. Saline.  Made from inactive coal.  The peculiarity lies in the fact that when a break in activity takes place, the batteries are recreated.  This helps extend battery life. </p><p>  2. Alkaline (alkaline).  Here, an alkaline electrolyte acts as a chemical element.  This type of battery can be stored for a very long time.  During use, the voltage at the electrodes changes to a much lesser extent than salt ones. </p><h2>  Types of batteries </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.turascandinavia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="AA Battery Type" class="if uuid-3152602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131937/3152602.jpg"></div><p>  In everyday life, when you have to choose batteries, there is often confusion, and the question is often, are AAA batteries finger-type or little-finger-type?  To clarify this point, we‚Äôll look at the difference between them: </p><ul><li>  Type AA (finger type) - products related to the AA standard have a diameter of 13-15 mm and a length of 60 mm.  This type of battery is very common around the world. </li><li>  AAA type (pinky ones) - these batteries have such dimensions as: length 44.6 mm, and diameter - up to 10.5 mm.  Weight is about 12 g and voltage is 1.5 V. This type is used in various small electronic devices that consume a small amount of current (all kinds of remote controls, portable audio players, cameras). </li></ul><p>  Having become acquainted with the main types of power sources, we turn to the main topic of this article.  To find out which batteries are better - Durasel or Energizer, you should talk about these competing companies and their products. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Energizer Batteries Characteristics </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cpiop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Battery Energizer" class="if uuid-3152604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131937/3152604.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most famous companies in the field of creating batteries is Energizer.  The logo of this company is known all over the world.  The products are divided into the following groups: Ultimate Lithium, Maximum, Plus and Alkaline. </p><p>  Alkaline batteries work stably at low temperatures, have high charge capacity.  They also have a very small degree of leakage and a long storage time.  Features of the Plus class is the innovative PowerSeal technology, characterized in that it retains charge up to 10 years.  This long period allows you to have no doubt in the reliability of the source used. </p><p>  Maximum batteries are created in accordance with PowerBoost technology and are characterized as the most durable in the Energizer alkaline battery line; their battery life is 70% longer.  Produced in all five sizes. </p><h2>  Durasel batteries: specifications </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pins2pin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Durasel Battery" class="if uuid-3152603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131937/3152603.jpg"></div><p>  In many ways, the American company Durasel received the title of world leader in the production of high-quality batteries and accumulators.  The initial batteries produced by it were mercury sources.  They were more often used in military affairs.  In the future, Durasel regularly created batteries using innovative technologies that were far ahead of competitors in terms of performance. </p><p>  Durasel occupies approximately one fourth of the market in this area, but their popularity has declined over time due to the increasing distribution of competing rechargeable batteries.  This company produces three main classes of alkaline batteries (alkaline): Basic, Professional and Turbo Max. </p><h2>  Comparison of Durasel and Energizer batteries at a price </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.toluna.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="durasel batteries Price" class="if uuid-3152605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131937/3152605.jpg"></div><p>  If we talk about the pricing policy of these firms, then they consist in one segment - "above average".  The high cost of production of these companies is explained by certain points, such as: </p><p>  1. The manufacturing company itself.  Yes, we have to pay for well-known brands with a long and high-profile history.  And this applies not only to shoes, clothes and jewelry, but also to batteries. </p><p>  2. High quality materials used for manufacturing products.  This is undeniable, both companies are not stingy, and apply the most advanced technologies using the highest quality materials. </p><p>  So, the average cost per unit of goods: </p><ul><li>  Battery "Energizer", AA (LR3) - 40-50 rubles. </li><li>  Battery "Durasel", AA (LR3) - 60-65 rubles. </li><li>  Battery "Energizer", AAA (LR6) - 40-50 rubles. </li><li>  Battery "Durasel", AAA (LR6) - 60-65 rubles. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the price of Durasel batteries is higher.  And we have to find out how justified it is. </p><h2>  Battery Comparison by Specifications </h2><p>  After studying all the tests to which the power sources of these companies were subjected, it can be noted that the high price is not necessarily high quality.  Which batteries are better, Durasel or Energizer, cannot be answered without considering their technical characteristics. </p><p>  For a fair assessment, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of batteries of the same type of both firms.  This will be the most common species - alkaline, type AA. </p><ul><li>  The first indicator to evaluate is how quickly the batteries drain when they are continuously discharged.  For greater clarity, we can cite as an example the operation of a powerful player or tank in radio control.  In this test, both companies show far not the best results compared to batteries of a cheaper price category: Durasel - 0.72 hours, Energizer - 0.64 hours. </li><li>  The second indicator to evaluate is how quickly the batteries drain when a powerful, but short-term (pulsed) discharge occurs.  This is an imitation of the work of any gadgets that are characterized by such a discharge, such as a digital camera with a flash.  In this test, the undisputed leader is the Durasel battery, which worked for 4.72 hours in this mode.  ‚ÄúEnergizer‚Äù, as in the first test, showed itself not from the best side - 3.58 hours of work. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews and conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="wslvt-praha.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="aaa battery is a finger or little finger" class="if uuid-3152606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131937/3152606.jpg"></div><p>  So, which batteries are better - Durasel or Energizer?  As you know, the majority of people are subjective due to the fact that it is based solely on personal experience.  And this experience can turn out to be sad only because, for example, a person came across an initially defective product.  Therefore, blindly trust the reviews when choosing batteries is not worth it.  But after reading what people write on the most famous otzovik sites, one thing can be said - there are fewer disappointments with the Durasel batteries than with Energizer power sources.  None of those who left a review deny the fact that the price of Durasel products is high, but most are inclined to believe that it is justified. </p><p>  As for the practical experiments and tests conducted on the batteries, there are also many points here that do not give the possibility of a completely correct assessment.  After all, it is impossible to test and compare all options for power supplies from the entire line presented by both companies.  The average test score for one battery may not look very competitive.  But this does not exclude the possibility that in the same series of batteries of the same company there is a species that will work much more efficiently. </p>
