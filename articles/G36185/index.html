    <h2>  Entertainment, leisure </h2><p>  The rest in the Tortuga Hotel (Nebug) will be remembered by the guests not only for the interior of the rooms or the exquisite cuisine of the hotel restaurant.  Vacationers do not have to get bored in Tortug - hotel animators constantly arrange holidays for children and adults.  The hotel has a modern playground, a barbecue for a picnic, in the evenings there is a summer dance floor. </p><p>  But in the resort village for tourists there is a lot of interesting things - the village of Nebug (Tuapse district) can be called a real center of entertainment.  Here is the "Dolphin" - one of the largest <span>water park</span> in the <span>Krasnodar Territory.</span>  Nebug, in addition, is known as the first city in the Krasnodar Territory in which a water park was built.  There is also a dolphinarium in Nebug, Luna - park, Ice Palace and a huge number of water attractions for any age category.  The dolphinarium and the famous water park (Nebug) are only 100 meters from the Tortuga hotel complex. </p><p>  In addition, vacationers can feel like real seekers of underwater treasures: a diving club operates on the coast, offering dives of any difficulty level, under the guidance of experienced instructors.

    <h2>  Excursions, sights </h2><p>  For the convenience of vacationers, walks and excursions are organized at the hotel for an additional fee.  Unfortunately, the village of Nebug, Tuapse district and the nearest resort villages cannot boast of a large number of interesting cultural sites.  Excursion routes are very popular, including one of the main attractions of the Tuapse district - a group of 13 dolmens, ancient religious buildings made of stone slabs.  These ancient monuments are located just 13 km from the village of Nebug.  Nearby, in the Hoseps Gorge, is a picturesque mountain waterfall, whose height is about eight meters.  In addition, tourists can take a fascinating voyage to the Kiselev rock - the place where the film ‚ÄúThe Diamond Arm‚Äù was filmed. </p>

    <h2>  How can I get to? </h2><p>  It is easiest to get to the village of Nebug (Tuapse district of Krasnodar Territory) along the Dzhubga-Sochi highway, by personal car or tourist transport.  There is also a railway line running along the resort village - the railway station is located in the district center of Tuapse.  Small difficulties may arise if you plan to fly on vacation by plane: there are no direct flights to Nebug.  The two nearest airports are in the cities of Krasnodar and Gelendzhik.  Regular buses and fixed-route taxis regularly run from these cities to Nebug. </p>
