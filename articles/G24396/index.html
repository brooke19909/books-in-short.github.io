This is a long, but fascinating adventure, which will definitely leave a certain impression.  The M29 highway is one of the most picturesque Russian roads, because it passes through wonderful places.  Unfortunately, many drivers are biased towards the Caucasus region and disseminate false information about the quality of the federal highway and safety when driving along it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sdelanounas.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="M29 highway today" class="if uuid-2555962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2555962.jpg"></div><h2>  Track Features </h2><p>  All of Russia is entwined with a network of <span>highways of federal</span> significance, but nowhere are there such features as on the M29 highway.  Since the road runs through the Caucasus region, which has long been famous for the wayward local population, it will not work very quickly. </p><p>  First of all, because there you can meet a huge number of tuned cars and understated Priors, whose drivers perceive any overtaking as a challenge and an invitation to the race.  However, to arrange a race is still not worth it.  Especially when you take into account the different quality of the roadway in different sections of the route.  Oddly enough, the most comfortable stretch of road passes through Chechnya.  In addition, in the summer, the track does not cope with the flow of cars.  This is mainly due to fructose and cars of travelers who go to the sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another and most significant feature is the reinforced traffic police posts and the most real militarized roadblocks.  Passing these sections quickly will not work, as the flow of cars is divided into 2: those who wish to drive in the usual manner and those who are in a hurry.  The queue is formed in any case, so it is unlikely to go round it. </p><p>  Entrance to Chechnya is possible with any numbers, the presence of Chechen license plates is not necessary.  However, Moscow numbers are really rarely found there for obvious reasons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="trest.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Federal highway M29" class="if uuid-2555965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2555965.jpg"></div><h2>  Tinted - no! </h2><p>  If you need to visit the city of Grozny, go along the Chechen section of the M29 highway, you must follow the main rule, namely, remove tinting.  The region is not famous for tranquility, and tinting is an excellent reason for the patrol traffic police to stop the car.  Also, tinting can cause many questions among local residents.  Which of these is better and which is worse, no one will say. </p><h2>  Be careful with gas stations! </h2><p>  In general, the M29 highway is calm and quite well-maintained.  However, in some of its areas there is a problem with gas stations.  Most of all it concerns Kabardino-Balkaria, Ingushetia, North Ossetia and Dagestan.  There are gas stations there, but the fuel quality is very poor.  Going around Chechnya or simply visiting any of these regions, it is undesirable to refuel at local gas stations.  It is recommended that you always have a stock of high-quality fuel and a spare fuel filter with you if you still have to refuel in the region.  It‚Äôs best to have enough fuel and two filters, just in case.  If there is a need for practical recommendations, it is best to ask truckers and drivers of tourist buses, they have unpleasant stories associated with breakdowns due to local fuel.  Their advice will be very useful, because they can recommend good car services and more or less reliable gas stations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru-auto.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Checkpoint in Kabardino-Balkaria on the M29 highway" class="if uuid-2555964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2555964.jpg"></div><h2>  Pavement quality </h2><p>  Roads in Russia are not famous for excellent quality, but quite the contrary, they are famous for permanent pits.  Nevertheless, the M29 <span>federal highway</span> has a satisfactory asphalt surface.  This is especially true of the entrances to the highway, its beginning and exits from it.  The first 100 km of the route pass along the road, which drivers in the jargon call "killed."  However, the farther the path, the better the road. </p><h2>  Striped threat </h2><p>  Driving along the M29 "Caucasus" highway, you need to be as attentive as possible to oncoming traffic.  Drivers of oncoming cars constantly warn of the so-called ‚Äústriped threat‚Äù.  Traffic police or fixation cameras are everywhere.  In the Stavropol Territory, the situation with traffic police is improving.  Their concentration decreases, and stops occur only with a fixed offense.  However, drivers become less polite and often forget to warn of ‚Äúdanger‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru-auto.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Roadblock on the M29 highway" class="if uuid-2555961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2555961.jpg"></div><h2>  Driving rules </h2><p>  The M29 highway today is an amazing place.  The first half of the road is subject to the usual traffic rules.  However, in Kabardino-Balkaria, Ingushetia, North Ossetia or Dagestan, the rules are slightly different.  Drivers often completely ignore road markings and signs.  There you should go either as slowly as possible, or greatly exceed the speed.  No less significant will be the habit of looking in the mirrors.  Local drivers overtake anywhere and anyhow, often do not use turn signals and make maneuvers at the very last moment, and to all this you can safely add a significant excess of the permissible speed limit. </p>
