  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Medieval literature</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Antique times were replaced by the Middle Ages - an important stage in the spiritual development of the peoples of Western Europe.  This time period begins in the 5th century and ends in the first half of the 17th century.  The contradictions and complexity of this era were manifested in the features of the development of its culture.  The history of Western European art distinguishes between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.  The first lasted from the 5th century to the 15th century, and the second from the <span>14th century</span> to the first third of the 17th century. </p><p>  Western European medieval literature and Renaissance literature are traditionally divided into three periods.  Chronologically, this corresponds to the distinction accepted by historical science.  Periodization looks like this: </p><p>  1. Literature of the <span>early Middle Ages</span> (from the 5th century to the 11th century).  It reflected the life of the <span>peoples of Europe</span> during the collapse of the communal system and the formation of feudal relations.  Her oral works are represented mainly by Anglo-Saxons, Celts and Scandinavians, as well as Latin writing. </p><p>  2. Literature of the heyday of feudalism (from the 11th century to the 15th century).  At this time, in parallel with folk works, the work of individual authors was becoming increasingly developed.  In the general literary stream, there are directions expressing the interests and worldview of different classes of feudal society.  There are works written not only in Latin, but also in living European languages. </p><p>  3. The literature of the Renaissance (from the 15th century to the first third of the 17th century).  This is the period of the so-called late Middle Ages, when the feudal community is undergoing a crisis and new economic relations are emerging. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The original genres of medieval literature were formed under the influence of the peculiar and complex life of European peoples in this period.  Many works have not been preserved, and those that remain are of great value for the study of cultural heritage. </p><p>  Medieval literature of the early period is divided into literature written in <span>Latin</span> and literature in the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof local peoples.  The first in content is divided into clerical and secular. </p><p>  Church literature, of course, is inextricably linked with faith in Christ and the <span>Catholic Church.</span>  However, it also included ‚Äúheretical‚Äù ideas expressing protest against the oppression of the people by the clergy and feudal lords. </p><p>  The literature in Latin is represented by the poetry of the vagantas and chronicles reflecting the course of events and their causes.  The latter have become a valuable source for historians. </p><p>  Literature in the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof local peoples is represented by the Irish and Anglo-Saxon epics, as well as Scandinavian creativity. </p><p>  Medieval literature of the period of the formation of <span>feudal society is</span> more diverse in content and genres.  It broader and deeper reflects the morality, ideas, ethics and life of its time.  The interests of the clergy and the feudal class are reflected in the clerical and <span>chivalrous literature.</span>  In oral form, the creativity of a simple people who does not own a literacy continues to develop.  Starting from the 12th century, in connection with the appearance of cities, burgher (city) literature appears.  It is characterized by democracy and has an antifeudal orientation. </p><p>  Renaissance medieval literature has been paying close attention to the real world.  Its content becomes national-historical, it responds to all the needs of modern life, boldly displays all its contradictions.  The main object of the image in the works of this period is a man with his world of feelings and thoughts, his actions.  It is also indicative that the authors use in their work fantastic and fabulous elements originating in folklore. </p><p>  The literature of the Renaissance of different countries has common features characteristic of this period. </p>
