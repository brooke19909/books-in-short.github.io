At this place at different times were the sites of the Cimmerians, Scythians and Sarmatians.  Excavations of numerous mounds around the city date the first settlements to the Middle Paleolithic era.  In the middle and end of the XVIII century, the central location and intersection of several trade routes led to the construction of the fortress of St. Elizabeth on the banks of the Ingul River and several Cossack settlements. </p><h2>  Golden time of the city </h2><p>  An economic impetus to the development of the city was given by the permission to hold four fairs, which merchants gathered on all sides.  In the middle and end of the XIX century, the industrial development of Elizavetgrad (Kirovograd) began.  At this moment, they began to implement the general development plan: they built a large bridge over Ingul, numerous stone houses, laid new boulevards and parks, then the first inns and hotels of Kirovograd appeared.  The stimulus for the development of the city was the construction of the Kharkov-Odessa railway through Elizavetgrad.  This is connected with the construction of several industrial enterprises, the emergence of a telephone exchange and telegraph, electric tram, water supply and other benefits of civilization. </p>
