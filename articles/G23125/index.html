From Rostov ‚Äì on ‚Äì Don it is separated by 40 kilometers.  The city was founded in 1805 by the <span>ataman Platov,</span> and at first it was called New Cherkassk.  Often it is called the unofficial capital of the Cossacks of the Don. </p><p>  Today it is a modern city in which industrial enterprises and research institutes work.  Nevertheless, the history and sights in Novocherkassk are woven together.  Many interesting places related to the history of the Cossacks attract thousands of tourists here annually.  In this article we will introduce you to some of them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Novocherkassk" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1043358.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sights of Novocherkassk: a photo with a description </h2><p>  The Cathedral Military Ascension Cathedral is the main temple not only of this city, but of the entire Cossacks of the Don.  Here lies the ashes of the famous Cossack chieftains <span>V.V.</span>  <span>Orlova-Denisova,</span> M.I.  Platova, Y.P.  Baklanova, <span>I.E.</span>  <span>Efremov,</span> and others. </p><p>  The cathedral was founded in 1805, but its active construction began in 1811.  The work was led by the architect Aloysius Ruski.  The construction lasted seven years, after which the architect left Russia.  The architect Amvrosimov continued his work, but part of the structure collapsed in 1846, the same tragedy occurred in 1863, when the construction was headed by Academician I.O.  Valprede.  The third and most successful project belonged to A.A.  Yashchenko.  It was implemented in May 1905. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history and sights in Novocherkassk" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1043353.jpg" width="600"></div>

The domes of the cathedral sparkled with <span>pure gold,</span> and a clock with a battle and two icons appeared on its facade. </p><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  Separately, a small power station and specially designed for the temple water supply should be mentioned.  The construction is executed in the classical style, and is one of the grand construction projects of that era. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions of Novocherkassk" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1043349.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  During the years of Soviet rule, the Ascension Cathedral suffered a fate typical for that time - at first the gold plating from the domes was removed, and in 1934 the temple was closed.  The room was used as a warehouse, the building was exposed to the devastating effects of precipitation, because the new government did not have the funds to repair the roof.  During the fascist occupation (1942), divine services again began to take place in the Ascension Cathedral, but the cellars of the temple were used as a storehouse until the end of the 90s. </p><h2>  Temple restoration </h2><p>  The restoration of the cathedral began in 2001, and after 5 years the renovated church appeared before the parishioners in all its splendor.  The sights of Novocherkassk surprisingly harmoniously combine antiquity and modern technology.  For example, the Ascension Cathedral has its own video system, which allows you to design biblical subjects on the facade.  In 2011, the domes of the temple were again covered with gold. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The interior of the cathedral was also restored.  The unique painting, the faces of the saints, and priceless murals have been completely restored.  The main attractions of Novocherkassk, to which the magnificent Ascension Cathedral undoubtedly belongs, are constantly being restored and decorated.  Residents of the city are very sensitive to their history. </p><h2>  Michael the Archangel Church </h2><p>  Not all the attractions of Novocherkassk were built in this city.  For example, the Mikhailo-Arkhangelsk Church was built in Cherkassk and was moved to a new place in 1812 on Arkhangelsk Square.  Here he was more than half a century.  Then the wooden structure was dilapidated and the local authorities decided to erect a stone cathedral.  Almost immediately, fundraising began, which allowed in 1873 to build a temple according to the project of architect Y. Sedov.  In the same year he was consecrated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novocherkassk city sights" class="if" height="488" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1043352.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The two-story new brick church was an impressive (both outside and inside) structure.  The jewelry that was once brought from Cherkassk was not only fully preserved, but also significantly increased.  This temple operated for another fifty years.  During this time, a parish school was built, the murals and the interior were updated several times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the late 1920s, this church was one of the first to be closed in the city.  Most priests were exiled or shot.  The temple values ‚Äã‚Äã(4 kg of gold, 864 kg of silver, precious stones) were seized in favor of the state treasury. </p><p>  In 1990, Father Oleg, a priest of the Mikhailovsky Church, sent a request to the authorities to return the church to the fold of Orthodoxy, which was granted.  Soon financing of <span>restoration work began,</span> and after 7 years the first big celebration was held on the occasion of the 125th anniversary of the temple.  Currently, the Church of Archangel Michael has a community of nurses and the same parish school.  Two choirs are organized, whose chants accompany the services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novocherkassk city sights" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1043356.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ataman Palace </h2><p>  Many sights of Novocherkassk are inextricably linked with the interesting history of the Don Cossacks.  This can be said about the Ataman Palace.  It was decided to build it in 1863, since since that time the members of the august family were appointed to this position. </p><p>  The building is designed in a classic style.  The author of the project was academician of architecture I.O.  Valprede.  Over the long history of the palace-residence, twelve atamans worked and lived here; three emperors came to Novocherkassk with working visits - Nicholas II, Alexander II, Alexander III. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Novocherkassk photo with description" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1043357.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After 1917, Novocherkassk changed a lot.  The sights of the city began to be used in a new quality.  For example, in the Ataman Palace at different times the District Executive Committee and the Health Department, the Physical Culture Council and the Education Department were located.  During the Second World War, the palace was not damaged at the hands of the invaders - they located their general headquarters in a magnificent building. </p><p>  The sights of Novocherkassk awaited a new historical milestone during the period of perestroika.  The Ataman Palace did not stand aside.  By decree of the President of Russia B. Yeltsin, the offices of all the officials who were in the building were sealed for one day, and the palace itself was transferred to the city administration. </p><p>  The palace received the status of an architectural and cultural monument in 2001.  In this regard, he was transferred to the balance of the Museum of the Don Cossacks.  Since that moment, restoration work has been going on almost continuously to restore the original appearance of the building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Novocherkassk" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1043350.jpg" width="425"></div>

    <p>  Today, many tourists who come to Novocherkassk begin to study interesting monuments and sights of the city from this palace, since the museum exposition located in the building gives a complete picture of the history and formation of the Don Cossacks.  Museum visitors are delighted with exquisite carved stucco molding, unique <span>ceiling painting, and</span> fireplaces finished in white marble.  It is planned to restore the house church, which used to be in the eastern wing of the palace, but it was destroyed during the Soviet era. </p><h2>  Grekov House Museum </h2><p>  Noteworthy are the cultural attractions of Novocherkassk.  These include the house-museum of the founder of battle painting of the XX century I. B. Grekov.  The artist‚Äôs museum was decided to create in 1957.  It is part of the Museum of the Don Cossacks.  The artist mainly worked in his hometown, so the organizers did not experience a lack of materials when creating the exposition.  All the paintings in the artist‚Äôs house are authentic, except for the famous ‚ÄúTachanka‚Äù (its original is stored in the Tretyakov Gallery).  In addition, here you can see the personal belongings of the master, his studies, sketches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history and sights in Novocherkassk" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1043354.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The memorial team is trying to maintain the atmosphere of the estate.  Nowadays, a house, a garden, an outbuilding look the same as during the life of a famous artist.  True, a monument to I.B.  Grekov.  In addition to the permanent exhibition, there are exhibitions of local artists. </p><h2>  House ‚Äì Museum of Krylov </h2><p>  Sights of Novocherkassk in our article continues the museum of the famous artist I.I.  Krylova.  The master was born in the village of Elizabeth.  After graduating from the Military High School (Novocherkassk), a talented young man entered the Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg.  At the beginning of the XX century, Krylov moved from the city on the Niva to his native land, where he worked productively for many years. </p><p>  Create a house-museum of the artist conceived his daughter - N.I.  Gurieva.  Soon her dream came true, thanks to the support of the Museum of the History of the Cossacks, which still holds many works of I.I.  Krylova. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions of Novocherkassk" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1043351.jpg" width="425"></div>
