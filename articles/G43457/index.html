Among them, the coast of the <span>Primorsky Territory,</span> in particular, the village of Livadia.  This is the coastal zone of Nakhodka on the shore of Reef Bay, in Vostok Bay.  The village of Livadia (Primorsky Territory) is a paradise for a good rest in their native land. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  If we talk about Livadia, then we need to pay attention to the history of the settlement in this place.  Land development on the territory of modern Nakhodka began in the 19th century.  The first settlement was founded by the Finns in 1868 on the shore of Gaydamak Bay.  Then the settlement fell into disrepair, and after a certain period, in 1890, a whaling base appeared there, which existed until 1911. Only in October of that year the now famous Livadia village appeared. </p><p>  Then, in 1939, in the ice-free bay of Nakhodka, a port was built and a working village was founded, which eventually turned into a city of the same name.  Now it is a city with a population of 200 thousand inhabitants.  And Livadia (Primorsky Territory) became a part of the city in 2004.  Now this microdistrict is the most popular and popular venue for summer vacations for vacationers and tourists of the Far East. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-826102" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31568/826102.jpg?1530272502"></div><h2>  The peculiarity of the rest in the Far East </h2><p>  Primorsky <span>Krai</span> is good for many <span>.</span>  <span>The beaches of</span> Livadia are famous not only in the area.  These are magnificent vacation spots on the Pacific coast, naturally lined with fine fine <span>white sand.</span>  The beaches stretch for several kilometers along the coast of the <span>Sea of</span> Japan in the <span>southern</span> part of the Far East.  Transparent water, a panoramic view with sheer cliffs, sea bays, the scent of herbs of the seaside, white sands of beaches, beautiful grottoes, countless meadows - all this is Livadia, Primorsky Territory.  The nature of this place is fascinating, impressive and attracts to itself.  Having visited these places at least once, I want to return again. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Rest in the Primorsky Territory</span> (Livadia) is an ideal option for those who are tired of city noise, bustle, smog and the stress of a <span>big city.</span>  The former name of the village - Gaydamak, was changed and borrowed from the Crimean resort, the town of Livadia, located on the Black Sea coast.  Seaside Livadia resembles a Crimean resort with its beaches and bays.  Pomeranians often call Livadia "the Far Eastern Crimean resort." </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-826100" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31568/826100.jpg?1530272502"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Natural and weather conditions make it possible to spend holidays on the shores of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan in Livadia.  The peak of the beach season falls on August-September.  It is during these months that the warmest and sunniest weather is established on the coast, the rains stop, the water in the sea warms up completely, and the wave becomes low.  Between August and September, the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan is the most calm, and the water in the waters of coastal bays is crystal clear.  A shallow depth allows the water to warm up to air temperature.  The average temperature of water and air from July to September is +24 degrees.  Weather in Livadia (Primorsky Territory) pleases with softness and stability during the beach season.  Only a few days in August are accompanied by gales. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-826103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31568/826103.jpg?1530272502"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  In Livadia there is everything for a comfortable and complete rest.  Tourism infrastructure is developed.  It offers guests in Livadia: many hotels, recreation centers, <span>summer houses.</span>  Diversely you can spend time outside the beaches.  For a good rest at the resort there are many discos, dance floors, night clubs, 24-hour cafes and bars.  Fans of extreme relaxation are offered hang gliding, parachute jumping, scooter, catamaran, boat and motorcycle rental. </p><p>  Lots of fun for the kids.  The most popular among young tourists is the local dolphinarium and water park.  Dolphinarium moved to Livadia from Vladivostok.  The basis of his activity is scientific work, however, scientists agreed with the presence of tourists.  In the dolphinarium of the village of Livadia (Primorsky Territory), belugas and dolphins have taken root.  They are friendly to guests, quickly master new tricks, arrange a real show.  For children, all this action has a beneficial effect, leaving a huge impression in memory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-826099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31568/826099.jpg?1530272502"></div><h2>  The popularity of the Far Eastern beach holiday </h2><p>  The popularity of the resort is growing every year.
