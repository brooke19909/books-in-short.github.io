Fundamentals and elements of geomorphology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Do you know what geomorphology studies?  From its very name you can guess about it.  However, a detailed definition cannot be deduced from it.  Meanwhile, geomorphology is <span>the science</span> of the origin, structure, modern dynamics and history of the development of the surface relief of our planet.  Thus, the object of study in it is relief.  This is what geomorphology is.  The definition given above will be described in detail in this article. </p><h2>  <span>What is a relief?</span> </h2><p>  Decide on a key concept.  The relief studied by geomorphology is the totality of all the irregularities of the Earth‚Äôs surface, different in age, origin, size, shape and history of development.  We can say that this is a complex of forms having one or another geological structure, which are exposed to the hydrosphere, atmosphere and internal forces of our planet.  The study of the relief is therefore impossible if you do not have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe properties and composition of the rocks composing it.  In addition, you need to know the processes that affect it. </p><h2>  Earth's crust </h2>

    <p>  Knowing the characteristics of the earth's crust is important for understanding what geomorphology is studying.  We will tell about her too.  The earth's crust (namely, its upper part and forms a relief) is constantly changing.  It is influenced by forces that are caused by processes occurring in the hydrosphere and atmosphere.  The earth‚Äôs crust is a product of endogenous (deep) processes that occur in the bowels of our planet.  The relief experiences many changes.  They occur under the influence of all these processes.  What does the earth's crust consist of?  It is formed by metamorphic, sedimentary and igneous rocks.  They react differently to internal and external forces acting on them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Relief features </h2>

    <p>  Dead organic matter and living organisms have a great impact on the features of the relief, on its formation.  This effect happens both directly when specific biogenic geological bodies or <span>relief forms</span> are created <span>,</span> and indirectly when the chemical and physical properties of rocks of the water and air <span>shells of the Earth</span> change <span>.</span>  Note that the relief of our planet itself, which is a collection of surfaces that either have significant slopes, then almost horizontal, affects geomorphological processes.  For example, in the lowland plains and in the mountains, they flow differently. </p><h2>  Terrain hypsometry </h2><p>  We introduce another concept - relief hypsometry.  This is the position of a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Earth‚Äôs surface relative to sea level.  It also affects relief formation, often causing processes that cannot occur at another hypsometric level.  We give an example.  Glaciers in today's climatic conditions can occur in equatorial, tropical and temperate zones only in high mountains.  A whole series of processes is observed only at the bottom of oceanic and deep sea basins. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The concept of "relief" can be clarified based on the foregoing.

    <p>  Since the earth‚Äôs crust is involved in this interaction, and we are talking about the roughness of its surface, it is difficult to imagine the study of the relief without knowing the internal structure of the forms that form it.  Relief-forming processes are diverse and complex to interact with each other.  However, the force of gravity is always involved in them, as one of the main components.  Therefore, the surface slope is also one of the most important characteristics of the relief in geomorphology.  In addition, the ‚Äúset‚Äù and intensity of the manifestation of various external agents, the strength of the earth's gravity are determined precisely by the relief hypsometry. </p><h2>  Relations of geomorphology with the sciences included in the geographical cycle </h2><p>  So, the relief is a product of geological development, but at the same time a component of the geographical landscape.  This position of the object of science of interest to us indicates the need for its close ties with such branches of knowledge as physical geography and geology.  Geomorphology, however, is not only related to them.  And soon you will find out why. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  As we have already said, geomorphology is a science that studies relief.  It is worth noting that in the structure of the Earth it occupies a special place.  The fact is that the relief is both the interface and the interaction surface of the shells of our planet: the hydrosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere and biosphere.  At the same time, it is a component of the <span>geographical environment.</span>  Consequently, its study can be maximally fruitful only when considered in interaction with the other components of the geographical environment.  Therefore, geomorphology is a science that has a particularly close relationship with physical geography, as well as with other sciences that are part of the geographic cycle. </p><h2>  The historicity of geomorphology </h2><p>  Another characteristic feature is historicity.  Geomorphology is a science that seeks to determine the sequence of events that occurred on Earth, which led to the emergence of a modern relief.  In his knowledge, this science uses the achievements of geology, geography, as well as many other disciplines related to the natural-historical cycle.  In particular, since the Earth is a planet, geomorphology refers to such sciences as cosmogony and astronomy.  In matters of the state, composition, structure of matter, which is involved in the formation of various forms of relief, she uses the achievements of chemistry and physics. </p><h2>  Types of geomorphology </h2><p>  Geomorphology today is a fairly ramified science.  It is divided into areas of knowledge, industry, research areas, parts.  Geomorphology has many research methods.  This science solves both applied and fundamental problems. </p><p>  The whole diversity of forms of scientific activity is united by the fact that all parts of geomorphology study the relief, its age, origin, evolution, its mutual influence and its relationship with other properties and elements of the endogenous and exogenous nature of the Earth. </p><p>  Types of geomorphology include the following: </p><ul><li>  general geomorphology; </li><li>  historical (paleogeomorphology); </li><li>  dynamic; </li><li>  planetary; </li><li>  regional; </li><li>  field; </li><li>  math; </li><li>  experimental; </li><li>  remote; </li><li>  geomorphological cartography; </li><li>  geomorphology of the bottom of the oceans and seas; </li><li>  land geomorphology. </li></ul><p>  This science has developed a special section in which relief formation in its interaction with climate is studied.  This section is called climate geomorphology.  The sculptural relief, as scientists have found, has a clear climatic zonality. </p><h2>  The practical side of geomorphology </h2>

    <p>  The purpose of studying this science from the practical side is to know the laws by which the relief develops, and based on this, use the revealed patterns in practical activities. </p><p>  Geomorphology is needed in the field of hydraulic structures and land reclamation.  The construction of irrigation canals in arid areas, and in wetlands, a drainage network, requires careful study of the relief.  Its features also need to be known during the construction of hydroelectric power plants in the mountains and on the plains.  Communication lines and road construction are also based on this science. </p><p>  Her achievements are used in the planning of large farms, towns and cities.  We give an example.  The city of Divnogorsk is located on a slope, so rainwater flows into the Yenisei, and the slope dries quickly.  A geomorphological map is used in the planning of various settlements.  It shows the surface structure, the components of the relief, the spatial distribution and the nature of its forms.  Depending on the features of the relief, the location of residential quarters, economic and industrial enterprises, the direction of highways is determined.  No less important is its study in the water supply of large industrial enterprises and settlements. </p><p>  Geological, topographic, botanical, soil surveys also begin precisely with the study of the relief.  Hydrogeological and hydrological surveys are also carried out based on it. </p><p>  Geomorphology plays a very large role in the organization of state defense.  The commanders of different nations and times have long been counting campaigns, taking into account the features of the relief.  Modern military science also gives them due attention. </p>

    <p>  It is necessary not only to know the types and forms of relief existing today, but also to anticipate the likely changes in the surface of our planet in the future under the influence of various processes.  This is especially true, for example, in the construction of high-rise buildings on fragile soil or in the construction of seaports. </p><h2>  Geomorphology and mining </h2><p>  Analysis of the history of development and features of the relief is an effective way to search for various natural resources.  Therefore, the elements of geomorphology in this area are in great demand.  For example, placer deposits of diamonds, gold and other valuable minerals are usually associated with the ancient and modern river network, since river flows eroded the gold-bearing rocks for a long time and collected heavy minerals in alluvial terraces.  In addition, iron ores and bauxites are often found on ancient leveling surfaces.  Deposits of coal, gas and oil are usually confined to certain tectonic structures.  These structures in many areas are reflected in the forms of the surface of our planet, so the deposits of these minerals helps to detect relief analysis. </p><h2>  Key facts from the history of the development of geomorphology </h2><p>  The relief of the Earth‚Äôs surface is one of the most important conditions for human economic activity, its very existence.  Information about him, of course, accumulated from the early stages of the emergence and development of society.  However, the concept of "geomorphology" did not appear immediately.  As a scientific discipline, it began to take shape only at the end of the 18th - beginning of the 19th century.  It is closely connected with geology, so it began to develop after it.  It was to this time that the first works on the conditions for the development and occurrence of the relief of the Earth's surface belong. </p>

    <p>  In 1763, the work "On the Layers of the Earth" by M.V. <span>Lomonosov appeared (</span> his <span>portrait</span> is presented above).  In it, he first expressed the idea that the relief develops as a result of the interaction of various exogenous and endogenous forces.  It is this idea that lies today at the basis of geomorphological science. </p><p>  At the end of the 19th century, the works of Pavlov, Penk, Richthofen appeared, in which the ideas about the structure of the Earth's surface and the origin of the relief, accumulated by predecessors, are systematized, and attempts are made to classify it.  The names of V. Penk, a German researcher, and V. Davis, an American scientist, are associated with the appearance of the first general geomorphological concepts, the separation of this science into an independent branch of knowledge. </p><h2>  Geomorphology today </h2><p>  In recent years, both in our country and in Western Europe, much attention has been paid to the development of geomorphology.  On the one hand, researchers pay attention to the relationship between geological structures and terrain (they are studied by structural geomorphology), and on the other, they are interested in exogenous geomorphological processes (dynamic and climatic geomorphology).  Paleogeomorphology, that is, the study of the ancient relief, is also given great attention.  These, of course, are only the main directions of its modern development. </p><p>  Now you know what science is studying geomorphology, the basic concepts related to it, directions and history of development, we also examined.  And also noted that it is very important both from a theoretical and from a practical point of view.  The basics of geomorphology presented in this article, we hope you find it useful. </p>
