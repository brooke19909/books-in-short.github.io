    <p>  The territory, which included the boyar republic, was not limited only to Novgorod lands.  The borders of the republic at the time of their greatest prosperity reached the following boundaries: </p><ul><li>  in the west - to the Baltic Sea; </li><li>  in the east - to the Ural Mountains; </li><li>  in the north - to the headwaters of the Volga River; </li><li>  in the south - to the <span>Western Dvina River.</span> </li></ul><p>  Novgorod itself is located on the banks of the Volkhov River. </p><h2>  History of the Republic </h2><p>  Novgorod land has been inhabited since ancient times.  It is known that in the VI century Krivichi arrived here, later the Ilmen Slovenes came.  The territory was one of the centers of Russia.  It was here that the Rurikovich began to reign. </p><p>  Novgorod has always sought to gain independence from Russia.  The first attempts began in the 11th century.  The boyars received support from the urban population to get rid of the need to pay taxes to Kiev.  They wanted to create their own army. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such an opportunity presented itself in 1132.  Mstislav the Great dies and the period begins, which historians define by the term ‚ÄúSpecific Russia‚Äù.  It means a period of fragmentation.  Each principality wanted to independently manage their affairs.  The Grand Duke retained only a nominal dominant position. </p><p>  In 1136, the son of the late Mstislav Vsevolod escapes from the battlefield.  For this, the Novgorodians expelled their prince.  Republican rule was established. </p><h2>  Times of the Mongol invasion </h2>

    <p>  With the invasion of the Mongols, as well as their campaigns in <span>Russia, the Novgorod</span> Boyar Republic (briefly Novgorod) was able to avoid ruin.  It was located far from other lands of Russia.  However, the following Novgorod possessions were plundered and devastated: </p><ul><li>  Torzhok; </li><li>  Vologda; </li><li>  Bezhetsk. </li></ul><p>  About fifteen years in the lands reigned Alexander Nevsky.  Another famous prince was Ivan Kalita.  In 1259, the boyar republic was obliged to pay tribute to the Horde. </p><p>  Until the XV century, Novgorod expanded its possessions to the east, northeast. </p><h2>  Political system </h2><p>  The political system of the Novgorod boyar republic had its own characteristics.  They manifested themselves in the fact that the boyars had significant landownership and social weight.  It so happened historically that the boyars actively participated in fishing activities and trade.  In the republic, the main economic factor was capital, not land. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Public administration was carried out using the veche.  It was a collection of a separate part of the male population of Novgorod. </p><p>  Veche had broad powers: </p><ul><li>  called upon the prince; </li><li>  freed the prince from authority; </li><li>  elected a posadnik, lord; </li><li>  made a decision on the outbreak of war and its cessation; </li><li>  dealt with laws; </li><li>  decided the size of duties and taxes. </li></ul><p>  Veche had the right not only to elect representatives of the authorities, but also to judge them.  Its traditions go back to the roots of popular assemblies, which originate from tribal councils. </p>

    <p>  The princes had no such influence in the political life as the veche.  Their functions included civil court, defense.  In wartime, the prince acted as chief commander.  Some cities of the boyar republic had their own princes.  Veche reserved the right to remove the king, who could not cope with his duties or threaten the political system. </p><p>  Executive power formally belonged to the posadnik, that is, the <span>head of the city.</span>  He led the work of officials.  Posadnik and the prince together dealt with matters of court and administration. </p><p>  There was a council of gentlemen in Novgorod.  It consisted of an archbishop, a posadnik, a thousand, elders.  The archbishop was not just one of the leaders of the republic, he kept the state treasury, controlled the <span>standards of weights</span> and measures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Agriculture </h2><p>  Specific Russia, like all medieval society, was agrarian.  Novgorod was no exception.  Most of the population lived through farming.  The city depended on the countryside. </p><p>  Boyars and individual monasteries owned a significant part of the land, which included villages with dependent peasants.  The settlements were small, consisted of only a few yards. </p><p>  Agriculture began to develop after the 13th century.  Prior to this, he was hindered by epidemics, pestilence and other negative factors.  In the XIII century, a three-floor system was introduced, which quickly proved its effectiveness.  Peasants were no longer required to roam in search of forests to enrich the soil. </p>

    <p>  Soil cultivation improved with the appearance of double-toed plow with police.  Rye was mainly planted on the land.  Flax, buckwheat, millet and other cereals were also grown.  Onions planted onions, cabbage, turnips.  Hoppers worked separately.  They produced raw materials for making beer - the most consumed drink of medieval Novgorod.  The principality of Moscow became interested in lands. </p><p>  Fishing, flight-hunting, and hunting became widespread.  Honey was obtained from wild bees.  It was enough not only for domestic needs, but also for export. </p><h2>  Handicraft </h2><p>  In addition to agriculture, the Novgorodians were engaged in various crafts.  Among them, iron smelting can be distinguished.  The resulting metal was processed by blacksmiths. </p><p>  The characterization of the Novgorod boyar republic would be incomplete without mentioning salt production and pearl fishing.  The production of salt was carried out by the peasants of Pomerania, Derevskaya Pyatina, Shelonsky Pyatina. </p><p>  Novgorod produced its own knives, axes, agricultural implements, and weapons.  In the XV century, Novgorod industry was able to arrange the production of firearms.  In some cases, it was decorated with precious metals and stones. </p><p>  There were especially narrow specialties in cities.  These included the profession of a lockman.  It was distinguished by its complexity due to the fact that some locks consisted of several dozen details. </p><p>  Pottery, weaving, leather and shoe craft were widespread.  Musical instruments, such as gusli and pipes, were also made in Novgorod. </p><h2>  Trade </h2>

    <p>  Mr. <span>Veliky Novgorod</span> has established a relationship with Europe.  This was important for all of Russia.  Through the city there was a path "from the Varangians to the Greeks."  In other words, goods came from the Scandinavian states to Byzantium. </p><p>  In Novgorod there was a bargain.  It consisted of 1800 shops, which were divided into rows.  Each row traded in separate products. </p><p>  The city began to trade with Western Europe in the X century.  Mention of this has been preserved in the Scandinavian sagas. </p><p>  In the XII century, trade relations were established with the island of the Baltic Sea called Gotland.  Over time, the Germans ousted the Gotlanders. </p><p>  Goods were sold and acquired in bulk - in bags, barrels, hundreds and thousands of pieces.  Under the strict ban was trade on credit.  For non-compliance with the rules, the goods could be confiscated. </p><p>  Fur and wax were mainly exported from Novgorod.  The last material was needed to illuminate large Gothic cathedrals.  Wax was bought in circles, each of which weighed one hundred and sixty kilograms. </p><p>  Expensive cloth, non-ferrous metals, spices, herring, salt were brought into the city.  In lean years, Novgorodians acquired foreign bread. </p><h2>  Division into estates </h2>

    <p>  The main landowning group in Novgorod (the boyar republic) were the townspeople.  The upper class consisted of boyars.  They owned capital and land, provided money to merchants.  The boyars came from the local tribal nobility, they were the most influential people in the republic, occupying all important posts.  Boyars were the element of the oligarchy that determined the form of government. </p><p>  People lived below the boyars.  They owned less capital and not as significant land as the boyars.  People did not hold higher posts.  It happened that representatives of this class could engage in trade. </p><p>  A step below was the merchants.  It was divided into guilds.  Craftsmen, small traders and workers were attributed to black people. </p><p>  The rural population was also heterogeneous.  Those who owned the land were called boyars and natives.  Peasants living on state land were called smerds.  Those who were supposed to cultivate other people's private lands were called isorants and nomads.  Purchases were considered peasants who took payment for their work in advance.  At the lower level there were stiff slaves. </p><h2>  The decline of the republic </h2><p>  Starting from the XIV century, Mr. <span>Veliky Novgorod</span> became interested in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as well as Tver and Moscow.  The ruling circles of the republic did not want to pay tribute to the Moscow principality; they sought support from Lithuania. </p>

    <p>  In 1470, Novgorod asked the bishop of Kiev, who at that time was under Lithuanian rule.  This was the reason for Ivan the Third to go to war in Novgorod.  Troops met with militias by the Sheloni River.  Novgorodians were defeated.  The city was taken, and in 1478 annexed to the Moscow Principality. </p><p>  Ivan the Third liquidated the veche, and their bell moved to Moscow.  He also abolished the post of posadnik, and executed many boyars.  Part of the upper class was exported to other lands.  Their place was taken by service people from the central regions of the Moscow state.  So the boyar republic ceased to exist. </p>
