Many call it a sculpture of flowers.  To learn this skill, you need to study a lot, read literature and, of course, have an aesthetic taste.  There are many canons and folding techniques.  Each <span>element of the composition</span> has a certain meaning and its own meaning.  This is a combination of colors, and the shape of a vase, and the layout of materials.  They use not only flowers, but also branches, leaves, fruits and berries, herbs and dried plants, even imitations and <span>artificial flowers.</span> </p><h2>  Origin history </h2><p>  Such art was born in Japan.  In translation, the word ikebana means fresh flowers or a second life for <span>flowers.</span>  <span>In Japanese</span> , ike is life, and bana is a flower.  Such a technique arose in the 15th century.  At first, in the <span>temples of Japan, the</span> monks designed such compositions in order to present a gift to the gods and decorate the temple. </p><p>  The basic principle of creating ikebana is sophistication and simplicity, which are achieved by a vision of the natural beauty of nature.  It is not necessary to have many different colors, just one bud, a leaf and a branch are enough, but the master will lay them out so that endless outer space will be used, show the whole breadth of his soul, his vision of the world.  At this moment, the only flower of the composition can symbolize eternal life. </p>

    <p>  Ikenobo is considered to be the very first bouquet-making school.  It was founded by a clergyman from Kyoto who made ikebans for the Rokkaku-do Buddhist temple, named Ikenobo Senkai.  The traditions of the old school are still used by monks to decorate temples and ritual festivals.  Many believe that it is this ancient style of Rikka that reflects the greatness of nature.  The use of each element in the composition is justified by customs and canons.  For example, pine branches convey the power of rocks and stones, and white chrysanthemums are symbols of rivers and small streams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ancient legend </h2><p>  In Japan, there is a legend about the origin of this art.  Once a hurricane swept through the country, during which many plants and flowers died as a result of strong wind and rain.  Buddhist monks gathered all the broken flowers from the garden and came to the temple with a prayer, asking God for mercy to restore the gardens. </p><p>  Buddha heeded the requests of the clergy, and the gardens again began to delight people with beautiful plants.  Since then, the monks gratefully bring beautifully composed asymmetric bouquets to the temple, trying to please the deity. </p><h2>  Ikebana Philosophy </h2><p>  Before making ikebana, the Japanese carefully think over the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcomposition, because, according to the monks, they served as a link between the world of the living and the dead.  The ritual offering of flowers to the Buddha was regular.  In India, Buddhists only scattered flowers near the statue of God in temples, and the Japanese invested philosophical meaning in every piece of floral art. </p><p>  The main meaning of ikebana is the opposition of the forces of darkness and light.  These are symbols of Heaven and Earth.  Therefore, the bouquets consisted of two branches.  Later, when the monks visited China, under the influence of the teachings of Confucianism, another branch was added, symbolizing Man. </p><p>  A strong influence on the philosophical significance of building the composition was exerted by the Zen doctrine, which noted the importance of being.  It denied magnificent rituals, and preferred a momentary reality and the ordinaryness of existence. </p><h2>  Japanese ikebana schools </h2><p>  In addition to the traditional Ikenobo, there are also more modern techniques for composing bouquets.  In 1897, a new style of ikebana appeared - this is Moribana.  This school trains masters to create compositions in flat vessels, low vases.  They use metal tattoos - kenzans.  The stems of plants or flowers are pricked on vertical needles, which ensures fixation in the desired position.  Kenzan is usually placed in a low vessel, hide it with plant material, and so that the flowers do not fade, the vase is filled with water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="autumn ikebana" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2112684.jpg"></div></h3><p>  The most modern school of ikebana art is Sogutse.  She is relatively young, arose in 1927.  It differs from other methods in that it uses not only flowers and plants, but also various other <span>natural materials.</span>  These are stones and plastic, fabric and even metal.  The main flower sculptor who initiates the creation of this school is Sofu Tesigahara.  He is considered an innovator and artist.  In Europe and America, he was nicknamed the Picasso of Flowers. </p><h2>  Popular contemporary styles </h2><p>  Currently, the art of teaching ikebana geishas.  There are special courses in our country.  Although the term appeared in Russia only in the twentieth century, the compilation of compositions captivated many.  Nowadays, ancient techniques are rarely seen, only some of them are fond of the masters.  We list only the most popular ones and how they differ from the rest. </p><p>  The Nageire or Hake style is characterized by finding flowers in tall vases with a narrow neck.  For the correct arrangement of plants, they rely on the edge of the vase.  If you need to change position, then take special wooden supports. </p><p>  Moriban's style is characterized by low vases, water trays.  Holders are used: kenzans or sippos described earlier. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Jiyuka is a free arrangement of natural material. </p><h2>  Moribana </h2><p>  Let's take a closer look at what this style represents.  Compositions reflect the philosophy of naturalism, all the works of masters look three-dimensional, voluminous.  Vases are all low, but can have different shapes: round and oval, square and rectangular. </p><p>  This style has three main rules for making a bouquet.  They are called Sin (sky), Soe (man), Tai (earth).  The ratio of these formative elements should be in the proportion of 7: 5: 3.  The dimensions of the vase are also taken into account.  First, the basic elements are laid out on metal rods, then depth is created thanks to additions.  They connect all the parts together. </p>

    <p>  There are 3 shapes in this style: </p><ol><li>  Tekutay has a vertical shape of the structure of the bouquet.  Long straight stems are used.  This is bamboo, gladiolus, daffodil.  The main element - Sin - is installed vertically.  Deviation is only permissible by 30 ¬∞. </li><li>  Syatay.  It uses the oblique shape of the line construction.  Branches with beautiful and unusual bends of the trunk are often used.  The apex deviates already much more than 30 ¬∞.  It seems that the bouquet was tilted by a strong wind. </li><li>  Suitai consists of several cascades.  Use hanging plants.  The main element of Sin can fall below the vase, creating a beautiful bend.  Such vases look impressive on high shelves or whatnots. </li></ol><h2>  Nageire </h2><p>  Ikebana from the flowers of this style has the same basic forms and proportions as the previous one.  The difference is represented by the shape of the vessel in which the composition is placed.  For Nageire, a tall vase is taken, the narrow neck of which holds the plants.  Additional fasteners are also used - crosses, split branches, wooden struts in the shape of the letter V. </p>

    <p>  This style conveys not only the beauty of natural landscapes, but also reveals the graceful bends of flower stems and plant branches. </p><h2>  Jiyuka </h2><p>  The freedom of style is manifested in the originality of the choice of material, this is a kind of surrealism ikebana from natural materials.  It combines the ancient art of composing bouquets and the contemporary look of the artist.  Here, any modification of the shape of the leaves is possible, the addition of materials both natural and inanimate.  Often used dry herbs and leaves, fruits, glass and stones, plastic.  An unusual shape of the vessels in which the masterpiece is created is also selected. </p>

    <p>  The free style of composing bouquets allows the use of mixing other styles.  Vegetable materials of the surrounding nature can be used, geometric symbols, color mixes are added.  Modern textured materials allow fantasy artists to take a walk, embodying the most reckless designs. </p><p>  In the style of Dziyuk, you can create countless images by combining plant and artificially created material. </p><h2>  How to create an ikebana? </h2><p>  Consider how you can make an autumn ikebana with your own hands.  To do this, take a sharp knife and go for a walk in the autumn forest or park.  The basic rule for composing ikebana is presented in detail in the article.  These are the three main elements that have a 7: 5: 3 ratio. </p>

    <p>  We list the basic rules for composing a composition: </p><ol><li>  All three main parts are placed in the shape of a triangle, and all its angles are located in different planes. </li><li>  The vessel in which ikebana is located should not have any coloring.  This object can have any shape, but be monophonic, because it should not distract the contemplators from the bouquet itself. </li><li>  First, there are three main elements, then there is already a filling of the space between them. </li></ol><p>  You can do the work using the basic styles, or you can collect a free composition.  For autumn ikebans, branches and leaves are used, elements with fruits, cones and chestnuts, plant seeds on the branches.  Bunches of ash look beautiful.  Here already try it yourself, fantasize to your liking.  You can take dry grass and flowers like the immortelle. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  First, in the work on the autumn ikebana, a vessel is chosen.  In our case, this role is played by a simple clay vase.  It is also necessary to have a foundation.  It‚Äôs best to buy a metal stand called kenzan at the store.  If it is not, then you can independently nail several nails in a row on a wooden stand. </p>

    <p>  The three main elements of our autumn ikebana are yellow chrysanthemum and twigs with red berries of barberry.  They are easy to find in autumn in parks or on slopes. </p><p>  It remains only to assemble the composition, given the proportions of the elements.  Remember that this is not a bouquet; it does not require splendor.  It will be enough to start to create such a simple plot. </p><h2>  Ikebana from the leaves </h2><p>  For the free style of ikebana (photo below), you can use large leaves of palm trees or ferns.  Allowed full deformation of the material.  So in the photo we see that palm leaves are cut off on one side of the twig and folded in an arc.  These leaf elements are located in different planes. </p>

    <p>  In the central part of the composition are bright floral accents.  The proportions inherent in ikebana are observed.  All three points with the correct sides are clearly visible.  The empty space is filled with smaller leaves and another, more rounded shape.  The vase, flat and plain, does not interfere with the perception of the artist‚Äôs paintings. </p><p>  Creating such simple compositions is not difficult, be sure to try, and our tips will help you with this. </p>
