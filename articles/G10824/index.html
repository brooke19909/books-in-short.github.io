Its population is just over a million people.  This settlement is located on the banks of the Belaya River, 100 kilometers west of the Bashkir Urals.  It is officially divided into 7 administrative districts.  There are a huge number of interesting places that deserve attention.  Arriving in the city of <span>Ufa, sights</span> can be found in each of the areas.  However, tourists begin the inspection with <span>architectural structures.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ufa attractions" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/227925.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  These are mainly monuments of the 18-19th century.  Of course, a huge number of them were converted into state and public institutions during the anti-religious Soviet period.  Arriving in the city of Ufa, the sights - religious buildings that deserve attention - can still be seen, although not in large numbers.  One of the brightest buildings in the capital of Bashkortostan is the Lala-Tulip Mosque.  Immediately striking high minarets.  The building is decorated in a contemporary style using white and red colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="r ufa attractions" class="if" height="490" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/227921.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  No less impressive building is the St. Sergius Cathedral.  This church is built of wood.  It is set on a stone foundation and dated to 1868.  This religious building was not closed even during the Soviet period. </p><p>  What else can you offer for a tour of Ufa?  Religious sites include the Pokrovsky temple, built in 1847 on the site of two wooden ones, in its list.  The Holy Cross Church is noteworthy.  It has eight crosses made of mirror glass, which is mounted on a cast-iron frame.  A unique feature of the temple is that it has three thrones.  Its value is excellent icons painted in the ancient Greek and ancient Byzantine style. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ufa Attractions Photos" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/227937.jpg" width="284"></div>

    <p>  But this does not end the religious buildings, which are famous for Ufa.  Attractions can be complemented by a building such as a church in honor of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  After the closure of the faithful, she was returned only in the early 90's.  Of interest is the Semionovsky Church, the building of which was laid in 1902.  Among other religious buildings, one cannot help but recall the <span>Cathedral Mosque.</span> </p><p>  Along with <span>architectural monuments,</span> there are a number of other interesting places.  The sights of Ufa, the photos of which are presented, can be supplemented by inspection of a new bright detail of the urban landscape, built with the help of Dutch masters.  This is a flower sculpture with a bee, which symbolizes the melliferous republic.  In winter, this masterpiece is not on display. </p><p>  In addition to the above, in the city there are many various monuments, among which the most majestic is set to Salavat Yulaev.  He is depicted on the coat of arms of the republic.  The discovery of the statue took place in 1967.  The village of Akhunovo will be interesting - a megalithic complex consisting of 13 menhirs of various heights. </p><p>  In addition to the sculptures and monuments that Ufa presents to its guests, the sights include unique places created by nature itself in its list.  The most significant among them is the Bashkir State Nature Reserve, created in 1930.  It is located on the western slope of the Bashkir Urals, in its southern part.  It occupies several ridges.  In addition, on the Belaya River in the Shulgan Shash Nature Reserve, you can visit the Kapova Cave, which is famous for <span>rock paintings of</span> primitive man. </p>
