    <h2>  Youth </h2><p>  Louis Adolf Thiers was born on 04.16.1797 in Marseille.  His father was a descendant of a successful bourgeois.  My paternal grandfather was a lawyer, he was also the chief secretary and financial controller in Marseille.  During the revolution of 1789, he was stripped of all posts, as were his mother's relatives. </p><p>  Adolf's childhood passed in poverty.  At school, he showed good abilities, so he could continue to study at the expense of the community.  In Aix-en-Provence, he studied law, after his graduation he became a lawyer. </p><p>  In 1821, Adolf moved to Paris.  He began to live with Migne. </p><h2>  Journalistic activities </h2><p>  At first, Adolf Thiers and his friend were in dire need, but everything changed after the start of cooperation with one of the magazines.  He began to write works on literature and art, political articles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1822, a collection of articles dedicated to an art exhibition was released.  The following year, a description of his journey to the south came out.  The work was imbued with political views on protectionism.  These works made the magazine successful, and their author was provided with financial stability. </p><h2>  Extensive work </h2><p>  At the same time, Adolf Thiers worked on his work, which describes the French Revolution.  It was distinguished by its scientific nature and detail. </p><p>  In The History of the French Revolution, Louis Adolf Thiers could talk about all the events in the tone of a specialist.  For example, pictures of battles were described as if the author was familiar with military affairs.  Adolf had an elegant presentation style.  This ensured the book success among the general public. </p>

    <p>  All the works of Thiers are permeated with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcausality.  The author believed that the revolution was not an accident, but a consequence of a chain of events.  Many reproached him for fatalism, that is, a belief in the predestination of life.  The author was also accused of worshiping success.  He sympathized with the one who came to power.  Adolf himself believed that success is crowned with real virtues.  Failure is the result of errors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thiers book was of great political importance.  At that time, society reacted negatively to the revolution, but the work breathed sympathy for what had happened, love for freedom.  The first edition sold 150,000 copies.  In subsequent editions, the author amended.  They dealt with changes in the political views of the writer. </p><h2>  Political activity </h2><p>  In 1829, Adolf Thiers, whose brief biography is connected with the revolution, founded the newspaper together with Migne and Carrell.  He published an article in which he spoke of fidelity to the Bourbons, provided that the dynasty strictly abided by the constitutional charter of 1814. </p><p>  Since the government of Charles the Tenth did not want to follow the charter, Adolf announced through the newspaper about the candidacy of the Duke of Orleans to the throne.  Thierre was awarded a heavy fine for this. </p>

    <p>  In 1830, an article was published about a king who does not rule his state.  When the July ordinances appeared, Adolf opposed them because they violated the charter.  The journalist should have been arrested. </p><p>  When Louis Philippe came to power, Thiers became the representative of the Council of State.  He worked in the Ministry of Finance and advocated the ideas of the revolution, demanding protection for Belgium.  He also wrote a lot about freedom of the press. </p><p>  In 1831, Thiers became a supporter of the conservative movement of Perrier.  He was opposed to Belgium joining France, as well as any drastic reforms.  The words about ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù began to be replaced by the words about ‚Äúorder‚Äù. </p><p>  Then there was participation in the Ministry of 1832, participation in the massacre of the rebels in 1834, support for the September laws of 1835, which constrained the freedom of the press.  In 1836 and 1840, Thiers ministries were formed, followed by activities in the opposition. </p>
