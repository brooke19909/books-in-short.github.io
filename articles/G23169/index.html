From childhood, every Soviet preschooler saw Vladimir Lenin daily from childhood; his portraits were in kindergartens, offices of leaders and ordinary officials.  The life of the creator of the USSR was carefully studied, his works were studied and outlined (not always thinking about the meaning of jagged phrases), but not many were aware of nationality, family composition, and other biographical subtleties.  Of course, JV Stalin is to blame - he hid the very fact of the existence of Sergei Ilyich, the name of his (and Lenin, respectively) grandfather, and much more.  This story seemed to be forever covered in mystery.  And suddenly such a discovery! </p>

    <h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  It all started with photographs depicting cute boys, looking like each other like two drops of water.  Both with curly heads, dressed equally, in general, the usual children's pictures, which <span>are</span> many in every <span>family album</span> .  Only their abundance was surprising, and they were made at such moments when the camera (it was in the 19th century, and then mobile phones with built-in cameras, even black and white), could not always be at hand.  For example, here Volodechka Ulyanov carries a bag, judging by the signature, with kittens, whom he is going to drown.  According to Voligamsi, Lenin‚Äôs twin brother Seryozha (although there was no party pseudonym then) loved animals, pitied them and did not offend them, because of which the boys had more than once conflicts.  However, parents loved all their sons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Adolescence </h2><p>  Sergei, in his youth - because of his love for animals - did not eat meat.  At the age of sixteen he went to live in Ufa, became interested in pagan theosophical theories, married a Bashkir (she was called Zuhra, and she was very beautiful), invited his relatives to the wedding, but they did not come, because they were afraid of contracting typhoid.  Once Seryozha (brother) Lenin even met by chance at the fair, and they again took pictures together.  The attempt to convert the Marxist to Buddhists failed, although it was made, and it is not known how history would have turned if it had been successful.  Meanwhile, the <span>first Russian revolution</span> thundered <span>, the</span> party needed money, and Vladimir Ilyich recalled that Sergei Ilyich had become a fairly wealthy merchant, trading in wax.  By that time, he allegedly got married two more times (faith allowed him), but did not refuse the request and sold all his goods, but he gave the money.  Brother Lenin personally brought this amount to Petrograd.  And the leader himself, meanwhile, was preparing weapons for future battles.  He even sharpened an ax, R. Voligamsi also has such a photo. </p>

    <h2>  The first Soviet years </h2><p>  Without a doubt, Sergei Ulyanov, the brother of Lenin, was an outstanding personality, and the leader of the revolution more than once consulted with him.  He believed that together they represented considerable strength.  The outward resemblance amused many.  The confusion that had arisen was the subject of numerous Bolshevik jokes, and it was not always clear where Lenin‚Äôs brother was and where he was.  Even the photographer was mistaken when applying for a pass to the Kremlin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the revolution, S.I. Ulyanov returned to Ufa and took up enlightenment.  But here the leader of the party and the first Soviet state fell ill, and then died, after several romantic years gloomy times came.  There was no time for jokes.  The whole old Bolshevik guard fell under the Stalinist ax, and soon the turn could reach Sergei Ilyich.  And the twin brother of Lenin fled from repression abroad. </p>

    <h2>  Emigration </h2><p>  Of course, it was possible to make a coup and lead the party, taking advantage of the complete external resemblance, or even pretend to be the leader, but the vegetarian-Buddhist nature of the intrigue.  The journey abroad was not easy: first Lithuania, then Romania, then Switzerland.  In the end, Lenin‚Äôs brother Sergey <strong> </strong>  Ilyich settled in Mexico, where he met many times with L. <span>D. Trotsky</span> and even made attempts to unite the old Bolshevik emigrants into a single combat-ready organization.  There he wrote a book, ‚ÄúTurning History Back‚Äù, it was called, and published forty times.  In his opinion, Islam could become a new unifying ideological platform. </p>

    <h2>  Mecca and Cuba </h2><p>  Lenin‚Äôs brother Sergey visited Mecca (he lived there for a couple of years), as he was seriously interested in the Islamic religion, which did not prevent him from moving to Cuba, where he was invited by comrade Fidel Castro.  On Liberty Island, he spent his last years.  Here he felt good, the warm climate and hospitality of the fraternal people contributed to fruitful theoretical work for the benefit of communism, which, as Lenin's brother believed, was just around the corner, and all over the world.  The Khrushchev thaw gave hope for a speedy return to the USSR without fear of reprisals. </p>

    <h2>  Last years </h2><p>  Little is known about the personal life of S.I. Ulyanov, but, according to unverified information, he had two daughters - one in Mexico, the other in the Middle East.  Lenin's twin brother <span>Sergey Ilyich Ulyanov</span> had high hopes for <span>Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, who</span> promised to return the previous Dostalinist party norms of leadership, but in vain.  The coming to power of the Brezhnev team became for him a symptom of the restoration of totalitarianism.  Sergei Ulyanov, Lenin‚Äôs brother and in his heart a devoted Bolshevik, painfully and painfully experienced the resignation of Nikita Sergeevich.  This coup traumatized his psyche, and he failed to restore his shaky health, despite all the efforts of the best Cuban medicine in the world.  In 1965, Sergei Ulyanov, the brother of Lenin, died quietly in Havana.  There he was buried under a modest slab, on which a proletarian emblem - crossed sickle and hammer - was embossed. </p><h2>  Exposure in the finale </h2><p>  Of course, no twin brother of Lenin Sergey ever existed.  But there was an art movement called social art, whose representatives are the artists Melamid, Komar (after leaving for the West this name is pronounced with emphasis on the first syllable), the already mentioned Renat Voligamsi and several other creative artists.  In the late eighties and in the early nineties there was an increased demand for works of a provocative nature, most often representing a parody of <span>socialist realism.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="twin brother of Vladimir Lenin" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10920/965992.jpg" width="396"></div>  It was during this period that Renat Voligamsi was invented by Lenin‚Äôs brother, and the photographs allegedly confirming his existence were also mounted by him from various archival photographs.  From a commercial point of view, the move was strong, because, on the one hand, it fully corresponded to the position officially approved and encouraged by the authorities to humiliate the images of totalitarian leaders, and on the other hand, it no less satisfied the needs of the majority of the population (especially the creative intelligentsia), who were tired of socialist realism.  In addition, the creation of such "masterpieces" does not require special skill, as well as labor costs.  Well, what time, and art ...
