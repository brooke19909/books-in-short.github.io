    <h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  <span>Prince Alexander Nevsky and his sons</span> <span>made a rather significant contribution to the well-being of Russia.</span>  <span>Daniel was born in 1261.</span>  <span>When the great</span> <span>Alexander Nevsky, the son of Russian land,</span> <span>died, Danil was only 2 years old.</span>  <span>The first years the boy lived in Tver, with his uncle Yaroslav Yaroslavich.</span>  <span>The latter was first a Tver prince, and then Vladimir.</span>  <span>Moscow was then part of the grand duchy and was under the leadership of the "tyuns" - the governors of the Tver prince.</span> </p><h2>  The Principality </h2><p>  <span>At what time and from whom the</span> <span>youngest son of Alexander Nevsky</span> <span>received Moscow in his lot is not known exactly.</span>  <span>Historians believe that this happened in the 70s of the XIII century.</span>  <span>In the annals, Daniel first appears in 1282.</span>  <span>At this time, he was already a full-fledged prince of Moscow.</span>  <span>It is worth noting that this was the <span>first mention of Moscow</span> in the annals after the terrible Batu ruin, which occurred in 1238.</span>  <span>Such a long silence was very significant.</span>  <span>The fact is that in the annals of that time, mention was made of cities only if there were any disasters, civil strife, major fires, invasions of the Tatars, etc.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Thus, there is reason to believe that in Moscow at that time things were more or less calm.</span>  <span>According to many historians, it was this silence, which lasted more than forty years, that predetermined the future greatness of Moscow.</span>  <span>In calm times, the city and its districts gained strength.</span>  <span>Many refugees from the devastated regions of Russia, mainly the southern ones, moved here here: Ryazan, Kiev and Chernigov lands.</span>  <span>Among the settlers there were artisans, farmers, and warriors.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>March 5, 1303 the Moscow</span> <span>Prince Daniel, son of Alexander Nevsky,</span> <span>died.</span>  <span>Before his death, he took tonsure as a monk.</span>  <span>Regarding the burial place of the Grand Duke, sources diverge.</span>  <span>According to some reports, the prince was buried in the church of the Archangel Michael, on the site of which now stands the Archangel Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin.</span>  <span>And according to others - in the Danilov Monastery, which the prince himself founded.</span> </p><h2>  Monastery </h2><p>  <span>Even during the reign, the youngest</span> <span>son of Alexander Nevsky</span> <span>founded a monastery in the south of Moscow in honor of the Monk Daniel Stolpnik, his heavenly patron.</span>  <span>This monastery was the first of the famous history of Moscow monasteries.</span>  <span>In the "Life" of the saint it is said that well-lovingly dominating in the Moscow region, Prince Daniel erected a monastery beyond the Moscow River and named it in honor of his angel Daniel Stolpnik.</span> </p><p>  <span>The fate of the monastery was amazing: 27 years after the death of the prince, his son Ivan Kalita transferred the monastery with his archimandrite to his princely court in the Kremlin and set up a church with him in the name of the Transfiguration of the Savior.</span>  <span>So the Spassky Monastery was founded.</span>  <span>According to the Life of Daniel of Moscow, many years later, due to the negligence of the Spassky archimandrites, the Danilovsky Monastery became so impoverished that the trace from it was smoothed out.</span>  <span>There is only one church left - the church of Daniel Stolpnik.</span>  <span>And the place where she stood was nicknamed the village of Danilovskoye.</span>  <span>Everyone soon forgot about the monastery.</span>  <span>During the reign of <span>Grand Duke</span> Ivan the Third, the Spassky Monastery was again transferred outside the Kremlin, across the Moskva River, to Mount Krutitsy.</span>  <span>This monastery still stands there and is called Novospassky.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Wonders </h2><p>  <span>On the site of the ancient Danilov Monastery, miracles happened more than once, confirming the holiness of its founder.</span>  <span>Let's get acquainted with the description of some of them.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Once, Prince Ivan Vasilievich (aka Ivan the Third), while in the ancient Danilov Monastery, drove past the place where the relics of Prince Daniel lay.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">At that moment a horse stumbled over a noble young man from a princely regiment.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The young man lagged behind the rest and remained in that place alone.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Suddenly a stranger appeared to him.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">So that the prince‚Äôs companion would not be afraid, the stranger told him: ‚ÄúDo not be afraid of me, I am a Christian, the lord of this place, my name is Daniel of Moscow.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">By God's will, I am laid here. ‚Äù</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Then Danil asked the young man to pass on a message from him to the prince with these words: ‚ÄúYou are comforting yourself in every way, but why did you put me into oblivion?‚Äù</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">After that, the appearance of the prince disappeared.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The young man immediately caught up with the Grand Duke and told him everything to the smallest detail.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Since then, Ivan Vasilyevich ordered to sing requiems and conduct divine services, and also gave alms to the departed souls of his relatives.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Many years later, the son of Ivan the Third, Prince Vasily Ivanovich, drove past the same place with many close associates, among whom was Prince Ivan Shuisky.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">When the latter stepped on a stone, under which the relics of Daniel of Moscow were buried in order to mount his horse, the peasant who happened here prevented him.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">He asked him not to defile the stone under which Prince Daniel lies.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Prince Ivan dismissively replied: ‚ÄúAre there few princes here?‚Äù And he finished his plan.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Suddenly the horse stood on its hind legs, fell to the ground and died.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The prince with great difficulty pulled out from under the horse.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">He repented and commanded a prayer service for his sin.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Soon, Ivan recovered.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>During the reign of Ivan the Terrible, a merchant from Kolomna sailed to Moscow in the same boat with his young son and Tatars.</span>  <span>On the road, the young man became very ill, so his father no longer believed in his recovery.</span>  <span>When the boat approached the church in which the relics of Prince Daniel rested, the merchant and his son approached the tomb of the saint.</span>  <span>Having ordered the priest to sing a prayer service, the merchant began to pray with great faith to God, urging Prince Daniel to help.</span>  <span>Suddenly, his son, as if awakened from a dream, recovered and gained strength.</span>  <span>Since then, the merchant wholeheartedly believed in St. Daniel and annually came to his tomb to perform prayers there.</span> </p><h2>  Alexander Nevsky - named son of Batu </h2><p>  <span>Another interesting fact, which, of course, affected the lives of children of Alexander Nevsky, is his named brotherhood with Tsarevich Sartak.</span>  <span>Information that</span> <span>Alexander Nevsky is the son of Batu</span> <span>is perceived by historians contradictory.</span>  <span>One thing is certain for sure - the decision to serve the Golden Horde and the named brotherhood with Tsarevich Sartak, Alexander Nevsky made purely in the interests of the state.</span>  <span>At that time, consanguinity was not much appreciated: the princes competed with each other for their inheritance and did not disdain betrayal.</span>  <span>But the named kinship was firmly revered as a shrine.</span>  <span>Therefore, taking such a step,</span> <span>Alexander Nevsky, the son of</span> <span>Batu</span> <span>Khan</span> <span>Sartak and the khan himself acted purely in the political interest.</span> </p>
