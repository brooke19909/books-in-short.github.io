However, this issue may lead to newcomers to a dead end.  After all, you need to be not only aware of the real real value of a particular cryptocurrency, but also choose the right trading platform.  Only a stock exchange verified over the years, carrying out thousands of financial transactions per day, can ensure the security of the transaction, as well as guarantee full payment to the account of a user who has entrusted their funds to the trading platform.  Based on the reviews and comments left on the forums dedicated to the topic of cryptocurrency trading, we made our own rating of cryptocurrency exchanges that you can trust. </p><h2>  Bittrex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hackernoon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rating of Russian exchanges" class="if uuid-2941336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56297/2941336.jpg"></div><p>  Bittrex exchange (bittrex.com) leads our rating.  This trading platform is a contender for the title of the largest online platform that allows you to exchange cryptocurrency for fiat money.  The exchange is founded and registered in the United States of America.  Pride Bittrex - an ultramodern server that allows you to quickly and without any ‚Äúhangs‚Äù to process millions of operations per minute. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For users of the exchange who are accustomed to making money on fluctuations in the rate of cryptocurrencies, there are a huge number of trading pairs of altcoins.  This platform offers current courses, constantly monitoring the global cryptocurrency markets. </p><p>  The main advantages of the Bittrex platform: </p><ul><li>  is one of the most popular in the world, which indicates the absolute trust of users; </li><li>  in addition to the main cryptocurrencies, it offers a large number of altcoins for exchange; </li><li>  has an intuitive interface for both desktop and mobile browsers; </li><li>  Efficiency of technical support reaction to users ‚Äôrequests. </li></ul><p>  The obvious cons of the Bittrex platform: </p><ul><li>  registration is temporarily closed for new users; </li><li>  there is a restriction on the withdrawal of money - the maximum amount should not exceed 0.4 MTC per day; </li><li>  wallets are periodically turned off, as a rule, at the time of a sharp jump in the rate of major cryptocurrencies. </li></ul><p>  Despite its shortcomings, Bittrex tops the list of the best exchanges.  By entrusting your funds to this trading platform, you can be sure of the safety of funds, the security of transactions.  And this is one of the main conditions of any trader. </p><h2>  Poloniex </h2><p>  In the <span>ranking of the best cryptocurrency exchanges, the</span> Poloniex platform (poloniex.com) is in second place.  It is very similar to Bittrex.  It is also convenient and offers a huge number of major altcoins for exchange.  Registration here is open to new users.  However, in order to withdraw money, it is necessary to verify.  The administration approaches the confirmation of identity quite seriously.  To create a verified account, you will need to go through several stages and provide a fairly solid package of documents, which will take a lot of time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main advantages that allowed to take second place in the ranking of cryptocurrency exchanges include: </p><ul><li>  good technical support, instantly responding to user requests; </li><li>  the presence of its own "cold" storage, which allows the most reliable storage of user deposits offline; </li><li>  the most beautiful and intuitive interface designed for both desktop versions of the browser and mobile; </li><li>  It has large volumes of popular altcoins, including Ether. </li></ul><p>  Like any other platform included in the rating of exchanges, Poloniex has its drawbacks: </p><ul><li>  there is no way to replenish your wallet with fiat money; </li><li>  a withdrawal limit is set - a maximum of $ 2,000 per day. </li></ul><p>  Users working with Poloniex for many years will remember that the exchange had serious security issues.  Several years ago, hackers managed to successfully attack the trading floor, steal a large amount of altcoins and fiat.  But at the moment, according to the exchange administration, there are no problems. </p><h2>  Coinbase </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.irishtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="currency exchange rating" class="if uuid-2941330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56297/2941330.jpg"></div><p>  In third place in the ranking of cryptocurrency exchanges for Russia is the <span>Coinbase</span> platform <span>(coinbase.com),</span> founded and registered in the United States of America.  This online platform that allows you to exchange cryptocurrency for fiat is one of the oldest, and its investment estimate has long exceeded the mark of 1 billion dollars.  Unlike most trading platforms that represent the rating of exchanges, Coinbase is more like an electronic wallet that allows you to exchange crypto for fiat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main advantages of this exchange can be considered: </p><ul><li>  ease of use; </li><li>  Attractive and intuitive interface </li><li>  the presence of mobile applications; </li><li>  the ability to input / output fiat; </li><li>  no withdrawal restrictions; </li><li>  quick response of technical support to user requests; </li><li>  maximum degree of protection for customers' online wallets; </li><li>  absolute user trust (Coinbase already has more than 5 million regular customers). </li></ul><p>  Despite the fact that Coinbase is among the first three leading the rating of exchanges, the trading platform has its drawbacks: </p><ul><li>  Lack of anonymity.  In order to become a verified Coinbase user, the client must disclose quite a lot of personal information that will be sent to the tax office.  Without verification, the withdrawal of funds is impossible. </li></ul><p>  For residents of Russia and Ukraine, it is important to know that they will not have full access to all the tools of the exchange.  For example, you cannot enter fiat from a debit card. </p><h2>  SEX </h2><p>  In fourth place in the ranking of cryptocurrency exchanges is the SEX platform (cex.io).  This platform was created as a service for cloud mining, but since its foundation (in 2013), SEX has been repeatedly upgraded to become a multifunctional cryptocurrency exchange. </p><p>  Despite the fact that this platform is in fourth place in our ranking of exchanges and its popularity is much lower than that of its predecessors, SEX has an undeniable advantage.  The online platform allows you to not only change cryptocurrency to fiat, but also instantly withdraw real money to a plastic card.  SEX offers cross-platform trading through the REST API, Web, WebSocket and mobile application. </p><p>  In the ranking of cryptocurrency exchanges for Russia, cex.io will confidently enter the top three leaders.  Why?  SEX accepts for exchange all the world's leading currencies, including rubles.  Thanks to this platform, cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETN, ZCash, Dash can be quickly and safely exchanged for fiat.  Popular altcoins are also featured here. </p><p>  Positive aspects of SEX: </p><ul><li>  the ability to carry out financial transactions with debit and credit cards; </li><li>  intuitive interface that allows even an inexperienced user to understand all the tools; </li><li>  lack of hidden fees; </li><li>  Russified technical support. </li></ul><p>  Negative sides: </p><ul><li>  rather rare update of trading pairs. </li></ul><h2>  Gdax </h2><p>  Next in the ranking of cryptocurrency exchanges is the gdax.com platform.  GDAX is the brainchild of Coinbase.  This online platform is perfect for experienced traders, offering them excellent liquidity.  All financial transactions are made in cryptocurrency or US dollars. </p><p>  GDAX Strengths: </p><ul><li>  intuitive interface; </li><li>  the presence of mobile applications for iOS and Android; </li><li>  the ability to input / output fiat; </li><li>  lack of restrictions on withdrawal; </li><li>  good tech support; </li><li>  maximum degree of protection; </li><li>  Optimized as a professional shopping site. </li></ul><p>  Weaknesses: </p><ul><li>  complete lack of anonymity of transactions; </li><li>  no support for users from the CIS; </li><li>  rather complicated verification procedure for a new account. </li></ul><h2>  Bitstamp </h2><p>  In sixth place in the ranking of cryptocurrency exchanges for Russia is the platform bitstamp.net.  This is a European online platform licensed to carry out financial transactions related to cryptocurrency.  The exchange has been operating since the beginning of 2011 and has established itself from the best side.  If we created a rating of exchanges for reliability, then surely Bitstamp became one of the leaders. </p><p>  The platform has large volumes of both fiat and cryptocurrencies, which allows you to instantly carry out large financial transactions.  Deposits are accepted in dollars and euros.  Until 2017, the exchange was engaged in the sale of Bitcoins, but at the moment almost all popular altcoins are available for exchange. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  reliability; </li><li>  intuitive interface. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  To work from the territory of the CIS, you must use a VPN or TOP browser. </li></ul><h2>  Bitfinex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="bitcoinist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cryptocurrency exchange rating" class="if uuid-2941316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56297/2941316.jpg"></div><p>  The Bitfinex platform (bitfinex.com) is in seventh place in the ranking.  Bitcoin exchange (just such it is) has a daily trading volume exceeding the mark of 1 billion dollars.  This online platform received an intuitive interface, as well as a wide range of tools.  There are many types of orders, margin trading. </p><p>  Positive sides: </p><ul><li>  convenient platform for trade / exchange; </li><li>  large volumes of military-technical cooperation. </li></ul><p>  Negative points: </p><ul><li>  many experts suspect this platform of manipulating the MTC exchange rate, as well as of artificially increasing the value of Bitcoin; </li><li>  registration on the site is possible only at the invitation of an active participant / trader; </li><li>  It‚Äôs quite difficult to verify your account; </li><li>  lack of anonymity; </li><li>  quite a long time to wait for input / output of real money. </li></ul><h2>  Binance </h2><p>  Binance (binance.com) is a relatively young currency exchange whose rating is constantly growing.  Due to the fallen popularity, the administration suspended the registration of new users.  The forced measures are explained by the fact that for the stable operation of the service, the site infrastructure must be changed.  Most likely, the exchange, whose server is capable of processing up to 1.5 million orders per second, turned out to be unprepared for the rapid growth of new users. </p><p>  The first auction on Binance was held 07/15/2017.  From this moment, both beginners and experienced traders began to show interest in the exchange.  Most users were attracted by customer focus, a convenient and intuitive interface, and the ability to maintain anonymity.  However, the site became truly popular only when it offered its users the option of PoS mining.  For storing the NEO cryptocurrency, which was popular at the end of 2017, a fee of 0.1% of the total deposit is charged. </p><p>  Strengths of Binance: </p><ul><li>  quite a wide selection of trading pairs; </li><li>  minimum commission; </li><li>  large set of tools; </li><li>  the ability to carry out financial transactions without verification and registration; </li><li>  maximum withdrawal amount (for an unregistered user) - 2 MTC per day; </li><li>  PoS mining. </li></ul><p>  Weaknesses: </p><ul><li>  Quite often the main page of the site freezes. </li></ul><h2>  HitBTC </h2><p>  One of the age areas is HitBTC (hitbtc.com), founded in 2013.  She is constantly included in the top 10 ranking of bitcoin exchanges according to the statistics of various sites.  And her venture capital is more than 6 million euros.  The HitBTC trading platform is widely known for its unique matching mechanism, as well as a wide range of blockchain support.  The vast majority of users note a friendly attitude towards the client on the part of the support service, which not only instantly responds to calls, but also effectively solves the issues that have arisen. </p><p>  To always be in the forefront of the ranking of world exchanges is not an easy task, but the HitBTC administration is doing everything possible to be one step ahead of its closest competitors.  The site operates on a unique and rather powerful ‚Äúengine‚Äù, which provides uninterrupted access to the trading platform.  Among the colossal set of tools presented on the exchange, there are also innovations, for example, real-time cleaning.  In addition to the main version, the site has a lighter version, a demo. </p><p>  Strengths: </p><ul><li>  the exchange has no restrictions on the input / output of funds; </li><li>  minimum commission; </li><li>  reliable protection; </li><li>  intuitive interface; </li><li>  prompt and professional technical support for users; </li><li>  high and uninterrupted operation of the site. </li></ul><p>  Weaknesses: </p><ul><li>  a small variety of altcoins submitted for exchange. </li></ul><h2>  Gemini </h2><div class="photo" data-original="restislaw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crypto exchange rating" class="if uuid-2941308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56297/2941308.jpg"></div><p>  Gemini (gemini.com) is a real pioneer among cryptocurrency trading platforms.  The founders of this resource are the world's first Bitcoin billionaires - the Winklevoss brothers.  It is on this platform that the futures price for Bitcoins is set, which cryptocurrency and stock exchanges of the world are equal to.  The rating of this trading platform is always high, since the internal reserves of both the MTC and the Fiat are outrageous here.  No matter how much you want to exchange, there is always the necessary amount. </p><p>  Gemini Pros: </p><ul><li>  continuous monitoring of compliance with banking obligations standards; </li><li>  the highest requirements for capital reserves; </li><li>  regulated by the state (under the jurisdiction of the state of New York). </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  Exchange services are available only in the United States. </li></ul><h2>  Bitflip </h2><p>  BitFlip (bitflip.cc) is a Moscow exchange whose rating is constantly growing.  It was founded in 2017, and its creators are Russian programmers Dmitry Kuzmenkov and Vladimir Kosenko.  Platform statistics show incredible performance.  In the first months of operation, the daily cash flow did not exceed the mark of 10 thousand dollars.  To date, this figure is measured in seven-digit numbers. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the creators of the trading platform did not stop there and decided to conduct their own ICO, giving the future crypt the name FLIP.  Oddly enough, but they did it.  Investors believed in the project and began to invest quite decent amounts in it, and six months later they received their first dividends. </p><p>  Positive aspects of the trading platform, thanks to which it leads the rating of Russian exchanges: </p><ul><li>  Multicurrency.

In order to make financial transactions on this trading platform, the user needs to go through the registration and identification process. </li></ul><h2>  EXMO </h2><p>  EXMO is one of the most convenient platforms for Russian-speaking users, which has not only an intuitive interface, but also Russified technical support.  EXMO is a multicurrency platform that cooperates with many popular payment systems, for example, Qiwi, OKPAY, Skrill, Yandex.Money, Payeer, Perfect Money, Payza, Webmoney, MasterCard, Visa.

At the moment, you can only buy two cryptocurrencies here: </p><ul><li>  Litecoin. </li><li>  Bitcoin </li></ul><p>  However, the administration says that more trading pairs will appear in the near future.
