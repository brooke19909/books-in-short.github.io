    <h2>  Building a template for the baby's undershirt </h2><p>  How is the <span>pattern of the baby's undershirt</span> built <span>?</span>  The template should be a wraparound shirt with a one-piece sleeve.  The standard volumes and growth of the baby are usually taken as measurements.  The minimum involves a shelf width of 28 cm, a sleeve of 15 cm, a neck depth of 1 cm on the back and 4 cm in front, a sleeve cuff girth of 11 cm and a product length of 30 cm. It is from these values ​​that the countdown starts for a larger size, adding 2-3 cm </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The pattern of the baby's undershirt is constructed as follows: </p><ul><li>  draw a line equal to two lengths of the sleeve and one dimension of the shelf, that is 15 + 28 + 15 cm; </li><li>  mark the beginning of the boundary of the sleeves, dropping the perpendiculars; </li><li>  mark the middle of the shelf; </li><li>  draw a neck for the front and back; </li><li>  at the edges they drop 1.5 cm and draw lines to the perpendiculars at an angle of 15 degrees. </li></ul><p>  As a result, the main template is obtained in the drawing, on which model lines can be marked.  And at this stage, we can assume that the pattern of the baby's undershirt is ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jumpsuit for newborns pattern" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1203916.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Product Modeling </h2><p>  The most comfortable vest is the one that has a good smell and fastens on the shoulder with a button or button.  This is known to any young mother.  Such a product will not untie or slide, and the baby’s chest will always be closed.  Such a pattern for a baby's undershirt suggests a double front shelf.  To get the product blank, in the drawing it is necessary to indicate the desired width of the shelf and the place of the fastener, as well as separately draw the back, so that it is easy to cut out the details. </p><p>  Another useful point to pay attention to is closed sleeves.  Here you should make a special lapel of the back of the sleeve cut to the wrong side (about 5 cm), and leave the front part to the size of the template.  The only thing is to add a few centimeters in the blank so that the child’s handle fits completely into the sleeve.  After sewing, the lapel can be twisted and closed the outlet from the sleeve to hide the baby's handles.  Such a design of the undershirt will be a great option for an active child, who continually waves his hands and can inadvertently scratch his face with nails. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cap pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1203934.jpg" width="548"></div>

The pattern of such a product is also quite simple, like the pattern of the baby's undershirt. </p><p>  As a rule, sleeves are made in such clothes, but for a small size this is not necessary.  Such a move is used in order to place parts on the canvas as compactly as possible to save material.  For the workpiece, you can take the already existing pattern of the undershirt and draw up the legs for it.  You will also need a small rhombus from the same fabric, which will need to be sewn as a gusset in the bow seam so that the items can be worn on diapers without any problems.  How to make a <span>jumpsuit for newborns?</span>  <span>The</span> product <span>pattern</span> is obtained with a cut on the chest and a solid back, which is very convenient, because the child is almost always lying.
