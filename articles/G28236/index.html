    <h2>  What to wear </h2><p>  Depending on the color of the fabric, this thing is suitable for a business meeting, for a walk and for going to visit or to work.  You can combine a skirt with any absolutely fitted top.  It can be all kinds of sweaters, blouses, shirts and even tops.  In cold weather, you can put on a short fitted jacket or <span>knitted sweater.</span> </p><h2>  How to build a pattern </h2><p>  A skirt-trousers is a very simple thing to build.  As already mentioned, the basis of simple trousers of the right size is taken as a template. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern skirts" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/327548.jpg" width="383"></div>  To determine it, you need to take such measurements: waist and hips.  There is another construction option.  If you use it, then you can also get a great skirt-pants.  The pattern in this case is done independently by outlining the contours of the details of your favorite jeans.  Further, it remains only to properly fit the fit on the hips and waist, because the trousers here make the most flared.  It is important to note that the fabric of the trousers that are encircled and the future product should be of the same degree of extensibility.  So, jeans are turned inside out, one leg is threaded into another and laid out on paper or construction film.  They begin to circle the details of the front and rear paintings separately along the side and inner sections, gradually turning the trousers.  After the main lines are drawn, proceed to modeling.  First of all, note the bottom of the product, then draw a line from the hip, making the necessary width of the leg.  The result is a finished pattern.  Skirts are built on the same principle.  At this stage, you also need to think about a fastener for the product.  If this is a standard fly, as on all trousers, then it is necessary to draw additional lines for it.  If the model has a hidden zipper on the side, then this should be taken into account when adding allowances to the seams. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern skirt pants" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/328422.jpg" width="254"></div>

    <h2>  Sewing process </h2><p>  So, how is a skirt-pants sewn?  The pattern is ready, now you need to transfer it to the fabric, make additions to process the edges and bottom of the product, you also need to remember about the belt or the inner hem.  First grind two back halves, then the front.  If necessary, sew a zipper, making a fly.  At this stage, you need to make all the model pockets and lines.  Next is the turn behind the side and inner seams.  They are combined, a line is laid and processed with an overcasting machine.  After they sew a belt or hem, depending on which <span>model the skirt-pants.</span>  The stitching pattern is built according to previously made patterns.  In fact, this is a strip of the top of the trousers, approximately 7-10 cm, which is sewn, covering the upper section of the product, and attached to the inner seams. </p>
