    <p>  Among similar online booking systems, the Agoda.com platform has the largest database of hotel offers in Asia, since its central office is located in Bangkok (Thailand), with its offices in Budapest, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo. </p><p>  By the way, the resort city of Pattaya, located 150 kilometers from Bangkok, is served directly by the Agoda central office. Pattaya hotels are a kind of laboratory for honing the quality of new travel services on its platform. </p>

    <p>  It makes no sense to compare the features of this service with the more well-known Bucking.com platform, which specializes more in European guest houses, since Priceline has owned both of them since 2011, and accordingly, their corporate policy is the same. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How does Agoda.com work?  Hotels collaborating with the Agoda platform regularly provide up-to-date information about their guest houses and half-boards.  Managers of the company maintain close contacts with thousands of hotels and choose the preferred options with "running" prices for customers.  If you made a choice, then for the hotel reservation, a prepayment of 100% of the amount is charged to your hotel card at the commercial rate of your issuing bank according to its card rates for settlements with foreign countries.  (This commercial rate includes more bank fees, so it is higher than if you just changed the currency in the exchanger). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Agoda, hotels in Pattaya" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/234364.jpg" width="573"></div><br>  By clicking the "Pay" button on the Agoda.com website, you are transferring money to the company (Agoda).  After that, the hotels will receive a message from her about your reservation, and you will receive a copy of the voucher from the Agoda_Company_Pte_Ltd company, with the signature of the official, stamp, name of the hotel, his address, contact phone number, time of your stay (check-in, check-out).  By the way, on the phone (we think everything is fine with English), according to the good habit of business people, we recommend that you call and clarify first.  Best of all - do not forget this "fad", at least in order to personally verify the quality of the service.  After all, theoretically there could be another situation.

Why?  As the unforgettable character of Superman Belmondo said, helplessly shaking hands: "The human factor."  Although the service of the company illuminated by us at the international level is recognized as a model, occasionally there may be cases of negligent reporting by the hotel.  Carry the contact details of your booking platform!  Please note that in some online reviews regarding "contingencies", clients express gratitude for the fact that thanks to the intervention of the Agoda managers, the hotels were nevertheless "found", that is, the replacement was quick and efficient, sometimes even some discount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Agoda hotels" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/234365.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  However, if your knowledge of English allows, you can call Agoda_Company_Pte_Ltd and resolve this issue by phone (the phone is located at the bottom of the voucher you received), at the same time it is useful to get some "hotel" consultation.

    <p>  To conclude, we recall the commonplace thing: "Read the documents received!"  Legally, the voucher you received from Agoda clearly delineates hotels.  The booked hotel indicated in it is required to contact even if there is an obvious problem.  After contacting the hotel, if there is a problem, you contact (on the Internet or by phone) the Agoda company, which resolves this problem.  It will take some time.  "Self-activity" is contraindicated!  If, having violated this algorithm, you yourself have found a replacement for a ‚Äúnegligent hotel‚Äù, then you automatically run the risk of losing money (your prepayment), because  put yourself legally outside the rules of the voucher. </p><p>  We hope that these simple tips will help you better navigate the simple and friendly service from Agoda_Company_Pte_Ltd. </p>
