However, sometimes unexpected problems can occur, often expressed in situations when the <span>sensor does not work on the phone.</span>  What to do and how to solve such a technical nuisance, we will review in this information review. </p><h2>  The consequences that you did not expect ... </h2><p>  Before proceeding to a more detailed study of the phone or other sensory device in order to identify the cause of its inoperability, try to recall all the unfavorable moments of an operational nature, that is: </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The sensor on the phone does not work, what should I do?" class="if" height="496" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/369875.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><ul><li>  Have you dropped the device on a hard surface.  Moreover, it does not matter that after the strike the device worked properly.  The main thing is to take this fact into account, since just now you noticed that the sensor is not working.  What to do, sometimes the consequences appear only after a while.  But, knowing the reason, you will facilitate the troubleshooting process. </li><li>  Were there any precedents related to water: heavy irrigation with rain, a thrown cup of coffee, often fogging display (the result of using the phone in a cold environment, and then a sharp transition to a warm room). </li><li>  Perhaps you repeatedly squeezed the device, of course, unconsciously and sometimes without even noticing it: minibus, train, concert and other places of crowded places. </li><li>  Think about where you usually carry your phone and whether the place you use is ‚Äútoo tight‚Äù (tight jeans). </li></ul><p>  Now you probably know why the sensor does not work on the phone.  What to do with all these disadvantages, you will learn from the next section of the article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The sensor does not work, what should I do?" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/369878.jpg?1396975724503" width="271"></div></h2><h2>  Visual diagnosis </h2><p>  First of all, examine your device for mechanical damage.  Connectors and interface slots should not have any signs of oxidation.  The surface of <span>the control panel</span> should be perfectly clean, that is, no greasy stains.  Often, due to excessive pollution of the device‚Äôs touchscreen, the sensor does not work on a tablet or mobile device.  Deep scratches and chips on the surface of the glass (plastic) of the wheelbarrow are unambiguously involved in the loss of the sensitive performance of your device.  The reason for resorting to the replacement of the sensor module may be obvious signs of delamination of the components of the control system.  This manifests itself in the form of darkened sections of the touchscreen, and multi-colored stains only serve as a confirming argument for the incapacity of the touch panel.  However, sometimes the culprit of the situation ‚Äúthe sensor does not work on the tablet‚Äù may be charging the device, more precisely, the simultaneous use of the gadget with the associated action of the power device. </p><h2>  Preparation for restoration work </h2><p>  Once you are convinced that the ‚Äúevidence base‚Äù allows you to resort to decisive measures to eliminate the identified problems, and in particular to replace the touchscreen, you should, so to speak, tune in accordingly to such a responsible ‚Äúmission‚Äù ... </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  First of all, pay attention to what kind of profile the fixing screws have, since a special tool is required for operation.  You will also need an old SIM card and a hairdryer.  And, of course, the new touchscreen, which today can be bought on almost any touch device.  It should be noted that on the Internet you can view the process of disassembling and assembling your model.  You only have one thing left: to put into practice a solution to a difficult question with the code name "The sensor does not work on the phone, what should I do?"  Well, of course, the favorable outcome depends on your efforts and careful actions.  In principle, there is nothing complicated in the process of <span>replacing a touchscreen.</span> </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung sensor does not work" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/370544.jpg?1397046634458" width="266"></div></h2><h2>  note </h2><ul><li>  Locking locks on a plastic case tend to break, of course, due to improperly applied forces.  Using a SIM card, with <span>translational movements</span> disconnect the case. </li><li>  In no case do not take the device for a break! </li><li>  Often, ports, connectors, and protruding parts need to be freed from the chassis at the very last moment of disconnection. </li><li>  Of particular note is the ‚ÄúMulti-touch reincarnation" of the phone from the Finnish manufacturer, which, for example, also does not have a sensor.  On Nokia, the touchscreen is removed simply.  If not immediately (at the first stages of dismantling), then, in any case, you will not have to ‚Äúscatter the entire apparatus‚Äù. </li><li>  Be careful and do everything without sudden movements, since almost any device has many internal connections in the form of a variety of loops that you need to not tear, but carefully disconnect. </li><li>  An adhesive base is applied to the inner edges of the frame during the production process, on which the sensor is mounted.  Your task is to warm up the touchscreen (not to burn and not to melt!) So that it can easily be removed. </li><li>  The installation process is no less important: there should be no ‚Äúextra" bolts, screws and other parts.  It is required to put everything in its place. </li></ul><h2>  How to protect your device from innumerable destructive factors? </h2><ul><li>  The phone or tablet should be kept in a special case, which should be made of a sufficiently dense material (leather, dermatin or silicone).  So you prevent the risk of mechanical damage: falling and scratching.  Importantly, this type of protection will protect the gadget from the harmful effects of cold in the winter. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The sensor does not work on the tablet" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/369874.jpg?1396975900286" width="600"></div></li><li>  Given the size of the device, you should always remember that it can slip out of your hands at the time of use.  Therefore, it is advisable to equip the device with a special rubberized, silicone or plastic bumper.  Of course, this does not always increase the aesthetics of the mobile device, but it will undoubtedly protect the gadget at the time of the fall. </li><li>  Finally, a variety of straps and chains fixed on the phone case are guaranteed to protect your gadget from unwanted impact on a hard surface.  You will never lose a mobile phone if it is ‚Äúattached‚Äù to you. </li><li>  And most importantly - wiping the control panel (touchscreen) with alcohol-containing substances, you can not avoid the deplorable result: the sensor does not work on the phone.  What to do if an incomprehensible pollution appears on the screen?  Use an ordinary polish.  By the way, a drop of sunflower oil is capable of real miracles, it is important not to overdo it! </li></ul><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  If the sensor doesn‚Äôt work on your Samsung device, and the touchscreen calibration and software update have not yielded positive results ... And for all that, you are still not sure of the 100% ‚Äúguilt‚Äù of the control panel, you should contact a service center.  Believe me, it will be much cheaper, since it is in Samsung that a very complex constructional scheme of the assembly is implemented.  Even the side controls are often tied to a loop.  It is unrealistically difficult to dismantle the <span>touch panel,</span> and very often, in principle, like on the iPhone, ‚Äúsandwich technology‚Äù is used, that is, the touch cannot be separated from the display without special devices ... Be prudent and hone your knowledge! </p>
