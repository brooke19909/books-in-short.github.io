  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Education in the 17th century in Russia: briefly on the main aspects</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Education in the 17th century in Russia has undergone major changes.  Transformations occurred both in the educational system and in the everyday life of ordinary people and literature, painting.  If before this knowledge mainly children of noble people had the opportunity to receive from individual tutors, now education is given in educational institutions.  Education becomes available to everyone, regardless of class status. </p><h2>  Creation of private schools in Russia </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-723026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32262/723026.jpg?1548691174"></div><p>  In modern opinion, the established institutions could not be fully called a school.  Education in the 17th century in Russia can be briefly described as primary.  In addition, spiritual people with their own rules worked as teachers.  For their work, they received a reward in the form of food. </p><p>  Some ‚ÄúABCs‚Äù are interesting to study.  These are preserved handwritten and printed books for reading by children who already have basic reading skills. </p><p>  In addition to the reading texts themselves, in the ABC books recommendations were given for the teacher - how to teach reading, rules of conduct in school, church and even at home. </p><p>  Education in the 17th century in Russia did not imply a permanent residence of children at school.  Pupils, as now, went to classes in the morning, and returned home during the day.  Knowledge was available to all, without exception, both rich and poor and wretched. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-723027" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32262/723027.jpg?1548691174"></div><h2>  Prints - A Good Help for Learning </h2><p>  The emergence of the ability to publish printed books had the best effect on education in the 17th century.  At each lesson, school elders handed out books for students to learn. </p><p>  In Moscow, letters began to print, which even the poorest segments of the population could buy.  Such books, costing only 1 kopeck, were very popular. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the alphabet, written by Deacon V. Burtsev, was sold out in one day in the amount of 2400 pieces. </p><p>  A little later, the alphabet with pictures published by Karion Istomin appears.  This book is built on the principle familiar to all of us.  Each letter corresponds to a picture whose name begins with a given sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-723025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32262/723025.jpg?1548691174"></div><h2>  Schools instead of individual repeaters </h2><p>  In the middle of the 17th century, 30 scientific monks were invited from Kiev.  They were supposed to open an educational institution at the St. Andrew's Monastery in Moscow.  The school began to teach philosophy, rhetoric, Greek and Latin for young nobles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But still, many <span>noble people</span> were distrustful of such an educational system.  They believed that such a technique leads to heresy and departure from God. </p><p>  But, despite the oblique views, schools at the monasteries began to appear everywhere.  Ivan Fomin, priest of the <span>Vvedensky church,</span> opened a school at <span>his own expense</span> .  Semen Polotsky headed the school at the <span>Zaikonospassky monastery.</span> </p><p>  In the newly opened educational institutions, in addition to Russian grammar, they taught Latin and Greek. </p><p>  In the classrooms, they always chose the elders.  They had great weight in the team and could even replace teachers.  Their main responsibility was to distribute books, appoint duty officers and monitor discipline. </p><p>  For those educated in the 17th century, rigorous discipline was at the heart of instruction.  Particularly appreciated and required careful attitude to the book and in general to all property located in the school. </p><p>  In addition to the mandatory observance of order and perfect cleanliness, it was forbidden to slander comrades and call them offensive words.  So a certain semblance of corporate solidarity was born. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-719148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32262/719148.jpg?1548691174"></div><h2>  Teaching Methods in the 17th Century </h2><p>  If we consider education in the 17th century, its unified methodology fully coincides with the standards in force in schools in <span>Western Europe</span> and Greece.  The main subjects were writing, reading, counting, and also singing. </p><p>  In addition to secular education, lessons on the basics of religion were compulsory.  In addition, basic knowledge was given in the field of free sciences.  These included: grammar, astronomy, music, dialectics, rhetoric, arithmetic. </p><p>  The ABCs contained various verses that children taught and recited by heart.  Also, students were taught the basics of versification, taught to write letters to senior officials. </p><p>  The rules written in the ABC books were adhered to in all schools, therefore it can be asserted with confidence that education in the 17th century is a unified teaching methodology, which subsequently formed the basis of all education. </p><h2>  The nuances of learning in Russia in the 17th century </h2><p>  Despite the development of science, classes at school began and ended with the word of God.  Yes, this is understandable, because the teachers were clergy. </p><p>  But it was the priests who disseminated the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgeneral education, universal literacy.  It was believed that people needed knowledge to understand the significance of faith and moral concepts.  It is necessary to be able to read mainly in order to independently study the <span>Holy Scripture</span> and understand the whole secret meaning of what is written. </p><p>  The main goal pursued by education in the 17th century in Russia was to educate a moral person who knows the basics of Christianity and possesses reading and writing skills. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-719149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32262/719149.jpg?1548691174"></div><p>  Interesting to study the work of ancient thinkers.  Many works were translated into Russian, and they formed their own opinions.  So, the schools studied the ideas of Aristotle, the "Dialectic" of Damascus.  On the margins often put various notes, which proves a careful study of the books of philosophers. </p><h2>  A new level of education gave impetus to the development of art </h2><p>  With widespread literacy, more and more new genres began to appear in literature.  Especially great development was poetry and stylistic stories.  They wrote many plays that they staged in the court theater. </p><p>  Painting has also undergone changes.  A genre appeared such as a secular portrait, completely similar to the original.  The most famous artist at that time was Ushakov, who wrote many famous people of that time. </p><p>  With the development of mathematics, physics and chemistry, new technologies appeared in the weapons industry, and the knowledge gained contributed to the spread of expeditions.  As a result, more and more new territories of vast Russia were developed. </p><p>  On the whole, education in the 17th century in Russia satisfied the interests of the church and the state itself.  Until the middle of the 18th century, students received knowledge according to approved methods.  But in the end, the conditions of historical development required further modifications. </p>
