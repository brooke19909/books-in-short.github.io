First of all, these are monuments that decorate the streets of any city for decades.  The appearance of these monuments did not leave any traces of either time or a change in weather conditions. </p><p>  Granite density - this is the criterion that characterizes the rock as a high-class building material.  And the monuments of the Soviet era are the best proof of the durability of this natural stone.  Today, both natural and artificial granite has been widely used in construction. </p><p>  What is this stone?  The name "granite" (from the word "granum") is translated from Latin as "grain", which immediately indicates the <span>nature of the structure of</span> this igneous volcanic <span>rock.</span>  The basis of this natural stone includes quartz, which is a granule, mica and <span>feldspar,</span> as well as other impurities.  The color scheme can be varied: white and gray, red, pink or even black. </p><p>  Due to its granular structure, excellently pricking, simple to process, including heat treatment, perfectly polished and polished to a mirror state, natural granite is very fond of designers.  In a polished stone, mica will sparkle with colorful sparkles, while unpolished will gently absorb the sun's rays.  The beauty of this stone opens up unlimited scope for imagination.  And such a property as granite density, equal to 2.5 thousand kg / m3, makes it universal, it is it that makes it possible to use this stone for both internal and external decoration of buildings.  So, for example, yellow Chinese granite can be used to clad a facade or a basement of buildings, use it as pavers or as granite borders, kitchen tabletops and steps can be made from it, or railings and balusters can be made.  Granite will be good in any form. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The density of granite, as well as its low water absorption, makes it possible to clad baths, bathrooms and even the bottom of pools with this stone.  Due to the high <span>density of the stone, the</span> water adheres perfectly to the surface, but you will never slip, as the rough structure of granite forms a persistent anti-skid effect. </p><p>  For the same reason, this stone is very fond of landscape designers.  If you decide to decorate your patio with an alpine slide, then you definitely can‚Äôt do without granite, since it tolerates rain and snow, <span>frost and sun</span> better than others <span>.</span> </p><p>  If someone really likes granite, but he can‚Äôt afford natural stone, you can try replacing it with an artificial analog.  The basis of artificial granite is a mineral filler, and the fifth part is a <span>polyester resin.</span>  The density of artificial granite and its strength, which are two to three times higher than that of natural, make it possible to withstand significant loads. </p><p>  It is produced by pressing sand, clay, feldspar, mica with the addition of dyes under high pressure.  Then firing is required at temperatures above 1200 degrees.  Artificial granite has many properties of its original counterpart, but, of course, it is not so durable, although it has its advantages.  For example, it is simply indispensable in the kitchen.  The sink, countertop, panels of this wonderful artificial stone look elegant, and most importantly - they make it easy to maintain perfect cleanliness in your kitchen: they are perfectly washed, they do not form mold and bacteria do not multiply, as they are made of non-porous material resistant to chemical exposure. </p><p>  Classical splendor, luxury and the atmosphere of antiquity - this is what granite will give you in the interior of a house or apartment.  This natural stone, which absorbed the heat of magma, surprisingly well combines with wood and ceramics.  It will make your home warm and comfortable. </p>
