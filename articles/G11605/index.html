  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to scan a QR code on a computer and phone?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The QR code is already firmly in use.  Currently, with its help it is possible not only to transfer important information in the form of text or html-links, but also to pay for purchases in stores.  Accordingly, in order to get information from the code, you must have at hand the appropriate application installed on a personal computer or smartphone.  Today, these applications will be discussed, namely, how to scan a QR code with their help. </p><h2>  QR Code Desktop Reader &amp; Generator </h2><p>  First of all, we‚Äôll figure out how to scan a QR code on a computer.  Although it is used less often for this, it will not be superfluous to learn about a special program for this.  And it will go, as you might guess from the title of the subheading, about the QR Code Desktop Reader &amp; Generator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lumpics.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="QR code how to scan" class="if uuid-2525452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2525452.jpg"></div><p>  This is a simple program that contains a lot of useful functions for working with QR codes.  We list the main ones: </p><ul><li>  You can scan the code directly from the monitor screen, for this you need to use the screen capture.  The option is called directly from the main application screen.  You just need to select the area where the QR code is located, after which the program will show the encrypted information. </li><li>  You can also use your webcam for scanning.  The algorithm of actions is simple: select the appropriate option in the menu, bring the QR code to the camera, and the application shows you the result. </li><li>  You can also load code into the program directly from the clipboard. </li><li>  If the code is in the form of an image on your computer, then you can also download it to the program without unnecessary problems, after which it will show the information hidden in it. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, using the application is very simple, but there are a lot of ways to scan a QR code.  By the way, among other things, you can create codes by entering information in the text box and clicking the corresponding button. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Barcode descriptor </h2><p>  If you were thinking about how to scan a QR code on an android, then there is a special program for this that can be downloaded directly from Google Play.  First, consider the BarCode Descriptor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lumpics.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://lumpics.ru/how-to-scan-qr-code/"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to scan a QR code on android" class="if uuid-2525453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2525453.jpg"></div><p>  This application has a simple interface and several functions.  For work with codes your camera is used.  All you need is to bring the phone‚Äôs camera to the code, and the information hiding in it will appear on the screen at the same time.  You can also interact with her.  For example, if this is a link, open it in a browser simply by clicking on it, and if it is a phone number, then call the subscriber.  You can also view the history of scanning and repost information on social networks and friends in SMS.  Among the shortcomings, one can distinguish an interface that does not please with a riot of colors. </p><h2>  QR and barcode scanner </h2><p>  The second way to scan a QR code by phone is to use <span>the</span> QR and Barcode <span>Scanner program</span> .  Here, on the contrary, one of the advantages can be considered a beautiful interface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.4androidapk.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to scan a QR code by phone" class="if uuid-2525450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2525450.jpg"></div><p>  The code is scanned in the same way - through the phone‚Äôs camera, unfortunately, there is no way to download images from the disk.  You can interact with the information received - send by mail, SMS or social networks.  If this is a link, then click on it by opening a browser. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know how to scan a QR code not only on smartphones, but also on a computer.  All programs have been tested and do not pose any threat to the user, if only they were downloaded from official sources (on the official website of the developer or on Google Play). </p>
