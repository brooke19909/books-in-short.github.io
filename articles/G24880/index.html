  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The industrial revolution. Features of the industrial revolution in the USA and Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The industrial revolution, which began at the end of the 18th century in England and subsequently embraced the developed states (in the 19th century), was a replacement of manual production by machine, a transition to a factory from manufactory.  The leading social classes are the workers and the bourgeoisie.  The basis of production are a factory and a factory equipped with machines. </p><p>  The industrial revolution was going on gradually.  In the first half of the 19th century, the revolution after England spanned the United States.  Then came the industrial revolution in Europe.  Moreover, in its eastern part, the industrial revolution did not end. </p><p>  The onset of the industrial revolution affected light industry.  Then, machineization began to cover other manufacturing industries.  This period was marked by technical inventions, including <span>a lathe, a</span> sewing machine, new transport (steam locomotive and steamboat), types of communication (radio, telegraph, telephone). </p><p>  In the second half of the 19th century, the industrial revolution passed to a new stage of development.  During this period, an engine of internal combustion engine was invented, a phonograph (sound recording and reproducing device), oil, chemical production was discovered.  People began to actively use electricity. </p><p>  The industrial revolution took place in favorable conditions.  They were created by the formation of the United States.  <span>Looms</span> and mechanical spinning wheels appeared in America in 1789.  After an emigrant worker from England, Plater drafted a loom, a year later the first textile factory began to operate in the United States.  After fifty years, cotton consumption in America‚Äôs factories has more than doubled. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that the greatest activity in the introduction of <span>steam engines</span> was noted from the beginning of the forties of the 19th century.  Such a relatively late introduction was due to the spread of the water engine, in comparison with the steam engine, cheaper. </p><p>  Great importance in the development of the industrial revolution in America was attached to the construction of railways.  In the period from 1830 to 1850 there was a more than five-fold increase in the railway network. </p><p>  The growth of the mining and metallurgical industries was largely due to the mechanization of transport.  So, in the first half of the 19th century there was a 12-fold increase in the production of pig iron, and a few thousand at the angle. </p><p>  The industrial revolution allowed the United States to develop its own mechanical engineering.  So, in Pennsylvania, New York, large steam engine plants were built. </p><p>  It should be noted that a great contribution to the development of industry in America was made by the geniuses of engineering (Colt, Singer, Morse).  <span>Agricultural engineering</span> was gaining momentum in the country <span>,</span> which was due to the growing needs of the farm.  In the period of the 40s and 50s, magnificent mechanical threshers, seeders, mowing machines and other equipment were created in America. </p><p>  For fifty years, the US imports increased 4 times, and exports 3.7.  However, in the middle of the 19th century, agricultural products and raw materials still occupied leading export positions. </p><p>  In Russia, the process of industrial revolution was inconsistent in the territorial and sectoral sectors.  This was the reason for the rather long, half-century transition of the country from manual labor to automated production.  Machinization began in the cotton industry in the thirties, and ended in metallurgy in the eighties. </p><p>  By the time of the abolition of serfdom, more than 60% of the products in the <span>manufacturing industry were</span> produced by civilian workers in factories. </p><p>  In the mid-19th century, about a hundred engineering industries were founded, but manual labor continued to be used in metallurgy. </p>
