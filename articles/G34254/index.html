In truth, this issue excites many modern citizens.  After all, one does not always want to stand in line at the bank for a long time in order to pay off the state.  Sometimes online payment is much faster and more convenient.  Fortunately, such an opportunity officially takes place.  Now we will try to understand how to pay the transport tax through the "State Services" or in any other way.  In addition, you need to understand the rules for calculating your debt.  It is not so difficult to do this if you are properly prepared for the process. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to pay transport tax through public services" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1150670.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  registration </h2><p>  The first stage to be completed is registration on the corresponding portal.  In our case, <span>it is "State Services".</span>  You should not have any questions - the whole process is extremely simple.  Visit gosuslugi.ru, and then in the right part of the window (in the corner) click on "Register". </p><p>  You will see a small form to fill out.  Here you should write only real information about yourself.  In principle, you will have to do exactly the same at all subsequent stages of filling out a profile.  Here, both TIN and SNILS, and passport data will be required.  Without them, paying tax through the State Services is simply not possible.  Anyway, using the portal will not work to the full. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Finished filling out the fields?  At the specified email address you will receive a special activation link.  Once you go through it, you can work with the portal.  What next? </p><h2>  Service search </h2><p>  The second stage is the search for the corresponding service in the list.  As a rule, many experience difficulties during the implementation of tax payments through the State Services.  After all, finding the right item can be extremely difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calculate transport tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1149165.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If you are independently engaged in searches, you will have to look into the section "Authorities".  Here, of course, you need to select <span>"Tax Service".</span>  Next, open the appropriate section and click on the desired line.  In our case, this is a "transport tax".  Click "Get the service" and see what happens.  Here you will see a window in which you will have to fill in some data.  This is usually information about the payer and his vehicle.  In addition, there is also a point where you need to enter the amount of tax.  It is best to use a bank card after completing the details to complete the action.  You will be offered this method.  We enter the <span>details of the bank</span> card and the recipient, and then confirm the actions. </p><p>  In addition, if you are thinking about how to pay the transport tax through "State services", it is enough to enter the corresponding request in the special search line (upper right corner).  And you will immediately be given a page with detailed information on how to make a payment.  Not as hard as it might seem, right?  But there is one small problem - this is the question of how to calculate the transport tax. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Settlement Rules </h2><p>  Fortunately, for those who plan to work with the State Services website, this is not such a big problem.  Why?  All data is stored directly in the system.  All the user needs is to extract and remember them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax nk rf" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1149162.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Calculating the transport tax with the help of "State services" is easy and simple.  Like last time, we go to the "Authorities" - "Tax Service".  Here now you need to pay attention to such an item as "Free reporting."  Click on it.  Next you need to click "Get a service." </p><p>  Information about your debt will appear on the screen.  This is the tax on the vehicle.  Now you can remember this amount, and then enter it into the appropriate field.  Sometimes the tax itself is "prescribed" in a virtual receipt.  Please note that it will be processed within 14 days.  And therefore, immediately after finishing work with the system, your payment will still be displayed as debt. </p><h2>  When to pay? </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how you can pay the transport tax.  The Tax Code of the Russian Federation also establishes the deadlines in which all taxpayers must "meet".  Otherwise, you will be fined, plus penalties.  By what date do we need to resolve our current issue? </p><p>  Everything is extremely simple here.  The transport tax (the Tax Code of the Russian Federation includes the clarification of the terms of payment) is paid by the citizens of the Russian Federation until July 1 next year, which came after the reporting year.  For example, for 2014 you need to pay before 07/01/2015.  In principle, there are no problems.  Portal of State Services (Moscow and any other region) contains information on the timing of payment of taxes.  If you suddenly forgot about them, you can find the relevant items in the description of the payment of transport tax.  There is nothing special about this.  But through the portal it is not always convenient to work.  Paying taxes using a regular bank card is more popular. </p>

    <h2>  Bank to help </h2><p>  Consider our current idea on the example of Sberbank.  After all, it is used by many citizens in Russia.  Payment of tax through "State services" is very convenient.  But still this is slightly unusual.  But at the bank or through an ATM, if you have the appropriate receipt, you can solve the issue faster.  Debt after can check through the "State Services". </p><p>  You must have a receipt and details for payment.  We approach the ATM, insert the plastic card into the receiver, enter the pin code.  Now you need to select "Payments in your area."  Click on "Recipient Search", and then select "By TIN".  Enter the data from the receipt of the recipient. </p><p>  If you did everything correctly, the system will give you all the necessary data on the payment of transport tax.  Check each item carefully.  There is nothing special about this.  Sometimes you have to independently enter all the necessary information in the appropriate fields.  The calculation of the transport tax will either be deduced automatically, or you must indicate it and then confirm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="payment of tax through public services" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1149161.jpg"></div>

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

    <p>  We confirm our actions, after which we pick up the check and save it.  It can come in handy at any time.  All necessary funds will be automatically deducted from your card.  This is easier than working with the State Services portal.  Moscow, St. Petersburg or any other region is not so important, because everywhere this process goes the same.  However, if you do not like to use an ATM, you can simply come with a passport and receipt, as well as money to the Sberbank cashier.  You give the payment document, present the identification card and all problems are resolved. </p><h2>  Online wallet </h2><p>  The transport tax, a payment sample of which can be seen on the Gosuslug portal, can be introduced not only by more or less familiar methods.  For example, every citizen is able to use payment via the Internet through an electronic wallet, for example, WebMoney. </p><p>  What is needed for this?  Firstly, the availability of funds in the account.  Secondly, your authorization.  We go into your profile and select "Penalties and taxes" - "Taxes on the TIN".  Next, enter the relevant data.  The system will give you tax calculations.  Select "Transport" and click on "Next."  The required amount will be debited from your account.  There will be no more problems here.  Unless your details on <span>the payment receipt</span> (if any) and in the electronic wallet are different.  This is an unpleasant moment, which should be eliminated before making a payment. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Now we understand <span>how to pay the transport tax</span> through the "State Services" and not only.  As you can see, if all the actions are properly organized, the process will not be too difficult.  The main problem, as a rule, lies in the calculations, as well as the loss of receipts.  If you have lost it, then payment cannot be made at the bank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax sample" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1149166.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  But do not be upset.  After all, you can always use the Gosuslugi portal or your electronic wallet to deal with the task set for us.  And remember the deadlines by which you need to pay the state.  Otherwise, a fine (penalty) will have to be issued as a separate payment. </p>
