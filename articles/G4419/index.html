  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Equifax: reviews of employees of the American organization</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Russians can learn their credit history for free even in a commercial organization.  One of the leaders among BKI in the Russian Federation is the Equifax company.  The Bureau is not only a major informant for banks and individuals, but also an official employer.  Reviews about Equifax allow you to evaluate its attractiveness to potential employees. </p><h2>  About company </h2><p>  The history of the bureau began almost 120 years ago in America, Georgia.  Now the Equifax database has more than 293 million customer credit histories.  Data is updated according to the results sent from 2 thousand companies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.democracynow.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Equifax credit history reviews" class="if uuid-3100463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3100463.jpg"></div><p>  The bureau works under the terms of contracts that are concluded with organizations.  According to the contract, banks, MFIs and other credit organizations are required to transmit information on each client agreement to the bureau. </p><p>  Based on the collected data, the borrower's credit history is formed.  The Equifax bureau can request a certificate from both the banks with which the contract is drawn up, as well as third-party organizations, as well as individuals. </p><p>  In addition to services for the collection, processing and provision of information about loans, BKI provides analysis and IT support programs.  Success of the company: </p><ol><li>  MigCredit and Gazprombank operate on the basis of the 4Score scoring model. </li><li>  Equifax is actively collaborating with the State Service online service, where the client can order a certificate of loans and repayments on loans. </li><li>  The online service "Credit History Online" is one of the best in Russia. </li></ol><h2>  Working conditions </h2><p>  One of the important criteria for selecting an employer is working conditions.  According to staff feedback about Equifax, the bureau‚Äôs working conditions meet modern requirements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="equifax credit services reviews" class="if uuid-3100469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3100469.jpg"></div><p>  Work in the office is in no way inferior to accepted standards: a comfortable room in the city.  Computers and other equipment work stably; in case of problems, employees can contact online support. </p><p>  In terms of convenience, everyone notes a clean bathroom and a separate kitchen.  The kitchen has a microwave, an electric kettle, tea and coffee are free. </p><p>  Each department operates in a separate room.  This allows you to focus on the team and priorities in the work. </p><h2>  Benefits and Privileges </h2><p>  The presence of comfortable conditions is appreciated by all employees.  But it is equally important to have additional benefits that make employees value their position and work diligently. </p><p>  According to Equifax, salaries are only official.  Payments "in envelopes" are not practiced in any of the departments.  This is important, especially in times of crisis, when even large companies are on the verge of financial insolvency and are forced to pay employees wages not under the contract. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marketwatch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="equifax employee reviews" class="if uuid-3100468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3100468.jpg"></div><p>  An important bonus is VHI.  For Equifax employees, it is already included in the employee support program for free, but they can purchase an additional package for their relatives for an extra charge. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to American labor practice, a healthy lifestyle has a positive effect on the ability of workers to work.  Therefore, in Equifax, according to workers, there is a free fitness room on the ground floor of the office. </p><p>  Equifax is a company with foreign work experience, therefore, the study of English is a priority in it.  Courses are paid by the employer.  According to reviews of Equifax bureau, employees can learn the language at any convenient time in the office of the company or partner organization. </p><h2>  Wage level </h2><p>  Attractiveness of conditions is very important, but it is not a priority when looking for work.  The salary is of interest to 100% of applicants, therefore, in the reviews about Equifax, future team members are looking for information about wages. </p><p>  One of the main advantages of the company is 100% official employment.  Salaries and bonuses are paid in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creditcards.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="office equifax reviews" class="if uuid-3100466" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3100466.jpg"></div><p>  The basic salary - up to 99% - is the salary.  At the end of the year, employees are awarded a prize based on the results of their work.  The most active team members receive 2-5 salaries for the New Year as a reward. </p><p>  The salary is the national average.  In Moscow and the region, according to reviews of Equifax Credit Services, employees receive at least 65 thousand rubles.  The salary in other regions is at least 35 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The company annually produces indexation of wages in connection with rising inflation in the country, so Equifax employees can count on decent wages in any economic situation in the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Employment Features </h2><p>  Before applying for a job at the Equifax Business Center, all employees are interviewed.  It allows you to verify the desire of applicants and test them for professional suitability. </p><p>  The company does not have strict requirements for education and work experience.  According to reviews of Equifax credit bureau, even a student without work experience can become a member of the team. </p><p>  Since the company is based on the American approach to doing business, a lot of attention in the organization is paid to the personal development of each team member.  This is reflected not only in the numerous bonuses (VHI, sports hall, free tea and coffee), but also in the training of employees in English at the office. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wksu.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="equifax reviews" class="if uuid-3100461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3100461.jpg"></div><p>  But to become a member of the team, you need to prove yourself.  In this case, the employee must possess the following qualities and skills: </p><ul><li>  responsibility; </li><li>  competent speech; </li><li>  purposefulness; </li><li>  learning ability; </li><li>  ability to work in a team; </li><li>  stress resistance; </li><li>  Be a confident PC user. </li></ul><h2>  The opinion of employees about work in BKI </h2><p>  Most workers speak warmly about their employer.  A key role in the trust of employees is played by white wages and the availability of a social package.  More than 2/3 of the operators love their work for comfortable conditions: an office in the city with quality repairs and amenities (gym, equipped kitchen). </p><p>  But in the network there are almost always free vacancies at Equifax.  This is due to the fact that not all employees are satisfied with the attitude of management or the level of wages.  In Moscow, to receive 65 thousand rubles is considered low earnings, while in the regions, a salary of 35 thousand rubles is an average. </p><p>  The strictness of the leadership in some departments is not always pleasing to the team, but this is the norm for the development of business and business relations in large organizations.  Since Equifax operates according to the American system, the requirements for team members are presented in accordance with accepted standards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="improvebudget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit bureau equifax reviews" class="if uuid-3100467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3100467.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews, at Equifax you can always solve the problem within the team and suggest development paths.  Employee activity is welcomed and encouraged at the end of the year in the form of bonuses. </p><h2>  Recommendations for Applicants </h2><p>  Those who want to become part of the Equifax team should heed the recommendations of existing employees.  They recommend the employer, pointing out the advantages of a friendly team, profitable bonuses and official employment. </p><p>  Working conditions are comfortable, management requirements are adequate.  But some employees say that not all jobs can be counted on to increase.  This negatively affects the attitude of workers to their work, which causes a "staff turnover".  Those who want to advance should pay attention to promising positions in the Equifax credit history bureau. </p><h2>  Reviews about the services of Equifax bureau </h2><p>  Use the services of Equifax credit history bureau can legal entities and individuals.  The most popular product, according to the bureau, is to obtain a credit history. </p><div class="photo" data-original="time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="equifax reviews" class="if uuid-3100477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3100477.jpg"></div><p>  Russians can find out information about loans and relations with creditors free of charge; it is allowed to exercise the right once a year.  In Equifax, according to reviews, credit history is provided online.  To do this, the client must find the appropriate tab "Credit history online". </p><p>  Information is provided after entering customer data.  The information that customers enter online is protected from unauthorized access, so credit history customers can not worry about their data. </p><p>  The feedback from Equifax customers about the credit history that borrowers received through Equifax is positive.  Information is provided on time, contains information from all credit organizations with which the payer collaborated. </p><p>  Legal entities, such as banks and MFIs, request information about borrowers during the application process.
