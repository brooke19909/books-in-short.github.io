    <h2>  Paradise vacation </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Kirish is relatively small in size, every year thousands of tourists from different parts of the world come to this village.  True connoisseurs of tropical nature will like it here.  Stunning imagination of pine forests, golden beaches, flowers of marvelous beauty, lush shrubs, plantations of pomegranates and oranges, whose magical aroma spreads throughout the district.  Small pebble beaches and convenient access to the sea are what attract visitors.  In general, Kirish is a great place for a good rest.  However, before taking a plane ticket, you should take care of your future housing.  One of the best and most popular options is the Queens Park Le Jardin Hotel - a luxurious five-star complex, which should be discussed in more detail. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Potential tourists, choosing a place in which they would like to spend their vacation, pay attention to such a nuance as the location of the hotel.  Agree, the vast majority of vacationers arrive in order to enjoy the beach pleasures.  ‚ÄúQueens Park Le Jardin‚Äù in this regard has a definite advantage, since it is located on the seashore.  Moreover, the hotel has its own private beach.  In addition, only 8 km separates the village of Kirish from the very center of Kemer.  Not very far and Antalya - only 55 km.  And the airport is located in comparative proximity. </p>

    <p>  So, in addition to a private beach, the hotel offers its guests everything that will help to make the rest more comfortable.  People who are going to stay here do not need to worry about such trifles important for a vacation as towels, mattresses and umbrellas.  All this is provided to hotel guests.  On the beach there are sun loungers and, of course, a bar where you can taste absolutely any drinks.  So you can not worry and do not take beach accessories with you on the road.  The hotel has a left-luggage office, parking, a variety of shops and small boutiques - you can say almost everything you might need. </p><h2>  Bars and Restaurants </h2><p>  Queens Park Le Jardin has a superbly developed infrastructure and service.  A good example is the large number of restaurants and bars located on site.  Guests have the opportunity to eat wherever they want.  So, the guests are invited to the main restaurant, as well as five <span>a la carte:</span> Italian, Far Eastern, Mexican, Turkish and fish.  Lovers of delicacies and exclusive cuisine will definitely like this place.  It‚Äôs only worth noting that you need to sign up in advance, one week before check-in, to visit one of the restaurants for free.  There is also a snack, lobby and disco bar.  And, of course, not without similar institutions by the pool and on the beach.  Regarding the assortment, one thing can be said - it shines with variety here, each guest will find something to his taste. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  Anything can happen on vacation, and the Queen's Park Le Jardin Resort Hotel understands this.  That is why the hotel guests are offered a variety of services that may be required - from the concierge to the help of a professional doctor.  These include laundry, dry cleaning, car rental, currency exchange and room service.  A fax and conference room are even offered.  And if guests have any questions, the administration will try not only to answer, but also help in resolving the problems that have arisen.  By the way, it is worth noting one nuance regarding accommodation.  If guests come with a child under 6 years old, then he will live for free.  If the baby is 2 years old or less, the hotel will put a crib in the room specially for him.  If the child is 7-11 years old, then you will need to pay 50% of the cost of living for one adult.  It is only necessary to stipulate this moment in advance so that the hotel administration will prepare everything necessary for the young guest. </p>
