Moreover, many drivers who have to drive a lot of cars do not imagine participating in the movement without this gadget. </p><p>  There are different cases on the road.  There may be a negligent traffic participant, grossly violating the rules of the road, ‚Äúauto-traders‚Äù, threatening physical impact, or even an unscrupulous traffic police officer, demanding money from an innocent driver.  This is where the faithful registrar friend comes to the rescue, with which you can fix a similar situation for subsequent submission to the competent authorities. </p><p>  The article below will focus on the mid-range registrar Avtovision Delta Plus New 16 Gb. </p><div class="photo" data-original="infoeto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Company `s logo" class="if uuid-2356235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2356235.jpg"></div><p>  For its fairly affordable cost, the device has remarkable capabilities.  Let's get acquainted with the characteristics and operational properties of this DVR. </p><h2>  Scope of delivery or what was put in the box? </h2><p>  The hero of the review below, Avtovision Delta Plus New, is delivered to the end user in a nice rectangular box of small sizes.  On the packaging lid you can see a photograph of the device and its full name.  There are also advertising signs explaining to the buyer that the device has 16 gigabytes of memory and a GPS module on board. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="car-radar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Box appearance" class="if uuid-2355898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2355898.jpg"></div><p>  Inside the box, the following was discovered: </p><ul><li>  Actually, the Avtovision Delta Plus New DVR itself. </li><li>  USB lanyard. </li><li>  HDMI cable for connecting to a TV. </li><li>  GPS antenna </li><li>  Power adapter for car cigarette lighter. </li><li>  A set of mounting the device on the windshield with a suction cup. </li><li>  Warranty documentation. </li><li>  Instructions for using the functionality of the gadget. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="allriders.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Contents of delivery" class="if uuid-2355881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2355881.jpg"></div><p>  The delivery set is rich, at the level of the best DVRs, here the manufacturer showed himself exclusively on the positive side. </p><h2>  Appearance and Ergonomics </h2><p>  The device is quite compact, has a thin body.  On the front panel in the center is a large lens of the optical module of the device, to the left and to the right of it are a microphone and a speaker.  At the upper end there are rails designed to connect to the bracket located on the windshield. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the right side of the device are an HDMI connector and a microSD card slot.  A microUSB port and a jack for outputting analog video to an external screen are placed on the left end.  The back panel of the Avtovision Delta New Plus is almost all occupied by a large LCD display.  To the right and left of it are buttons to control the operation of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="allriders.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General view with mount" class="if uuid-2355906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2355906.jpg"></div><p>  There is a microUSB port on the mount bracket, into which you can connect a complete GPS antenna.  You can also quickly turn the device in any direction.  This feature is convenient when you need to quickly direct the lens of the device to the side window of the car to fix the process of communication with another road user or traffic police officer. </p><p>  The ergonomics of the device are well thought out.  It will not be superfluous to mention the pleasant design of the gadget.  The disadvantages include the excessive shaking of the device when driving on rough roads due to the specific design of the bracket. </p><h2>  Gadget options </h2><p>  Below are the main parameters of Avtovision Delta Plus New: </p><ul><li>  Ambarella A2S60 image processing processor; </li><li>  maximum shooting resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels (this corresponds to FULL HD) at a frequency of 30 frames per second; </li><li>  the presence of a GPS module; </li><li>  viewing angle of the lens - 120 degrees; </li><li>  2.7-inch LCD screen </li><li>  built-in <span>rechargeable battery</span> with a capacity of 500 mAh; </li><li>  16 GB internal memory </li><li>  support for microSD memory cards up to 32 GB (speed class must be at least 10); </li><li>  motion sensor to start automatic video recording; </li><li>  G-sensor (aka shock sensor); </li><li>  USB port </li><li>  composite video output; </li><li>  support for connection via HDMI; </li><li>  device dimensions: width - 112 mm;  height - 45 mm;  thickness - 22 mm; </li><li>  the weight of the device is 88 grams. </li></ul><h2>  Device functionality </h2><p>  Now we analyze the operational capabilities of the device.  For convenience, we list them: </p><ul><li>  shooting video in maximum resolution FullHD (1920 x 1080 pixels); </li><li>  displaying the current speed of the vehicle according to signals from satellites of the GPS GPS system; </li><li>  selection of movie duration in minutes; </li><li>  setting recording cycles (new video files are written over the old ones); </li><li>  automatic inclusion of the device when turning the ignition key; </li><li>  a shock sensor that protects the roller from being removed, recorded at the time of external influence; </li><li>  insertion into the stamp frame of the vehicle‚Äôs own state number; </li><li>  large display with a diagonal of 2.7 inches; </li><li>  use of a motion sensor. </li></ul><h2>  How does it take off? </h2><p>  Let's look at how Avtovision Delta Plus copes with its main task - shooting traffic conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wizemart.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Back view" class="if uuid-2355913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2355913.jpg"></div><p>  In the daytime, in sunny weather, there are no complaints about the quality of the picture output by the DVR.  The sharpness is excellent, registration plates of passing and oncoming vehicles are perfectly readable even at a fairly large distance. </p><p>  In cloudy weather, the output image loses a bit of sharpness, but not critical.  State license plates of other road users are clearly distinguishable. </p><p>  When driving in the dark on a city street illuminated by lanterns, the device behaves best, given the fact that it does not have infrared illumination.  Of course, in order to distinguish car numbers on a video image, it is necessary that the distance to them be closer than in the daytime. </p><p>  When driving at night on an unlit highway, the situation with the quality of shooting is predictably worsened.  Despite this, even if an accident occurs, the culprit can be identified by video. </p><h2>  Opinions of the owners of the device </h2><p>  Below are the pros and cons of Avtovision Delta Plus New, according to user reviews. </p><p>  Advantages of the gadget: </p><ul><li>  The quality of shooting at the level of the best DVRs. </li><li>  Rich equipment delivery. </li><li>  The compact size of the device. </li><li>  The presence of a GPS module. </li><li>  The presence of a shock sensor. </li><li>  Big high-quality screen. </li><li>  External GPS antenna. </li></ul><p>  The disadvantages of the device: </p><ul><li>  Overpriced, for its characteristics, the price of Avtovision Delta Plus New (4000 rubles). </li><li>  Glitchy firmware. </li><li>  Short battery life without a cigarette lighter. </li><li>  It works unstable in severe frost. </li><li>  Sometimes the GPS signal disappears. </li><li>  The flimsy design of the bracket of the DVR (on rough roads the device is subject to strong vibrations). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="camerra.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recorder with bracket" class="if uuid-2356215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2356215.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The gadget is very interesting and can be recommended for purchase, despite the disadvantages of the device presented above.  The only significant drawback is its price.  Some users believe that for the same money you can buy a device with more decent characteristics. </p><p>  Therefore, customers are advised to purchase similar gadgets from other companies on the Internet before purchasing this device.  Perhaps, at the same price, a third-party device will be more functional. </p><p>  In any case, as they say, there is no companion for the taste and color, and someone can buy the device, simply because of the attractive appearance. </p>
