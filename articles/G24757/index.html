    <h2>  First chinese banners </h2><p>  The first mention of the Chinese banners of modern design dates back to the beginning of our era.  These flags visually differed from all other European standards in their structure.  Chinese banners were made of silk, which in those days was not known.  And they looked much better than the same Roman ones sewn from rough paintings. </p><p>  The national Chinese flag appeared only at the end of the 18th century.  It was a large white canvas, with numerous figures depicted on it.  There were birds, snakes, Chinese mandarin and a blue-red spiral.  However, the existence of this flag is not officially approved.  Almost nothing was known about the <span>Chinese empire</span> at that time.  It was a fantastic state, closed to everyone. </p><p>  Imperial ships went under a variety of flags.  There was no unity.  Everything depended on the tastes and financial capabilities of the ship captains.  And yet, by 1862, a single Chinese flag appeared on all ships.  This was due to the emergence of the Anglo-Chinese fleet and the urgent demands of European politicians.  The flag was a yellow triangle, which depicted a dragon and the sun.  Later it became rectangular and lasted until the fall of the Chinese Empire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Symbolism </h2>

Each element here made sense and personified the traditions of the country.  So, the yellow color in China was considered the color of the sun, greatness and deity.  Even the emperor's kimono was yellow.

    <p>  The dragon is a sacred symbol of the country.  Unlike Russian and European legends, in China this creature was never considered evil and bloodthirsty.  On the contrary, the dragon symbolized luck, greatness, strength, power and good.  He was worshiped and asked for protection and patronage.  The traditional image of this creature: a lion's head, a snake body with eagle paws and fish scales.  He was like that on the flag. </p><h2>  Modern chinese flag </h2><p>  The first flag of the Republic of China proclaimed in 1911 took the principles of the Kuomintang party as a basis.  Today, <span>this banner is</span> officially fluttering in Taiwan. </p><p>  But what does the Chinese flag look like today?  The way it was created in October 1949.  It was in that year that the country was declared the People's Republic of China and approved its official banner, which exists to this day. </p><p>  The modern Chinese flag is a rectangular cloth of red color.  At the pole, in the upper corner, one large golden star and four smaller ones are embroidered.  The flag is one and a half times wider than its length.  A large star is three times larger than small ones.  The author of this state symbol was Zuen Lianlong. </p>

This is a reference to the neighboring Soviet Union, which at one time had a huge impact on China.  But regarding the meaning of stars, there are two opinions.  According to the first, they mean the Communist Party (large) and four national classes (small).  The second version says that five stars symbolize the five most important areas of China.

    <h2>  National emblem </h2><p>  The coat of arms was approved in 1950.  It is a red circle, inside of which the Gates of Heavenly Peace are depicted.  This is the entrance to the Forbidden City, located in Beijing. </p><p>  Like the Chinese flag, there are five stars shining over the Gate.  The circle is framed by ears of wheat.  This symbolizes the agrarian revolution.  The large <span>gear wheel</span> located in the lower center of the coat of arms is the personification of the working class and industrialists.  Well, the main element - the Gate of Heavenly Peace - is the unshakable faith of the Chinese people in ancient traditions. </p>
