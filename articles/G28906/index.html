    <h2>  Motel "Nightingale Grove" (Kursk): negative reviews </h2><p>  The guests of this hotel leave a number of negative comments, the most significant of which can be considered the following: </p><ul><li>  the hotel is old enough and has not been renovated for a long time; </li><li>  leaking plumbing in the bathroom; </li><li>  the shower is represented by a tray with a curtain of oilcloth, which sticks to the body during bathing; </li><li>  very thin walls through which all conversations and steps of neighbors are heard; </li><li>  the rooms are rather dirty (the impression is that the rooms are not prepared for the arrival of new guests); </li><li>  in the hall and corridors do not turn on the light in order to save money, and therefore it is very dark there and there is a risk of injury </li><li>  the waiters in the restaurant are very slow and not too helpful with the guests; </li><li>  if in a cafe you want to make an order on the menu, you will find that more than half of the declared dishes are not available; </li><li>  the cost of living does not match the quality of the services provided; </li><li>  cosmetics are issued only upon arrival and are no longer replenished; </li><li>  When planning a visit to the hotel for the weekend, check if there are weddings on this day, because these events are too noisy and drag out until late at night. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The hotel complex "Nightingale Grove" is a good option for those who like to relax in nature, away from the bustle of the city.  The hotel is located in a pine forest, so you can enjoy the clean air and beautiful forest landscapes.  In addition, the distance to the city center is quite small, and therefore you will not feel divorced from civilization.  Nevertheless, all this beauty is overshadowed by the dilapidated building of the hotel, as well as the fact that the price of accommodation is very high. </p><p>  Holidays in the Nightingale Grove are best not planned for the weekend, because at this time weddings and other celebrations are often held here.  Given that the activities are usually quite noisy, you will not be able to enjoy the silence of the pine forest.  In addition, the restaurant service as well as the meager menu will disappoint you.  Nevertheless, the quality of dishes is at a fairly high level.  We can say that this hotel is suitable for picky guests who are ready to turn a blind eye to a number of shortcomings for the sake of relaxation in the lap of nature, as well as business people who want to hide from the city bustle. </p>
