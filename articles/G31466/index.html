Programs, recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More than a billion smartphones and tablets around the world are already running on the Android operating system.  The popularity of this OS is only increasing every day.  At the same time, the system itself is evolving, opening up new opportunities for gadgets.  Probably, every owner of such a device over time notices a decrease in the phone‚Äôs performance.  The reasons for this phenomenon are different: an abundance of unnecessary applications and programs that slow down, lack of memory, and much more.  In this regard, the question arises: how to speed up the work of Android?  The answer will be given in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to speed up android" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41852/1272513.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Install the latest firmware </h2><p>  The updated version of the Android OS has new fixes and features that will significantly increase the performance of the device, optimizing its work.  Check for updates, even if you just purchased a device.  You can find out the firmware version in the phone settings.  And if you have constant access to the Internet, you won‚Äôt even have to check - the offer to update the firmware will instantly arrive on your phone or tablet.  You just have to use it. </p><p>  How to speed up Android by updating application versions?  Stay tuned for new versions of the programs you use.  They fixed bugs allowed in previous versions, and added new features.  This will also improve productivity.  But before that, it is recommended to read the opinions of the townsfolk, to find out what they write in the reviews about the new version.  Perhaps you may expect unexpected surprises. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Place order on the home screen <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to speed up your android phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41852/1272509.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The abundance of many icons, applications, add-ons, and especially wallpapers with animations on the home screen, can cause system performance to decline.  If you don‚Äôt know how to speed up Android, set a regular picture on the background screen, get rid of unnecessary shortcuts and widgets.  After that, the system should start working faster. </p><h2>  Get rid of unnecessary apps <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to speed up android" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41852/1272512.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Do not clutter up free space with programs that you do not use.  They not only occupy the memory in the phone, but can also activate processes that require the use of traffic and once again involve the processor in the work.  Open the list of all installed programs and determine which ones can be removed.  If the name is difficult to determine the purpose of the application, find out information from Google.  Uninstall applications that are designed to operate the system will fail.  But you can deactivate their work.  This will disable their execution, and they will no longer be displayed in the list of active programs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to speed up android" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41852/1272511.jpg" width="600"></div>

If you need to install some program, before that, read the reviews, and also check the requested rights. </p><h2>  Optimize the display of animations </h2><p>  In order to solve the problem of how to speed up the phone on Android, so that its interface works more smoothly and quickly, you can configure the animation display policy.  To do this, activate the developer options.  Go to the settings and find the ‚ÄúAbout device‚Äù item there.  After that, click on the build number several times.  Returning to the main settings menu, you will see an additional item ‚ÄúDeveloper Options‚Äù.  They allow you to customize the animation as you wish.  It is not recommended to make adjustments to other functions, as this can provoke a deterioration in the OS. </p><h2>  Clean your application cache regularly <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to speed up the phone on android" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41852/1272510.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  As you know, applications use the cache in order to optimize their work.  But sometimes it accumulates a lot.  And this in no way contributes to acceleration.  Often some programs are deleted, and their cache still remains and occupies precious space in the file system.  One of the effective ways to speed up Android is to delete the program cache.  This can be done manually through the properties of applications or you can use special applications for optimization, which will be discussed below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Turn off or restrict auto-sync <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to speed up a smartphone on android" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41852/1272508.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Many owners of gadgets on Android have mobile Internet or Wi-fi constantly in an active state.  This consumes traffic for all kinds of background updates and auto-synchronization.  And this negatively affects the speed of battery discharge.  Now you know another way to speed up your smartphone on Android - you need to turn off auto-sync.  And if necessary, this can be done manually.  Moreover, refuse background data transfer from Google if you almost do not use their services. </p><h2>  Clearing cache partitions on a device </h2><p>  The "Cache" section on Android devices is not related to the application cache, which was described a little higher.  This is a slightly different option.  The cache on the device in its functions is similar to the Temp folder in the Windows operating system.  After a long period of time, it is cluttered with unnecessary temporary files.  They should be deleted if you are thinking about how to speed up Android.  You can clear the cache through the Recovery menu.  On different devices, the path to it may be different.  For a specific device, it should be clarified separately. </p><h2>  Third-party launcher </h2><p>  It also happens that even the most famous manufacturers of gadgets on Android can make significant mistakes and shortcomings in optimizing their launchers.  Suppose you have this situation and you need to change the situation.  To increase the productivity of the interface, you can select and install a new launcher through Google Play.  Among the many options available, the best are Nova Launcher, Go Launcher, Apex Launcher and others.  In addition, you can install a launcher that copies the interface of Windows Phone 8. There are also completely original ones. </p><h2>  Return to factory settings </h2><p>  If other optimization methods do not give significant results, the device hangs even during simple operations and you don‚Äôt know how to speed up the tablet on Android, try resetting to factory settings.  But it is important to remember that in this case all previous data will be lost.  Returns can be made in the settings or from the Recovery section.  Before doing this, be sure to save all the important information. </p><h2>  Try to overclock the gadget <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to speed up a tablet on android" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41852/1272516.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  If you want significant improvements, you can use the processor overclocking method.  Programs such as SetCPU or Android Overclock will come to the rescue.  Just act with extreme caution and monitor the temperature of the device. </p><h2>  Alternative firmware </h2><p>  This method of improving the performance of the device is fundamental.  To flash a smartphone, you will need to obtain <span>root privileges.</span>  Then install custom Recovery, go to the Cyanogenmod website and download the latest firmware for your gadget from there.  It is important to remember that after this procedure all your data will be lost. </p><h2>  Review the list of applications at startup </h2><p>  To optimize your device and speed up its inclusion, you should remove unnecessary applications from startup.  Indeed, by default in automatic mode when you turn on the phone, some programs are launched.  They continue to run in the <span>background,</span> which consumes resources.  Removing unnecessary programs from startup, you will not violate the functionality of the system.  If necessary, they can be started manually.  Autostarts specialized program can help in managing applications on Android startup. </p><h2>  Set processor frequency </h2><p>  Improving the performance of the device on Android and preventing it from freezing can be controlled by the correct processor frequencies.  The AnTuTu CPU Master application will help with this.  This program will accelerate Android if you increase the minimum frequency value.  But it should be borne in mind that the higher the value in the ‚Äúminimum‚Äù column is set, the more resources will be required.  Accordingly, the battery will be more discharged. </p><h2>  Clean Master for optimization <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="program speed up android" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41852/1272514.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  One of the most popular programs for optimizing the work with Android OS is Clean Master.  The comprehensive application offers a number of actions to improve the speed of the device.  This is a very good program.  She will be able to speed up the Android without any problems.  <span>Clean Master</span> makes it possible to quickly <span>clear the</span> program <span>cache</span> and get rid of unused files.
