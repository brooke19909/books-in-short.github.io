It has a land border with Denmark and is washed immediately by two seas - the Baltic and the North.  Federal land is located on <span>the Jutland Peninsula.</span>  For a long time, the Schleswig-Holstein region was an independent duchy.  And some of the land belonged to the <span>Danish kingdom.</span>  All this led to the unique appearance of Schleswig-Holstein.  Beautiful northern nature, sand dunes, watts (sandbanks), ancient <span>medieval cities,</span> excellent cuisine - all this attracts many tourists to the region.  The lion's share of them comes here in the summer months.  Gourmets, attracted by huge oysters, marzipans and special wine, families with children who like fast-warming shallow water, and amateur naturalists love to be here.  And what else is <span>Germany</span> 's northernmost federal <span>state</span> famous for <span>?</span>  Read about it below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Schleswig Holstein" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1105325.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Regions </h2><p>  In the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein, several zones can be distinguished.  And each of them is good in its own way.  For example, the southern zone, the former independent Duchy of Löhenburg, has the semi-official name of Holstein Switzerland.  There are vast forests on the hills, between which secluded lakes sparkle with blue eyes.  The coast of the North Sea is watts.  Huge areas at high tide are flooded with water.  This strip can reach a width of forty kilometers!  Guinea pigs and seals are found on the shallows.  Therefore, unique watts from the Danish border to the mouth of the Elbe are a natural object of world significance and are included in the UNESCO list.  The area of ​​this biosphere reserve is more than four thousand square kilometers.  Extensive sandy beaches, high steep banks are the hallmark of the Baltic Sea.  The Jutland Peninsula is the most sparsely populated in Germany.  Deserted landscapes allow the development of tourism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Schleswig Holstein Features" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1105334.jpg" width="600"></div>

Since 1665, the city acquired a university.  For about a century, Kiel belonged to the Danish kingdom, which left its stamp on its appearance.  Having become part of Prussia, the city turned into a naval port.  With Kiel, the revolution of 1918 began, when the sailors revolted.  The old city center suffered a lot from the bombing during World War II, but was lovingly restored by citizens.  Kiel acquired the status of the capital of the federal state in 1946.  Other major cities in Schleswig-Holstein are Lubeck, Elmshorn, Norderstedt, Neumuenster and Flensburg.  In the latter, a regatta of ancient ships is held annually.  Kiel, Neumuenster, Lübeck and Flenburg have airports.  Berlin, Hamburg and other cities in Germany are connected with federal land by motorways and railways. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Schleswig Holstein Capital" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1105346.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resorts </h2><p>  In the summer, Schleswig-Holstein is filled with tourists.  Mostly these are beach people.  Extremely high temperatures on the shores of the North and Baltic Seas do not exist, but unforgettable landscapes, the smell of iodine and pines, pacification spilled in the air await vacationers.  Tourists flock to the seaside resort of Travemunde, as well as the islands of Amrum and Sylt.  The latter gained the glory of the “German St. Moritz” (by analogy with the Swiss resort).  In summer, celebrities and representatives of creative bohemia come to Sylt Island.  There are hospitals and spa hotels, and local restaurants serve giant oysters (each weighing at least 80 grams).  Travemuende was once an independent city, but now it has entered the Lubeck line.  And the crescent-shaped island of Amrum, on which less than two thousand people live in winter, attracts tourists with fine white sand.  Those who prefer solitude and contact with wildlife go to the Wadden Sea or to Holstein Switzerland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Land Schleswig Holstein" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1105335.jpg" width="600"></div>

And in this, the federal state is perfect.  Here, no matter what the village is, an old manor or castle, turned into a museum.  Very interesting cities in Schleswig-Holstein.  The capital of the region, Kiel, is famous for the oldest in Germany (and one of the longest in the country) pedestrian Holstenstrasse.  And this city gave the name to the sprat.  This is a local delicacy served as an appetizer.  “Sprats caught in the Kiel Fjord” are not the only fun features of the city.  Its citizens call themselves "killers" and proudly bear this name.  The city is also connected with the history of Russia.  In Kiel, the Prince of Holstein-Gottorp was born, who, through marriage with Catherine the Great, turned into Tsar Peter III.  Could he think, leaving his hometown for the sake of the Russian throne, that he would soon be overthrown by his wife, and then killed by a fork at dinner? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Schleswig Holstein Attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1105313.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lubeck </h2><p>  This city in the Middle Ages was the capital of the glorious Hanseatic League.  Now Lubeck captivates tourists with its Gothic architecture.  The center, built of red brick, is included in the UNESCO list.  If you go to Kiel to watch a sailing regatta, then to Lübeck to take part in a music festival.  The Holstein-Gottorp dukes had numerous castles in the city and its environs.  And not far from Marien-Kirche is the home of the writers Heinrich and Thomas Mannov.  “The city of red brick” is the most visited by tourists in the land of Schleswig-Holstein.  Interesting facts connect him with Russian history.  As you know, Novgorod in the XIII century was also a member of the <span>Hanseatic League.</span>  And one young merchant, a native of Lubeck, once went with goods to Russia.  There he was imbued with the Orthodox faith, distributed his goods to the poor and began to walk in rags.  Now he is known as St. Procopius of Ustyug. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of the earth Schleswig Holstein" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1105347.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Möln </h2><p>  In the Middle Ages, this city played a key role, because the Great Salt Route from Luneburg to the Baltic passed through it.  Now Möln is the untitled capital of “Northern Switzerland” in the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein.  The sights of this city are hard to overestimate.  First of all, this is the cult of Til Uhlenshpiegel.  German legends took this mockingbird from Holland.  It is believed that Ulenspiegel was born in Braunschweig and died in Möln.  Moreover, Til lived not in the sixteenth century, but in the fourteenth.  And he died during the Great Plague.  In Möln there are several monuments to Ulenspiegel.  Tourists should also explore the majestic church of St. Nicholas, which can be seen from anywhere in the city, and the town hall of the fourteenth century.  To match the historical natural attractions of Möln.  You should visit at least one of the glorious lakes of Holstein Switzerland. The tourist boom in Möln falls on August, when the Festival of Lights and the competition of archers are held in the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Schleswig Holstein interesting facts" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1105331.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to try in Schleswig-Holstein </h2><p>  Keelersproten is not the only local delicacy.  If you are a sweet tooth, you just have to visit Lübeck.  This city is considered the capital of German marzipan.  In fact, the Italians came up with a sweet <span>almond flour</span> and sugar.  And the name "marzipan" means "March bread."  This dessert was enjoyed before Easter, during Lent.  In the main Hanseatic city - Lubeck - the marzipan imported from Italy was so fond of that the locals began to use it all year round.  And the corresponding legend was invented: they say, in 1407, due to a lack of wheat flour, they began to use crushed almonds.  There is a Marzipan Museum in Lübeck.  The local wine, Lübecker Rotspon, has an interesting history.  Of course, it was born from vines not in Lübeck, but in the more southern regions.  But, having wandered in barrels in the cool climate of Schleswig-Holstein, the wine acquired an indescribable taste.  While on Sylt Island, be sure to try the Zilter Royal - huge oysters that are grown on local farms. </p><h2>  Schleswig-Holstein: features of the region </h2><p>  This region has its own charm.  The proximity of Denmark and almost a hundred-year stay in the northern neighbor left an imprint on the appearance of cities.  Yes, and the inhabitants themselves speak "plattduch" - a special dialect that is not always understood by an ordinary German. </p>
