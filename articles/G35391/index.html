    <h2>  M.V. Butashevich-Petrashevsky: a brief biography </h2><p>  In 1839, after graduating from the <span>Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum,</span> he entered St. Petersburg University at the Faculty of Law.  Having completed his education, he served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a translator.  Butashevich-Petrashevsky participated in the compilation of the Dictionary of Foreign Words Included in the Russian Language.  The first edition was edited by Mikov.  Butashevich-Petrashevsky completely corrected the second issue.  He also wrote most of the theoretical articles.  They promoted materialistic and democratic ideas, the concept of utopian socialism. </p><h2>  Butashevich-Petrashevsky: who is he for pre-revolutionary Russia? </h2><p>  First of all, it must be said that this person was the foremost thinker of his time.  Butashevich-Petrashevsky, whose biography is closely connected with the revolutionary unrest in the country, has been organizing meetings in his house since 1844.  In 1845, meetings became weekly ("Fridays").  Participants in the meetings used the Butashevich-Petrashevsky library.  Some publications were banned in Russia.  They concerned the history of revolutionary movements, materialist philosophy, utopian socialism.  Butashevich-Petrashevsky, in short, advocated the democratization of the political system in the country, the liberation of peasants with land allotments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Arrest </h2><p>  At the end of 1848, Butashevich-Petrashevsky took part in meetings at which the establishment of a secret community was discussed.  The Thinker was an active supporter of the continuous preparation of the people for the revolutionary struggle.  In 1849, a public figure Butashevich-Petrashevsky and several dozen people associated with him were arrested.  A criminal court sentenced them to death.  However, it was replaced by indefinite hard labor.  Butashevich-Petrashevsky was exiled to Eastern Siberia. </p><h2>  last years of life </h2><p>  Since 1856, being an exiled settler, Butashevich-Petrashevsky lived in Irkutsk.  Here he taught, collaborated with local newspapers.  In 1860 he organized the print edition of Amur.  In February of the same year he was sent to Shushenskoye for speaking out against the activities of local authorities.  In December 1860 he moved to Krasnoyarsk and lived there until 1864. Here he exerted a great influence on the work of the City Duma.  <span>The governor of Krasnoyarsk</span> Petrashevsky was first sent back to Shushenskoye, and then to the village.  Kebezh.  In early May 1866 he was transferred to a village.  Belskoe in the Yenisei District.  Here he died of a brain hemorrhage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Butashevich Petrashevsky biography" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1262730.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of the revolutionary circle </h2><p>  Active formation of new underground communities in Russia began in the 40s of the 19th century.  Among all the circles, Butashevich-Petrashevsky‚Äôs organization attracted special attention.  The year 1845 began its active work on the revolutionary path.  It was then that <span>literary men,</span> students, teachers, petty officials, and officers began to regularly gather in his <span>house</span> .  All of them came from wealthy noble families.  The existing society existed until 1849. At the meetings there was a discussion of sore socio-political issues, the philosophical foundations of the worldview were developed, plans for further actions were drawn up.  Here, serfdom was openly denounced, characterized as the egregious evil of tsarism and the <span>estate system.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="butashevich petrashevsky who is he" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1262726.jpg" width="428"></div>

The community has expanded to include new members.  The circle included such outstanding personalities as Dostoevsky, Saltykov-Shchedrin, Maykov, Plescheev, Semenov, Rubinstein, Speshnev, Mombelli, Akhsharumov, Kashkin.  Among the <span>members of society were</span> officers.  This indicated that the ideas of utopian socialism began to actively penetrate the army. </p><h2>  Practical work </h2><p>  Community members sought action.  In 1845, the first issue of the Dictionary was published.  It was published by the guard colonel Kirillov, who could not even think about what a revolutionary publication was releasing.  The second edition was published in 1846. The Dictionary reflected the ideology of a new revolutionary organization.  Various terms were explained in it: "normal state", "organization of production", etc. The "Dictionary" quickly got around.  However, the government soon drew attention to the publication.  Instances were withdrawn from sale.  But up to this point, about 1 thousand pieces were distributed.  Warmly welcomed the appearance of the "Dictionary" Belinsky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Butashevich Petrashevsky photo" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1262727.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Strengthening the activity of society </h2><p>  Gradually, Petrashevists began to gain revolutionary democratic positions.  Community members spoke with sympathy about the problems facing Russia.  In particular, Mombelli wrote about the suffering of millions of people, about the absence of any rights among the peasants in the high position of the elite estates.  Petrashevists hated autocracy, acted as ardent patriots of Russia, constantly indicating their belonging to the people.  After the revolutionary events of 1848, up to 50 people began to attend meetings.  The active core began to stand out, the ideological struggle of more revolutionary-minded members against those who took a moderate position became apparent.  Calls to action, slogans began to sound in reports and appeals. </p><p>  Community members began to think of further plans.  Supporters of utopian socialism advanced to the forefront.  The key figure of this wing was Speshnev.  In addition to Petrashevsky, the ideas of socialism were shared by Khanykov, Kashkin, Akhsharumov, etc. The community had a great influence on the formation of Chernyshevsky's worldview.  He was not a member of society, but had a close relationship with him through his comrades - Hanykov, Lobodovsky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="butashevich petrashevsky briefly" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1262728.jpg" width="226"></div>

    <h2>  Police surveillance </h2><p>  Many members of the circle counted on the start of a military revolution in the country.  They believed that in Russia it was necessary to prepare for a mass uprising.  Community members developed a secret printing house project and drafted campaign leaflets.  Speshnev prepared a draft community charter.  Everyone was waiting for the rise of the peasant movement.  However, they failed to create a revolutionary organization.  The tsar‚Äôs servants were able to track down ‚ÄúFridays‚Äù and establish community surveillance.  A police agent penetrated the meetings of the Petrashevists.  He listened to everything that was happening around, and then transmitted reports to the government. </p><p>  In April 1849, on April 2, by order of Nikolai, the most active members of the circle were arrested.  According to the king, sympathy for republican and communist ideas was equated with the most serious crime against the state.  Among them were Petrashevsky, Dostoevsky, Mombelli, Speshnev.  In total, 39 people were arrested.  The High Court decided that 21 of them were worthy of death.  But, recognizing circumstances mitigating guilt, the court suggested replacing the execution with hard labor, prisoners, and a reference to the settlement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="public figure butashevich petrashevsky" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1262729.jpg" width="358"></div>

    <h2>  Simulation of execution </h2><p>  Nicholas 1 agreed with the final court verdict, but decided to make the prisoners survive the fear of death.  In December 1849, 1849, all the accused were taken to Semenovskaya Square.  The prisoners saw a high scaffold, pillars dug into the ground, troops lined up in a square, and a crowd of people.  After reading the sentence, hoodies were pulled on the convicts.  Three - Petrashevsky, Grigoriev and Mombelli - were tied to poles, covering their faces with caps.  Convicts heard the clatter of rifles, drum roll.  At this moment, the adjutant outbuilding appeared with Nikolai‚Äôs order for clemency.  Petrashevsky was immediately shackled and sent to Siberia for hard labor. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Butashevich Petrashevsky short biography" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1262725.jpg" width="318"></div>

    <p>  A few days later, the remaining members of the society were taken.  Among the convicts was Dostoevsky, the famous great writer.  He was sentenced to four years of hard labor in a <span>prison castle</span> in Omsk, and then to 6 years of service in a linear battalion in Semipalatinsk. </p>
