    <h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  In the Val di Fassa Valley (Italy) there are several resort villages.  Campitello and Canazei are the most popular among tourists.  In Campitello, you can settle in one of the excellent 4 * hotels, for example, Park Hotel Club.  It has a good wellness center and an indoor pool.  You can choose Park Hotel.  Last year, I met the first vacationers Grand Chalet Soreghes, which offers guests a spa. </p><p>  Good standard three-star hotels in Campitello.  These are small but very comfortable hotels, which are usually decorated in Tyrolean style.  For families traveling with children, it is better to choose apartments or rooms in four-star hotels.  The fact is that in 3 * hotels there are rather small rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resort val di fassa" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1027841.jpg" width="600"></div>
