One of the latter is Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat.  The beach resort is located on Cape Cap Ferrat.  It is known worldwide as the most fashionable and calm resort region.  After all, the most luxurious villas are closed here, closed to ordinary tourists.  The city is near Nice. </p><h2>  A bit of history ... </h2><p>  Favorable places on Cape Cap Ferrat among the eucalyptus and pine groves were discovered by the King of Belgium Leopold II, who built a villa here for his beloved Caroline Lacroix.  And in the mid-twentieth century, it was owned by Giovanni Agnelli (Italian industrialist).  Film lovers could see the villa in the films “Catch the Thief” and “Red Shoes” (1948). </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.68953" data-lng="7.33298400000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/0/7/2/12072.png"></div><p>  Currently, Leopold’s villa is considered the most expensive in the world and is protected as a historical and cultural monument.  Following the Belgian monarchs, the seaside charm of the region was appreciated by the aristocrats of the Old World.  Only very wealthy people began to settle in these places, who sought to surround themselves with artists, writers, poets and just intellectuals.  Such famous personalities as Jean Cocteau, Friedrich Nietzsche, the Rothschilds, Somerset Maugham, Isadora Duncan had a rest in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat.  A cozy Mediterranean corner to this day attracts the wealthiest people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modern resort </h2><p>  Cape Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat is an incredibly picturesque place, striking in its beauty.  Now the resort is no less attractive than before.  Here you can see numerous paths meandering along the coast and disappearing in pine groves, well-groomed and expensive villas.  The cape can be circled on foot, making a transition of 14 kilometers.  And throughout the walk you will invariably be amazed at the beauty of these places.  On the way you can see the old lighthouse of the era of Napoleon III, rocky capes, Maurice Rouvier boulevard, the old port. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.traveller.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat" class="if uuid-2976732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2976732.jpg"></div><p>  During the walk you will definitely meet the chapel of St. Hospice, which was built in the eleventh century on the site of the monk’s tower.  In the seventeenth century, the chapel was reconstructed by the famous Duke of Savoy, Charles Emmanuel II.  And even later, with the filing of King Charles Felix, it became a pilgrimage site for sailors who revere the Holy Hospice and consider it their guardian and intercessor.  In 1900, a bronze (11-meter) sculpture of the Virgin Mary, made by the Italian sculptor Galbusieri, was installed near the chapel.  Among the people, the statue was called the Black Virgin. </p><h2>  Villa Efrussia de Rothschild </h2><p>  One of the most outstanding attractions of the resort is the Rothschild Villa.  It is no secret that the guests of Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat and the owners of real estate were the most prominent and wealthy people: bohemians, kings, celebrities and billionaires.  A striking representative of the latter is the Rothschild family. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Vila, once owned by Beatrice Efrussia de Rothschild, is now a museum whose exhibits reflect the tastes of the famous public, its habits and mores. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.italyrivieralps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Villa Efrussi de Rothschild" class="if uuid-2976739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2976739.jpg"></div><p>  The daughter of the famous Alfred Rothschild acquired a plot of land in the resort of Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat in 1905.  During this period, rest in the region was considered incredibly prestigious and popular among aristocrats and rich.  The plot acquired by the Baroness had an area of ​​about 7 hectares.  Villa Beatrice was built for seven whole years, having succeeded in replacing 20 architects during this time.  The Baroness was considered a famous art collector.  Therefore, it is expected that she decorated her villa with items from her personal collection.  The works of art in the mansion date back to the period of the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries.  After the death of the Baroness, the villa, part of the collection and other items were transferred to the French Academy of Fine Sciences.  As for the mansion, it was called the “French Island”, in 1912 it was visited by the first guests. </p><p>  Villa Efrussia-Rothschild is a real palace made of pink marble, decorated in the style of an Italian palazzo.  It is surrounded by gorgeous gardens.  All of them were divided in accordance with a certain theme - the garden of Provence, the rose garden, the garden of exotic plants, the Japanese garden, etc. The mansion is of interest from the point of view of the outstanding works of art stored in its walls.  Here you can see objects of the French and Italian Renaissance, a carpet from the Royal Chapel of Versailles, antique furniture, personal belongings of members of the Bourbon dynasty, an outstanding collection of porcelain.  And in one room the interior and objects of the hostess of the villa itself, Beatrice, are even preserved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  "Grand Hotel" </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat a special place is occupied by the famous "Grand Hotel", erected in 1908.  The chic palace is one of the most luxurious hotel complexes in the world.

Whatever beach you choose, you will invariably swim in the waters of the warm Mediterranean Sea.  Among the best beaches of the resort, it is worth highlighting “Paloma”.  According to experts, this particular section of the coast is the most beautiful.  From it you can admire the views of the Cote d'Azur.  The beach is surrounded by lush Mediterranean vegetation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theitalianeyemagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays on the French Riviera" class="if uuid-2976879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2976879.jpg"></div><p>  He appeared in 1948, his project was developed by architect Andre Deperi.

A correctly organized trip across France is a real fairy tale.  Almost any travel company will help you go to the country.  However, it should be understood that rest on the Cote d'Azur will not be budgetary.  For example, we give the cost of a four-day trip with three nights and air travel.  Such a tour will cost you no less than 500 euros. </p><div class="photo" data-original="loulouchanel.centerblog.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saint Jean Cap Ferrat hotels" class="if uuid-2976916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2976916.jpg"></div><p>  But the famous resorts of France are worth it.  According to tourists, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat deserves no less attention than the beautiful Paris, which all women dream to visit.  If the capital of the country can be visited at any time of the year, then it is worth going to the Cote d'Azur in the summer to fully enjoy the warm sea, beautiful beaches and stunning views. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  All resorts of the Cote d'Azur are invariably expensive and fashionable, as happened historically.  No less presentable and local hotels.  You can’t count on cheap housing in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat.  Resort hotels offer a decent level of service, chic rooms and fairly high prices. </p><p>  The resort at Cape Cap Ferrat has always been considered expensive.  That remains to this day.  Villas on its territory are acquired by the wealthiest people in the world.  Among them, our compatriots are increasingly appearing.  After all, the resort is a very status place, and therefore the acquisition of real estate on the Cote d'Azur is considered a very prestigious investment.  But for ordinary tourists, such purchases can not afford.  But to fly to the resort for the weekend is quite possible to appreciate all its advantages and beauty. </p>
