  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to make candles: types of candles and their composition</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Candles have long ceased to be just sources of light.  Among other things, they also have a calming effect and give the room a completely new, amazing and sometimes even fabulous atmosphere.  When your eyes get tired of the usual lamps, you should light a candle and think about something pleasant.  And if you add a little aromatic oil to it, the effect will be even better. </p><p>  In the world there are a huge number of people who are not only seriously interested in learning what to make candles from, but also know the history of the creation of these interesting decor elements.  Therefore, we consider the varieties of unusual light sources and where they came from. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Throughout almost the entire existence of man, it was candles that were the most popular form of lighting that was used in homes.  There is a lot of literature describing exactly how the ignition of these elements occurred.  At one time, there were even individuals who were engaged in extinguishing candles in the streets and lighting them in the morning. </p><p>  If we talk about the first mentions of these elements, then according to historians, the first semblance of modern candles appeared even at a time when cavemen only opened fire for themselves.  At that time, they used dry sticks or rods, which were coated with animal fat.  Thanks to this, an object was obtained that gave lighting for a longer time.  However, in this case, it is more likely about torches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.savvyhomemade.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful candles" class="if uuid-3040854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3040854.jpg"></div><p>  If we talk about a more real resemblance to a candle, then for the first time it could be seen on images of ancient creators that were found on ancient reliefs.  It is believed that the first creators of these elements are the inhabitants of ancient Egypt.  They created candles that were made of fairly elastic fibers with animal fat.  Similar products were installed on the table. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, it is worth noting that such elements almost from the beginning of time began to be used in religious rites.  For example, if you turn to the most ancient holy books, then you can find a huge amount of information on how to use candles in them.  You don‚Äôt have to go far, just open the story of King Solomon.  After he built the temple, 10 candlesticks were used. </p><p>  Therefore, it is not surprising that these elements appeared in Europe.  For a long time the existence of candles changed their composition. </p><h2>  Types of candles </h2><p>  When deciding what to make a candle from at home, it is worth taking a closer look at the types of lighting elements.  First of all, they differ in composition, which, in fact, acts as the basis.  The wick, as a rule, remains unchanged.  The technologies of its manufacture have been preserved and are successfully applied today, as well as hundreds of years ago.  Therefore, it is worth considering in more detail the most popular varieties of candles. </p><h2>  Paraffin </h2><p>  To determine what to make a candle from at home, it is worth recalling the properties of paraffin.  Some are confident that this material is the best.  But it is not so.  This material represents saturated hydrocarbons, which, as a rule, are obtained in the course of oil refining as by-products.  This is a very cheap production. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that in the process of combustion, paraffin begins to produce gases with a very unpleasant odor.  That is why on such candles you can notice an unpleasant dark soot.  As a rule, today paraffin is used exclusively for the manufacture of household candles.  However, there are unscrupulous manufacturers.  They use this component for more expensive models that should be of better quality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wax </h2><p>  In this case, we are talking about the best elements of lighting and decor, which are made exclusively from natural materials.  If we consider what wax is made of for candles, then, as a rule, this is a natural material.  For example, there is bee, palm and soy wax.  Any of them is suitable for such products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.arnaldoandujar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Melted wax" class="if uuid-3040874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3040874.jpg"></div><p>  Wax candles have a longer burning and pleasant aroma.  At the same time, there is absolutely no need to add any additional flavorings so that the room is filled with a barely noticeable, but very pleasant, relaxing smell.  It is also worth noting that wax, although it produces gases during combustion, cannot harm the human body.  The fact is that during the combustion process they remain inert and completely harmless.  Many people prefer the use of palm or soy wax. </p><h2>  Stearic </h2><p>  Perhaps, if almost everyone heard about paraffin, then this component is perplexing.  In fact, stearin is used quite often.  It is a fairly hard and greasy to the touch mass, which is obtained by mixing stearic acid with other fatty acids.  As a rule, in this case we are talking about fats of natural origin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Despite its chemical name, stearin is a natural product.  Therefore, it can be used if it comes to how to make candles with your own hands.  At the same time, products of this type are distinguished by long burning and special brightness.  In addition, they do not emit absolutely no gases harmful to humans.  Often, stearin is used as an additional component when a candle is made from several bases at once. </p><h2>  Gel </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the gel in its characteristics very much resembles wax.  For example, it continues to be in a solid state due to the action of a hydrocarbon.  It interferes with the crystallization process.  If we talk about the composition of gel candles, then in the original recipe there are also absolutely no chemical components.  Such products are made from glycerin, gelatin and tannin. </p><p>  The gel, which is poured into a transparent container, looks very original and unusual.  As a rule, such candles are complemented by beautiful pictures.  A toy may even be placed inside the gel.  When deciding what to make candles from, it is enough to mix natural components in the right proportions.  However, many still prefer the classic models.  Therefore, people use wax and other materials. </p><h2>  Bengal </h2><p>  Such products are often called lights.  They are often used at special occasions.  Such elongated sticks are distinguished by a bright, but very short burning.  Because of the sparks flying in different directions, they are absolutely not suitable for use as lighting, but nevertheless such products look very impressive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="grandweddingexit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sparkler" class="if uuid-3040879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3040879.jpg"></div><p>  If we talk about the composition of Bengal candles, then first of all it is worth noting that they relate to pyrotechnic products.  They do not have <span>wax, paraffin</span> or any other similar materials.  Instead, they contain metal powder (mainly aluminum), barium nitrate, starch, and steel filings.  All this rests on a metal wire.  As soon as the mixture is ignited, it begins to sparkle beautifully. </p><h2>  What church candles are made of </h2><p>  Perhaps everyone noted that when visiting cathedrals and small churches, one thing remains unchanged - a surprisingly pleasant aroma.  Hence the question arises of how such elements are prepared.  If we talk about what candles are made of in the church, then in the original recipe there is only beeswax without the use of any other impurities.  They are distinguished by dark yellow color and matte texture.  Also, church candles can be of different lengths and thicknesses.  For example, there is a very high one with a slice in the form of a cone and a compacted wick.  Such a candle is called deacon.  As a rule, it is used for liturgy. </p><p>  Knowing the composition of the church candle, it is easy to understand that if elements are made from natural wax, then no flavorings will be required.  However, there is an equally interesting form of candles, which is of interest to fans of these amazing light sources. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fiverr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church candles" class="if uuid-3040877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3040877.jpg"></div><h2>  Jerusalem </h2><p>  This is a special kind of candle.  In fact, it is a bunch of 33 candles (usually white) that light up for Easter.  The number 33 symbolizes the age of Jesus Christ. </p><p>  If we talk about what <span>Jerusalem candles</span> are made of <span>,</span> then traditionally they are also made of wax.  However, paraffin versions are also found today.  The main feature of such products is that they create almost a torch.  This can not be called surprising, because at the same time 33 candles are lit immediately. </p><p>  Having become acquainted with the main varieties of such lighting elements, you should go to the most interesting.  Everyone will be interested to know what to make candles with their own hands.  First of all, it is worthwhile to figure out the optimal composition. </p><h2>  Features of the base of the candle </h2><p>  Before you start the independent manufacture of these interesting elements, it is worth a little more to learn about what is included in a modern candle.  As a rule, technology remains unchanged.  In stores, most often there are products that contain paraffin, stearin and bee or any other natural wax. </p><p>  However, you can go a more traditional way and get only wax. </p><p>  If we talk about what it is possible to make a <span>wick for candles from,</span> then traditionally it was made of cotton or linen.  The latter option is preferable, as it has better burning.  The most important thing is that the wick is properly woven.  To do this, the material is laid in a special direction and placed so that its end is constantly in the flame zone.  This allows you to achieve a high level of combustion.  Also today, you can meet models of candles, in which there are wicks with a wire core.  In this case, the glow will be brighter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="madnotions.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Long wick" class="if uuid-3040858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3040858.jpg"></div><p>  But if you consider what to make a wick for a wax candle from, then the easiest way to do this is to buy a thick thread, cord or twine made of natural material.  It can be purchased at any hardware store.  The main thing is to make sure that the thread is 100% cotton or linen.  Synthetics are completely unsuitable in this case.  In order not to be mistaken, you can look into the fabric store and buy an ordinary white floss. </p><p>  Knowing what to make a wick for a candle from, you can move on to the most interesting - to direct manufacture. </p><h2>  How to make a candle with your own hands </h2><p>  This is a very interesting process that can captivate the whole family.  In order to make candles at home, it is necessary to prepare: </p><ul><li>  Material for the base.  Used wax (if desired, you can add a little paraffin and stearin).  Some just buy cheap household candles and grate them to get a blank. </li><li>  The thread to be used for the wick. </li><li>  The pan and the second metal bowl are slightly smaller.  These items will be required for a water bath on which wax will melt. </li><li>  Wooden sticks or ordinary pencils.  They will be required to fix the wick. </li></ul><p>  Separately, it is worth saying a few words about how to make forms for candles.  In fact, it can be any containers whose size is selected depending on the size of the candle you want to receive.  For this, tin or plastic molds are usually used.  But many prefer glass, since wax sticks off it better.  In addition, you can not be tormented with giving the desired shape and immediately pour the wax into a transparent cup.  After the candle solidifies, this element will be a candlestick.  However, if you want to create products in the shape of a star or other object, then you can go the hard way.  To do this, you can purchase blanks (preferably silicone), in which the liquid mass will be poured. </p><p>  Speaking about how and from what to make candles with your own hands, it is worth paying attention to the fact that the wax hardens quite quickly.  Before you start melting it, you need to be sure that everything you need is prepared, since it takes no more than 15 minutes to work with hot material. </p><h2>  Manufacturing sequence </h2><p>  Knowing what to make candles from, it remains only to prepare them correctly.  To do this, you must: </p><ul><li>  Lubricate each form with a small amount of vegetable oil.  This is necessary so that the finished candle is easily removed from it.  If after curing it remains in the cup, then this step is not necessary. </li><li>  Place the prepared wicks in the molds (some previously wipe them with dry wax so that they harden a little) and tie their upper ends on the prepared sticks or pencils.  These elements are laid on the edge of the container and help to place the thread exactly in the center. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="blog.mountainroseherbs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pencil and thread" class="if uuid-3040870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3040870.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Pour the pan with water and put on fire.  It is necessary to lower another container into which wax is placed.  It needs to be melted in a water bath over low heat, stirring constantly.  The result should be a homogeneous mass in which there are no lumps. </li><li>  Pour a small amount of molten wax into the mold bottom.  This is necessary in order to securely fix the lower tip of the wick.  If necessary, at this stage, you can easily adjust its position. </li><li>  Wait for a while until a small amount of wax grabs and fixes the wick. </li><li>  Pour the remaining wax into molds.  You need to work extremely carefully.  If hot wax gets on your skin, you can get a very severe burn.  Therefore, when making candles for the first time, it is better to work with a partner or use protective gloves. </li><li>  Leave the candle to harden in a cool place.  Some put blanks in the refrigerator, but this is not always a good idea.  In this case, there is a risk that as soon as the candle hardens, it will immediately crack due to too much cold. </li></ul><p>  The resulting products can be used for their intended purpose, but not earlier than in a day.  However, the waiting time can be increased if larger models are manufactured. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.varunaweb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Candle filling" class="if uuid-3040882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3040882.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a gel candle </h2><p>  Such products look very impressive, so many people think that making them at home is almost impossible.  But this is not so.  Manufacturing technology is practically no different from that described above.  All the difference will be only in the source material.  In this case, not wax but gel will be used.  Best transparent.  However, in this case, not any gel is suitable, but a candle.  You can cook it yourself without any problems. </p><p>  To do this, take two tablespoons of gelatin and glycerin.  They are added to a glass of cold water and dissolved in it within an hour.  During this time, the gel will swell, and it will be possible to work with it.  The main thing is that the container for cooking is clean, otherwise the mixture may become cloudy. </p><p>  After that, the procedure is the same.  Wicks are installed in the molds, the molten gel is poured.  The glass cup before this is also worth a little warm up.  Then, no bubbles form in the gel due to the temperature difference.  The advantage of working with such a composition is that it allows you to create the most amazing products.  For example, a shell, beads or colored stones can be placed in a gel.  Some thus create entire compositions.  There are also those who lay pieces of fruit in such candles.  They solidify with the gel and change.  The main thing is to remember that if you stack the elements before pouring the gel, they will remain at the bottom of the form.  Therefore, it is better to consistently fill the base, while adding decorative elements. </p><p>  It is also worth using only a transparent form for gel candles.  Otherwise, the effect will not work.  It is also important to ensure that before pouring on the glass from the inside there are no dust particles or hairs.  They can solidify with the gel and ruin the look of the finished product. </p><p>  If necessary, dye formulations can also be added to the gel.  However, in this case, the mass will lose its transparency.  But in some cases, and it looks very impressive. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  If you know what to make a wick for a candle and a base, it will not be completely difficult to independently produce such interesting decor items.  If desired, food colors and flavors can be added to the wax.  In this case, you get a very bright and unusual candle with a unique design.  For example, some make striped candles.  In this case, each poured layer should be prepared separately with the addition of dyes of different colors.  This is a very simple technique that even a beginner can handle.  In all other respects, one can show one‚Äôs imagination.  You can even sell finished crafts and organize your own small business. </p>
