  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jacobin dictatorship</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the summer of 1793, the <span>revolution in France</span> entered its highest phase.  The most radical politicians came to power, whose rule went down in history as the Jacobin dictatorship.  They lasted only a year, but during this time they could do a lot. </p><p>  <strong>The rise to power and the fight against speculation</strong> </p><p>  On May 31, an uprising of the poor broke out in Paris.  He was led by representatives of the most radical political group in the Convention - the Jacobins.  They were supported by urban and rural lower classes, representatives of the petty bourgeoisie.  <span>Artillery pieces</span> rolled up to the building of the French parliament <span>,</span> at the sight of which on June 2 the deputies decided to arrest the Girondins - political opponents of the Jacobins.  So a new political regime was established in the country. </p><p>  The Jacobins held on for about a year.  During this period, many changes have taken place in France.  The situation both inside and outside the country was such that it seemed that the revolution was about to be suppressed.  The armies of European states stood at the French borders: in the north - Austrians and Prussians, in the south - Spaniards, and the English fleet cruised off the coast.  In the province of Vend√©e, a peasant uprising led by emigre nobles raged.  The country's economic situation has worsened: food prices have risen, speculation flourished.  In such circumstances, emergency measures were required, and the Convention, under pressure from the Jacobins, did so.  In September, under the influence of the grain shortage, a law was passed on setting maximum prices for the most important goods.  For his violation relied on the death penalty. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Reforms of the Jacobins</strong> </p><p>  In October 1793, the French constitution was adopted, which was the most progressive in its time.  She introduced universal <span>suffrage</span> for men over 21 years of age, gave equal rights to those who vote and those for whom they vote.  Laws were adopted by the Legislative Corps and entered into force only after their approval by the people.  But in reality, the French constitution of 1793 did not begin to operate.  In wartime conditions, the Jacobins led the country with the help of emergency orders - decrees that had the force of law.  This is how the Jacobin dictatorship developed - a system of power in which the parliament was put on the back burner, and the real power belonged to the executive bodies - committees. </p><p>  The main pillar of the revolution was the peasantry, so the new government resolutely carried out reforms in the agricultural sector.  Already in June 1793, communal lands were transferred to peasants, all <span>feudal duties were</span> liquidated, and the documents testifying to them were to be destroyed.  Lands belonging to nobles and clergy were confiscated.  Now the peasants have become full owners of their land.  Although the Jacobin dictatorship did not go further than this on the agrarian question, these laws alone provided them with the support of the peasants, who willingly defended the revolution with arms in their hands. </p><p>  A lot has been done in the army.  In the officer posts were those who proved himself in practice, but did not have a noble birth.  In place of the old officers came youth from the people.  It was at this time that Napoleon Bonaparte began his career, showing his managerial abilities when taking Toulon.  The Jacobins managed to pacify the revolt in the Vendee.  External enemies were also repulsed.  In June 1794, the revolutionary army defeated the Austrians at Fleurus, securing the French borders. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>Terror and the fall</strong> </p><p>  At the same time, the Jacobin dictatorship had its negative consequences.  The leader of the revolutionary government Maximilian Robespierre and his supporters were not shy about their means, cracking down on their opponents.  Terror against the Girondins and supporters of the monarchy was carried out on completely legitimate grounds.  Already in September 1793, a decree appeared permitting the arrest of all suspicious persons.  But the terror reached its greatest scope in June 1794. The <span>decree</span> adopted at that <span>time</span> introduced a new concept - the ‚Äúenemy of the people‚Äù, which then will gain new life in the Soviet Union.  The document did not give a clear definition of whom to regard as enemies, but it established a punishment for them - the death penalty.  Judicial proceedings turned into complete absurdity: a jury verdict was enough to accuse a person.  Subordinates could not even dream of any lawyers.  So the Jacobins provoked a wave of terror that affected thousands of people. </p><p>  Mass arrests, contrary to the expectations of the authorities, did not protect it from opponents, but only accelerated the fall of the dictatorship.  The most prosperous strata that became rich during the revolution were dissatisfied with the new orders and tolerated them, until the danger of intervention had passed.  The poor, who had recently brought the Jacobins to power, were also outraged by terror and dissatisfied with their indecisive policies - the laws on price restrictions were in every way violated, the lands confiscated from the enemies of the revolution were not distributed among the poor.  The final of the Jacobin dictatorship was a coup d'etat on July 27, 1794, when their opponents in the Convention approved the decision to arrest and <span>execute Robespierre</span> and his supporters.  Soon it was completed, and representatives of the big bourgeoisie came to power. </p><p>  Many of the reforms of the Jacobins were canceled, and in 1795 a new government came to power - the Directory.  A new political regime was established in France, reflecting the interests of those who made their fortunes during the revolution. </p>
