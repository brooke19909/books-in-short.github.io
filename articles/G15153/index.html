How is it different from other resorts?  Despite the small size of the city, there is no need to think about where to go.  In Gelendzhik at any time of the year there is something to have fun. </p><h3>  Summer Gelendzhik </h3><p>  Of course, the main summer attraction is the sea.  Between the Thin and Tolstoy capes is a beautiful, clean bay with a magnificent bottom.  It is no coincidence that novice divers practice here.  The bay pleases holidaymakers with crystal clear water, well-equipped beaches.  Tired of swimming in the sea?  Wondering how to diversify swimming?  Where to go?  In Gelendzhik as many as three water parks.  In the little "Dolphin" there are only 8 slides, several pools. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go in gelendzhik" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/307029.jpg" width="600"></div>  In ‚ÄúHippo‚Äù there are only three pools, but each area is more than a kilometer.  There are 17 <span>slides, children's</span> attractions, cafes.  The number of water attractions in the "Golden Bay" is difficult to calculate.  Here you can spend the whole day, and never ride twice on the same hill.  According to 2010 results, this water park is recognized as the largest in Russia.  Where to go in Gelendzhik in the summer?  You can simply walk along the snow-white promenade, admire the beautiful sea views.  Go to the park or visit the unique, the only Alley of Civilizations in Russia.  Here are collected ancient cultural monuments from around the world.  Of course, these are only copies made by the local architect Alekseev.  But this does not stop tourists who have inspected all the greatest buildings of all eras in an hour to get great pleasure.  There is also Vrungel Park.  Unfortunately, it does not work every day, but it delights lovers of cool extreme sensations.  Where to go in Gelendzhik?  2013 showed that tourists do not have to be bored here.  You can go with your whole family to Olympus Park or to the near and far dolmens, take a walk to nearby Kabardinka to spend time in the Old Park or just breathe in the air of the mountain slopes.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3>  Gelendzhik all year round </h3><p>  This small town is one of the few resorts where even in winter you do not have to think about where to go.  In Gelendzhik at any time of the year work: </p><ul><li>  The Wax Museum. </li><li>  Oceanarium.  Still very young, he leaves a strong impression.  Especially children like traveling along the ocean waves. </li><li>  Dolphinarium.  The program in it is quite standard, but there is one undeniable advantage: it is closed, so in extreme heat (and it is not uncommon here) and in bad weather, visitors feel very comfortable. </li></ul><h3>  Safari Park <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go in gelendzhik 2013" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/307031.jpg" width="600"></div></h3><p>  The brightest and most unforgettable place of Gelendzhik is Safari Park.  Anyone who has ever visited it or just looked through <span>brochures</span> does not think about where to go to Gelendzhik. </p><p>  The Safari Park has everything: almost tame animals in spacious enclosures, caves, a <span>cable car</span> (one of the longest), dolmen, <span>restaurants, cafes,</span> playgrounds with ‚Äúreal‚Äù dinosaurs ... To go around 156 hectares, of course, one day that's enough. </p><h3>  Evening gelendzhik <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik where to go in the evening" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/307043.jpg" width="600"></div></h3><p>  Where to go in the evening?  There are so many cafes and restaurants in the city that you have to think not about where to go, but about which one to choose.  Disco bars and clubs, a colorful Ukrainian courtyard with a hostess Solokha, a Bear with a huge selection of beers, an exquisite and expensive Panorama, a democratic but elegant Maestro coffee house ... Gelendzhik is worth spending at least a week in it. </p>
