Craftsmen using various techniques for creativity are constantly in search of new ideas.  Therefore, they have long been aware of the main methods of using crepe paper: to create flowers, bouquets of sweets and huge fluffy balls.  Some craftswomen make jewelry and paintings using this material, but still, the technique for making interior gizmos is based primarily on the assembly of flowers.  It is from buds that compositions for bouquets and accessories are made. </p><h2>  Leah Griffith: paper dress designer </h2><p>  But few people know that you can make a dress out of corrugated paper.  Some foreign designers use this material to create real masterpieces and demonstrate them at fashion shows.  For example, the world-famous fashion designer, stylist and photographer Leah Griffith has created a collection of dresses made of corrugated paper, a master class for the manufacture of which she shows in her blog. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper dress" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1856923.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Creating women's dresses from paper </h2><p>  Crepe paper is a very pliable, delicate and versatile material that holds its shape well and gives products a sense of lightness.  For a dress with a full skirt, you need to prepare a lot of details similar to flower petals.  They can be made in completely different shapes, extended, twisted and bent.  Elements are attached with a glue gun to a fabric corset.  Of course, you must first come up with a model and develop a sketch.  Then patterns are made, as for a regular dress, and the product is assembled according to them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a dress from corrugated paper" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1856922.jpg" width="360"></div>

Crepe paper is also useful here.  As a workpiece, you can use the usual combination or sew the frame yourself.  From corrugated paper we make large petals, stretching them to the sides to give a curved shape.  A fluffy skirt will need approximately 70 pieces.  We attach rows of petals with a stapler or glue gun.  For the upper part of the dress, we make roses or other flowers and glue them.  The number of buds depends on the size of the product. </p><h2>  Dress for the doll </h2><p>  If this option seems too complicated, but you want to try the technique, you can make a dress of corrugated paper with your own hands for a Barbie doll or a similar toy.  Often these figures have problems with the lower body, for example, their legs are lost.  Do not rush to throw such a toy.  It can be used to create a birthday present or as an unusual piece of furniture in a children's room.  You can also attract a child to create the outfit: any girl will be interested in making a dress from corrugated paper with her own hands for her own doll.  Such an experience will help children develop creative thinking, determination and perseverance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper dress for girls" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1857075.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  DIY doll dresses </h2><p>  The lower part of the body will be covered with a cone made of thick cardboard or foam, on which the figure is fixed with glue.  Due to him, the doll will be fixed in an upright position even without legs.  In this master class, you will learn how to make a dress from corrugated paper for a doll in one of the simplest and at the same time having many options, techniques: from paper flowers.  The material allows you to create beautiful elements without much difficulty.  Petals can not even be cut, but simply twisted from a long strip, forming a bud. </p><p>  You can make flowers resembling roses by folding the paper several times and cutting out the same circles from it: just fasten the blanks in the center with a stapler, spread the petals and the rose is ready!  Some masters do not even fasten the parts, but simply tuck the layers into each other, getting a neat bud.  If you want to work hard and create a real masterpiece, you should look for patterns of different types of flowers, for example, roses or poppies, and collect them from individual elements.  For a gift, from a doll you can make a bouquet of chocolates.  It’s better to take the whole figure for this, so that the girl, having tasted the sweet, could then play with the new “girlfriend”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper dress master class" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1856925.jpg" width="348"></div>

    <h2>  Making doll dresses: a master class </h2><p>  How to make a dress from corrugated paper?  As an example, take a simple option.  For work, we need: </p><ul><li>  several rolls of multi-colored paper, </li><li>  a piece of cardboard or foam for the base, </li><li>  masking tape </li><li>  scissors, </li><li>  glue gun </li><li>  decorative elements for dress decoration: beads, lace, ribbons, </li><li>  thin wire. </li></ul><p>  If the doll is without legs, the lower part of the skirt can be covered with a circle cut out of an opaque plastic cover.  A dress made of corrugated paper is assembled as follows: </p><ol><li>  We make a cardboard cone, fixing the edges with <span>masking tape</span> so that there is enough opening for the doll on top. </li><li>  Cut the blanks for the upper and lower parts of the dress. </li><li>  We place the doll inside the workpiece and fix it in place with tape. </li><li>  We fix the bodice.  Wrap the skirt blank with a sheet of paper.  Decorative elements will be mounted on it. </li><li>  Stretching the paper on the bottom of the skirt, we make “waves”. </li><li>  We make out of paper in tone roses or other flowers, at our discretion. </li><li>  Glue the blanks to the dress in random order. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper skirt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/1857780.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  A simple example of creating a dress for a doll </h2><p>  You can do even easier and make a skirt of corrugated paper from blanks that will be just folded rectangular pieces.  They are made on the principle of origami and can be of different colors, but of the same shape.  First you need to make a lot of such modules, and then assemble it on a doll by gluing it to the frame. </p><p>  It is done like this: </p><ol><li>  A rectangular blank of paper is folded in half along the long side. </li><li>  Then cut in half on the short side. </li><li>  The resulting square is revealed, and the upper corners are bent to the center, as on a paper airplane. </li><li>  The edges of the lower corners are bent up. </li><li>  The horizontal bottom bends upward. </li><li>  The resulting triangle folds in half. </li></ol><p>  Using these blanks, you can transform the shape of the product by changing the number of elements in each next row.  A dress made of corrugated paper, made in this technique, is fixed on the doll using an adhesive <span>gun.</span>  <span>It is</span> better not to use PVA glue for this purpose, since the paper gets wet from it and can tear. </p><p>  Choose a suitable option for yourself and start creating! </p>
