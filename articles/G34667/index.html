    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, who arrived at the hotel in the afternoon, they had no problems with checking in.  Of course, this does not apply to situations when several dozen new guests called at the hotel at the same time.  In this case, tourists had to wait a little while the administrators resettle all the new arrivals. </p>

    <p>  As for those travelers who flew to Hurghada in the morning flights, in most cases they had to wait two in the afternoon to enter the room.  The fact is that, thanks to a rather attractive price for accommodation in this hotel, it is almost always completely filled.  Therefore, new tenants have to wait until the previous tenants have vacated the room intended for them.  However, such a need did not become a serious problem for most of our compatriots.  After all, they did not need to sit in the lobby for several hours.  So, you can go to a restaurant for breakfast or lunch, swim in the pool or go straight to the beach. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This question always causes a lot of discussion among the guests.  And this applies not only to the Montillon Grand Horizon Resort 4 * (Hurghada, Egypt), but also to other hotels of various categories from different countries.  As for the hotel complex we are considering, the majority of tourists agree that the food here is organized at a very decent level.  Of course, one does not have to rely on delicacies here, as in expensive five-star hotels, however, each guest has the opportunity to eat tasty and varied.  True, some guests complained that cooks in some cases overdo it with seasonings, which makes the taste of dishes unusual for our compatriots.  However, experienced tourists note that this is a feature of most hotels in Egypt.  But still, you should not worry, since the menu always has dishes prepared without spices.  In a word, nobody will remain hungry here. </p><p>  In addition to the main buffet restaurant, many tourists enjoyed snacking at the beach snack bar during the day.  So, some tourists did not even return from the shore for lunch, content with pizza, hamburgers, french fries and other fast food. </p><h2>  Contingent </h2><p>  As the hotel guests note, mainly tourists from Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union rest here.  In this regard, some travelers appeal to our compatriots with a request to treat both the staff and other guests more respectfully.  For example, a number of tourists expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the guests in the restaurant created long lines because they tried to put as much food on their plates as possible.  And this despite the fact that in the end they did not eat half.  In addition, some tourists were ashamed of compatriots who were rude to service staff.  In addition, travelers appeal to all vacationers with a request not to take loungers on the beach early in the morning, if you are not sure that you plan to go to the sea during the day.  Indeed, because of this, many tourists do not get sun loungers, and they are forced to sit directly on the sand, although there are empty sunbeds that were previously occupied by other guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="montillon grand horizon resort 4 pics" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1004802.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  If you are counting on an excellent beach holiday, then the Montillon Grand Horizon Resort 4 * hotel, according to our compatriots, is quite capable of meeting your expectations.  So, as guests note, from the main building to the sea you can walk in just five minutes.  And some residential buildings are located almost on the shore.  The beach of the hotel complex itself is quite large, sandy, very clean.  Many were surprised to see here separate garbage containers for plastic, glass, etc. The travelers considered the fact that the beach is divided into two parts a big plus.  So, on one side of the pier, the entry into the water is gentle, sandy.  Here, as a rule, families with small children relax.  On the other side of the pier at the bottom are stones and corals.  Here, amateurs spend time with pleasure to watch the life of marine life and swim with a mask.  Many tourists in the reviews note the fact that rescuers are always on duty at the pier, who carefully monitor the swimmers and react if necessary. </p><p>  As for the sun loungers and parasols, then, according to vacationers, they are in good condition, very comfortable.  There are many loungers here, but due to the fact that many guests try to occupy them early in the morning, as noted above, other tourists may not be enough. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  A pleasant time, according to our compatriots, is also possible on the territory of the Montillon Grand Horizon Resort hotel complex.  So, here are equipped with large and clean pools.  One of them has water slides.  There are sunbeds with sunbeds nearby.  By the way, there are always plenty of sun loungers here.  Also nearby is a bar with a wide selection of drinks for every taste. </p><p>  From 10 a.m. until late in the evening, animators work at the hotel.  They try to diversify the leisure of both adult guests and children.  So, tourists are invited to work out with gymnastics, water aerobics, learn dancing movements, play water polo, volleyball, darts, etc. In the evenings, entertainment shows are held.  And then, accompanied by animators, you can go to a disco in the city. </p><p>  For children, the hotel has a mini club.  According to family travelers, their children enjoyed visiting him.  In the evenings, for the smallest, a mini-disco is held and cartoons are organized. </p>
