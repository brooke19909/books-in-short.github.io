The main purpose of the state bodies regulating the work of these companies is to create optimal conditions for the development of this industry.  This can be done only if the legislation will not hamper the work of developers.  For this purpose, major changes were made to it, as a result of which the building license lost its original strength. </p><p>  Therefore, the question of whether a license for construction work is needed is one of the most relevant today.  It is not difficult to issue it, the most important thing is to collect the necessary package of documents, and then write an application for receipt. </p><h2>  general information </h2>

However, this approach has many disadvantages, as it creates a large number of difficulties for the business.

    <p>  Therefore, the legislation was revised, and the issuance of licenses and quality control of work was transferred to the SRO.  Thus, any construction company operating in Russia must buy a construction license from the SRO and obtain permits for all types of work that it plans to carry out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  License Definition </h2><p>  A license for construction work is a document granting the right to perform construction and other types of work related to design.

In addition to the license, it is also necessary to obtain permits for the types of work that the company will perform.

    <p>  Today, SRO is engaged in issuing licenses and regulating the activities of developers.  However, in order to obtain permits, the developer must first become a member.  It is important to understand that, in addition to the main activity, insurance companies also perform various types of work, which also requires permission. </p><p>  If any company whose activities are not commercial, you need to obtain permission for construction or other works, then it is issued a limited license for construction and installation works. </p><h2>  Varieties of building licenses </h2>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A license for construction work is a <span>permitting document,</span> without which the activity of a construction company is impossible.  However, getting it is only half the battle, because SRO can always deprive her of an unscrupulous company for violations and poor quality work.  Therefore, after obtaining a license, always adhere to high standards and comply with the requirements put forward by the SRO. </p>
