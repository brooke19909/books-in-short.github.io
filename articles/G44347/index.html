    <p>  Why was the Kazan station in Moscow so named?  And all because the 73-meter tower crowning it is stylized as the Tatar tower of Princess Syuyumbike, which is located in the Kremlin of the city of Kazan, and the dragon Zilant, depicted on the coat of arms of the Kazan kingdom, also proudly sits on its spire.  The winged serpent is a symbol of Kazan. </p><p>  Prominent artists such as Benoit, Kustodiev, Serebryakova and many others were painting the halls.  So, in the main lobby and at present you can see the work of the famous Roerich, which depicts the Battle of Kerzhen with the Tatars and the further conquest of Kazan. </p><p>  In the following years of the 20th century, the station was reconstructed more than once: new halls and restaurants were built, a large-span glazed ceiling was erected over the railway lines.  An underground tunnel built under <span>Komsomolskaya Square</span> connected three nearby stations and became the longest in length in the capital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Station Clock </h2><p>  Of course, the <span>Kazan Railway Station</span> in Moscow is also famous for its tower clock.  From the beginning of the construction of the entire structure, Shchusev insisted on installing a clock with shock fighting, he also completed the drawings of the zodiac signs himself, later bronze blanks were cast on them in St. Petersburg.  For many decades, the watch was reconstructed more than once: the bell was removed as unnecessary, in 1996 the correct operation of the hands was adjusted, the zodiac signs were updated, covered with paint, and the blue dial was repaired by industrial climbers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Scheme of the Kazan station in Moscow" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20675/452718.jpg" width="331"></div>
