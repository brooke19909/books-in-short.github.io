What is</span> it?"  - may ask those who have never heard such a name.  The word Celtic is translated as “stone table”.  Dolmens (photographs clearly demonstrate this) are structures made of processed stone slabs used for religious purposes.  They, especially those built in western Europe, really look like tables.  The age of such structures exceeds the <span>age of the pyramids.</span>  So, in the areas where they were erected, people </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="l dolmen what is it" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11516/208987.jpg" width="594"></div>  already at that time were at a relatively high level of development.  Who doubts, can conduct an experiment and build his own dolmen.  That it is impossible to fulfill, it becomes clear immediately.  After all, you need to take a stone slab weighing five hundred kilograms, grind it and make a perfectly smooth round hole in the middle.  Keep in mind that all this must be done without modern appliances, but only with your hands!  Although, of course, we cannot say for sure what technologies were known to the builders of these historical monuments.

    <p>  The first structures of this type were found in Brittany, one of the French provinces, they began to study.  Find them in other places.  In our country, dolmens are known in Gelendzhik of the Krasnodar Territory, as well as Crimean dolmens.  Their distinctive <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dolmens in Gelendzhik" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11516/208977.jpg" width="600"></div>  the line is a perfectly flat round hole made in one of the plates.  Therefore, they decided that their representatives were built by one people.  Presumably, people moved from west to east, because the quality and level of work at the Caucasian historical monuments is much higher than that of the Western European: therefore, the construction technique improved with time.

What is its practical purpose?"  The assumption that the representatives of the ancient people simply decided to leave a memory of themselves only from aesthetic motives is untenable.  Our ancestors were too practical.  Therefore, these structures had a specific practical purpose.  But what, no one can reliably say so far.  There are two versions: this is a religious building for sacrifices, and possibly a space that transformed and generated the energy flows of the human body.  Simply put, dolmens were used to cure ailments. </p>

    <p>  Some researchers claim that they were a kind of infirmaries for wounded soldiers.  It is hard to believe in this, since it is impossible to build such a massive structure in field conditions, unless it is assumed that its creators possessed some mysterious super-powerful technologies. </p><p>  What role does the dolmen play now?  What is it from the point of view of modern man?  Their locations are quite popular with tourists.  People travel to not only look and touch history, but also with the secret hope that the dolmen can heal their ailments and even change their fate.  It is hard to say how true this is.  Some holy believe in the magical properties of dolmens, others are skeptical grin.  But one thing is for sure: these are monuments of antiquity, and you need to visit them in order to touch history and once again be surprised at the greatness of the human spirit that can move mountains, work them out and stack them on top of each other.  Moreover, dolmens are located in fabulously beautiful places. </p>
