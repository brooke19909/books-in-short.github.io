    <p>  But the most attractive place for tourists has always been and will be the banks of the Volga River, next to which the city lies.  However, clean air, picturesque river banks, a mixture of modernity and hoary antiquity are the sights of the Volgograd region, which can be found not only in the Volga, but also in all other cities and villages of the region. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kamyshin: a working city and its attractions </h2><p>  The third largest in the region, Kamyshin stands in a picturesque area, on the banks of the Kamyshinka River.  Citizens say that the main attractions of Kamyshin of the Volgograd region are its plants and factories.  Developed industry sets the pace of urban life.  But the reed workers are not averse to rest after a working day.  The favorite place of city dwellers and tourists is the <span>Alexander Park, the</span> construction of which began back in 1900.  The city museum is famous and attractive for guests of Kamyshin.  In it you can find expositions devoted to the history of the city from the day of foundation to the present day.  There are also exhibits related to the life of the writer Mikhail Sholokhov, who at one time lived in the city and even began work on the novel "They Fought for the Homeland".  Moreover, Sholokhov is not the only famous person whose life was somehow connected with the city.  For example, the sculptures of the famous master Volkonsky, who lived in Kamyshin for 30 years, adorn Alexander Park.  This park and museum of local lore are the sights of the Volgograd region, which, of course, are worth a visit to all guests of Kamyshin. </p>

    <p>  A vivid example of this is the little Olkhovka, founded by the Don Cossacks in the eighteenth century.  Each tourist who comes to these parts seeks not only to admire the beauty of Russian land, but also plans to visit such sights of the Volgograd region as the Holy Mountain Barrow, located in the north-west of Olkhovka.  At the foot of the mound there is a spring with crystal clear water.  Legend has it that Alexander Nevsky himself quenched his thirst.  Kamenno-Brodsky Holy Trinity Monastery is an equally famous and popular place among pilgrims in the Olkhovsky district.  The ancient monastery complex is surrounded on all sides by <span>chalk mountains,</span> pitted with many caves.  The monastery is famous for its healing springs, beating from the bowels of the earth.  Until now, researchers have found new caves and passages that keep secrets of ancient times.  It was established that in these underground caches local residents were hiding even during the time of the Batu invasion.  The territory of the monastery is planted with giant oaks, among which there are 300-400-year-old elders. </p>
