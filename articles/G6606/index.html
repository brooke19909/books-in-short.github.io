This expression is more suitable than ever in our case.  Now, when it would seem that the courtyard is the twenty-first century, the girls still continue to weave various bracelets, coming up with new styles and designs for them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="schemes of candy baubles" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/1969819.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <p>  Fenichka was always a <span>friendship bracelet</span> and was given only to close people.  Its color, patterns and forms usually carried special meanings, and this is how new types of bracelets were created. </p><h2>  Confectionery decoration </h2><p>  One of the varieties of friendship bracelets is a bauble candy.  It is easy to distinguish it from the rest of the bright mass of needlework braids.  It has a special shape of a sequence of rhombuses, which makes it even more interesting and original than rectangular bracelets.  This form and awarded it with a sweet name, as bright threads woven into a composition with a bizarre shape, become similar to a string of caramels. </p><p>  Despite the peculiarity of the form, schemes of baubles-sweets do not differ in particular complexity.  This makes their manufacture affordable even for beginners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Schemes of candy baubles </h2><p>  To begin with, there are several types of baubles of this type: ordinary sweetie, British bauble and double sweetie.  The first type is basic and necessary for study in order to subsequently reproduce more complex instances. </p><p>  In order to weave such a bracelet, we need: </p><ul><li>  Thread floss.  Since weaving is based on symmetrical rhombuses, we will need 16 threads, the color you choose yourself.  The length of the thread is 1 meter. </li><li>  Scotch.  It is necessary for attaching threads during weaving. </li><li>  Schemes of baubles-sweets.  The choice of the scheme is based only on your personal preference, so if the scheme given here does not suit you, then you can safely replace it with another. </li></ul>

    <p>  Preparation for the weaving process does not require much effort.  First you need to fix all the threads on a solid surface, placing them evenly among themselves. </p><p>  As can be seen from the diagram, bracelets are woven from an even number of threads.  In our case, 8 threads of red and white floss are taken, they are located on two sides. </p><p>  Now let's start weaving itself.  Take the leftmost thread and make a knot to the right, capturing the next seven threads of white color.  Then we will do a similar action, but with the right thread to the left, on red strands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As you can see, all the steps coincide with the direction of the arrows in the diagram, which greatly facilitates the process of explanation.  We just need to follow the directions in the drawing, changing the course of action depending on where you want to loop to the right and where to the left. </p><p>  Next, according to the pattern of the baubles-candy patterns, we start a new row, knit the threads, start a new row again, and so on, until your bracelet acquires the length you need or until the mouline thread ends. </p>

    <h2>  Sweet british </h2><p>  The next type of baubles, sweets - British.  It has the same shape, but differs in a pattern known all over, resembling the flag of Great Britain.  It is based on all the same directional nodules that we used earlier.  To make a bracelet we need: </p><ul><li>  Thread floss.  This time you need to use a clearly indicated number of specific colors: 10 white, 6 blue and 4 red threads.  The length remains unchanged - 1 meter. </li><li>  Adhesive tape or duct tape. </li><li>  Scheme baubles-candy British. </li></ul><p>  Now that everything is ready to begin, you can carefully consider the scheme.  As you can see, all the threads are arranged symmetrically to each other, because without their necessary location the pattern will not work.  We begin weaving again with the leftmost thread, covering it with the next 9 strands, and then weaving according to the pattern, relying on the upper left side of the rhombus. </p><p>  When the side is completely braided, you can go to the mirror to her, the right side of the bracelet. </p><p>  After, guided by the scheme, we begin to weave the next row of British women.  It is most convenient to do this with the so-called diagonals, weaving them one after another.  It should also be recalled that throughout the weaving, you need to monitor the strength of the tension of the threads so that the pattern looks uniform and accurate. </p><h2>  Double Happiness </h2><p>  Now that we have had a good time practicing weaving ordinary candy bracelets, we can make the bauble more difficult.  The technique of weaving such a bracelet is no different from the usual one, since the ‚ÄúDouble Sweetie‚Äù bauble pattern is the usual bauble pattern.  The main difference between them is the number of floss threads used in weaving. </p>

    <p>  And as you might guess, we will need them twice as much.  Other accessories remain the same: </p><ul><li>  Thread floss.  If the scheme of a regular candy is designed for 16 threads, now you need to take 32 threads of a mouline thread, where the length of each segment is 1 meter. </li><li>  Adhesive tape or <span>duct tape.</span>  Some prefer stationery clips that attach to thick covers of books and notebooks. </li><li>  Patterns of weaving baubles-sweets. </li></ul><p>  These bracelets are woven according to the same principle, but taking into account the following rows. </p><p>  For example, if we split all the threads in half and twisted a candy from each half, the last, so-called strapping row of loops, needs to be done only from the edges, allowing the remaining threads to form a new candy.  We weave it in the same way as the two previous ones.  Then again we form two new candies and so on. </p><p>  We complete the product by carefully weaving the rest of the threads into pigtails and proudly presenting baubles to friends and relatives. </p>
