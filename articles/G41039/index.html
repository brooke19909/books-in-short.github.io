    <p>  In the hotel "Arcadia" (Sochi), one of the favorite places for vacationers is an outdoor pool.  Children are happy to splash around in it, and their parents are relaxing on a deck chair with a glass of wine. </p><p>  The hotel has a 24-hour guarded parking lot, a laundry service and a left-luggage office. </p><p>  Hotel "Arcadia" (Sochi), although located in a quiet village, but it has everything you need.  Within walking distance are shops, a market, several pretty cafes, souvenir shops, tour agencies, a football field, tennis courts and volleyball courts. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to the Hotel Arcadia in the Anchor Slit, you can use the shuttle service organized by the hotel for a fee. </p><p>  If you flew to Sochi by plane to <span>Adler Airport,</span> then you need to take a bus or minibus at number 105 and get to the bus station in Sochi. </p><p>  From the bus station or from the railway station of the city of Sochi there is a bus number 155, which goes to the village of Yakornaya Shchel. </p><p>  You can also get on the train, in the village there is a railway station. </p><p>  Address of the Arcadia Hotel: Russia, Sochi, Lazarevsky District, Yakornaya Shchel settlement, Main Street, 73v. </p><h2>  Hotel "Arcadia", Sochi: reviews of vacationers </h2><p>  Reviews and reviews of hotel guests are the best way to tell us about all the advantages and disadvantages of this place of rest. </p><p>  There are a lot of opinions about the Arcadia hotel on the forums, which undoubtedly pleases, as it follows that the hotel is popular. </p><p>  The very location of the hotel and the village cause conflicting comments.  Tourists who had an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village and its surroundings, admire the silence and peace.  Other vacationers write that in the Anchor Slit there is absolutely nowhere to go, the village is boring and uninteresting. </p><p>  Fans of a relaxing holiday, as expected, were satisfied with the situation in the village.  There is everything necessary for holidaymakers: shops are close, the market is full of fresh fruits, numerous souvenirs, sellers of excursions and several cozy cafes. </p><p>  The territory of the hotel itself did not satisfy all visitors.  Many expected something more.  According to hotel guests, the territory is very small. </p><p>  The rooms do not cause any particular complaints, but the unanimous opinion of almost all vacationers is that there is no refrigerator in the room.  Its presence on the floor causes outrage. </p><p>  Reviews about the children's room are not good.  Advertising indicates the presence of games and entertainment, but in fact, in addition to children's drawings, there is practically nothing in it. </p><p>  The beach of the village is also not to everyone's liking.  The promised beach infrastructure did not meet the expectations of many tourists, but a huge amount of free places is an undoubted plus. </p>
