That is why this discipline has so many sections.  However, one of the youngest, but promising and of particular importance today is genetics.  It was born later than the others, but managed to become the most relevant, important and voluminous science, which has its own goals, objectives and object of study.  Consider what the history of the development of genetics is and what this branch of biology represents. </p>

    <h2>  Genetics: subject and object of study </h2><p>  Science got its name only in 1906 at the suggestion of the Englishman Betson.  It can be defined as follows: it is a discipline that studies the mechanisms of heredity, its variability in different types of living creatures.  Therefore, the main goal of genetics is to elucidate the structure of structures responsible for the transmission of hereditary traits, and to study the very essence of this process. </p><p>  The objects of study are: </p><ul><li>  plants; </li><li>  animals; </li><li>  bacteria </li><li>  mushrooms; </li><li>  human. </li></ul><p>  Thus, she covers all the kingdoms of wildlife, not forgetting any of the representatives.  However, to date, the research of precisely unicellular protozoa has been maximally put on stream, all experiments on genetics are carried out on them, as well as on bacteria. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To arrive at the results now available, the history of the development of genetics has come a long and thorny path.  In different periods of time, it was subjected to intensive development, then to complete oblivion.  However, in the end, it still got its rightful place among the whole family of biological disciplines. </p>

    <h2>  History of Genetics Briefly </h2><p>  In order to characterize the main milestones of the formation of the branch of biology under consideration, one should turn to the not so distant past.  After all, genetics originates from the 19th century.  And the official date of its inception as a completely separate discipline is 1900. </p><p>  By the way, if we are already talking about the origins, then it should be noted attempts to plant breeding, crossing animals for a very long time.  After all, farmers and herders did this in the 15th century.  It just did not happen scientifically. </p><p>  The table "The history of the development of genetics" will help to master its main historical moments of formation. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr align="center"><td>  <em>Development period</em> </td><td>  <em>Key Discoveries</em> </td><td>  <em>Scientists</em> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">  Beginner (second half of the XIX century) </td><td><p>  Hybridological studies in the field of plants (a study of generations using the example of a pea species) </p></td><td><p>  Gregory Mendel (1866) </p></td></tr><tr><td>  The discovery of the process of <span>meiosis and mitosis, the</span> study of sexual reproduction and its significance for fixing and transmission of signs from parents to offspring </td><td>  Strasbourger, Gorozhankin, Gertvig, Van Benevin, Fleming, Chistyakov, Valdeir and others (1878-1883) </td></tr><tr><td>  Medium (early to mid-20th century) </td><td>  This is the period of the most intensive growth in the development of genetic research, if we consider the historical era as a whole.

Of paramount importance are the daughter genetic sciences, of which quite a lot were formed during this period. </td><td>  W. Elving, Noden and others </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  In the table above, the history of the development of genetics is briefly displayed.  Next, we consider in more detail the main discoveries of different periods. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The main discoveries of the XIX century </h2><p>  The main works of this period were the work of three scientists from different countries: </p><ul><li>  in Holland, G. de Vries - a study of the characteristics of inheritance of characters in hybrids of different generations; </li><li>  in Germany, K. Correns - did the same with maize; </li><li>  in Austria K. Chermak - repeated the experiments of Mendel on sowing peas. </li></ul><p>  All these discoveries were based on the works written 35 years earlier by Gregory Mendel, who conducted many years of research and recorded all the results in scientific works.  However, these data did not arouse interest among his contemporaries. </p><p>  In the same period, the history of the development of genetics includes a number of discoveries on the study of human and animal sex cells.  It is proved that some signs that are inherited are fixed unchanged.  Others are individual for each organism and are the result of adaptation to environmental conditions.  The work was carried out by Strasbourg, Chistyakov, Fleming and many others. </p>

    <h2>  The development of science in the XX century </h2><p>  Since the official date of birth is <span>1900,</span> it is not surprising that it was in the 20th century that the history of the development of genetics was made.  <span>The hybridological</span> research <span>method</span> , created by this time, allows you to slowly, but surely get amazing results. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Creating the latest technological advances provides an opportunity to look into microstructures - this further propels genetics forward in development.  So, were installed: </p><ul><li>  DNA and RNA structures; </li><li>  mechanisms of their synthesis and replication; </li><li>  protein molecule; </li><li>  features of inheritance and consolidation; </li><li>  localization of individual characters in the chromosomes; </li><li>  mutations and their manifestations; </li><li>  there was access to control the genetic apparatus of the cell. </li></ul><p>  Probably one of the most important discoveries during this period was the decoding of DNA.  This was done by Watson and Crick in 1953.  In 1941, it was proved that traits are encoded in protein molecules.  From 1944 to 1970, maximum discoveries were made in the field of structure, replication, and the significance of DNA and RNA. </p>

    <h2>  The history of the development of genetics in Russia </h2><p>  In our country, the science in question began its intensive formation only in the second half of the 20th century.  The thing is that for a long time there was a period of stagnation.  These are the reign of Stalin and Khrushchev.  It was in this historical era that a schism occurred in academia.  T. D. Lysenko, who had power, said that all research in the field of genetics was invalid.  And she herself is not a science at all.  With the support of Stalin, he sent all the famous geneticists of that time to death.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  Vavilov; </li><li>  Serebrovsky; </li><li>  Rings; </li><li>  Chetverikov and others. </li></ul><p>  Many were forced to adapt to the requirements of Lysenko in order to avoid death and continue research.  Some emigrated to the United States and other countries. </p><p>  Only after Khrushchev left his post did genetics in Russia gain freedom in development and intensive growth. </p>

    <h2>  Domestic geneticists </h2><p>  The most significant discoveries that the science in question can be proud of are those that have been realized by our compatriots.  The history of the development of genetics in Russia is associated with such names as: </p><ul><li>  Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov (the doctrine of plant immunity, the <span>law of homologous series</span> , etc.); </li><li>  Nikolai Konstantinovich Koltsov (chemical mutagenesis); </li><li>  N.V. Timofeev-Resovsky (founder of radiation genetics); </li><li>  V.V. Sakharov (nature of mutations); </li><li>  M. E. Lobashev (author of manuals on genetics); </li><li>  A. S. Serebrovsky; </li><li>  K.A. Timiryazev; </li><li>  N.P. Dubinin and many others. </li></ul><p>  This list can be continued for a long time, because at all times Russian minds were great in all branches and scientific fields of knowledge. </p><h2>  Directions in science: medical genetics </h2><p>  The history of the development of medical genetics originates much earlier than general science.  After all, in the XV-XVIII centuries, the phenomena of transmission by inheritance of such diseases as: </p><ul><li>  polydactyly; </li><li>  hemophilia; </li><li>  progressive chorea; </li><li>  epilepsy and others. </li></ul><p>  The negative role of incest was established in maintaining the health and normal development of offspring.  Today, this section of genetics is a very important area of ‚Äã‚Äãmedicine.  After all, it is he who allows you to control manifestations and stop many genetic mutations even at the stage of embryonic development of the fetus. </p>
