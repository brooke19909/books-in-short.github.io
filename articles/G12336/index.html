However, during this time on the territory of this state, a huge number of events took place that influenced the development of life not only within the country, but also far beyond its borders.  The thing is that it is the New World (as America was called after its discovery) that has a powerful lever of influence on the world community.  We are talking about the US national currency - the dollar. </p><p>  The GDP of this state occupies a huge share in the total world volume.  It is thanks to the sustainable development and growth of the country's prosperity that its national currency is rightfully the main <span>reserve currency</span> of the planet‚Äôs economy. </p>

    <h2>  New World Dollar </h2><p>  Dollar bills, which modern society knows, initially had a completely different look.  <span>The issue of monetary</span> units began in the United States in 1861, when a civil war took place in the country, called the ‚ÄúWar of the North and the South‚Äù.  Even banknotes issued at that time are still a legal tender.  Every dollar includes one hundred US cents.  At the same time, only institutions that are members of the US trust, which is called the <span>Federal Reserve System,</span> can issue bank tickets <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All dollar bills that were issued before 1971 were backed up by the country's gold reserve.  Then this law was abolished, and today the issue of banknotes does not contain a ‚Äúsolid‚Äù and ‚Äúmetal‚Äù base.  An interesting point is that in addition to the US, this currency is considered national in other countries.  El Salvador and the Marshall Islands successfully use dollar bills issued in the New World. </p>

    <h2>  Banknotes and coins </h2><p>  Along with paper monetary units, citizens of the country also use metal signs.  On a one-cent coin, the image of <span>Abraham Lincoln is</span> minted <span>.</span>  Being smaller in nominal value, this sign is by no means the smallest in size.  More miniature is a ten-cent coin.  Between these two metal circles there is an intermediate minted sign - five cents.  In addition, there are quarter, half and one dollar coins in circulation. </p><p>  Moreover, the penultimate ones began to be released relatively recently - in 2011.  Dollar bills are also issued in almost all of these denominations.  However, there are some features: there is no banknote of 25 dollars - only 20. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Do not forget the additional paper currency.  Despite the presence of banknotes of various denominations, the most popular among the counterfeit is a hundred-dollar bill with the image of <span>Benjamin Franklin.</span>  This banknote is one of the most common in the world.  Currently, the US government is in full swing introducing a new, more secure bill into world circulation. </p>

    <p>  Another interesting banknote put into circulation is a bank ticket with a face value of $ 2.  The issue of these banknotes is not constant, so getting it into your wallet is not as easy as the usual 1 or 5 dollars.  A note in 3 US monetary units also existed.  However, a very short time.  The main feature of the three-dollar banknote was its one-sided ‚Äúcoloring‚Äù.  At the moment, the US government is considering options for withdrawing from circulation notes of minimal value.  Soon, one-dollar and two-dollar bank tickets will be replaced with metal counterparts.  However, the final scheme for the implementation of this procedure has not yet been announced. </p><h2>  Large rare bills </h2><p>  Many believe that the biggest dollar bill is a cash ticket of one thousand dollars.  Only a few know that on the territory of the country the ‚Äúbald eagles‚Äù had banknotes with denominations in excess of one thousandth, five, ten and even a hundred times.  However, only the last bill never fell into the masses.  However, in order to combat corruption and crime, the issue of bank tickets worth over <span>one hundred dollars</span> was discontinued.  Until now, in some places in the USA one can find banknotes of 1000 or 500 dollars, the cost of which for numismatists is much higher than the nominal. </p>
