So, the rooms here, according to them, are spacious, pleasantly decorated, comfortable and clean.  The furniture is not new, but high-quality, in excellent condition.  The same goes for technology.  Everything works without interruption.  Those who came here in families or companies of 4-5 people also note the fact that there are two bathrooms in the large rooms.  This is very convenient when everyone returns to their room from the beach at the same time, because in this case you do not have to wait long for your turn to take a shower. </p><p>  Tourists also included regular high-quality cleaning and a daily change of towels (both bath and beach ones).  The maids here update their bedding twice a week.  As for the shortcomings, a number of complaints about the rooms, which overlook the pool and disco bar of a neighboring hotel.  The fact is that quite loud music plays there until late, which can interfere with the relaxation of those who came on vacation with a small child, or those who are used to going to bed early.  Therefore, upon arrival, you can immediately ask not to occupy you in such apartments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="princess residence 4 reviews" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1515728.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Most tourists note in reviews that when booking accommodation in Princess Residence 4 * (Bulgaria), they paid only for breakfast and did not lose.  So, according to travelers, in the vicinity of the hotel there are many cafes where you can have lunch and dinner much cheaper than in the Princess Residence.  As for breakfast, their guests considered monotonous.  So, in the morning you can eat a fried egg or scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese, granola, toast, tea, coffee, etc. However, the set of products and dishes every day remains unchanged.  Therefore, some guests sometimes preferred not to go down for breakfast to the hotel restaurant, but to buy something in a supermarket or a bakery. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  According to most of our compatriots who have visited the Princess Residence, this hotel is perfect for lovers of beach relax.  So, you can reach the sea in just a couple of minutes.  The beach here is municipal, so you will have to pay extra for renting sun loungers and umbrellas (about nine euros per day).  Those who wish to save money can settle down on a site not occupied by sun loungers on mats or towels brought with them.  No one will require payment for this.  When entering the water, according to tourists, there are stones.  Depth increases gradually, so families with children will be comfortable here.  On the beach, vacationers are offered a lot of entertainment - riding a "banana", water slides, etc. </p>
