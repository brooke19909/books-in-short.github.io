The fabric is woven from linen, cotton, wool, silk, synthetic fibers, and there are also a huge number of <span>mixed fabrics.</span> </p><p>  In addition to the composition, the method of production of a particular material is different.  All these subtleties and nuances allow textile factories to offer their customers fabrics for every taste, color and wallet.  Sometimes this confusion also makes it difficult to understand.  So, materials that are completely different in composition, production method and purpose may have a similar or even the same name.  The two-thread fabric also appeared on this list. </p>

    <h2>  The name is one, but the essence? </h2><p>  In fairness, it should be noted that in most cases, the customers of textile and furniture stores themselves are to blame for the confusion and confusion of goods from the sewing world category.  Initially, each position that the manufacturer offers retail outlets has its own original name. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the end consumer often simplifies the name of a commodity unit for himself, and with someone‚Äôs easy hand this simple but fundamentally incorrect option becomes more popular than the original name.  So it turned out that the two-thread fabric is at the same time the name of the most delicate knitwear and coarse linen, which, first of all, is produced for sewing overalls and used as auxiliary material necessary for furniture factories and creative workshops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Harsh raw materials </h2><p>  So, the coarse linen material woven by the gunny method (warp and weft is taken in a ratio of two to two), characterized by high strength and strength, is called a two-thread.  Initially, the two-thread fabric consisted of only one hundred percent cotton component, but now manufacturers have expanded the range of this type of fabric and produce panels made with the inclusion of polyester fibers.  But it is worthwhile to understand that this is no longer the traditional <span>coarse fabric of the</span> two-thread, but finished, finished in a separate subspecies of materials. </p><p>  The fabric may have a different appearance, which directly depends on the density of the weave of the threads.  There are varieties that have a clearly traceable structure, they differ in porosity, the cells obtained as a result of interweaving of threads are even and homogeneous.  Other species, on the contrary, are dense and downed.  When choosing, it is worth considering for what purpose the material is bought.  The two-thread fabric description has the following: </p><ul><li>  composition - cotton blended; </li><li>  surface density - 180-520 g / m¬≤; </li><li>  mission - tailoring, industry, creativity; </li><li>  color - mainly natural beige, there are types bleached and dyed with monophonic dyes, sometimes printed matter with a floral and abstract pattern is found; </li><li>  width - 80, 100, 150, 220 cm. </li></ul><h2>  Types of two-thread, its purpose </h2><p>  So, as it becomes clear from the previous section, the two-thread can be harsh cotton or finished.  In addition, the material differs in thickness, width and density.  The usual two-thread is used as raw material for sewing work clothes or its individual elements (mittens, lining in shoes).  In the furniture industry, some internal elements are made from it.  Two-thread is also indispensable for printing houses (as material for book bindings). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the fabric has been widely used by needleworkers and creative people.  So, artists use it as the basis for their work, but it is worth bearing in mind that such a canvas needs special preliminary impregnation, otherwise too aggressive components of oil paints will destroy the structure of the cotton material.  Great souvenirs are made from two-thread, it is easy and convenient to embroider with a cross on it, it is often used as waste material in creative workshops. </p><p>  A more serious purpose is the finished fabric of a two-thread.  The composition of this material allows the use of clothing from it where a person is exposed to elevated temperatures.  Special impregnation makes the fabric heat-resistant and non-combustible. </p><h2>  Delicate care for coarse cloth </h2><p>  Regardless of the purpose for which the material will be used, it needs preliminary processing before sewing certain products from it.  As you know, cotton fabric tends to deform after getting wet.  This can be manifested in the displacement of individual threads or in the shrinkage of a piece of fabric. </p><p>  Manufacturers of severe two-thread remind their customers that the purchased fabric needs to be washed and dried.  This should be done, firstly, so that the material gives its natural shrinkage, and secondly, it needs to be cleaned of special impregnation, which the threads are usually processed at the factory in order to protect the fabric from pests and temperature fluctuations. </p><p>  The washing of a two-thread can be either machine or manual, however, do not use special drums for drying, and it is advisable to set the spin in the centrifuge to the minimum value. </p>

    <h2>  Knitted two-thread - what is it? </h2><p>  The knitted fabric of a two-thread cardinally differs from the material considered in the first part of the article.  Description: </p><ul><li>  the composition is mixed (base - cotton, optionally elastane, polyester); </li><li>  width - 150-180 cm; </li><li>  color - the fabric can be monophonic, printed, striped with different geometric and floral patterns; </li><li>  mission - sewing children's and adult clothes, tracksuits. </li></ul><p>  The popularity of this fabric is due to its high quality and excellent appearance.  This material is incredibly gentle, resistant to deformation.  Although this is knitwear, however, it is practically devoid of such drawbacks as the appearance of spools and puffs, in addition, the footer (the true name of knitted two-thread) is perfectly breathable, which is especially important for clothing. </p>

    <h2>  Ideal material for ... </h2><p>  A footer is a wonderful type of knitwear that is suitable for sewing clothes for children of any age.  Modeling begins with little men, creepers and vests, designed for babies, comfortable and practical blouses, leggings and panties for older children.  Adults will appreciate the suits for sports, t-shirts, tunics, pants, leggings, dresses and sundresses from this type of knitwear. </p><p>  Most often, the question of what is two-thread fabric in tracksuits is asked by mothers of young children and athletes.  Manufacturers proudly display on the tags the material from which their products are sewn.  However, how to distinguish the original fabric from a fake? </p><p>  The real footer from the front and the wrong side looks almost identical, the fabric stretches slightly due to the presence of stretch, it is soft and pleasant to the touch.  Due to the content of cotton, knitted two-thread is soft and light, and synthetic components give it durability. </p><p>  Colored fabrics do not wash and do not fade for a long time.  Many readers will be interested in the question of how much does knitted two-thread fabric cost.  The price of it depends on several factors (the width of the matter, its composition, design, country of origin) and ranges from 450 to 700 rubles per linear meter. </p>
