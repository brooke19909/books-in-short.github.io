  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History of the reign and biography of Amanullah Khan in Afghanistan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Amanullah Khan went down in history as a progressive politician and supporter of liberal reforms.  Under him, Afghanistan's independence from the British Empire was proclaimed.  Independence Day is celebrated in Afghanistan annually on August 19, one of the main holidays in the country. </p><p>  The active domestic policy of the government of Amanullah touched all spheres of society and changed the face of the country.  Below is a biography of Amanullah Khan, who ruled in Afghanistan from February 1919 to January 1929. </p><h2>  Rise to power </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amanullah Khan" class="if uuid-2870986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2870986.jpg"></div><p>  Amanullah was proclaimed emir after the death of his father, Habibullah Khan, who considered the establishment of Afghanistan's independence from the British Empire as one of the main tasks of his reign.  The son continued the work of his father, and on February 28, 1919 his government proclaimed the independence of the country, which provoked the beginning of the Anglo-Afghan war. </p><p>  Weakened after the First World War and torn by internal contradictions, the British Empire could not conduct full-fledged military operations.  The war lasted from May 3 to August 8, 1919, and its result was the signing of a peace treaty, according to which Afghanistan gained independence in foreign policy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Foreign policy of the new government </h2><div class="photo" data-original="driverlayer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amanullah with the President of Turkey" class="if uuid-2870993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2870993.jpg"></div><p>  Amanullah Khan's anti-Soviet views at the beginning of his reign were expressed in Afghanistan's support for the Basmach movement, whose goal was to prevent the establishment of Soviet power in Central Asia.  However, the government later changed its foreign policy course, and on February 28, 1921, as a result of lengthy negotiations, a Soviet-Afghan treaty was signed.  The British government, trying to prevent the strengthening of Soviet influence in the region, initiated the signing of the Anglo-Afghan treaty. </p><p>  Close relations have been established with Turkey and its president Mustafa Kemal.  The signing of the Afghan-Turkish treaty deprived the Amanullah Khan regime of supporting the conservative part of the Afghan society, which opposed the Turkish government, which in its policy departed from many of the principles of Islam. </p><p>  As a result of a successful foreign policy, Afghanistan was able to establish diplomatic relations with two world powers and increase its international prestige.  But inside the country serious contradictions were brewing. </p><h2>  Domestic policy: reform activities </h2><div class="photo" data-original="driverlayer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Domestic policy" class="if uuid-2870991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2870991.jpg"></div><p>  The internal politics of the government of Amanullah Khan was strongly influenced by the ideas of the Young Afghans who advocated progressive reforms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Reforms in Afghanistan: </p><ul><li>  Together with Turkish military instructors, military reform was developed.  The army was reorganized, and the government introduced general conscription. </li><li>  As part of the protectionist policy, customs reform was carried out in 1920, the result of which was an increase in trade with Persia and Russia. </li><li>  In the years 1921-1925, the development of a criminal code was carried out (before that, the court went according to Sharia law).  The reform did not bring the desired results, since the religious society was not ready for such radical reforms. </li><li>  Amanullah's wife, Queen Soraya, advocated for women's rights.  She believed that they should contribute to the development of the state and participate in public life.  In 1921, the country's first school for girls, "Masturat," was opened, and in 1923, the right of girls to choose their own spouse was legislated. </li><li>  On May 30, 1923, the first constitution in the history of Afghanistan entered into force.  She maintained a monarchical form of government, but at the same time introduced new authorities.  Freedom of religion was declared, freedom of speech, the inviolability of the home was proclaimed, a ban was introduced on requisitions in favor of local authorities, etc. </li></ul><h2>  Fall mode </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.andrewgrantham.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruler of Afghanistan" class="if uuid-2870998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2870998.jpg"></div><p>  Amanullah Khan's progressive reforms in Afghanistan met with resistance among a conservative part of the population.  In November 1928, the Pashtun tribes revolted.  Having joined forces, the rebels launched an attack on Kabul.  Soon, an uprising swept the whole country, and on January 14, 1929, Amanullah abdicated in favor of his brother Inayatullah Khan, who fled from Afghanistan on January 17. </p><p>  With the support of the USSR, Amanulla organized his own detachment, with the help of which he intended to regain power.  Under the leadership of General Nabi Khan, the detachment invaded Afghanistan, but, meeting fierce resistance, was forced to retreat.  Amanullah with his family fled to India.  In exile, he lived in Italy with his wife and children. </p>
