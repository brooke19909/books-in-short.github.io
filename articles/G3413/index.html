    <p>  The highest of them (145 m) is called the Blue Drop Hall.  Kizil-Koba Cave is also notable for the fact that it contains the largest stalactite in Europe, 8 meters long.  Its approximate age is 8 thousand years. </p><p>  The cave complex forms a complex and impassable labyrinth of six conditional floors, however, for tourist (not extreme) trips, a route of only 500 meters is reserved for which people without an escort of a guide are not allowed.  The temperature regime at these heights ranges from 8-9 ¬∞ C.  What is especially important, excursions are held all year round, although in winter the road to the complex is complicated by the icing of the slopes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Red Cave (Kizil-Koba) </h2><p>  This complex is a natural formation that appeared as a result of the erosion by the Kizilkobinka <span>(underground river)</span> of rocks.  It is easy to guess that this object got its name due to its color.  The rock forming Kizil-Kobu, calcium bicarbonate, under the influence of water is transformed into travertine (calcareous tuff) of a reddish hue. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, the cave arches are uneven in height, so in some passages you have to bend down to the ground.  However, there are also very high halls (for example, the Blue Drop Hall), where you can wander with your head held high. </p>

    <p>  Kizil-Koba is inhabited by bats, which can often be found sleeping in the arches of the cave.  They are accustomed to the noise created by people, but do not wake them up specially or shoot with a bright flash, because the reaction of frightened animals is unpredictable. </p><h2>  Cave inside </h2><p>  Atmosphere of the cave complex is set by lighting established along the entire route.  It varies in intensity so as to create fancy shadows and at the same time cover obstacles in the way.  However, there are not many of them: inside Kizil-Koba it is equipped with paths and railings for security purposes (only an excursion route). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Cave lovers will appreciate the cave, because inside it there is not only stalactite, recognized as the largest in Europe, but also many other sags of very bizarre forms. </p><p>  In addition, inside you can often see reservoirs formed by the underground river Kizilkobinka, otherwise called Su-Uchkhan.  It goes outside with a waterfall tearing off the edge of the tufa platform, visible along the way to the complex.  The water in this river is so clear that sometimes in a cave it can be seen only by the characteristic glare on the surface and walls around. </p><p>  Earlier (about 2.5 thousand years ago) Kizil-Koba was inhabited by ancient tribes, but scientists still fail to associate them with any culture: some call them Kizil-Kobintsy, the second - Taurus, and the third - Cimmerians once capturing the Crimean steppe and the Northern Black Sea coast.  However, no matter how many archaeologists try to find something resembling cave painting, to draw more accurate conclusions, while their attempts are unsuccessful. </p><h2>  A tourist route </h2><p>  The excursion program includes a visit to only four caves from the entire underground network: Dark, Windy, Pigeon and Chamomile. </p><p>  The journey begins from the lower entrance to Kizil-Koba through the gallery of the 2nd floor, from where a track equipped with a railing leads down.  To her right is a hole in the archaeological ring of the 3rd floor, and in front of the trail there is a passage to the underground reservoirs of the 1st floor.  Griboedov‚Äôs gallery stretches behind it, previously rich in cascades and stalactites, from which today there is nothing left but the foundation.  On this territory there are two entrances that provide free air circulation, therefore it is always cool and easy to breathe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also in the gallery is a well, leading to a floor below, and baths formed by an underground river.  If you go back a little, you can get to the far part of the complex through an artificial tunnel.  He will lead visitors to the Indian Hall, the walls of which are made of especially bright travertine, followed by the Chinese (notable for natural formations resembling the roofs of Buddhist pagodas in shape) and the Academic.  The last of them has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã300 square meters.  m. With the exception of size, it is not of particular interest: only the brooks of the New River await tourists in it, flowing down blocks of ceilings between the 1st and 2nd floors.  On this route ends, and will only return. </p>

    <p>  However, not so long ago Kizil-Koba (Crimea) opened its doors for lovers of extreme relaxation.  Now it has become possible to book a scuba diving excursion, for which you only need the ability to swim and dive.  This route covers 4 kilometers, and takes about 4 hours in duration.  However, it costs its money and time, because before the visitors new beauty of the underworld opens up, accessible not to everyone. </p><h2>  Visiting Rules </h2><p>  Those who decide to visit the Red Cave should familiarize themselves with the rules that the guide also voices: </p><ol><li>  Before going to Kizil-Koba, you need to wear warm clothes, which are not a pity to stain (best overalls), since the temperature inside does not rise above 13 ¬∞ C. </li><li>  To avoid injuries, the visitor should monitor the height of the arches, look under his feet and follow the instructions of the guide. </li><li>  Any shooting is allowed and is included in the ticket price. </li><li>  It is forbidden to touch the electrical equipment and leaks inside the caves. </li><li>  If necessary, it is permitted to use only electric lights, lighting a fire under a ban. </li><li>  You can not go beyond the equipped route, otherwise the visitor will be fined. </li><li>  It is forbidden to litter, draw on the walls and do any other harm to the aesthetic appearance of Kizil-Koba. </li></ol>

The car should be left in the parking lot and continue on the road either on foot or in a train for an additional fee (only in summer and winter this type of inland transport is not available and travel by car is allowed). </p>

    <p>  Next, there is a rather long road along a slope in the thick of various vegetation along the Su-Uchkhan River to a fork (on the right is the approach to the waterfall, on the left is a cave) and turn left, where you need to walk another couple of hundred meters, then climb the bridge and climb up the steep steps to the ticket office, followed by the entrance to Kizil-Koba. </p><h2>  Fairy Valley </h2><p>  Camping (Kizil-Koba has such a camp), called the "Fairy Valley", operates all year round and is a fenced area around the Red Cave, equipped for relaxation and living in <span>gazebos with a fireplace.</span> </p><p>  Here you can buy food and drinks, visit the tiny zoo, ride the rides, get souvenirs and just sit in a cafe with a cup of herbal tea.  In the "Fairy Valley" there is an internal transport that reduces the travel time to the Red Cave.  Outwardly, it resembles a children's engine. </p><h2>  Kizil-Koba Cave: how to get </h2><p>  You can get to the Red Cave both by public and by private transport.  From Yalta and Alushta to the village of Perevalnoye (Angara), where Kizil-Koba extends, trolleybuses number 52 and 55 go along the Simferopol highway. True, they only reach a turn to the cave complex, after which tourists will have to walk for about 3 km. </p>
