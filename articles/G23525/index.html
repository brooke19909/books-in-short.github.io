    <h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Isaac‚Äôs father died before his birth.  Mother, Anna Eyskou, having been widowed early, married again, having given birth to three more children from the new husband.  She paid little attention to her eldest son.  Newton, whose biography seemed to be prosperous in his childhood, suffered greatly from loneliness and lack of attention from his mother. </p><p>  The boy was more cared for by his uncle, brother of Anna Eyskou.  As a child, Isaac was a closed silent child, with a tendency to make various technical crafts, such as, for example, a <span>windmill</span> and a sundial. </p><h2>  School years </h2><p>  In 1955, at the age of 12, Isaac Newton was sent to school.  Shortly before </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brief biography of newton" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17479/314374.jpg" width="250"></div>  his stepfather dies, and his mother inherits his fortune, immediately re-registering him as his eldest son.  The school was in Grantham, and Newton lived with local pharmacist Clark.  During his studies, his outstanding abilities were revealed, but his mother returned the 16-year-old boy four years later with the aim of entrusting him with the duties of managing the farm.

Reading books, versification, the construction of complex mechanisms - this was the whole of Newton.  His biography at that very moment determined its direction towards science.  School teacher Stokes, Uncle William, and a member of Trinity College at Cambridge University, Humphrey Babington, joined forces to continue the education of Isaac Newton. </p><h2>  Universities </h2><p>  In Cambridge, a brief biography of Newton is as follows: </p><ul><li>  1661 - admission to Trinity College at the university for free education as a student ‚Äúsizer‚Äù. </li><li>  1664 - successful passing of exams and transfer to the next level of study as a ‚Äúschoolboy‚Äù student, which gave him the right to receive scholarships and the opportunity to continue his studies further. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, Newton, whose biography recorded a creative upsurge and the beginning of independent <span>scientific activity,</span> met Isaac Barrow, a new mathematics teacher who had a strong influence on the <span>scientist's</span> passion for <span>mathematics.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Years of great achievement and glory </h2><p>  With the onset of the plague epidemic in 1665, college classes ceased, and Newton went to his estate in Woolsthorpe, where the most significant discoveries were made - optical experiments with spectrum colors, the <span>law of universal gravitation.</span> </p><p>  In 1667, the scientist returned to Trinity College, where he continued his research in the fields of physics, mathematics, and optics.  The telescope he created caused rave reviews in the Royal Society. </p><p>  In 1705, Newton, whose photo today can be found in every textbook, was the first to be awarded the title of knight precisely for scientific achievements.  The number of discoveries in various fields of science is very large.  Monumental works on mathematics, the basics of mechanics, in the fields of astronomy, optics, and physics have turned scientists around the world. </p>
