    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Evi 3 is located on one of the largest and most beautiful <span>islands in Greece</span> - Rhodes, in its eastern part.  Since the island is large, its territory is divided into areas.  The hotel is located in Filaraki, a former village, and now one of the best resorts in the country.  From here, it is 14 km to the main <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Rhodes</span> ; comfortable buses regularly run here, a stop is just opposite the hotel.  Also nearby are numerous shops, cafes, restaurants, souvenir shops.  Two steps away there is a karaoke bar, and on the next street there are nightclubs, discos, even strip shows.  The airport is located just 17 km from the hotel.  The international port is located in the island's capital, Rhodes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Evi 3" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/468591.jpg" width="381"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  From any part of Rhodes, getting to Evi 3 is easy.  You can take a regular bus or taxi.  The main thing is to get to the island itself.  From Russia you can get to Rhodes by plane.  Travel time depends on the type of flight.  If it is a change, the flight will take from 6 hours to a day.  The distance from the airport to the hotel is approximately 17 km.  But you can get to the island from Athens either by plane or on fantastically convenient and comfortable ferries.  Almost every of them has cafes, bars and restaurants.  Tickets can be chosen inexpensively, but then you have to sit on wooden deck benches or in the common room, you can have average cost (with soft seats in the cabin) and expensive with standard or luxury cabins.  Travel time also depends on the type of ship.  This is an average of 16 hours.  In addition, you can fly to Rhodes or sail from Thessaloniki and many <span>Greek islands,</span> for example, Crete, the Cyclades group, as well as Turkish Marmaris. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Evi hotel 3" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/468588.jpg" width="402"></div>

    <h2>  Full Description Show less Evi 3, Rhodes </h2><p>  The hotel is a three-story building surrounded by a small garden.  On the territory there is a large pool with a children's section.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are located both around it, on the tiled path and the area in front of the bar, and on a green lawn in the shade of trees.  There is a playground nearby.  There are a couple of small shops in the building, including jewelry, a restaurant, a bar, and a TV lounge.  At the reception you can get all the necessary information about excursions, bus routes, rent a car, order tickets, and wash your clothes.  The cost of the latter service is paid.  There is also a paid safe and internet.  The hotel has its own parking area.  Built by Evi in ‚Äã‚Äã1985.  Scheduled repairs were carried out here in 1995 and in 2002, and ongoing repairs are carried out as necessary.  The hotel opens in April, closes in October. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Evi 3" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/468596.jpg" width="371"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Hotel Evi 3 (Rhodes) in its fund has 240 rooms of the category "standard" and 34 "apartments".  All rooms are bright and spacious enough.  The interior is classic, Greek - white walls with paintings, blue furniture (beds with excellent mattresses, a mirror with a dressing table, bedside tables, chairs, wardrobe).  Each room has a balcony with a plastic table and armchairs.  It offers beautiful views of the lawn, pool or garden.  From the equipment there are air conditioners that work only with the <span>balcony door</span> closed <span>,</span> refrigerators, telephone, radio.  220 sockets and televisions are available in some rooms.  But the bathroom and toilet are located in each room.  The apartments are also equipped with a kitchenette. </p><p>  On request and for a fee, cots are available. </p><p>  Room cleaning is very conscientious, carried out daily.  Linen is changed every 3 days, towels - every day. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  If an all-inclusive tour is purchased at Evi 3 Hotel (Rhodes), guests will be provided with a buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Breakfast menu includes scrambled eggs, several types of sausages, rolls, butter, jam, cottage cheese, coffee, tea, juice.  For lunch and dinner, fish, meat, vegetables are offered.  In addition, in the bar you can take beer, wine, ouzo (this is not vodka!), Crayfish and other spirits free of charge and for money, and ice cream in the afternoon.  But, by and large, the "BB" system justifies itself little, since you have to be attached to the hotel.  It is much more reasonable to make breakfast only, and to have all snacks and meals in the city.  So the menu will be more diverse, and for the price you can choose the most suitable option.  In Filaraki and in the city of Rhodes, there are wonderful restaurants located on the seashore where you can have a great time.  As for the products, I would like to note that fruits and vegetables in Greece are much cheaper than in some Russian sea resorts.  It is better to buy them in large supermarkets, for example Carrefour, where very often there are promotions and discounts, as well as in small vegetable shops.  You can always have a bite to eat in confectioneries (zaharoplasty), where fantastically delicious cakes are sold.  A little secret - if you become a regular customer of a restaurant, you will certainly find free treats in the form of sweet and decanter of wine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Evi 3 reviews" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/468590.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Greece is primarily famous for its beach holidays.  Evi 3 is located from the sea in a 15-minute leisurely walk, or 850 meters.  Those for whom this is crucial can find a hotel on the 1st coastline.  The beach in Filaraki is wonderful, with white and yellow sand, a smooth entry into the water and a crystal clear sea.  The only drawback - sometimes there are quite noticeable winds.  Although for surfers, this is rather a virtue.  For holidaymakers, the wind is much stronger on the west coast of the island.  There are sun loungers and sun loungers on the beach, but you can also sit on your own towels.  For the convenience of vacationers, bars and restaurants work here.  Children can frolic on a roller coaster.  For adults, there are canoes, catamarans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece Evi 3" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/468595.jpg" width="387"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Evi 3 (Rhodes) is designed for those who prefer an active holiday on the island, rather than within the walls of the hotel.  Therefore, entertainment shows are not held here, there is only a small program for kids.  Although there is karaoke nearby, and on almost all the streets there are a lot of bars and cafes working "until the last client".  During the day, you can diversify your leisure with numerous excursions, because visiting Greece and not seeing anything but the beach is almost a crime.  To get to know the island it is better to rent a car with or without a guide, because traveling only by bus is not very convenient.  You should definitely see the city of Rhodes with its amazing streets, churches, the famous ancient fortress.  It is also worth seeing the Acropolis of Lindos, the ancient city of Kamiros, the monastery on Mount Filerimos, Ladiko and Kallithea bays, the temples of St. Nectarios and St. Panteleimon, Rodini Park with peacocks walking along the alleys, the Valley of the Butterflies and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Evi 3 Hotel Rhodes" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/468589.jpg" width="392"></div>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  For everyone who decided to stay at Evi 3 (Rhodes), it is worthwhile to know that Greek three-star hotels have their own characteristics and are somewhat different from Turkish and Egyptian ones.  So, they do not twist swans and do not pour petals on the bed, but they almost always work on the principle that each guest is the most expensive and the best guest.  The situation here is without frills and pretentiousness, but there is everything necessary to ensure an excellent holiday, everything is in good condition and is working properly.  Greeks are unusually hospitable and friendly, love to treat, always ready to help.  The same is waiting for everyone who came to Evi.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you know Greek or not, you will be served well.  And if you greet with a smile or say goodbye to the word "jasas", thank "eucharisto", and accompany your request with "paracalo", the staff and hotel owners will be pleased, but it will be useful for you.  In general, in Greece, the second language is English.  Those tourists who are friends with him will always be easy anywhere in the country and in Rhodes as well. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Almost everyone vacationing in Evi 3 leaves positive reviews.  The friendliness and excellent work of all the staff, maids, cooks, and receptionists are especially noted.  Also, all guests are delighted with the excellent cleaning of the rooms.  Some complaints are caused by the monotony of breakfasts, as well as the night noise from the karaoke bar.  Only the hotel is not to blame here, you just need to book rooms with windows opposite to the side of the bar.  Basically, tourists give the hotel a high rating, highlighting the right value for money. </p>
