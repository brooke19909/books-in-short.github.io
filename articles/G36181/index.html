    <h2>  History </h2><p>  <span>Archaeological excavations</span> indicate that near the Khimki channel there was a site of an ancient man.  Events took their course, settlements arose and collapsed, two wars (1812 and 1945) took turns to demolish the village from the face of the earth.  Only in 1960 did Tushino communicate with Moscow, the villages began to grow and a park was laid out here for people to relax.  Later, the territory became part of Moscow, which greatly affected its attendance.  Domestic cinema used this natural area to shoot episodes of films. </p><p>  Since 1992, the territory was given the name "Park of Culture and Rest" Northern Tushino "."  Since 2013, he was again waiting for the transformation.  The territory of the park was combined with the museum and memorial complex of the history of the fleet, and several more small park zones were added to them.  Now the park "Northern Tushino" has greatly increased in size and acquired historical significance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Present </h2><p>  If you are planning to explore its territory, you should prepare well.  Comfortable shoes, a supply of drinking water and free time are a necessity, since the Severnoye Tushino park occupies 70 hectares.  The southern part of the park is of interest to history buffs.  There are beautiful avenues and a museum <span>of the Navy.</span>  It‚Äôs worth visiting, because nowhere else will you have the opportunity to visit a submarine, ekranoplan and boat.  Keep in mind that there are always a lot of people willing, and up to 20 people are allowed to go on excursions during certain hours.  The rest are waiting for the first group to leave for several hours. </p>

    <h2>  Summer in the park </h2><p>  The coolness of the shady alleys itself is very attractive in the summer heat.  But this is not all that the park boasts.  Not so long ago, a wonderful beach was laid out here with sunbeds and umbrellas, changing rooms and showers.  This wonderful recreation area lies on the shore of the reservoir, and on the pontoons, directly on the surface of the water, there is a luxurious swimming pool with purified water and heating.  Now you can at least every day gather in the park "Northern Tushino".  The pool is perfect for swimming in any weather. </p><p>  This applies to passive relaxation, but for sports lovers there are suitable entertainments.  Rollerball Park provides an opportunity to master this fashionable sport.  Running tracks are laid throughout.  Lovers of cycling were not ignored: unpopular alleys were given to them so as not to interfere with pedestrians walking. </p><p>  For its visitors, the Northern Tushino Park offers rental of bicycles, roller skates, scooters and other sports equipment.  How nice it is for the whole family to go to the park!  The child can have fun on the playground, and adults can stretch their muscles, ride bicycles to the full.  Today it is the most popular sport after inline skating. </p><p>  Those who are tired and hungry can have a bite to eat at the kiosks with delicious street food or in stationary cafes.  After sitting quietly with a cup of tea, you can continue your walk. </p>

    <h2>  Winter in the park </h2><p>  A large skating rink is poured on the site of the football field, its area is 800 square meters.  For the convenience of visitors nearby there is a convenient area for changing shoes, as well as a rental point.  If you are taking your first steps, then a personal trainer is at your service.  It will allow you to skate faster with a minimum of injuries. </p><p>  Who doesn't like sledding?  This activity is to the liking of both children and adults.  To do this, use a large slide, about 4 meters in height.  Here you can ride on the tubing - a huge inflatable sled.  Impressions from such a descent are always abundant.  At high speed, your vehicle flies a decent distance after the end of the slide.  For family holidays, riding a <span>Finnish sleigh</span> or a powerful snowmobile is well suited.  Skiers did not go unnoticed either; for them there is a convenient track and equipment rental. </p>
