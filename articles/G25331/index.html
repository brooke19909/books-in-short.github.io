    <h2>  Business Guarantee Program </h2><p>  This program from Sberbank is much more complicated - this is not a standard loan, but a symbiosis of insurance against the occurrence of an insured event.  In simple words, the entrepreneur is not sure that if he wins the tender he will have enough of his own funds to fulfill the contract and there will not be a <span>cash gap.</span>  Turning to the bank for a loan, he is insured by borrowed funds. </p><p>  In the absence of an insured event, the entrepreneur will only need to pay a commission, and if you have to use borrowed money, you will need to return it and pay interest. </p><p>  Terms of the "Business Guarantee" program: </p><ul><li>  Under this program, for Sberbank <span>tender loans to</span> individual entrepreneurs, terms are given up to 3 years. </li><li>  The minimum amount is 50 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Commission fees for the issuance of funds - from 2.5%. </li><li>  Interest rate - from 11.5. </li><li>  Collateral - a guarantee or property pledge. </li><li>  Insurance is optional. </li></ul><h2>  Leasing </h2><p>  You already know that Sberbank provides IP loans in cash, but you can also issue a loan for the purchase of means of production, such as vehicles.  This program is called Leasing. </p><p>  Leasing programs: </p><ul><li>  Cars.  A loan is issued up to 24 million rubles, a period of 1 year, a contribution of 10%. </li><li>  Commercial and freight transport - from 1 year, up to 24 million rubles, contribution of 15%. </li><li>  Special equipment - from 2 years, up to 24 million rubles, 25% contribution. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Consideration of a funding application </h2><p>  A special credit committee has been created in Sberbank, which is engaged in the consideration of loan applications of individual entrepreneurs.  In this case, the credit business is formed by the inspector and only after that it is transferred to the committee for analysis. </p><p>  In order to increase the chances of a positive decision on the issuance of a Sberbank loan to individual entrepreneurs, the conditions must comply with the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  The perfect credit history. </li><li>  Stable financial situation. </li><li>  Permanent and official employment of a guarantor. </li><li>  Availability of own real estate and other property. </li><li>  A reliable guarantor. </li><li>  Competitive business plan. </li></ul><h2>  Possible reasons for failure </h2><p>  Unfortunately, situations when Sberbank decides to refuse lending often happen.  There may be several reasons for this: </p><ul><li>  An unconvincing business project. </li><li>  Insufficient liquidity of a functioning business. </li></ul><p>  It should be borne in mind that the solvency verification of individual entrepreneurs is especially meticulous, since it is quite difficult to assess the transparency of accounting records. </p><p>  Having studied the bank’s programs, you can understand that there are enough opportunities for business development, you just need to choose the right program and observe all the necessary conditions. </p>
