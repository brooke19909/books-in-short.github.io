    <h2>  Haraks Palace and Park </h2><p>  The complex is built in a special style that is different from all existing ones.  Built by a wonderful master of his craft, N.P. Krasnov, the palace today is striking in its beauty.  The palace received its name in honor of the Roman fortress, which was located in these places in the 3rd century BC. </p><p>  The scale of the project was amazing even during the years of its creation - 46 rooms, a chapel, a church, a greenhouse, a large stable, a kitchen, a park, water supply and sewage systems.  Today the Haraks Palace is one of the dormitory buildings of the Dnepr sanatorium. </p><h2>  Church of st.  Nina </h2><p>  This structure was created by N.P. Krasnov, an architect known in those days, on the estate of Grand Duke G.M. Romanov.  Construction began in 1906, completed in 1908.  G. M. Romanov decided to build a temple in the style of architecture of Armenia and Georgia.  The Grand Duke approved his decision.  The mosaic for the temple was made by an artist from Venice A. Salviati.  She adorns the entrance to the building. </p><p>  The name of the church is directly related to Princess Nina Georgievna, the eldest daughter of the Grand Duke.  She was ill with diphtheria at the age of four and survived thanks to an operation she had done in Hamburg on August 6, 1905.  This is the day of the Transfiguration of the Lord.  The church is named after the saint who performed the miracle of the princess's recovery. </p>
