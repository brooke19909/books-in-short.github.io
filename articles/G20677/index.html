    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The village of Cherny Yar <span>(Astrakhan region)</span> is located on one of the banks of the Lower Volga.  It was founded around the middle of the seventeenth century.  Then the Black Ostrog fortress was built, which a little later had to be moved due to the collapse of the river bank.  The fortress was renamed Chernoyarskaya. </p><p>  Here, the battle of Stepan Razin with the rebels took place, not far from this place the rebels fought for the last time together with <span>Emelyan Pugachev.</span>  Soon the village was completely burned down, but was rebuilt again.  And in the nineteenth century, residents were forced to move further from the coast because of its significant river washout. </p><p>  By the end of the 19th century, a new fire occurred in Yara, as a result of which the village center burned down.  After this, the buildings began to be built of bricks (shops, shops, bakeries and mansions).  Black Yar developed and received the status of a city, but was later deprived of it.  And again in 1925 it became a village. </p><h2>  Name history </h2><p>  The name Cherny Yar itself consists of two words: Russian ‚Äúblack‚Äù and Turkic ‚Äúyar‚Äù (high bank, which is washed by the river).  There is a legend about the origin of such a name.  Once the Astrakhan prince passing along the Volga River stopped in those places where the village is now located.  The prince went ashore and saw the most beautiful places.  And the coast was so steep and high that the river water seemed dark, almost black.  The prince decided that people would live in this place.  And he called the place Black Yar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are other legends, but it is noteworthy that the word "black" in then Russia called everything strange, incomprehensible and mysterious.  This word was associated with sorcerers and witches, in which the villagers still believe. </p>

    <p>  Fishing lovers must visit these amazing places.  Residents get catfish in the Volga, pike and rare fish sterlet. </p><p>  On the bank of the river, under the cliff, the bones of an ancient bison and mammoth were found, and later a whole skeleton was collected, which is stored in the Astrakhan Museum.  In Black Yar there is a branch of the museum, which will tell about the history of the village and the life of the inhabitants during the Great Patriotic War. </p><p>  But not only the village is called the Black Yar.  In the Orenburg region there is <span>a recreation center</span> "Black Yar".  On its territory there are comfortable houses, a well-maintained beach and gazebos for relaxing near the river, as well as a bathhouse and a children's "town". </p><p>  Here you can try dishes from national cuisine, see oriental dances, go fishing.  In winter - skiing and ice skating, as well as harnessed horses to ride through the winter forest.  Both adults and children can relax at the base, a family vacation is also provided. </p><p>  In any case, you should visit both places.  Each of them will surprise you with something special. </p>
