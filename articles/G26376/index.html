  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a tablet</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Over the past two decades, technological progress has burst into a whirlwind and has not subsided.  Even computer specialists cannot understand such an abundance of new products.  This is an amazing fact, but many have to admit it.  Ordinary consumers do not need so much knowledge.  But when the decision matures to acquire a new thing, they involuntarily think and get lost among the huge selection of models offered by the industry.  Let us try briefly and, in fact, to understand this difficult issue. </p><p><br>  How is a tablet different from a computer or phone?  Is this a small laptop?  Some people think that the tablet is an advanced e-book.  The young generation, born already adapted for new technologies, does not have difficulties with definitions, not everyone was so lucky.  Therefore, we will deal seriously.  The history of occurrence, transformation and processions around the world will be left out of the picture.  Let's call it clear and simple.  A tablet is a handheld computer.  Computer and notepad.  It is convenient to use outside the home.  Easy.  Nicely.  It is comfortable.  A huge selection of tablets is on the site <noindex>  <span>http://prohtc.com.ua</span> </noindex>  as well as other household appliances. <br><br>  Choose a tablet you need to start with its size.  Specialists call this screen size, measured in diagonals.  A small diagonal of 5-6 is often for portable tablets, which, in essence, is no different from a phone, only with advanced features.  Diagonal 7-8 is an average tablet, and it ceases to be a toy, it can already be used professionally to solve complex problems.  The latter, which is considered, it is also with the largest diagonal of 9-10.  This is a classic functional tablet.  It has optimal dimensions. <br><br>  In addition to the size of the diagonal, you must not forget to clarify the screen resolution.  There are several standard ones, and the rule works here, the higher the better.  For simplicity, you can pay attention to the technical characteristics of expensive models, and it is precisely in these parameters that you can choose.  Because display quality is fifty percent of the success.  This is the appearance and perception of the color gamut, contrast, glare.  The tablet does not have a keyboard and mouse, as in a laptop, and this once again reminds of the importance with which to approach when choosing a screen for a future tablet. <br><br>  We turn to the heart of the tablet and the motor in one person.  Operating system.  It‚Äôs not difficult to understand here.  The first Google Android is often used on phones, easier and cheaper.  The second is very unpopular, it is not chosen by consumers and professionals.  Why this happens is better not to know.  This is Microsoft Windows.  We need to pay attention to the Apple iOS system.  The most popular and time-tested operating system. <br><br>  Having decided, with two main tasks, we move on to the third.  It is very nice if the tablet is smart.  It depends on the speed of data processing.  In a handheld computer, the processor does this.  Here the rule is the same as when choosing a screen, the higher the indicators, the better.  A powerful processor is a fast tablet. <br><br>  Further, you can choose, compare and buy, because the other functions in almost all tablets are the same in essence, but different in shape.  Agree that the weight, the number of gigabytes of memory, the color is not so thorough, everyone can make this choice without prompting.  Ah, but forgot to mention the manufacturers, brand and price.  There is a secret that sellers are silent about from the very beginning.  You don‚Äôt have to read anything at all and don‚Äôt recognize, don‚Äôt clog your mind with unnecessary information.  It will not look like a secret that the best is the most fashionable and high-quality brand at this time.  And good manufacturers do not have bad things.  Therefore, if there are difficulties with finances, choose a less expensive model among the most popular and favorites.  Choose from the leaders. </p></div></article>
