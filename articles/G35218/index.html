The fact is that smartphones are identical not only in appearance, but also in functionality.  A significant difference in phones is only in price - Nokia is 5 times cheaper than the Canadian representative.  In this article, the reader will get acquainted with the infamous smartphone closer, and the technical specifications, review and reviews of the owners will help a potential buyer to choose a phone on the mobile device market. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia E6" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30608/1051995.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The <span>Nokia E6</span> smartphone <span>, the</span> price of which is about 10-12 thousand rubles, has all the modern functions useful for both work and leisure: </p><ol><li>  TFT multi-touch color touch screen with 16 million colors.

    <p>  Nokia cell phone, apparently, claims to be in the niche of youth devices, at least this is indicated by its multimedia capabilities: </p><ol><li>  The built-in camera has a resolution of 8 megapixels.  In addition to the built-in flash, the camera is equipped with digital zoom and can recognize faces. </li><li>  Video recording is carried out according to the H.264 standard with a maximum resolution of 1280x720 dpi (the frequency does not exceed 25 frames per second). </li></ol><p>  There is a front camera as additional functionality, Geo Tagging is supported (adding location information to photos).  The phone is capable of playing audio in all popular formats.  At the hardware level, the smartphone has an FM radio. </p><h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  As many users note, the Nokia cell phone borrowed even a complete set from the Canadian representative.  The box really has impressive dimensions, and its contents will delight all buyers.  Inside you can find not only a smartphone and a charger.  The buyer will be pleasantly surprised by the branded phone case and excellent quality headphones. </p>

    <p>  But many owners have questions about the build quality.  Firstly, the phone is very lightweight, and the huge ‚Äúspatula‚Äù cannot weigh 130 grams, here the manufacturer clearly saved on materials.  There are complaints about the design itself - it creaks under severe deformation.  This behavior of the device in a plastic case indicates low-quality materials used for the manufacture of phones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ergonomics and control </h2><p>  In addition to the SIM card slot, the user will not be able to detect any other interface connectors under the battery of the Nokia E6 smartphone.  A review of the phone‚Äôs appearance suggests that the manufacturer placed everything at the user's fingertips.  First of all, we are talking about a memory card - for micro-SD, the slot is located near the power button, on top.  It is covered with a rubber stopper and allows the user to remove the drive without turning off the smartphone.  Also, under the rubber cover, the user will find a USB port, which may be needed for flashing or synchronizing the phone with a personal computer. </p>

    <p>  The appearance is spoiled only by the <span>control buttons,</span> which the manufacturer made strongly protruding from the body on the right side edge.  The volume keys are touch sensitive, and technologists could make them smaller.  The superfluous slider in Nokia E6 is also responsible for blocking the device. </p><h2>  Operating system features </h2><p>  According to manufacturers, the phone has an innovative Symbian Anna operating system.  The manufacturer assures that the changes affected not only the appearance, but also are directly related to performance (less resource intensive).  But, as the owners note in their reviews, they did not notice much difference between the devices of the previous generation and E6.  And for most users, the main criterion for the purchase was full application compatibility for the Symbian platform.  That is, any programs for Nokia that a person used before buying a new smartphone will work on this device.  In fact, this is one of the main criteria that influenced the choice of this phone model. </p><h2>  Expectations and Opportunities </h2><p>  The presence of a high-resolution camera in an inexpensive smartphone definitely attracts the buyer, however, a close acquaintance with the functionality of the device leads to a completely different result.  Firstly, the camera does not have 8 megapixels announced - in fact, a 5 megapixel sensor is installed.  Built-in programs for Nokia perform the usual interpolation of the image, providing the result of processing to the user.  There are complaints about the photosensitivity of the matrix - white balance and shades of gray are unfamiliar to her, therefore, in poor lighting, it will not be possible to achieve a high-quality picture. </p>

    <p>  But the lack of autofocus did not affect the quality of the photos.  The camera does an excellent job of measuring distances and captures the smallest details of objects.  The better the lighting on the street, the better the user will receive a photograph.  To color reproduction in good lighting, too, no complaints. </p><h2>  Information Entry and Management </h2><p>  The keyboard buttons of the Nokia E6 phone, as noted by users, have a fairly rigid course, which completely eliminates accidental pressing when entering information.  The keys themselves are slightly convex upwards - this form does not even allow you to press several buttons with your thumb.  As befits any full keyboard, the smartphone has a long space, an <span>upper-case</span> letter, and an alternative command call (Sym and Ctrl buttons). </p>

    <p>  The manufacturer implemented in the device a full keyboard backlight, which is controlled using <span>a light sensor.</span>  All buttons of the smartphone are illuminated evenly, without any distortion.  In general, the keyboard of this phone is impeccable.  With it, it is very easy to type large amounts of text with both one and two hands.  The small pad present under the keys acts as a palm rest. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  A rather interesting model was released by Nokia to the world market.  On the one hand, this is low-quality plagiarism for a more expensive phone, and on the other, the cheapest smartphone with a QWERTY keyboard, which has a lot of useful functions.  For example, in a Nokia E6 phone, the firmware is downloaded independently when the device is connected to high-speed WiFi networks, as is implemented in many Android devices.  In general, the advantages still prevail over the shortcomings, and new owners continue to appear on the smartphone daily. </p>
