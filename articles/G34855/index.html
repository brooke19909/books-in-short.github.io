It is based on the contradiction of the parties.  As a rule, it is accompanied by negative emotions. </p><p>  However, in these definitions the concepts of ‚Äúcontradiction‚Äù and ‚Äúsignificance of contradictions‚Äù are not fully disclosed. </p><p>  According to Yu. V. Rozhdestvensky, the contradiction relates to speech action.  He identified three stages in the development of the struggle for interests.  The first, in his opinion, includes differences of opinion, the second - contradictions in the process of discussion.  The third stage - the conflict - is a direct struggle in action. </p><p>  A contradiction is defined as a dialogue (speech action) in which the differences of the parties are expressed. </p><p>  Conflict is any speech influences of the parties that are aimed at causing various harm to the opposite side. </p><p>  The essence of this phenomenon should be stated in a conceptual scheme.  In doing so, four main characteristics should be covered.  These include dynamics, structure, management and functions. </p><p>  <span>The structure of the conflict</span> contains the object (controversial subject), subjects (groups, organizations, individuals), conditions, scale (interpersonal, global), tactics and strategies of behavior of the parties, outcomes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Any real conflict is a rather complex dynamic process.  It includes the following phases: </p><ul><li>  objective situation (the formation of objective reasons); </li><li>  interaction (developing situation or incident); </li><li>  partial or full resolution. </li></ul><p>  Depending on the nature, there are situations: </p><ul><li>  objective (associated with actual shortcomings and problems); </li><li>  subjective (due to different assessments of certain actions and events). </li></ul><p>  Depending on the consequences, destructive (destructive) and constructive (providing for rational transformations) situations are determined. </p><p>  Among the existing specific classification of conflicting situations, conflicts of interest are quite common.  These include situations in which distribution issues are raised, or which arise against a background of competition for possession. </p><p>  In other words, a conflict of interest is a situation in which the interests of the parties involved are involved (goal plans, motives, aspirations, and others) that turn out to be contradictory or incompatible with each other.  These include, for example, disagreements between spouses about plans for the upcoming vacation.  This situation refers to contradictions.  In case of their incompatibility, situations pass into the category of resource conflicts.  This is due to the desire often arising among the parties to get the same resource or its most profitable part.  At the same time, opponents strive for one goal, however, due to the limited or individual nature of the resource, their interests contradict each other.  Such problems often arise in everyday life. </p><p>  All events, phenomena of a social nature, community (political parties, family and others) can be considered from the standpoint of conflict.  At the same time, the result of a contradictory situation can lead to both disagreement and struggle, as well as solidarity and solidarity of people.  Thus, social conflict is a concept that contains a certain duality.  This nature of the controversial situation, expressed in a constructive or destructive beginning, plays a crucial role in the development of society. </p>
