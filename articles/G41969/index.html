    <h2>  Sukhmantra Resort &amp; Spa 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Many modern tourists spend a lot of time preparing for their vacation.  So, they try to find the best flight option, collect the maximum information about the features and culture of the country that they plan to visit, and also study a lot of hotel reviews in order not to make a mistake in their choice.  Experienced travelers are advised to pay special attention to the last point.  After all, during a trip abroad, the hotel will become your second home, where you will return every day.  Therefore, it should not cause you negative emotions.  Studying the comments of other tourists allows you to make the right choice.  After all, former guests are trying to tell in detail not only about the pros, but also about the shortcomings of a particular hotel that they had to face.  To save you time, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized reviews of Russian travelers who have already visited the Sukhmantra Resort &amp; Spa 4 * hotel in North Goa.  It should be noted right away that this hotel has a very good rating (4.2 points out of 5 possible).  This suggests that the vast majority of vacationers were not disappointed in their choice. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  I must say that the guests in general were satisfied with the rooms in this hotel.  They claim that the apartments here are spacious, clean, bright.  The furniture is comfortable, high-quality, modern equipment.  Everything is in good condition.  If something suddenly fails, then after contacting the reception the problem will be quickly fixed.  Tourists pay attention to the fact that the rooms do not have a hairdryer.  However, if necessary, you can take it to the reception for free.  The guests liked that the apartment has a tea / coffee maker.  Its contents are replenished every day.  Hotel guests also note clean and quality linens and towels.  Using such things, they said, is very nice.  As for the complaints, some vacationers noted that the rooms have poor soundproofing.  However, for most travelers this was not a problem, as the hotel is small and there are very few guests.  And if you come across too noisy neighbors, then no soundproofing will help here. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  As tourists note in their reviews, throughout the entire Sukhmantra Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Candolim) there is access to free wireless Internet.  True, according to the guests, the connection speed can not always be called high.  Therefore, most travelers who want to always be able to access the Internet purchased SIM cards of local mobile operators with a package of mobile Internet.  It costs quite inexpensively, and the account can be replenished in a mass of points anywhere in Goa. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning staff </h2><p>  The hotel guests had no complaints about the work of the maids.  On the contrary, tourists note that the cleaning of their rooms was very high quality and regular.  Towels are changed every day, and linen - a couple of times a week or at the request of.  The maids also replenish supplies of bath and toilet accessories, <span>tea sets</span> and bring bottled drinking water as they are spent. </p><p>  As for the other hotel employees, they also made a very positive impression on our compatriots.  So, travelers claim that the staff here are always friendly, friendly and ready to help in resolving any issue.  True, not all hotel workers understand Russian.  However, everyone speaks English, therefore, remembering the basics of the school curriculum, you can easily explain. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The price of accommodation in Sukhmantra Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (North Goa) includes breakfast only.  According to our compatriots, many dishes were unusual for them.  However, in the morning you could always have a meal with scrambled eggs or scrambled eggs, which the cook will fry according to your order, toasts, fruits and vegetables.  Many have also enjoyed tasting local dishes.  However, experienced travelers are advised to do this carefully, because it is not known how your body will respond to unfamiliar ingredients. </p><p>  As for lunch and dinner, the hotel guests had no problems with this.  So, one could eat both in the hotel restaurant and in one of the many establishments outside it.  According to tourists, necks (as cafes are called here) in Goa can be found everywhere - both on the beach and in the city.  You just have to go to the institution that you liked more.  They cook everywhere the same way, and the prices will surely please Russian travelers. </p>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  From the hotel Sukhmantra Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (India, Candolim), the nearest beach can be reached on foot, according to the guests, in about 15-20 minutes.  The vast majority of tourists initially knew about this, so they did not have any difficulties.  As for the beach, it is quite clean, with a small pleasant sand.  Sunbeds and umbrellas can be rented here for a fee.  However, many vacationers were located on the sun loungers belonging to one of the necks.  If you order drinks there, then sunbeds can be used all day completely free. </p><p>  Also, travelers are advised to visit other beaches of Goa, if possible.  You can do this by ordering an excursion, taking a taxi or renting a motorbike. </p>
