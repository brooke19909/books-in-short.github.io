Release began in the postwar period.  The predecessor at that time was morally obsolete, and a lot of complaints caused the economy of the engine, unreliable brakes, a gearbox without synchronizers, and poor ride. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kuruh.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="GAZ M20 &quot;Victory&quot;" class="if uuid-2510656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43949/2510656.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Initially, the car ‚ÄúVictory M20 DeAgostini‚Äù was planned in two versions as well as the original car.  Modification M25 was equipped with a power unit with six cylinders, and M20 with a four-cylinder analogue.  Digital designations testified to the belonging of vehicles to the new production line of the Gorky Automobile Plant.  These models were characterized by a reduced volume of engines, compared with pre-war counterparts.  Later, the GAZ-21 and 24 became the successors of this kind. </p><p>  The dynamics of the car in question was approximately identical to the Emka (M1).  At the same time, the design of the power plant has become more perfect, providing the best indicators for saving fuel without losing power parameters.  As a result, the engine capacity decreased from 3.5 to 2.1 liters.  Modifications with six work cylinders were soon phased out for a number of reasons, including the inappropriateness of installing such a unit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Below are the performance characteristics of the car, which became the prototype of the ‚ÄúVictory M20 DeAgostini‚Äù: </p><ul><li>  length / width / height - 4.66 / 1.69 / 1.64 m; </li><li>  body - sedan; </li><li>  the number of seats - five; </li><li>  wheel base - 2.7 m; </li><li>  front / rear track - 1364/1362 mm; </li><li>  ground clearance - 20 cm; </li><li>  front / rear suspension unit - coil spring / spring; </li><li>  transmission unit - a three-mode manual gearbox with rear-wheel drive; </li><li>  brakes - rear and front drum type; </li><li>  weight full / equipped - 1.82 / 1.46 t; </li><li>  maximum speed - 105 km / h; </li><li>  gas tank capacity - 55 l; </li><li>  acceleration to "hundreds" - 46 seconds. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="topworldauto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo of the car &quot;Victory M20&quot;" class="if uuid-2510667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43949/2510667.jpg"></div><h2>  Engine Details </h2><p>  Fans of the ‚ÄúVictory M20 DeAgostini‚Äù model will be interested to learn more about the updated power unit of the original car.

Additional help will be provided by various diagrams and illustrations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fruityloops.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Model &quot;Victory M20 DeAgostini&quot;" class="if uuid-2510651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43949/2510651.jpg"></div><p>  Options and dialing options: </p><ul><li>  scaling - 1: 8. </li><li>  length / width / height - 58.2 / 21.2 / 2.03 cm; </li><li>  all four doors open, front wheels turn; </li><li>  front and rear light elements function; </li><li>  hood, trunk, vents are also active; </li><li>  batteries for stoplights and headlights - three AAA batteries. </li></ul><h2>  Where could I buy? </h2><p>  There are two ways to purchase the ‚ÄúVictory M20 DeAgostini‚Äù model, the photo of which is shown below. </p><ul><li>  Firstly, various blocks and parts were in a special magazine.  A complete set requires one hundred issues. </li><li>  Secondly, it was possible to assemble the model in stages, or wait and buy all the issues in order to do your favorite hobby. </li></ul><p>  According to reviews, now this set has already moved into the category of rarities, you can buy it only ‚Äúwith your hands‚Äù or on the manufacturer‚Äôs official website on request. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fruityloops.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Victory M20 DeAgostini&quot;" class="if uuid-2510652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43949/2510652.jpg"></div><h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  In their responses, users note a number of advantages of the model in question. </p><ol><li>  Good detail of all precast elements. </li><li>  The acceptable quality of the coating with which the ‚ÄúVictory M20 DeAgostini‚Äù is painted in the standard version. </li><li>  The lack of color in the body parts. </li><li>  Exclusivity. </li><li>  Moving doors, wheels, working light elements. </li></ol><p>  Among the minuses, the owners point to a rather poor plastic.  Therefore, many craftsmen repaint the model again, because the material without additional processing looks inconspicuous.  It may also be necessary to replace the LEDs in the headlights with warmer analogs.  To store the finished product you will need a special cabinet or airtight box. </p><p>  Among other features: </p><ul><li>  a coil with wiring for connecting standard components is installed in the engine compartment; </li><li>  the set includes technical plates from the manufacturer Wipillily; </li><li>  attached license plates of the same company. </li></ul><p>  When finalizing the product, consumers recommend making a disk for a spare tire, tinting nameplates, hood shapes, bumpers, radiator grilles.  This will enhance the exclusivity of the exterior and the overall impression of the contemplation of the model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nacekomie.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Assembly model &quot;Victory M20&quot;" class="if uuid-2510670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43949/2510670.jpg"></div><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  The true white color of Victory since the M series was very far from modern automotive colors.  At that time, the shade resembled a light gray palette.  In addition, many restorers try to give the surface of the body a glossy finish.  The original post-war machines were not finished in this way.  The fact is that the Soviet coating was of poor quality, the gloss could begin to climb around the warehouse.  It is better to polish the body with the Tamiya finish polish, and on top you can cover with Vaxa. </p><p>  Many modelers are wondering how to tint chips on the ‚ÄúVictory M20 DeAgostini‚Äù?  This can be done with a water-soluble paint such as XF diluted with water with a small addition of vodka.  Also for this purpose, an analog of the variety X, which is mixed with white spirit, is suitable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avtomobile.cc" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Characteristics &quot;GAZ M20 Victory&quot;" class="if uuid-2510676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43949/2510676.jpg"></div><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Some experts argue that it is possible, of course, to repaint the model in question, but they do not advise doing this.  Such things in the original performance in a few years will have collectible value.  This is confirmed by knowledgeable antiquaries and experienced collectors.  By the way, many attribute the Victory body color to the ivory color.  In fact, such a shade on these machines has never been.  Factory painting was more suited to beige decoration (coffee with milk).  Various Soviet equipment of that period, including heavy motorcycles, were handled in a similar manner.  It is worth noting that the original DeAgostini set is as close as possible to the original in color. </p>
