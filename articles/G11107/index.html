It unites the <span>rural population</span> based on customs, socio-cultural and economic ties, community of territory, traditions and geographical conditions.  Now there is a lot of debate about how the village differs from the village and what another term has to do with them - Seltse.  Most experts agree that the village settlement has long been the most popular subject among the Slavs, in particular among the Russian population.  Usually it consisted of 5-10 yards.  Some researchers find the origin of the name of the village from the words "tear" and "tear."  This meant preparing for arable land and clearing land from forest plantations.  This fact is confirmed by the frequent use of the word "village" in the forest regions of the north, where small-yielding villages were the predominant administrative unit. </p>

    <p>  Answering the question "what is the difference between a village and a village", several important nuances can be highlighted.  Firstly, this is a larger number of yards - an average of about twenty-seven plots.  Moreover, on one territory there could be several residential buildings at once, where the grown sons of the owner with their families were located.  In addition, there was a landowner estate and a bazaar.  Secondly, the presence of a church is mandatory.  But such an attachment appeared a little later, with the gradual introduction of the concept of an administrative unit.  Sometimes a village was mistakenly called several villages that were located around one church parish, but had separate resources and were not combined into one settlement.  Thirdly, the number of inhabitants plays an important role.  This indicator depended entirely on population growth, and it was he who led to the gradual expansion, and with it the transformation of the village into a village, and then into a full-fledged village. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  From the foregoing, one can easily understand the difference between a village and a village.  Therefore, let‚Äôs go a little to the side and tell about their predecessor - the settlement.  This settlement is considered an older type of settlement.  The first of them began to appear near fortified cities and fortified lines.  The ‚Äúservants‚Äù and their families lived there primarily.  Experts say that the settlement was the forerunner of the <span>modern village.</span>  It is interesting that the name for such settlements was most often chosen from the memories of their homeland (Chernihiv), by the name of the founder (Karlovka), or the word ‚ÄúNew‚Äù or ‚ÄúSmall‚Äù was added to the already known name. </p>

    <p>  In conclusion, I would like to express the hope that this article will give all the answers to the question of how the village differs from the village, and also say a few words about the variety of these settlements. </p><p>  Rural settlements are: </p><ul><li>  temporary (seasonally habitable) and permanent; </li><li>  scattered and group. </li></ul><p>  The former are common in the Baltic countries and on two different continents: in Australia and North America.  The second in most cases are located throughout Europe, Russia and in Asia. </p><p>  In our country, such rural settlements are known as captures, villages, hamlets, villages, camps, villages, villages and villages. </p>
