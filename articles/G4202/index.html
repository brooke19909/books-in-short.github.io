    <h2>  Smartphone niche </h2><p>  The hardware parameters leave no doubt that the Lenovo A5000 belongs to the initial segment of smartphones.  W3bsit3-dns.com - a forum where users discuss the characteristics of certain devices - this only confirms once again.  Owners allocate a memory subsystem, which is already very modest, as by today's standards.  The same can be said about the central processor, which is outdated both morally and physically.  But there is one significant advantage with this gadget - an increased battery capacity.  Therefore, this smartphone is of most interest to those who need an entry-level device with increased battery life. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Standard equipment for this entry-level smart phone.  It includes the following: </p><ul><li><p>  Cellular telephone. </p></li><li><p>  Removable battery with a nominal capacity of 4000mAh. </p></li><li><p>  Cord for charging the battery and for synchronizing with a PC. </p></li><li><p>  Charging adapter. </p></li><li><p>  Warranty card. </p></li><li><p>  Brochure on the operation of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div></li></ul><p>  The case of this gadget is made of plastic, and the case for Lenovo A5000 will keep its original condition.  The owner of this phone will have to buy this accessory separately and, of course, for an additional fee.  The second important accessory is a protective film, which will protect the front panel of the device from possible damage.  There is a slot for installing an external drive in this device, but the drive itself will have to be bought additionally.  Well, another important accessory that is not included in the original equipment by the manufacturer is a stereo headset. </p>

    <h2>  A few words about design </h2><p>  In terms of design, something unusual cannot boast of an entry-level device.  A 5-inch display protected by shockproof glass is displayed on its front side.  There is no <span>oleophobic coating</span> here, and therefore, removing the remaining fingerprints will not be so simple.  Therefore, the smartphone owner is strongly recommended to purchase a high-quality protective film and stick it on the front panel of the cell phone.  At the bottom of the display, a control unit of three touch buttons is displayed.  From above, the earpiece and front camera are displayed.  There are also sensors here, among which separately you need to highlight the display brightness control sensor.  Not every entry-level gadget boasts the presence of such a component.  Interface wired micro-USB ports and audio jacks are competently grouped on the top edge of the gadget.  Well, on the opposite side there is only a conversational microphone.  Physical control buttons are displayed on the right side of the device.  On the back there is only a loud speaker, a peephole of the main camera and its LED backlight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  <strong>Computational Capabilities</strong> </h2><p>  As noted earlier, a modest CPU is installed in the <span>Lenovo A5000.</span>  Reviews are only once again only confirm.  More specifically, we are talking about MT6582, developed by MediaTek.  This processor has been on the market for about two years now.  During this time, decisions based on it ‚Äúslipped‚Äù from the middle price range to the budget segment.  It consists of four 32-bit computing cores of the A7 architecture.  Each of them cannot boast of a high level of performance.  But the lack of the latter is compensated by the presence of four cores at once.  On the other hand, the A7 architecture boasts a high level of energy efficiency.  Also, this processor solution can dynamically change its clock frequency in the range from 300 MHz to 1.3 GHz.  Well, modules that are not involved in calculations are automatically disabled.  This allows even more flexible use of battery life.  For most tasks, this semiconductor chip is enough.  The exceptions in this regard are the most recent 64-bit programs and the most demanding 3D games.  This software on this gadget, alas, will not be able to fully function. </p>

    <h2>  Video accelerator </h2><p>  This cell phone has a graphics accelerator such as the Mali-400MP2.  An outstanding level of performance, he can not boast.  This is not surprising - this is a budget class solution.  The main task of this chip is the processing of graphic information displayed on the display.  In this case, the central processor is not used to perform this operation.  The result is a significant increase in the performance of the mobile gadget, which is observed in this particular case.  Therefore, even mid-level toys are on this device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display and its parameters </h2><p>  Of course, the display can be attributed to the advantages of this model of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone.  First of all, you need to select the matrix, which in this device is manufactured using the IPS technology.  As a result, the picture quality is perfect, and the viewing angles are as close as possible to the maximum possible 180 degrees.  The only criticism in this case is the presence of an air gap between the touch panel and the screen matrix.  But do not forget that this is a <span>budget device</span> and the same drawback is present in most other similar devices of this price range.  The display resolution is 1280x720, the pixel density in this case is 294 ppi.  Of course, this is not an outstanding indicator at the moment, but for a budget device this is quite enough. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  A very modest memory subsystem in the <span>Lenovo A5000.</span>  8 GB - this is how much the capacity of the built-in drive is.  This is indeed a very modest value today.  At the same time, the operating system occupies 3 GB, and 2 GB is reserved for the installation of new software.  The remaining 3 GB users can use to store personal data (documents, photos, videos, books, and so on).  There is also the possibility of installing an external drive.  The corresponding slot is in this gadget.  Its maximum capacity can be in this case 32 GB.  The worst situation with this smartphone with RAM.  Its only 1 GB.  At the same time, pre-installed software takes about 600 MB after the download is completed.  In this case, 400 MB is allocated for the user's needs.  For any one task, this is quite enough.  But if two or three applications are launched at the same time, there may be problems with the smooth operation of the interface on this gadget. </p><h2>  Photo and video </h2><p>  Average characteristics in the main camera of this device.  The sensor element is 8 megapixels.  There is autofocus and a single LED backlight.  With a good level of illumination, photos turn out to be of very good quality.  But with its lack, one LED does not really save.  The quality of such photos is far from ideal.  The video here is recorded in 720p format with a refresh rate of 30 frames per second.  In this case, a normal level of illumination is needed.  Otherwise, the quality of the video will be very poor.  The front camera is based on a 2 megapixel sensor element.  For the now popular ‚Äúselfie‚Äù this will not be enough.  At least its quality will be very modest.  But video calls using the Lenovo A5000 DUAL can be made, and the picture quality will be quite good.  But, again, the lighting should be acceptable. </p>

    <h2>  Gadget Autonomy </h2><p>  The strength is autonomy in the Lenovo A5000.  The battery in this case boasts an impressive capacity of 4000 mAh.  At the same time, we also take into account a high degree of energy efficiency of the processor solution and a medium-sized display.  As a result, we get even with the maximum load of 12-14 hours of operation on a single charge of the built-in battery.  If you use the gadget in average mode, you can get 2 days of work.  Well, in the most economical mode, this smartphone can last 4-5 days.  So Lenovo A5000 DUAL from the standpoint of autonomy really leaves far behind most of its competitors.  This is its key plus. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  A typical set of information transfer methods, as for an entry-level device, in the Lenovo A5000.  W3bsit3-dns.com - <strong> </strong>  the forum we talked about is filled with reviews highlighting their excellent quality of work.  The list of interfaces in this case includes the following: </p><ul><li><p>  Full support for GSM networks (i.e. 2G) and WCDMA (or, as they are also called, 3G).  In the first case, the real speed can reach 0.5 Mbps.  This allows you to comfortably communicate on social networks and upload unpretentious Internet resources.  Well, in the second case, you can count on 21 Mbit / s, and this will already allow you to view online video and download large enough websites already.  Among the disadvantages of this gadget is the lack of support for LTE technology (i.e. 4G).  But, on the other hand, it has not yet received a sufficiently large distribution.  And not every entry-level device boasts the presence of its support. </p></li><li><p>  The main way to get data from the Internet is Wifi.  It allows data to be downloaded at speeds of up to 100 Mbps.  This is enough to download any amount of information on the gadget. </p></li><li><p>  Also, this smartphone is equipped with a wireless transmitter such as Bluetooth.  It allows you to connect various devices to your smartphone (for example, a wireless stereo headset or a similar gadget). </p></li><li><p>  For the navigation capabilities of the device, GPS and A-GPS technologies are responsible.  The first of them is perfect for determining the location outside the village, and it is based on the use of navigation satellites.  Well, in the second case, mobile towers and an Internet connection are used for these purposes.  This method is well suited for large cities, where the density of <span>base stations is</span> quite high. </p></li><li><p>  To output an audio signal, this unit is equipped with an audio jack. </p></li><li><p>  Micro-USB allows you to connect Lenovo A5000 to a PC.  Also with its help, the smartphone battery is charged. </p></li></ul>

    <h2>  Device software </h2><p>  In this case, ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù acts as the OS with the most common and currently popular version 4.4.  It is such software that is preinstalled in the Lenovo A5000.  Customization <strong> </strong>  the interface in this case is minimal: there is no separate menu for programs, and you can hide shortcuts only using folders.  But the same nuance is true for all other budget devices today.  Such an organization of the interface makes iOS and Android very similar to each other in <strong> </strong>  Lenovo A5000.  Update <strong> </strong>  up to version 5.0, the manufacturer‚Äôs plans are present, but it‚Äôs not yet known when it will be released. </p><h2>  Owners opinion </h2><p>  A weak main camera and modest equipment are the main disadvantages of the Lenovo A5000.  Reviews highlight the poor quality of photos and videos received with the main camera.  Although the manufacturer declared 8 megapixels in this case, but in most cases they correspond to the real 5 megapixels.  And you won‚Äôt get anywhere from this.  Perhaps the situation will change after the release of the latest firmware version of the device, which should appear in the foreseeable future.  Most of the problems of the main camera are related to software, and this problem can be solved by processing system software.  Well, you can‚Äôt expect exclusive equipment for a budget smartphone, and the same case for Lenovo A5000 <strong> </strong>  the new owner will have to buy separately and at an additional cost.  The same is true for other accessories that are not included with the device.  Well, the advantages of this device are: high battery capacity and high-quality display.  Indeed, a capacity of 4000 mAh allows the device to work on a single charge for 2-3 days at an average load.  Well, the screen in this device is really high quality and does not cause any complaints. </p><h2>  How much is? </h2><p>  Another plus is the cost of the Lenovo A5000.  Its price is 130 dollars.  On the one hand, this is slightly higher than the cost of the same products of direct competitors.  But if you take into account the parameters of the device, then everything falls into place.  A key role here is played by a battery with increased capacity.  Well, the autonomy of the device because of this is much better.  Therefore, the inflated price is compensated, first of all, by this parameter.  It is also necessary to take into account the display and the central processor and everything falls into place.  The white version of this gadget costs $ 5-10 more. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Excellent technical parameters and autonomy in the Lenovo A5000.  Price and main camera are the main disadvantages of this phone.  Overpriced is offset by improved autonomy compared to peers.  Well, the camera for an entry-level device is not so bad in the Lenovo A5000.  Reviews on this occasion indicate that if you need a better camera, then you need to buy a smartphone not of a budget level, but of a middle class, which costs significantly more.  So it turns out that the Lenovo A5000 can be an excellent solution for those who need an inexpensive smartphone with improved autonomy. </p>
