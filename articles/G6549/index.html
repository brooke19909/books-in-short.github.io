    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  But tourists who visited the Globus 3 * hotel (Prague) leave reviews not only positive.  Among the hotel guests there are those who did not like their stay here.

Sometimes it does not work well in the room or is completely turned off. </li><li>  Kettles and refrigerators are not available in all rooms.  The bathroom lacks a hairdryer, and the toiletries are very scarce. </li><li>  There are no parking places in the evening. </li><li>  Unfriendly staff.  The administrator does not greet visitors, and the maids can even be rude. </li><li>  The room has dirty and dusty windows, the carpet is also poorly cleaned.  Shower in the bathroom is leaking. </li><li>  The park is not lit in the evening, so finding a hotel in the dark is quite difficult. </li><li>  Breakfast does not serve fruits and vegetables. </li></ul><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Thus, the Globus 3 * hotel (Prague) is unlikely to give you a first-class level of service.  The presence of significant flaws can spoil the impression of travel.  But for those tourists who want to relax cheaply in the Czech Republic, it will be an ideal option.  Great location, good rooms, quiet environment - all this contributes to a quality and affordable stay.  Globus is suitable for couples, and for youth companies, and for senior citizens. </p>
