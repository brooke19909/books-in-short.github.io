In comparison with fellow giants, it‚Äôs more like little bridges - modest, pedestrian.  But what an original!  Let us leave for the future the stories of suspension chain <span>bridges by Lion</span> and Pochtamtsky.  Today we turn all eyes to the <span>Bank Bridge,</span> opened on the Catherine (Griboedov) channel in July 1826.  Its decoration was the mythical winged lion, but not one, but four at once! </p>

    <h2>  Nearby was a bank </h2><p>  Events succeed, but memory remains.  Today, in an expressive building on Sadovaya, one of the oldest universities in Russia is based - St. Petersburg State University of Economics and Finance.  And once the State Assignation Bank was located.  Therefore, the bridge was called Banking.  The sculptures of golden-winged lions, a symbol of security and stability, molded in the form of the sculptor P.P. Sokolov, are his <span>visiting card.</span> </p><p>  Tourists and strolling locals like to look at the reflection of strange profiles in the evening waters.  At such moments, it seems to some dreamers that the channel starting from the Moika does not lead to the Fontanka, but to distant uncharted lands, to where the legends about griffins were born. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Indeed, the winged lion often appears as a griffin.  Some believe that this is not entirely true (they say that unknown animals do not have bird heads).  Others claim that these fantastic creatures were diverse, including those with a lion "tower".  Be that as it may, the author of the sculptures clearly knew: griffins became famous in mythology as guardians of treasures - and decided that his offspring would have similar features, because they would sit on pedestals near a large credit institution. </p>

    <h2>  Lions - separately, wings - separately </h2><p>  So, you already know that a bridge in St. Petersburg with winged lions can be seen and walk along it, going to the central part of the city, to the Griboedov Canal.  The Griffin Miracle connects the Spassky and Kazan islands (located near the Nevsky Prospekt-2 metro station).  The bridge is considered one of the best decorations of the city on the Neva. </p><p>  According to historical information, poultry-like cast-iron animals 2.85 meters high were made in the shops of the Aleksandrovsky Iron Foundry.  The indicated figure also includes the length of the wings.  But the manufacturing of the sights for centuries took place in three stages: the first was a casting of the components of a hollow figure (a connecting seam is visible on the backs of the animals), the second is the minting of copper wings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Proud guards </h2><p>  The third (assembly) was probably the most impressive.  Especially when the very first lion was ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù - winged, powerful.  They say that in the XIX century, gilding on the fabulous plumage was made of pure gold (pure).  In 1967 (and then in 1988), the spraying was updated with tinsel, however, in the new millennium (namely in 2009), the precious layer was removed altogether. </p><p>  But even without expensive jewelry, individuals with eagle eyes and a lion's grin, ready to fly into the St. Petersburg sky, continue to gaze proudly from the opposite banks of the canal at each other and people walking along the bridge.  The silent proud guard has less romantic, but important tasks.  Their heads hold curved supports for lanterns with spherical shades.  "Gander" painted in bronze, gilded.  At sunrise and sunset the sparkling is unspeakable. </p>

    <h2>  Built for centuries </h2><p>  The authors of the project, engineers V.K. Tretter and V.A. Khristianovich, conceived the construction of a length of 28 m, a width of 2.5 m. They brought the idea to life with the help of the best foundry-mechanical enterprise - Byrd plant (founded by Charles Byrd in 1792) .  Cast iron and metal parts were made and then assembled there.  Hollow sculptures (‚Äúwinged lion‚Äù) hide the ‚Äúengineering kitchen‚Äù - the places of cable fastenings, mechanisms. </p><p>  Despite the fact that it was just a single-span hanging structure, the work was not easy.  The quality of the installation of chains, pendants, wooden canvas, pylons and other components depended on the strength of the structure, which was built for more than one day.  Over the years of service, the bridge was repaired, but the excellent basic work still inspires respect for the sedate, thorough approach of the ancestors (in the broad sense of the word) to everything that they did. </p>

    <h2>  Bring happiness </h2><p>  The bridge with winged lions in <span>St. Petersburg is decorated with</span> sculptures that reflect the myths of the distant past.  What are the legends of today?  Although, if you believe in miracles, you can consider this a real guarantee of success.  Beliefs are based on the magical properties of griffins.  So, you need to quietly approach the fantastic creatures sitting on their hind legs, and rub their ‚Äúpoop‚Äù on the left.  Your wish will come true!  For the sake of this, you can also try to reach two lions at once. </p><p>  It is recommended to put a coin on its paw ‚Äì‚Äì to increase wealth, of course.  By the way, such coins during the restoration in the cavities found a huge amount.  Apparently, it is human nature to hope to the last and believe in the "dream come true".  Found restorers and many notes.  People asked different things in them: love, happiness, health, return to St. Petersburg, help in passing the session and hundreds more important things.  We are sure: every winged lion is sympathetic to the aspirations of the people. </p>
