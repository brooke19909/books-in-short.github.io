In addition, the entrance to the sea is gentle, which is very important for vacationers with small children. </li><li>  The range of children's dishes, although not the widest, but the child will never remain hungry.  The menu contains quite tasty diet dishes. </li><li>  An unforgettable experience makes an excursion to Paradise Island.  Guests are taken by boat to their destination. </li><li>  Settlement is fast.

At some points, guests express dissatisfaction.  Here are the shortcomings and shortcomings inherent in the resort complex under consideration: </p><ul><li>  The staff at the hotel's retail outlets is too intrusive.  Some workers may be rude to guests if they do not want to buy anything. </li><li>  The spa has a scruffy feel.  Cleaning is not thorough enough, and towels and bathrobes are washed. </li><li>  The hotel staff is indifferent to the guests.  Little smiles and attention.  Although for some, such a distance is a positive thing. </li><li>  The seats in the amphitheater are dirty covers.  Sitting on them is unpleasant. </li><li>  The smoke detectors in the rooms have very bright light indicators that interfere with sleep at night. </li><li>  Despite the fact that the hotel is divided into smoking and non-smoking areas, none of the staff does not monitor compliance with this distinction. </li><li>  The hotel is very noisy from day and night events.  Moreover, the sounds are clearly heard in the numbers, regardless of the location of the case. </li><li>  Unfavorable exchange rate at the point at the hotel. </li><li>  The food is monotonous.  From plant foods it‚Äôs hard to find anything other than cucumbers and tomatoes. </li><li>  The rooms located on the lower floors have a strong smell of sewage.  After the plumbing visit, the problem goes away for a while, but soon returns again. </li><li>  Egyptian hotels usually have delicious desserts.  But in this institution they are kind of fresh. </li><li>  The hotel feels total savings on everything. </li><li>  Instead of freshly squeezed juices, the restaurant serves instant powder drinks. </li><li>  Tasteless coffee.  Even for an additional fee, you can not find a delicious invigorating drink. </li><li>  The restaurant menu has very few fruits.  Moreover, they are not served every day. </li><li>  The pools have very cold water, and for some reason they do not include heating (although it was initially stated that such a possibility was available). </li><li>  Wireless Internet does not work well, regardless of whether you use the free service or bought a package. </li><li>  All guests are accommodated in old buildings.  Newly renovated are temporarily mothballed due to reduced tourist flow. </li></ul>
