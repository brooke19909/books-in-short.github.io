    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Rethymno Mare Hotel 5 * is located in the western part of the beautiful island of Crete.  To be more precise, in the city of Rethymnon.  This is a completely unique place.  It is distinguished by its unique architecture, narrow streets, carved window frames, the Venetian port and preserved Greek identity.  About 10-12 kilometers from it is the village of Scaletta.  And it was here, a little less than 30 years ago, that a hotel was built, which is now so popular.  The last restoration, by the way, was in 2014, so everything inside is modern and new. </p><p>  The hotel has its own private beach, which is literally a few steps from the building.  True, the airport is far away - in Heraklion.  It is a little less than 80 kilometers from here. </p><p>  Tourists can find a bus stop near the building.  A regular taxi runs from there to Rethymnon and other nearby towns.  And it is worth taking this into account, since all sights must be reached by transport.  This is the Venetian port, the center of Byzantine art, archaeological and historical-ethnographic museums, a city park and many other interesting places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is in the hotel? </h2><p>  Rethymno Mare Hotel 5 * offers a variety of services, ranging from free private parking and high-speed Internet to a 24-hour reception and currency exchange. </p><p>  It also offers services in the delivery of drinks and food, as well as the sale of tickets, caregivers on call, laundry assistance, transfer and rental cars, motorbikes and bicycles.  The hotel has several shops, so tourists do not even need to leave the hotel to purchase anything. </p>

    <h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  Well, now about the cost.  Prices for apartments in this hotel are unfixed.  And sometimes they can differ so that it will be difficult to believe.  For example, if you reserve the previously mentioned apartments somewhere six months before check-in, you will need to pay only 42 tons.  per week of relaxation (with half board).  But if you come to your senses a week or two before the planned arrival, the price will increase to 100 tons.  per day.  And this is really true - you can check it yourself by making a test reservation.  Therefore, it is very important to carefully plan your vacation. </p><p>  Better to take advantage of early booking.  It will be in all plans a justified act.  The first plus is favorable prices.  Second - you can choose your favorite number, and not reserve the remaining free.  There are other hotels in Crete with Russian-speaking staff, but Rethymno Mare Royal (this, by the way, is the full name of the complex) is very popular, so the apartments are literally snapping up. </p>

And this is only 18 tons.  from each. </p><h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  Check-in at the hotel starts at 14:00, and ends at 23:00.  Check out lasts until noon.  But, as the guests here said, this framework is conditional.  If tourists arrived earlier, and their rooms are ready to move in, they will place guests right away.  Arrived later than 23:00?  It's okay too. </p><p>  The hotel can live with children.  If the baby is not two years old, a cradle will be provided for him, and absolutely free of charge.  You can also bring pets to the hotel, but this is on a preliminary request.  In general, if there are any nuances, then you need to mention them even when drawing up a reservation request.
