In terms of size, the models are rather cumbersome.  The parameter of their rated power starts from 2 kW.  For large families, devices of this type are great.  Before you buy a device, it's important to consider performance.  At the same time, component materials play an important role.  To understand in more detail indirect water heaters, you need to understand the principle of their work. </p><h2>  The principle of operation of the device </h2><p>  The market offers a wide variety of indirect heaters.  The principle of operation of the device is to heat the spiral element.  Initially, the voltage from the 220 V network is supplied to the power supply.  Next, the control system is activated.  The inlet pressure of the device depends on the valve.  In order to protect the system from overvoltage, a fuse is required.  Setting the water temperature is carried out thanks to the controller.  Conductivity of heating elements is quite different. </p><p>  Water supply occurs through a branch pipe.  In some cases, a flexible hose is used.  The coolant is connected to the insulator.  With increasing model power, the heating spiral element inside the tank heats up.  Heated water enters through the outlet pipe.  In this case, the control unit is used with a stabilizer.  The temperature limit is controlled by a thermometer. </p>

    <h2>  How to connect the device? </h2><p>  Connecting an indirect water heater is quite simple.  First of all, the tank is fixed directly.  Most often, horizontal stops are used for this purpose.  In this case, much depends on the size of the water heater.  After fixing the tank, proceed to connecting the pipe to the water supply system.  For this purpose, a metal clip is used.  Direct connection in the devices is provided with a screw type.  The outlet pipe is connected to the mixer.  The power cable plugs into an outlet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
