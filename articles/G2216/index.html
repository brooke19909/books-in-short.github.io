    <p>  Eve was born in Munich <span>on February 6,</span> 1912. Hitler's future wife Eva Braun grew up in an ordinary German family, whose biography turned out to be so atypical.  She was the second child.  Friedrich Brown, her father, worked as a teacher, and Francis, the girl‚Äôs mother, was a dressmaker.  Frederick raised his three daughters in the strict traditions of Christianity.  He did not allow them liberties and did not really indulge in affection and attention. </p><p>  Eve graduated from the monastery school, and then the Munich Lyceum.  After that, she began working in a photo studio.  Friedrich Brown continued to control his matured daughters.  Without his permission, they were forbidden to call, leave home, or meet friends.  Their future was seen by Frederick quite definitely.  They must marry, have children and begin a respectable family life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Work in a shop </h2><p>  However, the romantic Eva, a big lover of lady-romance and cinema, dreamed not of such a life.  She wanted to make her beautiful, bright, filled with events and love.  In a sense, Hitler's future wife Eva Brown achieved her goal.  The biography, photos and details of her romance with Adolf are still being discussed by many. </p>

    <p>  The shop in which Eva worked was owned by a fan of the Nazi party.  This man was a personal photographer of Adolf Hitler, a rising star.  Eve did not know anything about this party, nor about its leader.  The girl was not at all interested in politics.  In 1929, Hitler himself appeared in the studio.  He needed to take pre-election photos. </p><h2>  Acquaintance with Hitler </h2><p>  The first thing that struck Adolf when he entered was the <span>slender legs of the</span> girl who stood on the stepladder.  Hitler spoke to her, not hiding sympathy.  This mysterious man captivated Eva Brown with his exquisite compliments, stories from social life, as well as the halo of power and strength that surrounded him. </p><p>  Adolf knew how to please women, fascinate them, and not only them.  A little later, he managed to conquer many people with his charm.  They believed in his truly monstrous ideas.  Is it any wonder that the naive girl Eva Braun succumbed to the madness that subsequently swept across Germany? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The girl, of course, was flattered by the attention of such a famous person.  She was proud of his admiration.  Adolf liked her naturalness, spontaneity and youth in Eve.  It was also important for him that it was Aryan blood that Hitler's future wife Eva Brown had.  Her nationality was carefully checked by Adolf's helpers. </p><p>  By the way, quite recently a different opinion appeared about Eva's nationality thanks to the DNA analysis.  He was subjected to hair from the comb of this woman, discovered in the Alpine residence of the Fuhrer in a box on which was written the name of Hitler's wife, or rather, his initials (E.V.).  Scientists have found that Brown DNA contains a mutation that is typical of Ashkenazi Jews.  If Hitler found out about this, he would probably be horrified. </p><h2>  Features of the relationship of Hitler and Eve </h2><p>  Adolf was 23 years older than his lover, and it was he who always set the tone in their relationship.  When Hitler and Brown began dating (going to theaters and cinema, going to picnics, etc.), Adolf determined the frequency, duration and place of the meetings.  He had very little time for Eve, because this man always had a political career in the first place.  Hitler liked to say that his bride was Germany. </p><p>  However, Adolf found time to meet with other women.  He appeared with his companions in the light and did not really try to hide this fact from Eve.  More than once captivated by his demonic charms, women who failed to achieve reciprocity made attempts to commit suicide.  For example, Hitler's niece, whom Adolf showed <span>attention,</span> shot herself after a quarrel with him.  This man already in his youth sow destruction and death around him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Eve agreed to the rules of the game imposed on her by Hitler.  She decided on this because the feeling of this woman was deep and strong.  In addition, Eve saw in Hitler the most suitable batch for herself.  Her character was not hated by her subordinate position.  However, the girl still suffered, and sometimes the torment of Eve became simply unbearable. </p><h2>  Why did Hitler hide his beloved </h2><p>  When Hitler disappeared somewhere for several months, the woman repeatedly tried to commit suicide.  For some reason, it did not occur to her to simply part with Adolf, thereby ending this painful relationship.  At the request of Hitler, their relationship was strictly conspiratorial.  Adolf wanted no one to know about their relationship.  He believed that otherwise his position in society would be in danger.  Hitler wanted to see himself as the legendary Fuhrer, the leader of the nation, devoid of all the weaknesses and feelings inherent in man. </p><h2>  How did Eve's parents relate to her relationship with Adolf </h2><p>  Eve's parents, especially her father, believed that the girl made a mistake by choosing the wrong person.  They reproached Eve for living with Hitler "in sin."  This reinforced the desire, natural for the girl, to become a legal spouse.  But Adolf did not want to think about marriage. </p><h2>  Relocation to Berghof </h2><p>  Unable to break off relations with such a selfish and cold lover, the girl for a long time maintained the belief that one day she would become Frau Hitler.  Eva Brown adopted the lifestyle and views of Adolf. </p><p>  As soon as Hitler became Reich Chancellor of Germany, he immediately made Eve his secretary.  The girl moved to Berghof, his alpine residence.  In this secluded place, she became, on the one hand, the mistress, but on the other - a captive hidden from prying eyes.  This is the double role that Hitler's wife was forced to play.  The photo below is one of the few collaborative images of Adolf and Eve. </p>

    <p>  Eve was allowed to appear in society only in the presence of people whom Hitler considered the closest.  When famous politicians and other high-ranking guests came to Berghof, Eve had to hide from them.  Brown and Hitler lived in different apartments.  Their rooms were connected by a common corridor.  Only the F√ºhrer decided when he needed Eve's presence.  Hitler's common-law wife Eva Braun could not call his apartment on an internal telephone.  I had to wait for calls from Adolf. </p><h2>  Eve Attractions </h2><p>  The girl had her own entertainment.  Eve, Hitler's wife, had a good time inviting her friends and sisters to parties or going shopping.  In material terms, the F√ºhrer did not limit his beloved - she could buy anything that she liked. </p><p>  Eve really liked to get new clothes, trinkets and jewelry.  Sometimes she even flew to Austria and Italy to shop.  Eve enjoyed her role as an inveterate fashionista.  She could change clothes six times a day.  Of course, what else could she do? .. </p>

    <p>  Another hobby Brown was photographing.  The girl dreamed that her newsreels, in which she captured the daily life of Hitler, would become the basis of a biographical film about him, shot in Hollywood.  Eva Brown still remembered her desire to become a film actress.  Therefore, she dreamed that she would play herself in this film: the great lover of a great man. </p><p>  Gymnastics was another passion of this girl.  Hitler's wife Eva Brown brought her figure to perfection with daily exercises.  Photos and footage of newsreels of those years captured her in complex acrobatic poses.  The girl liked to do gymnastics against the background of alpine landscapes. </p><h2>  Best time for Eve </h2><p>  The best time for Eve was the end of the 1930s.  Her man was the leader of a great nation, and very soon - the girl did not doubt it - the whole world would fall at his feet.  Eva Brown shared the triumph with Hitler, but was still in the shadows.  Adolf never appeared in public with Eve.  He wanted no one to know what was the name of Hitler's wife.  It seemed to not exist, and not only for the general public, but even for most of his associates. </p><h2>  The stick and carrot tactics </h2><p>  Narcissistic, mentally unstable Hitler adhered to the time-tested tactics of "carrot and stick" in relations with his beloved.  If he believed that the girl was behaving too freely, he could yell at Eve, humiliate her even with strangers.  When Hitler thought that he had gone too far, he began to show her signs of attention and crouch.  Hitler was sure that this girl was completely in his power. </p><h2>  Life in a fantasy world </h2>

    <p>  Eve was an observant and intelligent woman, but at the same time detached and dreamy.  During her life with Hitler, she learned enough about what is happening in the world in order to understand: she does not want to know anything else.  The girl learned not to understand and not to hear.  Hitler's common-law wife, like the Fuhrer, tried with all her strength to live in a prosperous fictional world.  Adolf, who condemned a lot of people to painful death, himself tried to fence himself off from the horrors that he was causing.  At home, there was a strict ban on discussing genocide and war.  Hitler never visited concentration camps and did not personally participate in the killings and bullying provoked by him. </p><h2>  Beginning of the End </h2><p>  After the German troops were defeated at Stalingrad, the carefree atmosphere reigning in Berghof gradually began to change, despite the fact that Eva and all of its inhabitants did their best to pretend that everything was fine.  At this time, the relationship between Brown and Hitler was closer than ever. </p>

    <p>  The F√ºhrer, for the first time in his life, failed, needed support and comfort.  Eve struggled to distract her lover from pessimistic thoughts.  She did not want to know about the hundreds of thousands of people who were tortured by order of Adolf.  She was only interested in his well-being and mood. </p><p>  As before, the woman cherished the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbecoming Hitler's lawful wife and giving birth to his children.  She thought that now something would certainly change.  However, the hopes of Eva Braun were again shattered.  Hitler did not want to hear about the child.  He said that children of genius have a very hard time in life. </p><h2>  Hitler's fall, suicide of Eve and Adolf </h2><p>  When the Allied forces approached Berlin, Adolf moved to the bunker, which was under the Reich Chancellery.  And he decided to send his beloved to Munich, where it was safe.  But Eve did not submit to Hitler for the first time.  The girl came to Berlin to share his fall with her lover, as she once shared a triumph. </p><p>  On April 29, 1945, Hitler finally made an official proposal to Eva Braun.  The woman who had been waiting for this for 16 years, of course, agreed.  However, she was destined to become Frau Hitler for only one day.  On April 30, 1945, after the wedding night, Hitler's wife and he committed suicide.  Thus, the fortuneteller‚Äôs prediction came true, but life made terrible corrections to it ... Today, many people know what was the name of Adolf Hitler‚Äôs wife, but she paid for this fame with her life. </p>
