However, it is simply impossible to see the main monuments of North Palmyra, falling in love at first sight, in one trip.  To explore all the corners of a fantastically beautiful city on the Neva, it will not be enough for several years. </p><p>  But there are still unusual sights of St. Petersburg that are of interest to those who are tempted by popular architectural works.  Often guides do not include interesting corners in their routes, and official guides to the great city do not even mention them.  Today we look at the work of Peter from a different angle and take a fascinating journey through little-known places, often left unattended by tourists. </p><h2>  Cathedral Mosque </h2><p>  Northern Venice has always been a multinational city in which people who profess different religions coexisted peacefully.  This is confirmed by the unusual sights of St. Petersburg - one of the largest mosques in the world and a Buddhist temple that serve as a real decoration of the Northern capital of Russia. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The most interesting and unusual places in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1763709.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, it was closed under Soviet rule, and only 60 years ago the cathedral mosque, located next to Troitskaya Square in the area called "Tatarka", was returned to believers.  The bright turquoise dome covered with ceramic mosaic is visible even on a cloudy day, while minarets directed into the sky bring bright colors to the city landscape. </p><h2>  A masterpiece descended from the pages of oriental tales </h2><p>  A magnificent architectural masterpiece, the walls of which are finished with gray granite and decorated with an ornamental pattern, as if descended from the pages of oriental tales.  A spacious building appeared near the mosque, where Muslims, before entering the temple, perform a ritual bath.  Unusual sights of St. Petersburg can be visited by all tourists subject to certain rules.  At the entrance you need to take off your shoes and turn off your cell phone, and women can enter the hall reserved for prayer only with their heads covered and in closed clothes. </p><h2>  Buddhist temple on Primorsky Prospekt </h2><p>  Temples of all religions are comfortably located on the <span>banks of the Neva</span> , and therefore it is not surprising that at the beginning of the last century on the outskirts of the city a so-called Tibetan miracle appeared - datsan Gunzechoynei.  It is curious that the architect involved in the project decided to endow the religious monument with the features of the Northern Art Nouveau style popular in Europe. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What interesting places in St. Petersburg are worth visiting" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1762570.jpg" width="600"></div>

Before entering the temple, spinning drums with prayer mantras are installed, and each visitor cranks them in the hope of fulfilling a cherished desire.  In the altar hall there is a statue of Buddha made of papier-m√¢ch√© and covered <span>with gold leaf.</span>  Divine services are held here, and lamas give lectures on Buddhism. </p><p>  Any tourist, regardless of religion, can visit interesting places and attractions of St. Petersburg on Primorsky Prospekt.  Moving inside the temple, which works on all days except Wednesday, should be exclusively in the direction of the sun - from left to right. </p><h2>  Mosaic patio </h2><p>  To see the unusual sights of St. Petersburg, not included in the standard guidebooks, is the dream of any visitor to the city.  <span>The mosaic courtyard,</span> located on Tchaikovsky Street, is the very place that is better to be seen once.  The unique <span>open-air museum was</span> created by the hands of pupils of the Small Academy of Arts, and the St. Petersburg artist V. Lubenko was the ideological inspiration.  The ordinary courtyard, which is hiding from casual passers-by, has become a canvas for creative people who decorated it with colorful mosaics. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Unusual sights of St. Petersburg for children" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1763706.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A wonderful corner shimmering in all shades of the rainbow is a rather young attraction, widely known among local residents.  Paths, curbs, benches, ground floors and numerous sculptures are decorated with colorful mosaic panels on a variety of topics.  The guests of the amazing courtyard delightedly peer into the creation of human hands, finding something new in bizarre plexuses.  The best time to visit the fabulous corner is a bright sunny day, when multi-colored tiles play under the rays of the sun. </p><h2>  Chinese "Garden of Friendship" </h2><p>  What interesting places in St. Petersburg should tourists visit?  Those who want to visit the Northern capital - the leader in the number of twin cities - and at the same time visit China, should go to Liteiny Prospekt, where the Friendship Garden, donated by Shanghai, is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã2000 m2.  The unfinished square turned in a few months into a piece of the Celestial Empire, the entrance to which is guarded by two stone lions.  The design of the kindergarten is quite functional: in a beautiful corner where it is so nice to relax, a pagoda designed for an open-air tea ceremony and fountains beating from the pond appeared.  The pond is surrounded by a variety of stones that are scattered throughout the garden.  According to legend, they create the illusion of mountain ranges in miniature. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most unusual sights in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1762563.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The green oasis, which is the youngest exotic attraction, harmoniously blended with urban architecture.  The colorful "Garden of Friendship" not only makes visitors involved in Chinese culture, but also helps to comprehend the laws of harmony and beauty. </p><h2>  Roofs of Northern Venice </h2><p>  Listing the most interesting and unusual places in St. Petersburg, one cannot but mention the city rooftops, from which truly unforgettable views are opened.  However, viewing photographs and listening to eyewitnesses' stories is not at all that it is much more interesting to get to know the many-sided city from a bird‚Äôs flight.  Unfortunately, there are not many open and accessible roofs, and getting on them to enjoy the most beautiful panoramas is very difficult on your own.  But for those who want to legally see Peter at a glance, there are special excursion routes that will open the city from a new angle. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of the most unusual sights of spb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1763701.jpg"></div>

To get acquainted with a curious architectural masterpiece, it is worth going to Kolokolnaya Street, where the object of cultural heritage stands - the so-called gingerbread house.  Similar to a beautiful tower from a folk tale, it was built at the beginning of the last century.

Relatively recently, a non-existent street appeared, a sign of which flaunts in the courtyard of the art center on Pushkinskaya.  This is an interesting corner for those who want to get acquainted with the reverse side of North Palmyra and appreciate street art. </p><p>  The corner, which is not mentioned by any guide, was founded by the Beatles lover N. Vasin, who received an autographed album from John Lennon.  Nikolai spent a long time fighting the city authorities, wanting to name one of the streets in the name of his beloved artist. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting places and sights of spb" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1762562.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the end, the leader of the Beatleman movement in Russia hung a sign in his yard and put a sign pointing to the sky to emphasize the fact that Lennon Street does not pass on the ground.  First, plaster bas-reliefs appeared depicting the faces of The Beatles musicians, then they painted a yellow submarine on the wall.  A street that has neither <em> </em>  on one map, it turned into a Mecca for the Beatles, and for more than five years now astonished tourists have been visiting an informal monument of St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  Museum "Grand Layout Russia" </h2><p>  Finishing to list interesting places in the most beautiful city in the world, we will describe the unusual sights of St. Petersburg for children.
