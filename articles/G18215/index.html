But for believers, this name carries a much deeper meaning.  Before figuring out how to get to Diveevo from St. Petersburg, you need to understand how attractive this place is.  In Diveevo there is the Holy Trinity Seraphim-Diveevo <span>Convent,</span> where many pilgrims from different parts of the country go.  In addition, this legendary place is associated with the name of St. Seraphim of Sarov. </p><h2>  History of the Diveevo Monastery </h2><p>  Seraphim of Sarov at one time took under the patronage of the monastery at the request of its founder, mother Alexandra.  Before Alexandra came to Diveevo, there was only a small wooden church.  Arriving as a stranger in the village, she began to build a stone temple, then received land from the local landowner and began to build a convent. </p><p>  After the death of mother Alexandra, Seraphim of Sarov took up the community.  His merit is that he built the main shrine of the monastery - the Groove of the Queen of Heaven.  This event took place at the beginning of the 19th century. </p><p>  After the death of the saint, the monastery underwent various trials.  Under Soviet rule, it was closed, and only in 1989 did its revival begin. </p>
