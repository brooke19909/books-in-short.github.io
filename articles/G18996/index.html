    <h2>  Requirements </h2><p>  What should be the <span>regulation?</span>  <span>The interaction between the departments of accounting and economic</span> services, human resources and planning and planning unit, other structural units of the enterprise is inevitable in the process.  Moreover, the contact of employees should ensure the implementation of tasks in the shortest possible time.  <span>A sample of the rules of interaction between departments</span> , first of all, should be available to performers.  If the person responsible for its development writes out all the provisions, but the subordinates cannot understand anything, there will be no sense in the document.  In this regard, when forming a <span>model of the regulation of interaction between departments</span> , three key principles should be taken into account: </p><ol><li>  The document is compiled on the basis of a business process model.  The quality of the regulation will directly depend on the thoroughness of the elaboration of the scheme. </li><li>  The structure of the document is determined by the process model.  All points of the scheme must be present in the regulation. </li><li>  The presentation of information is carried out in an official, dry language.  It is recommended to use short simple sentences in the text of the document.  The provisions should be clearly stated.  All abbreviations and terms must be decrypted. </li></ol><h2>  Goals </h2><p>  About the <span>rules of interaction between</span> departments provides: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Establishment and maintenance of order in the preparation of documentation, effective contact between structural units. </li><li>  Prevention of conflict situations in the team.  If the interaction schemes for work are determined in advance, the share of participation of an employee in the processes, disputes will not arise. </li><li>  Prompt entry into the team of beginners.  The regulation helps to understand the structure of interactions, indicates which documents the employee will use, with which services he will contact. </li><li>  Discipline control. </li><li>  Faster transfer of cases to another employee (upon dismissal or on vacation). </li><li>  Prevention of loss of financial, human and time resources. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Interaction between IT and IB departments" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1824874.jpg" width="320"></div></li></ol><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  <span>What rules of interaction between departments</span> can be considered correctly drawn up?  Typically, a document includes the following sections: </p><ol><li>  General Provisions </li><li>  Definitions, terms and abbreviations. </li><li>  Descriptions of the processes. </li><li>  Responsibility. </li><li>  The control. </li></ol><p>  Sources of definitions can be legislative acts, GOSTs and other documents.  The latter, in particular, include Orders of ministries, departments, government decrees.  Moreover, references to regulatory documents, the provisions of which were used, should be included in the <span>regulation of interaction between departments.</span>  <span>The sample for healthcare facilities</span> , in particular, contains instructions on the Orders of the Ministry of Health and Social Development, the Ministry of Health of the region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  application </h2><p>  It usually provides a graphical model of a business process.  It is depicted in the form of a diagram consisting of several blocks.  A graphic image can be created using PC software products.  Schemes reflect a specific procedure for the implementation of certain tasks.  Visualization is more convenient than text.  The diagram clearly shows the beginning of the process and each stage, the relationship between them and the final result.  This model is often used by developers of the <span>rules of interaction between departments of the company according to 223-</span> .  Key parameters such as outputs and inputs, participants and clients are highlighted in the diagram.  If a beginner becomes familiar with such a model, he will immediately understand the specifics of the process and will be ready to implement a specific task. </p><h2>  Instruction manual </h2><p>  At the first stage, it is necessary to determine the subject of the document and the responsible persons, that is, who draws up and what regulations.  The interaction between the departments of accounting, in particular, is carried out according to a clear scheme fixed by law.  This structural unit always has the most important employee responsible for compliance with reporting requirements.  He can become the person responsible for drawing up the <span>rules of interaction between departments.</span>  <span>A sample</span> document should be discussed by all staff.  For this, a general meeting is organized.  If the document regulates the process in which the interests of more than two departments clash, it is important to involve key employees in the discussion.  The person responsible for the development should explain to colleagues the importance of implementing the rules. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regulations interaction between company departments at 223 fz" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1367532.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Process description </h2><p>  Its volume will depend on the complexity of the interaction.  If the process is simple, and the person in charge of it understands all the stages of implementation, then he can draw up a scheme for working with other structural units.  After that, he should discuss the document with the other participants.  If the business process is complex, then each employee develops his part of the model.  After that, all projects are compiled and discussed.  In the course of familiarization with the basic document, all interested employees can offer certain corrections and additions.  After that, the <span>rules of interaction between the departments of the company are</span> transferred to the head. </p><h2>  Statement </h2><p>  It can be carried out directly.  In this case, the head himself signs the <span>rules of interaction between the departments of the company.</span>  <span>A sample</span> document may be approved indirectly.  In this case, the leader issues an order.  The registration data of the administrative act shall be entered in the stamp of approval. </p><h2>  The specifics of the work of the responsible person </h2><p>  Some organizations in the state provide for the position of quality manager.  In practice, certain stages of the preparation of the document have been worked out.  They must be observed by the manager who <span>draws</span> up the <span>rules for interaction between departments.</span>  <span>An example of the</span> main stages: </p><ol><li>  Definition of processes. </li><li>  Lining up the chart. </li><li>  Detailed description. </li><li>  Composing text. </li></ol><p>  A responsible specialist studies the routine of employees in different departments.  This is necessary to draw up a description of standard situations, included in the <span>regulation of interaction between departments.</span>  <span>Example</span> : ‚ÄúA gas station is inspected using such technical means as ... At the end of the survey, a report is drawn up." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regulation of interaction between company departments sample" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1824876.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Definition of the final goal </h2><p>  The person responsible for drawing up the regulations should have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãall the processes, know the responsibilities of employees, have the appropriate qualifications and level of professionalism.  The purpose of the document should be clear to employees.  Otherwise, the implementation of the regulation will be an additional burden on employees. </p><h2>  Optimization and design </h2><p>  A comprehensive study of the processes occurring in the enterprise, allows to identify weaknesses.  Analysis of situations, results, operations makes it possible to optimize activities.  This, in turn, allows us to formulate several scenarios for further development.  So, an enterprise can leave everything as it is, create a new model of work or adjust the old one. </p><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  It is important that each employee has a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat he needs to do and how the results achieved will affect his earnings.  That is why it is necessary to discuss the rules before its approval.  The key role in the <span>preparation of the document</span> is assigned, of course, to the head of the working group (project).  The tasks of this specialist include raising acute issues.  He should be able to present a clear model of the process.  Each participant sees the picture with his own eyes.  It is necessary to achieve a common understanding.  Each participant needs to explain the responsibility in creating the regulation.  In most cases, teams are skeptical about the implementation of such a document.  Depending on the complexity of the process, the introduction of the regulation takes 4-12 months. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rules of interaction between company departments" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1824877.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Implementation Features </h2><p>  To introduce a new regulation, it is necessary: </p><ol><li>  Recognize previous documents as invalid. </li><li>  Introduce new local acts to activate the regulation. </li><li>  Develop the documents necessary for the application of the approved rules. </li><li>  To finalize or introduce new modules of automated information bases. </li><li>  Create forms of unified documents. </li><li>  Change or add staffing. </li><li>  Find candidates for new positions, appoint or transfer employees. </li><li>  Train performers in new rules. </li><li>  Conduct outreach to employees. </li><li>  Carry out a trial implementation of the regulation. </li><li>  Correct the text based on the results of experimental execution. </li><li>  Enter in action the final version of the document. </li><li>  Define procedures for quality control regulations. </li></ol><p>  After the measures for the implementation of the document are identified, the head issues an order.  It should be noted that in connection with the duration of the activities, the date of approval and direct implementation of the regulation will differ.  Let us further consider the main mistakes made by employees in the preparation of the document. </p><h2>  Inconsistency with practice </h2><p>  It is important to trust the creation of regulations to an employee who is directly related to the work activities in the enterprise.  Suppose the organization has become very large.  Management may well allow itself to form a special service whose tasks will include resolving development issues.  Accordingly, the department will set the task to describe all the processes of the enterprise.  But the purpose of this event is not important to them.  If the regulation is made up of people who are not involved in real activities, then the person who directs it will not execute the scheme.  Accordingly, the document does not make sense. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regulations for interaction between departments" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1824878.jpg" width="502"></div>

    <h2>  Lack of flexibility </h2><p>  Many decision makers strive for maximum detail.  This situation is caused by ignorance of the differences between the preparation of regulations and a description of real production processes.  If the task is to automate operations, their detail is designed to help employees.  The need for regulations arises when a lot of people are involved in production.  Their actions are often duplicated, but each person interprets this or that operation in their own way.  The rules are aimed at resolving disagreements.  It should be borne in mind that the organization‚Äôs employees must have a certain freedom of action that allows them to make a decision depending on the situation.  For example, a client can be answered immediately, and not after some time. </p><h2>  The large volume and complexity of the text </h2><p>  The optimal regulations are those consisting of 5-7 pages.  Moreover, its content should be capacious, but concise.  It is not recommended to use complex, multiple sentences.  The text should be understandable.  In addition, you should pay attention to the terms.  You should not replace the concepts with synonyms, use abbreviations without decoding. </p><h2>  The interaction of the departments of information security and IT </h2><p>  At present, many enterprises have very difficult contacts with these services.  Difficulties are associated with internal conflicts between IT and information security departments.  There are several options for ensuring their effective cooperation.  The first and simplest one is the presence of workers (one or several) specializing in information security within the information technology service.  <span>The rules of interaction between the IT and IS departments</span> in this case reflect typical approaches to cooperation.  Organization of work is carried out on the basis of the prevailing stereotype that information security is part of the provision of information technology.  If the company does not have conflicts between these services, then the manager may think about designing the IS service as a separate structure of the IT department.  Accordingly, it will be necessary to allocate more resources, including financial, to support such activities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the regulation of the interaction between the departments of accounting" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1824879.jpg" width="354"></div>

    <h2>  Type sample </h2><p>  The General Provisions indicate: </p><ol><li>  Purpose of the document.  As a rule, there is such a phrase: "These rules determine the order ...". </li><li>  Scope  Regulations may apply to employees or facilities. </li><li>  Normative documents in accordance with which the act is developed. </li><li>  Rules of approval, adjustment, cancellation of regulations. </li></ol><p>  The ‚ÄúTerms, Abbreviations, Definitions‚Äù section describes the concepts used in the document.  All abbreviations must be decrypted.  Terms should be given in alphabetical order.  Each concept is indicated on a new line in units.  h. The definition of the term is given without the word "it", through a dash.  In the "Process Description" section, a step-by-step description is given.  It is advisable to introduce subparagraphs.  Each of them will correspond to a specific stage.  In the same section, the employees involved in the performance of certain operations are indicated.  It describes not only actions, but also their results. </p><h2>  Responsibility and control </h2><p>  The regulation must contain an indication of the possibility of applying sanctions to persons who do not comply with the provisions.  Responsibility is permitted under the law.  It may be criminal, administrative or disciplinary.  It is mandatory to indicate F. I. O. and the position of the employee who exercises control over the implementation of the regulations. </p>
