This is one of the oldest cities in modern Russia.  Today it is the administrative center of the Murom region in the Vladimir region.  It is located on the banks of the Oka River, to the regional center less than 150 kilometers.  But from Murom a stone's throw to the border of the Nizhny Novgorod region.  This is a major transport and railway junction of the Gorky Railway. </p><h2>  Ancient history </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.votpusk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Murom Monasteries" class="if uuid-2601116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2601116.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the city of Murom begins in the period of the Old Russian state.  The first mention of it is found in the "Tale of Bygone Years", it is listed along with other cities in which Rurik had established power by then.  From this time, they trace the history of the city of Murom. </p><p>  In the 80s, large-scale archaeological excavations were carried out on the territory of the Murom Kremlin, which is located in the central part of the modern city.  It was possible to find wooden pavements that were built back in the X century, as well as the remains of wooden buildings, traces of manor buildings.  All this speaks of the ancient and glorious history of the city of Murom. </p><p>  In 1998, excavations were carried out in the eastern part of the so-called Kremlin Mountain.  It was found stucco ceramics of the late X - early XI century.  On top of it lay layers that were typical of the Old Russian era.  Also there was a pagan temple, which was very similar to the description of the Gorodets sanctuary on the North Cape of the ancient Ryazan settlement.  So, we study further the brief history of the city of Murom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Invasions of the Bulgars and Tatars </h2><p>  It is known that the very first prince of Murom became Gleb Vladimirovich.  He came to power in 1013.  In 1088, the city suffered an invasion of the Volga Bulgars. </p><p>  In 1096, a new stage began in the history of the city of Murom.  He was at the center of the internecine war.  Murom-Ryazan land announced its desire to become an independent principality in 1127, having separated from the Chernigov principality.  This happened during the reign of Yaroslav Svyatoslavich.  It is this prince with his family that historians rank among the people who baptized the Murom lands.  In 1129, after his death, the son of Murom was headed by his son Yuri Yaroslavich, from 1143 to 1145 the first prince was another son of Yaroslav Svyatoslav, and after his younger brother, whose name was Rostislav. </p><p>  It was during the reign of Rostislav that the Murom-Ryazan land fell into two principalities, which finally gained independence after the death of Svyatoslav in 1145.  In 1198, Murom (in a brief history of the city for children is described in detail) became the center of an independent diocese. </p><p>  Meanwhile, in Ryazan, Prince Gleb Rostislavich remained, who by any means began to fight his northern neighbor, the Rostov-Suzdal Principality.  Everything ended deplorably for Murom: Vsevolod the Big Nest won, the local princes were captured.  Since 1219, Ryazan headed Ingvar Igorevich, and after him brother Yuri.  During these times, the principality was subjected to several devastating invasions of the Tatar-Mongol.  In 1293, Murom was actually burned to the ground and for some time ceased to be mentioned in Russian chronicles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The city managed to revive only by 1351, this is connected with Prince Yuri Yaroslavich, who was removed from the throne four years later by Fedor Glebovich.  A new page in the history of the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Ancient Rus of</span> Murom begins in 1392, when the Grand Duke of Moscow Vasily I annexed this principality to Moscow. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  It is believed that the name of the city came from the Finno-Ugric tribe of Murom, a mention of which can be found even in the "Tale of Bygone Years", in those parts that relate to undated chronicles before the Varangians were called to Russia. </p><p>  However, some researchers do not exclude that there was an inverse relationship.  However, the etymology of the word "murom" remains unknown.  So the history of the name of the city of Murom remains foggy.  At the same time, there are a large number of consonant hydronyms in the district: Lake Murom, the Murom River, the Muromets stream, and another lake called Murom Luka. </p><p>  There is a version that the word "murma" came from the Baltic analogue, which in translation means "rumble, grunt, murmur."  There is also a similar consonant word in the Mari language, which means "fun, a place to sing." </p><p>  In the dictionary of Vladimir Dahl, you can find a mention that the name of the city comes from the word "murom", which means "glaze."  This is a glassy shell on pottery or tiles that were made during the foundation of the city. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the name of the city is also mentioned in the Scandinavian sagas, which belong to the XIII century. </p><h2>  As part of the Moscow Principality </h2><p>  Since the XIV century, the history of the city of Ancient Russia by Murom continues as part of the Moscow principality.  In the middle of the 16th century, it was in this city that the troops of the Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible began gathering in order to start a campaign from there on Kazan.  During this period, the first stone temples were built in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 1565, Ivan IV divides the Russian state into "zemshchina" and "oprichnina", the city is included in the first. </p><p>  In the XVII century, Murom became an important craft center of the country.  A large number of leather dressing masters appear here, as well as many blacksmiths, shoemakers, tailors, and jewelers.  The appearance of the famous Murom kalachs dates back to this time.  It was unique for that time baking, which was made from sieve dough.  The uniqueness of Murom kalach was precisely in its duty cycle.  For this, the dough itself was crushed for a long time by hands, due to this, the carbon dioxide contained in it did not evaporate.  The kalach came out porous, with large voids inside. </p><h2>  The architectural appearance of the city </h2><div class="photo" data-original="book33.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Peasant Square in Murom" class="if uuid-2601119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2601119.jpg"></div><p>  The architectural appearance of Murom began to take shape starting from the 19th century.  By this moment, the city had already managed to visit the Moscow province, Vladimir governorate. </p><p>  In 1792 and 1805, large-scale fires occurred that destroyed almost all the wooden buildings.  The city was rebuilt already according to a new master plan, which was developed by the architect Ivan Lem, and it was approved by Empress Catherine II back in 1788.  According to this plan, the development of the city was supposed to go from a radial beam scheme to a strictly perpendicular one.  So, the quarters of Murom began to be rectangles with sides 250 and 150 meters. </p><p>  Only in the 80s was this long-established order violated.  According to a new project developed by the honored architect of the RSFSR Nikolai Bespalov, many central streets were blocked by multi-access houses. </p><h2>  The development of the city in the XIX-XX century </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Muromsk today" class="if uuid-2601118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2601118.jpg"></div><p>  Murom, which in the 19th century was part of the <span>Vladimir province,</span> became the first city in these places where water supply appeared.  To implement this advanced project for its time, a water tower was built at the intersection of Voznesenskaya and Rozhdestvenskaya Streets.  It can be found today at the intersection of Sovetskaya with Lenin Street. </p><p>  The head of the city, Aleksey Ermakov, who was also a philanthropist and a wealthy merchant, financed the construction of the water tower.  In the XIX century, Murom began to actively develop, mechanical and iron foundries were being built, a cotton and, later, flax spinning mill appeared.  At the beginning of the 20th century, railway workshops opened. </p><p>  The history of the city and the sights of Murom was greatly influenced by the events that occurred after the October Revolution.  After the victory of the October Revolution, many churches were ravaged, several ancient churches were completely demolished.  Including one of the main temples of the city, its key attraction is the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin, built in the 16th century by order of Ivan the Terrible. </p><h2>  Riots in Murom </h2><p>  In 1961, riots took place in Murom, which caused serious concern for the Soviet leadership.  It all started with the fact that the master of the refrigerator manufacturing department, Yuri Kostikov, while drunk, tried to pop into the back of a truck that was passing by.  The worker broke, hit his head on the asphalt. </p><p>  A local police chief drove by and ordered to take him to the police station.  Kostikov sat in the cell until morning, he was not provided with medical assistance, only in the morning he was taken to the hospital, where he died.  Rumors immediately began to circulate around the city that the police had beaten him, and he died from this. </p><p>  Experts said the death was due to an accident, but the factory questioned these results, requiring another study involving independent experts from the capital. </p><p>  On the day of the funeral, the participants in the procession started stoning the police station and turned the police over.  A spontaneous rally arose. </p><p>  Soon, the crowd, armed with improvised means, stormed the police station.  Weapons were seized from employees of the department; a pogrom was organized in the offices.  48 people were released from pre-trial detention.  The police building was set on fire, and then fire brigades that arrived at the scene were not allowed into it. </p><p>  City authorities were at a loss.  By midnight, about 200 troops arrived in the city, who managed to prevent unrest.  Many party officials and security officials lost their posts.  Eight people were accused of participating in the riots, and 11 - of hooliganism.  Three were sentenced to death, the rest - to imprisonment. </p><h2>  Moore today </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nesiditsa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Murom story" class="if uuid-2601115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2601115.jpg"></div><p>  Today, the history of the city and the sights of Murom attract a large number of tourists.
