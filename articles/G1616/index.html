    <p>  In just a couple of days, a brave correspondent plunges headlong into political troubles in his homeland.  He reveals the fact of falsification of the signatures of the pickers of one of the presidential candidates, attends a press conference of the current head of state, and interviews the leader of the Right Sector. </p><h2>  Acquaintance with Galina Timchenko </h2><p>  The post of chief editor of "Gazeta.Ru" at that time was held by <span>Galina Timchenko.</span>  She tried to ensure that the news of her periodical online publication was presented objectively and comprehensively.  But due to a link to an interview with a Ukrainian nationalist, she was fired, and the online publication had problems.  The dismissal process was resonant and controversial.  Many employees followed their leader, submitting relevant statements.  One of these quitters was Ilya Azar. </p><p>  After the calculation, he worked for six months as a special correspondent for the site of the popular Russian radio station, specializing in round-the-clock information and communication with the listening audience. </p><p>  In October 2014, Timchenko, with the financial support of the entrepreneur Khodorkovsky, created a new informative online project Meduza, where experienced Azar got to work from the very beginning of the existence of the online publication. </p><p>  However, two years later, Ilya Vilyamovich announced his departure from the news portal.  It was difficult for him to leave his beloved brainchild, but circumstances were stronger.  According to reports from various sources, the reasons for leaving were called different: from the dissimilarity of the characters with the boss to the intentional dismissal in connection with the announcement of undesirable facts. </p><h2>  Ilya Azar today </h2><p>  From the very beginning of 2017, the journalist got a job at Novaya Gazeta, a weekly periodical specializing in investigative journalism.  In the new field, Ilya Vilyamovich will need unprecedented talent and skill, prudence and sanity, intuitive thinking and courage, which fate awarded him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ilya azar activity" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1765817.jpg" width="600"></div>
