    <h2>  Nearby Attractions </h2><p>  Prague is an ancient city in which there will be no time to lie quietly on a sofa.  Here, one square kilometer fits dozens of attractions that you need to visit.  In Prague, it is better to wear comfortable shoes, because walks in this city will be endless, and each time you will see something completely incredible.  After all, Prague is the most beautiful bridges, golden domes of churches and cathedral spiers, quiet streets paved with paving stones, and incredible monuments and museums. </p><p>  Hotel Olsanka 3 *, the photo of which you see in the article, is located a few kilometers from the very center of Prague.  There is a public transport stop directly in front of the entrance.  Bus and tram run exactly on schedule. </p><h2>  Zizkov TV Tower </h2><p>  Just a couple of tram stops from the hotel is the highest attraction in Prague.  The tower was built in 1992 according to the project of architect Vaclav Aulicki.  This building, with its appearance similar to a spaceship, stands out from the general architecture of the Zizkovsky District.  In 2000, it was decided to attach 10 metal statues of two-meter babies to the tower walls.  From the side, it seems that babies crawl down the wall of the TV tower.  People still argue about whether the city needs such a sight.  Nevertheless, the TV tower is very popular among tourists, because its futuristic style is not the most interesting in it. </p><p>  At an altitude of 93 m there are three viewing platforms.  You can climb them using the elevator or on foot.  Huge panoramic windows, comfortable sofas and telescopes in which you can view Prague from a bird's eye view - this is what visitors will see when they are upstairs. </p><p>  A little lower is a chic restaurant.  Despite the fact that the prices in the restaurant are higher than in other similar establishments, it is in great demand.  After all, the incredible view that opens outside the window impresses with its scope. </p><p>  Within the walls of the tower is a six-star hotel.  True, it contains only one number, the queue for which is scheduled for several months in advance.  The main advantage of the room is panoramic windows everywhere.  You can lie in the bathroom and watch Prague from top to bottom. </p>

    <h2>  National Monument on Vitkov </h2><p>  Olsanka Hotel is surrounded by a very large park.  Good location makes this place a kind of oasis for various plants, animals and birds.  The main structure of the park is a sculpture by Jan i≈æka.  During the Hussite wars, one of the tragic battles for the independence of Bohemia (Czech Republic) took place on the site of the park.  Under the leadership of this military leader, the Czech people gained freedom and faith in a brighter future. </p><p>  Behind the monument is a memorial in which the mummified body of the first president of the Czechoslovak Republic was once stored.  Currently, the <span>grave of an unknown soldier</span> and several historical displays are located here. </p><h2>  Church of the Sacred Heart of the Lord </h2><p>  A few kilometers from the hotel there is an unusual church in its appearance.  This shrine to even a non-believing tourist resembles Noah's Ark.  The bulky brick-lined building attracts many tourists to these places.  On one side of the building are huge clocks that ‚Äúcome to life‚Äù every 15 minutes.  The interior of the temple looks impressive.  Gold-plated statues of the main saints of the country and gold balls hanging on thin threads in the middle of the temple make you think about the eternal.  The Church of the Sacred Heart of the Lord is active.  Every day there are services and you can hear the singing of the choir. </p>

    <h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  The Olsanka 3 * hotel (Prague) attracts its tourists with its excellent service and good location.  Tours are acquired by many, and this is not the first time.  Former hotel guests recommend choosing it as an accommodation option.  Comfortable rooms and additional hotel services make your stay in Prague even more memorable.  They come back here many times, but isn't that the main praise of the establishment?  However, it is better to see once.  Get tours to this beautiful place and have a nice rest! </p>
