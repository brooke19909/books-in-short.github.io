The result of this work was the emergence <span>of a new</span> type of <span>school</span> - specialized, national schools, lyceums, gymnasiums, colleges. </p><p>  The changes also affected the structure of higher education.  A multilevel system has developed that unites institutions of postgraduate education, as well as those that provide higher and <span>secondary vocational</span> education.  International universities and private universities began to operate, the main higher institutions were academies and universities. </p>
