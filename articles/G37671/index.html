Moreover, the situations are different: it is one thing when time allows you to save, but it is completely different if the funds are needed urgently.  Where to get the money will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  About earnings in general </h2><p>  It should be understood that in our life free cheese happens only in a mousetrap.  Many people wonder where to quickly get the money so that you can not give it back.  Nowhere!  Funds are obtained by hard work, sweat and blood. </p><p>  Without the need to return, you can get money only in the form of a salary, and for this you need to work (which is no longer a "freebie", because you need to sacrifice your own forces and time).  And quickly and immediately money is given only in debt. </p><p>  Criminal methods are not considered - it is illegal!  And the funds obtained in this way will also have to be returned sooner or later, because there is no way to twist the thread, but there will still be an end.  Therefore, this article will discuss exclusively legal ways where you can get money - either make money or borrow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.99.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get money quickly" class="if uuid-2352298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2352298.jpg"></div><h2>  1. Microloan </h2><p>  There are many companies with names like Fast Money and Borrow Before.  Points where you can urgently borrow money are located at almost every step in any city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A microloan is a small loan.  Usually up to 30 or up to 50 thousand rubles for a short period of time - a month or two.  The interest rate depends on the amount and term.  Each company has a different one, therefore this information should be clarified directly with a loan officer. </p><p>  This is a good option, giving an answer to the question of where to get the money urgently on your passport.  It is only necessary to choose wisely a company that offers fully understandable and transparent conditions before taking such a step, because one unsuccessful attempt can drag a person into a debt hole. </p><p>  The benefits are as follows: </p><ul><li>  It is issued very quickly and there is no need to provide any documents additionally.  Only a form is required. </li><li>  Guarantors or co-borrowers are not needed. </li><li>  The purpose of obtaining a small loan is not of interest to the company. </li><li>  There are offices that issue microloans over the Internet.  It is enough to indicate the details of the bank card on the site.  Refunds are also made by electronic payments.  No need to go anywhere and wait long in line. </li><li>  If the above method is difficult, the nearest point of issuance of small loans will cope with this too quickly. </li></ul><p>  Important: </p><ul><li>  You need to take only the necessary amount of funds - a penny in a penny, without rounding.  The surplus will be wasted, but it will have to be given in the end.  Of course, the company's employees will persuade a potential client to take such a step, but you should be aware of what all this can turn out for the loan recipient. </li><li>  It is necessary to repay the debt on time.  Earlier it is possible, later it is impossible.  Delay threatens with large fines and an increase in interest, which ultimately leads to overpayments and poor credit history.  Where to get the money later if everyone will eventually refuse such an unreliable borrower? </li><li>  If the payment delay was allowed, you should immediately contact a company representative and discuss the situation in order to avoid undesirable consequences and uncomfortable negotiations.  According to the law No. 230- dated 07/03/2017, the borrower's risks are reduced today.  Companies no longer need to literally ‚Äúfill up‚Äù the debtor with fines, exacerbating the situation.  According to statistics, only 30% of such overdue loans were eventually paid.  Therefore, the above law regulated the size of the penalty for delay.  But it should be understood that the further the customer delays the deadline for resolving the payment incident, the less chance of refinancing. </li></ul><h2>  2. Bank lending </h2><p>  Another place where to get money with a further return is the bank.  Consumer credit is issued for a large amount and for a long time: months, or even years.  Accordingly, the percentage is lower than on a microloan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Consumer loans are usually resorted to starting a personal business or acquiring a car.  The method is not for those who think where to get money on <span>credit without failure,</span> because the bank checks the client for compliance with the following points: </p><ul><li>  The presence of a constant and stable income.  If the borrower has not worked anywhere for six months and, accordingly, will not be able to provide a certificate of income, then it is likely that the bank will refuse to issue. </li><li>  Credit history without violations.  Means that previously taken loans were always paid on time and without delay. </li><li>  The bank is entitled to refuse without explanation.  To increase the likelihood of approval, you should stock up on a surety.  This is a person who also puts his signature in the contract and agrees to repay the loan in case of financial insolvency of the borrower.  It should only be taken into account that not everyone will agree to this.  It should be either a very good friend, ready to go for it, or a relative.  You need to know that a unfamiliar person who asked to vouch for him when drawing up a loan agreement may turn out to be a fraudster and disappear with money, and all payment obligations will be transferred to the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  The bank may require anything in pledge as a guarantee that the borrower will be able to repay everything.  In case of termination of payments, the mortgaged property may be withdrawn from the owner.  Most often, a car or an apartment is left as collateral, and the bank resorts to this measure in the case of mortgage lending. </p><p>  This is also not very simple and does not suit those who are looking for where to get money without failure.  Getting a mortgage is even more difficult, but it is also an option to purchase a large amount to buy a home or car.  You just need to get a stable job and fully comply with the conditions put forward by the bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnnindonesia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get the money" class="if uuid-2352296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2352296.jpg"></div><h2>  3. Own credit card </h2><p>  If you use the card wisely, then this will play the role of a "magic wand."  It‚Äôs possible to take money with a bad history somewhere, but not somewhere, so you have to turn to many companies in search of approval. </p><p>  The credit card will not look at the story.  Money is withdrawn from the card, and if it is returned on time, then interest and overpayments will not disturb the borrower.  If the amount is not paid on time, interest will begin to accrue, and you will have to return much more money than was originally withdrawn. </p><p>  As a rule, we are talking about a period of 50-55 days.  But each bank has its own characteristics, and details should be clarified by representatives.  In any case, a credit card is an undeniable plus, if suddenly an unexpected situation occurred and an urgent question arose about where to get the money.  A kind of loan from himself is able to help out in such a situation. </p><p>  But there are also disadvantages - cash is withdrawn with interest, which brings certain inconvenience.  Therefore, it is better to pay by credit card itself, if there is such an opportunity. </p><p>  Many banks can provide customers with such cards, for example, Sberbank, Tinkoff or Kuban Credit. </p><h2>  4. Ask friends </h2><p>  There is a saying: "If you want to lose a friend, borrow money from him."  A joke, of course, but with some truth.  Friends, acquaintances and relatives are often approached by people who do not know where to get the money quickly. </p><p>  The method is not acceptable to everyone solely from a moral point of view.  In the end, even if you ask for money from your own parents, it is nothing more than to stay sitting on your neck. </p><p>  Of course, it‚Äôs good if you have true friends who are ready to help in difficult times and who can be condescending to a person who cannot return the money on time.  However, such a treasure as faithful comrades, not everyone can boast.  True friendship (like true love) has become a very rare occurrence in modern society, where money and technological progress rule. </p><p>  It would seem just a pathos statement.  But this is exactly how Oswald Spengler described the signs of a civilized society in his book ‚ÄúSunset in Europe‚Äù. </p><h2>  5. Pawnshop </h2><p>  Not the most popular place, but if somewhere you urgently need to take money with your passport, contact here.  A flea marketer is considered one of the most ancient professions. </p><p>  What you need to know: </p><ul><li>  You are required to have a passport or any other document confirming the identity of the applicant. </li><li>  A fee is charged for storing things handed over to a pawnshop. </li><li>  Refunds can only be made after payment of the full amount and interest. </li></ul><p>  Accepted jewelry, antiques, rare works of art, as well as cars, audio and video equipment, mobile devices, watches, jewelry and even furniture of different sizes. </p><p>  But most of all, of course, such organizations like to work with jewelry and antiques.  A significant minus is that the owner of the pawnshop can often offer an amount significantly lower than the cost of property left as a pledge. </p><p>  It should also be understood that the storage period of things is agreed upon by both parties, and if the buyback is not made within the established time frame, the pawnshop can put up the mortgaged property at auction. </p><p>  Therefore, when a question arises about where you can borrow money, you should think about whether it will be possible to redeem a thing from a pawnshop.  Otherwise, it is better to choose a different method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.noobpreneur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="need money urgently where to get the passport" class="if uuid-2352301" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2352301.jpg"></div><h2>  6. Avito </h2><p>  In the end, everyone has unnecessary things that are not a pity to sell.  If funds are needed urgently, then put up for sale a thing is necessary at a significantly reduced price. </p><p>  In any case, trading floors involve the sale of second-hand goods.  Even if household appliances or furniture are completely new, then hardly anyone will buy it at cost.  It should be understood that a car purchased in the cabin loses about 10% of its value, having traveled the first 100 meters. </p><p>  The service has a lot of advantages compared to other methods of obtaining funds.  For sale often exhibited: </p><ul><li>  the clothes are in good condition; </li><li>  all kinds of antiques; </li><li>  vinyl records, compact discs; </li><li>  books </li><li>  stamps; </li><li>  coins; </li><li>  mobile devices; </li><li>  furniture; </li><li>  Appliances. </li></ul><p>  In principle, you can set anything.  Even some little things.  Just to get the right amount. </p><h2>  7. To rent housing </h2><p>  A good way to replenish your wallet in resort towns.  The owner of a house or apartment just moves to friends or family for the summer, and rents out his square meters to vacationers at a pre-agreed price. </p><p>  Earnings for the season, but the amounts are significant.  Of course, this is not the case when you need to urgently take money somewhere, but with a proper approach to saving money, you can come to the formation of stash that will help avoid unforeseen expenses. </p><h2>  8. The Sabbath </h2><p>  The simplest and most honest way to get rich a little is to work part-time.  This refers to the performance of one-time work with instant payroll.  There are many similar ads on the Internet. </p><p>  Often, wondering where to get the money, people agree to the jobs of movers.  Loading and unloading involve working with heavy loads, so they are paid pretty well (depending on what to load). </p><p>  A slightly less profitable way is to work as a promoter.  Usually, students agree to this in their free time. </p><p>  In addition to the mentioned options, where to quickly get the money, there are the following "one-time" vacancies: </p><ul><li>  room cleaners; </li><li>  waiters </li><li>  courier for the delivery of goods; </li><li>  collector of furniture; </li><li>  Content manager. </li></ul><p>  Of course, if the problems arose quite unexpectedly, and the question is where to urgently borrow money, then the option is not the most suitable, because it is unlikely that it will be possible to get a large amount of money on such side jobs.  But by accumulating the right amount of funds, the consequences of unforeseen situations can be nullified. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.noobpreneur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where can I borrow money urgently" class="if uuid-2352299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2352299.jpg"></div><h2>  9. Agree with the employer </h2><p>  It will turn out only if the employee has proven himself well, and the company's policy allows the employee to issue a ‚Äúsalary loan‚Äù. </p><p>  Huge pluses are that there is no interest, as in the case of loans, and also it is not required to collect a lot of documents and look for guarantors. </p><p>  It should only be remembered that the salary in the end is calculated less, because the amount issued on loan will be debited. </p><h2>  10. Earnings on the Internet </h2><p>  The most common option and involves a lot: it is writing articles to order, and programming, and work in the field of web design, as well as typesetting of printed materials. </p><p>  In fact, this is also a side job and not always suitable if money is required right now in cash.  Firstly, the withdrawal of funds can be carried out on the card within a few days, and secondly, there is a commission.  In addition, if the money is cashed out through an ATM of the wrong company that issued the card, some of the funds will also be lost due to the commission. </p><p>  Therefore, it is advisable to look for the possibility of withdrawing directly to a bank card. </p><p>  Many successfully work on copywriting exchanges.  There are many pluses, but significant disadvantages in the form of the lack of direct withdrawal to the Sberbank card push potential authors away from the project. </p><h2>  11. Lottery </h2><p>  Alas, many often resort to this method and quickly ‚Äúrun away‚Äù.  As they say, once a year the poker shoots.  The probability of winning the jackpot in the lottery, of course, is present, but only very small. </p><p>  Therefore, it is highly recommended not to resort to the help of lottery tickets in the hope of quickly getting money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moneyning.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="urgently need money where to get" class="if uuid-2352306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2352306.jpg"></div><h2>  12. Government subsidies </h2><p>  There are many government programs to help the population: funds are allocated for treatment, purchase of housing, implementation of business projects and much more.  But this method is not the fastest, because it is not suitable for those who are looking for where you can urgently borrow money. </p><h2>  13. Tax Refunds </h2><p>  A very useful procedure for those who have purchased an apartment or issued a mortgage.  Not the best option if you need funds urgently, but it‚Äôs still useful to know that you can get taxes and mortgage interest. </p><p>  A person has the right to return 13% of the cost of the apartment.  Moreover, the amount should not exceed the amount established by law.  The cost of housing should not exceed 2,000,000 rubles.  That is, the above percentages are 260,000 rubles.  No one will pay this amount at a time, because taxes paid for the year are subject to return. </p><p>  To return these funds you will need a package of documents: </p><ul><li>  certificate in form 2 personal income tax (issued in accounting at the place of work); </li><li>  proof of identity; </li><li>  contract of sale of an apartment or house; </li><li>  certificate of transfer of funds from the buyer to the seller; </li><li>  certificate of ownership; </li><li>  tax refund application; </li><li>  Help 3 personal income tax. </li></ul><p>  The specified list is submitted to the tax office along with the card details for the transfer of funds.  After three months, the transfer is made.  A good way to replenish the wallet for those who pay a loan for an apartment and think about where to get the money.  The main thing is to have a permanent job with transparent wages - a guarantee that the employer withholds income tax. </p><p>  In the case of a refund of mortgage funds, you should also get a certificate of interest paid from the bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="el-mokademtechnology.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get money on credit without refusal" class="if uuid-2352314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2352314.jpg"></div><h2>  14. Own account </h2><p>  In order not to rush from side to side in an emergency, thinking where to get the money, it is better to play it safe.  You can save to have your stash in case of force majeure. </p><p>  Of course, it is difficult to keep funds in cash and put aside in the old fashioned way in a piggy bank, therefore it is better to open a bank account and replenish it with small amounts.  All people tend to spend money on all kinds of little things.  Lies, for example, 100 p.  in the pocket.  Surely something will be bought. </p><p>  But it is better to throw them in the "bank piggy bank".  So, a pretty penny, and accumulates a very large amount.  Of course, this takes a lot of time and patience.  It is also required to periodically replenish the account with larger amounts, but the result is worth it. </p><p>  In order not to disturb friends and not to look for where you can urgently borrow money, the easiest way is to have your nest egg, which will always help out at the right time. </p><p>  For example, in the personal account of Sberbank you can find the ‚Äúpiggy bank‚Äù function, thanks to which you can configure automatic debit of funds from the card.  For example, an employee receives a salary from which the amount set by the client is transferred to an open account. </p><h2>  15. Find an investor </h2><p> Sometimes you have to look for really large amounts that are problematic to borrow from friends, especially when banks are always refused.  But the option with an investor is suitable only for businessmen who think where to get money on receipt for the development of their own business. </p><p>  In this role, as a rule, a very wealthy and influential person acts who agrees to provide a large amount to a private person.  It is necessary to provide passport data, as well as explain how to plan to return the amount received. </p><p>  In most cases, money is needed to start a business, then you should take care of the business plan. </p><p>  About a private loan you need to know: </p><ul><li>  Be sure to check the investor.  There are many scammers who require a down payment (as security or security), and then disappear. </li><li>  It is very important to pay attention to the receipt.  It should be correctly composed, because errors in the document can lead to very disastrous consequences. </li><li>  A key role is played by the pledge.  The cost of this should fully correspond to the requested amount.  The risk level is very high, because in case of unsuccessful development of events, the mortgaged property may go to the investor.  As a rule, leave apartments, cars, cottages, land. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In modern society, people are reluctant to resort to loans, preferring to borrow from friends.  Even less choose the option with the accumulation of funds in order to have a safety net in the form of nest egg for a rainy day. </p><p>  There are different cases in life when money may be urgently needed.  This is a treatment, and an accident, and all kinds of emergency situations. </p><p>  In the end, even the birth of a child significantly affects the financial component of the family.  It is not always possible to find funds at the right time, because you need to take care of the maintenance of the child.  And this is a medical examination, treatment, therapy, all kinds of massages.  As well as diapers, diapers, baby food and clothing.  Registration in the kindergarten also entails financial losses.  And then another school, where you will need to donate funds based on decisions of parent meetings.  As a result, everyone urgently needs money.  Where to get them, everyone is forced to think for himself. </p><p>  In view of the foregoing, people often have to live from paycheck to paycheck and from one loan to another.  The most difficult situation is when you have to take a loan in order to repay your debts.  So a person turns into a squirrel in a wheel. </p><p>  The solution can only be a decisive willful step in terms of part-time work or the search for a more profitable job. </p><p>  Often people resort to microloans, who are everywhere denied credit.  Nothing remains like this, except to live from one loan to another and turn into the aforementioned squirrel in the wheel.  It should be understood that you should not take the money that will not be able to give then. </p><p>  Therefore, we must sensibly assess our strengths and capabilities, and also not take anything superfluous: only a penny in a penny.  And if you happen to take it, you need to understand that you have to refuse yourself in many ways in order to postpone the necessary amount for a refund.  Otherwise, it threatens with a tainted history and attracting the attention of collectors. </p><p>  For information, any company issuing money transfers information to the credit committee.  Accordingly, the bank (before approving the issuance) makes a request to the above organization and, based on the answer, either refuses to issue a loan, or approves it.  Therefore, you should not think that if a credit history is spoiled in any VTB bank, then you should try your hand at Sberbank.  Sber may also be refused after a request to the above committee.  After such failures, a person begins to think about where to urgently borrow money. </p><p>  Many resort to microloans to improve their credit history.  This is done as follows: first you need to find a stable job with high earnings, take a microloan and pay it on time or ahead of schedule, then take the next one and do exactly the same. </p><p>  Information is sent to the committee, which entails an adjustment to the story plus.  After that, you can try your luck and take a loan from the bank.  But this is not an entirely acceptable solution from an ethical point of view.  It is much better to immediately think over your steps in order not to spoil your credit history and then correct it with microloans, as in the end the amount will have to be returned much more than what was received at the beginning. </p><p>  In addition, marks on damaged credit history may further serve as a reason for refusing to issue funds at any large bank.  As mentioned above, they may fail without explanation. </p><p>  A very good option is a credit card, which allows you to borrow from yourself.  The main thing is to calculate everything correctly and return the funds on time.  Otherwise, you will have to return with interest. </p><p>  A good way to make money on the Internet, which is now very common, is to maintain your own blog and receive payments for advertising.  A good method to get money is to advertise someone else‚Äôs product somewhere.  With a large number of subscribers, advertisers offer a blogger to place ads on their page.  For this, money is obtained.  It‚Äôs a good way to make money, but you need to be able to promote your personal blog, and it doesn‚Äôt matter what you are talking about, whether it‚Äôs an account on Youtube, Instagram, Facebook or the public VKontakte. </p><p>  Borrowed or loaned money is always an unpleasant situation, because it should be given away.  Therefore, it is much better to earn money on your own at work and part-time jobs, in order to always have funds for emergency situations.  Such methods will avoid situations when you have to think about where to get money with bad credit history. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hadiah.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where can I borrow money" class="if uuid-2352303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2352303.jpg"></div><p>  A good solution is to have your own business, because in this case there is always a way to quickly get money, but even in such conditions no one is safe from mistakes.  Any oversight can lead to large financial losses, because in order not to lose everything, you should calculate in advance.  As they say, measure seven times - cut once.  That is the key to success in business and a good life.  Only careful consideration of each step will help to avoid unforeseen situations in which very large amounts of money may be needed. </p><p>  Only planning, calculations and recalculations will help to avoid collapse, bankruptcy and falling into a debt hole.  It must be remembered that all the failures in life are the consequences of mistakes made earlier.  Therefore, it is necessary to correct them in time and not to postpone their decision for later.  Otherwise, the further you go, the more consequences can be the most. </p><p>  And we are talking not only about the financial component of errors, but, in principle, about relations between people, which can also lead to monetary losses and thoughts about where you can borrow money.  Good friends will always help with a word and a penny.  Good colleagues are also able to help out in a difficult situation.  As they say, do not have a hundred rubles, but have a hundred friends. </p><p>  Therefore, a friend who has already been bailed out sometimes will come to the rescue in 90% of cases.  This is how partnerships are built not only in business, but also in the work team.  Friendship between people is much more important, although everyone has thoughts where to borrow money. </p><p>  You should understand the difference between a friend who can help out in any situation, and a person who can take money and not return it.  The first will help, and more than once, especially if I received the same help in return, and the relations between such people have developed very well.  But the act of the second will definitely be single, and such a person will definitely leave in search of a new victim.  That's just how much thread you want to curl, but the end will still be found.  As a result, the fraudster will be left alone without anything.  And it will torment itself with the thought of where to take money on credit - with or without a passport, it does not matter anymore.  It is unlikely that someone will help him. </p><p>  It follows from this that the ideal formula, how not to get into situations when you have to think about where to get money from your passport (urgently needed), is this: it‚Äôs enough just to be a reasonable and kind person. </p><p>  Good luck to all!  And do not refuse relatives when they come to you with such a request, for they no longer know where to borrow money yet.  Help them!  After all, kindness will return to everyone. </p>
