    <h2>  Track Characteristics </h2><p>  On the eastern and western slopes there is an extensive network of routes.  Here everyone will be able to find for himself a suitable one that fully meets his skills and abilities.  If you are skiing for the first time, then welcome to the training, short and gentle slopes.  Having mastered this art a little, you can proceed to the Eastern route.  Its length is 2300 meters, it is not too steep, while the slope is constantly changing.  Given the category of skiers, the track expands to steeper sections and narrows to gentle. </p><p>  The western route is the world of mid-level skiers.  The track is very interesting, it is smooth and wide at first, and then it is divided into two sleeves - very steep for trained skiers and a roundabout, with a gentle slope.  If the mastersto has reached a good level, you can go to the Klim highway.  Its width is 30 meters, while the long descent with a slope of 43 degrees lasts until the middle of the path.  The West Ridge is a very difficult track that is suitable only for the most experienced skiers.  It is narrow, has a complex relief, its length is 2400 meters. </p><p>  More likely as entertainment than as a real sport, tubing tracks can be considered.  These are gutters well-packed with artificial snow, through which you can make a very high-speed descent - in 55 seconds. </p><p>  The complex is served by 8 lifts.  Passage to them is carried out using plastic cards, or, as it is customary to say today, ski passes.  For evening skating there are well-lit tracks, mainly for simple, gentle slopes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountain sable card" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/676394.jpg" width="554"></div>

At the peak of the season, the cost of a daily subscription is 1,500 rubles, for half a day (5 hours) - 850 rubles.  But on the advice of experienced travelers, you can go for a ride closer to spring.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists say that "Sable Mountain" is a great place to relax, and it is good here all year round.  Experienced travelers are advised to come to ride on the slopes from March to May, at which time the prices are the lowest.  In addition, it is better to take a half-day ticket.  Five hours is often enough to get on the road, and going up the track for longer so that the payment is not wasted, you risk getting hurt, as fatigue interferes with good coordination.  In general, all reviews agree that the resort is very good, not too expensive and has a sufficient arsenal of funds to organize excellent leisure. </p>
