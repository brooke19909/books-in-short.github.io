  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Emerald Hills": reviews, address, developer</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Well, which of us does not dream of our own apartment?  And if we are talking about square meters in the capital, the proposal becomes more attractive.  For a high standard of living, wide opportunities for personal and professional growth, many come to Moscow from remote cities and villages.  But almost everyone is faced with fairly high prices for metropolitan real estate.  Do you really have to say goodbye to your dream once and for all? </p><p>  An alternative to expensive apartments in Moscow will be housing in the region.  Moreover, just a few km from MKAD, you can buy a spacious, functional apartment with significant savings.  One of these options is precisely the LCD "Emerald Hills".  Feedback on the project will be an excellent information base and will help all inexperienced customers to make the really right choice in all respects.  We will consider all the main components. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  So, LCD "Emerald Hills" (Krasnogorsk) is a fully inhabited and well-maintained area with developed infrastructure.  20 monolithic-brick buildings were erected in a picturesque area on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã80 hectares.  At the moment, this is one of the largest residential projects in the Moscow region, in which it was possible to take into account all the wishes of modern residents of the capital.  Until some time ago, no one could have imagined that just a few km from the Moscow Ring Road you can find such a quiet, calm and secluded place, while receiving the comfort and mobility of a city dweller.  It must be admitted that recently the Moscow Region complexes are becoming increasingly popular, and not only because of the reduced price. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="vizco.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Emerald Hills neighborhood" class="if uuid-2972274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2972274.jpg"></div><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  Of course, such a large-scale project could be entrusted only to qualified specialists, real professionals of the construction industry.  The developer of the complex in Krasnogorsk is a company with a long history in the Moscow market - a subsidiary of the huge construction holding group Etalon. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Experienced realtors strongly recommend starting from a place in choosing housing.  In the end, each of us is attached not to the square meters themselves, but to the environment that surrounds them: the street, the square in the neighboring courtyard, and walking areas.  So, for the construction of a new residential neighborhood "Emerald Hills" an excellent place was chosen - the floodplain of the Moscow River, surrounded on all sides by a forest.  Many of the first buyers just say that they first fell in love with a place, and only then began to choose an apartment.  Indeed, the wide forest belt has become a kind of barrier to noise, dust of the capital, providing all residents with clean cool air, as well as an excellent walking area.  You have no doubt: you will no longer have to go out on a picnic hundreds of kilometers away, because on the territory of your complex all conditions will be created for a complete family vacation: shady alleys, areas with gazebos and benches, sports and playgrounds, both for children and for adults. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd emerald hills how to get" class="if uuid-2972284" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2972284.jpg"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The developer of the Emerald Hills residential complex has provided all the details: choosing a location for the future facility, he took into account car traffic, as well as the availability of public transport routes.  Such an approach made it possible to satisfy the needs of absolutely all residents, both with personal transport and without it.  The project was put into operation, therefore, it is already possible to evaluate the actions and promises of the Etalon Group.  And she is positive. </p><p>  What does the Emerald Hills LCD offer?  How to get to it?  Volokolamsk highway passes near a new residential neighborhood, providing convenient and unhindered access to the Moscow Ring Road.  By personal transport you will need only 15 minutes to get to the capital.  As residents note, traffic congestion is not ruled out, but they do not significantly affect the duration of the journey.  The city has a well-organized transport system, represented by a sufficient number of fixed-route taxis.  You can get to the capital by train from the Opaliha and Krasnogorskaya stations. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.8360753" data-lng="37.28029140000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="18"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/9/9/6/11996.png"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  For all those who are considering residential complexes near Moscow, the issue of infrastructure is of no small importance.  Indeed, no one wants to move from a developed metropolitan area, surrounded by all the blessings of modern humanity, even to the greenest and most environmentally friendly, but completely unsuitable for a full-fledged existence area.  What can the Emerald Hills LCD offer?  In the reviews of residents, much attention is paid to infrastructure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="domorder.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd emerald hills address" class="if uuid-2972286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2972286.jpg"></div><p>  The first thing that catches your eye is the round-the-clock protection of the complex, as well as the availability of a video surveillance system.  Such measures allowed each resident to provide the necessary level of security.  You can rest assured: outsiders will not enter the complex, so feel free to let your children go to the playground.  In the yards, a comprehensive improvement of the territory was carried out: playgrounds and sports grounds for children of various ages, walking paths, a recreation area with gazebos and benches. </p><p>  We want to remind you that the complex was built in an area with developed infrastructure.  Within a radius of a kilometer there are several kindergartens and secondary schools, a clinic and a hospital. </p><h2>  Parking </h2><p>  For any <span>residential complex</span> located outside the MKAD, the organization of parking is of great importance.  No matter how thoughtful and comfortable the area may be, no matter how spacious and beautiful the apartments may be, you are unlikely to want to spend hours of precious time looking for free space for a car.  It must be admitted that it is this shortcoming that can become an essential reason for moving.  The developer of the Emerald Hills residential complex paid great attention to this problem by proposing an underground parking.  Even now, when the complex is almost completely populated, the problem of the lack of packing places does not exist here. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  Of course, potential buyers of real estate are interested not only in location, infrastructure, but also in those apartments that are offered by the Emerald Hills residential complex.  Feedback from the first tenants is the best information base in this case.  Comfort class apartments - this is how the developer positions his square meters.  So what is included in this concept? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kvmeter.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments in emerald hills" class="if uuid-2972978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2972978.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, this is the spaciousness of each apartment.  The choice of customers presented to the studio, one-, two-, three- and four-room options, among which everyone will find something special.  Spacious dressing rooms are provided for storing things, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe kitchen is enough to organize a place not only for preparing lunches and dinners, but also for receiving guests.  Large and friendly families can count on an additional bathroom, which will provide comfort to everyone living.  Every square meter has been thought out, which allows rational and functional use of space - that‚Äôs what the residents are talking about.  People buy an apartment for a long time, so they are so careful in choosing a layout.  Agree, another important issue is the availability of decoration.  Recently, many construction companies offer apartments that are completely ready for living.  The LCD "Emerald Hills" was no exception.  Decorated apartments are not luxury, but affordable reality.  Moreover, as the residents say, they were offered a choice of style, which made it possible to take into account all taste wishes.  The work was performed so high quality that no one had any complaints. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  Apartments in the Emerald Hills are a pretty bargain.  Currently, most of them are sold out, but there is still the opportunity to become the owner of square meters in a fully ready-to-move complex.  So, a studio of 30 m2 can be purchased for only 3 million rubles, and a four-room apartment of 120 m2 will cost only 9 million rubles.  I must admit that it was the democratic value that largely affected the popularity of the Emerald Hills project.  The prices are not final, for more information you should contact the sales office. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd emerald hills reviews" class="if uuid-2972271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2972271.jpg"></div><h2>  Terms of purchase </h2><p>  Not everyone has the necessary amount to buy an apartment in the Moscow Region.  Most often, income barely allows you to collect the down payment, which is why you need to get acquainted not only with the project itself, but also with the conditions for the purchase of apartments that the developer offers. </p><p>  So, the company cooperates with the largest banks, so you can get a mortgage on very favorable terms - from 7.5% per annum.  In addition, the developer holds promotions, for example, in honor of the upcoming New Year holidays, promising 10% savings.  And finally, the most interesting offer is the opportunity to purchase an apartment by installments until 2023.  You can rest assured that no other company will offer you a more profitable option.  Well, of course, you can buy an apartment here under the military mortgage program, which also not all developers offer. </p><h2>  Project Benefits </h2><p>  Finally, the time has come to pay attention to those strengths of the Emerald Hills residential complex (Krasnogorsk), which were noted not by the developer himself, but by those who managed to live here for some time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lan.estate" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd emerald hills builder" class="if uuid-2972280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2972280.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, this is an excellent location and transport accessibility.  Indeed, the project is surrounded by forest, therefore it is always clean, fresh and cool.  Some say that the territory of the complex is a kind of oasis, an isolated place where it is always comfortable.  The western direction is currently a priority, so it is so comfortable to live here.  The indisputable advantage of the location is the availability of railway communication - now your plans will not violate traffic congestion, repair work.  Even the lack of personal transport will not in this case become an obstacle to mobility. </p><p>  Gorgeous view from the window - perhaps it was because of him that many fell in love with the Emerald Hills microdistrict.  Every day you will not admire the neighbors from other houses, but nature in its original form.  Spacious apartments, a variety of planning solutions, decoration - that is also impressive.  Currently, a huge number of new buildings are being built, but the description on the site is far from always true.  As residents note, reality turned out to be better than expected. </p><h2>  Weaknesses </h2><p>  The first tenants have already started receiving utility bills.  And here one significant drawback was revealed - high tariffs.  And this is despite the fact that counters are installed in each apartment.  Currently, a house management company is trying to solve this problem. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lan.estate" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="group reference" class="if uuid-2972289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2972289.jpg"></div><p>  Here is another omission - at the present time the management company does not allow changing the Internet provider.  The one that is offered does not cope with the needs of residents, therefore, on their initiative, signatures were collected for making changes and the possibility of attracting other companies. </p><p>  There are problems with the organization of the social infrastructure of the Emerald Hills residential complex.  Reviews confirm that getting a child to a local kindergarten or school is quite problematic.  If a private kindergarten were built on the territory of the complex, this would at least partially solve the existing problem. </p><p>  Residents complain of traffic jams, especially in the mornings and evenings.  It must be admitted that this feature is characteristic of almost all areas of Moscow and the Moscow region.  In this case, a wide transport network helps minimize congestion. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  If you decide to visit the LCD "Emerald Hills", address: Moscow Region, Krasnogorsk, blvd.  Cosmonauts.  Feel free to go there to personally get to know him, to assess the strengths and weaknesses.  Perhaps after the first visit you will want to stay here. </p>
