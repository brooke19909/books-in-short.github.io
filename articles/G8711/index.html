Rooms with terraces have sun loungers, which is very convenient for an afternoon break with a view of the nature.  Plumbing and appliances are in good condition, a minibar and regular stocks of coffee / tea are replenished.  Some tourists complained about the carelessness of the presence of cosmetics in the bathroom and their late replenishment. </p><p>  Internet quality and speed are satisfactory. </p><p>  Guests note a pleasant neighborhood of Turks and Europeans in the hotel and a low percentage of Russian-speaking vacationers. </p>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Most vacationers were satisfied with the assortment of buffet dishes and their quality.  It is important that the menu at the <span>Side Sungate Hotel 5 * hotel (Turkey) is</span> varied and new dishes are offered daily.  A variety of meat, cheeses, desserts and cream soups delighted guests.  Always offered fish, different types of potatoes, pasta and lots of fruits and vegetables.  As the dishes are consumed, their supplies are replenished.  The nutrition of the hotel has earned positive ratings for the availability of various options for how to feed children of different ages.  Parents leave grateful feedback addressed to the cooks and administration.  There are some minor remarks regarding the over-sharpness of the dishes, but they are not critical.  A very important factor is the lack of queues for receiving dishes.  But, as tourists say, everyone has enough food.  Nobody will be hungry here. </p><p>  Among the tourists who rested in the hotel during the peak season, there were complaints about the failed dinner in a la carte restaurants due to the maximum occupancy of the hotel and the lines. </p>

    <h2>  Opinions about the sea and the beach </h2><p>  The hotel is located on the second coastline, so you need to walk 150 meters to the sea.  Some families covered this distance in two minutes, others in eight to ten, slowly enjoying the promenade.  Along the way there are a lot of plants forming a shadow, almost no traffic, the path is convenient.  The beach of the hotel is sandy, clean (beachboy regularly removes garbage during the day), but small.  Sun beds and umbrellas are always available, towels are provided.  A very convenient service is plastic storage rooms on the coast, where you can put valuables and safely go to sea with a key on your bracelet. </p><p>  There is no unequivocal opinion of the guests on the fullness of the beach: one had a lot of space, free sunbeds and few people even with 100% occupancy, others were crowded during periods when some of the rooms were empty.  Due to its shallow depth and gentle entrance, the beach is considered ideal for children.  The sea is clean and gentle, no complaints about the low water temperature were recorded even from tourists resting in the velvet season. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel staff </h2><p>  Initially, the <span>Side Sungate 5 *</span> hotel is focused on European tourists, so Russian-speaking employees are rarely found on staff.  But they all speak good English, so the language barrier can be overcome by knowing this language.  The hotel staff are modest and unobtrusive, as noted above, do not insist on a tip.  Service in bars and restaurants is highly rated by tourists.  Turks treat children very warmly, according to tourists' reviews, after a request, the staff brought toys for the sandbox to children on the beach. </p><p>  In general, the staff is attentive and helpful. </p>
