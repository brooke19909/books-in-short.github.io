    <h2>  General information and infrastructure of the area </h2><p>  The Tolstoy cape (Gelendzhik) district is located within walking distance from the city center.  Here are the most luxurious apartments in Gelendzhik, which any tourist can rent for a vacation.  You can stay here in hotels, and there are quite a lot of them in the area, or in private houses.  There will be no problems with food and entertainment.  The thick cape is a place of gathering of restaurants and shops. </p><p>  Also, tourists will like two equipped beaches of the Cape Tolstoy.  One of them is sandy, the other is pebble.  Of the entertainment for the whole family, the <span>Dolphin water park</span> is most popular <span>.</span>  A quiet, but at the same time an interesting vacation - this is what Gelendzhik can boast of. </p><p>  The private sector (Cape Thick is a good example) occupies a large part of the city, so it is calm and comfortable here.  By the way, vacationers can always be located in one of the private houses, removing it completely or one room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cape Thick Gelendzhik" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/484189.jpg" width="500"></div>

Near it there are several cozy pebble beaches.  However, not everyone can get to them.  Tourists who want to relax here will have to go down the steep stairs.  But the beaches are worth it.  The water here is very clean and clear.  Locals call these beaches "Krucha".  There is always a choice, and tourists who settled in the Cape Tolstoy district can go sunbathing on the central <span>beach of Gelendzhik.</span> </p><p>  More recently, a new microdistrict has opened near the lighthouse - Yuzhnaya Street.  Let it be small, but it has many shops, cafes and modern hotels.  If you settle on this street, there will be no need to go to the city center, although it can be reached on foot - 20-30 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik private sector Thick cape" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/484180.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <p>  Of course, every vacationer should visit the local restaurant "Steeper".  It is very popular among tourists.  It serves delicious dishes of Russian and <span>Caucasian cuisine.</span> </p><p>  As for the locals, the bulk of them are hospitable and friendly people.  They will always show the way, help you navigate in the city, find the right place, advise you on the choice of a restaurant or a store.  Hospitality is a hallmark of the city of Gelendzhik. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The thick cape is a district that attracts nudists.  This phenomenon is not uncommon here, so do not be surprised to see a naked man on the beach.  Most often, nudists go to sunbathe over the lighthouse, here are the so-called <span>wild beaches.</span>  The only drawback of these places is the accumulation of garbage.  It is removed only at the beginning and at the end of the season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik Thick Cape Hotels" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/484185.jpg" width="560"></div>
