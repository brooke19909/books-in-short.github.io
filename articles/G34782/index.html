His descendants are scattered all over the world today.  So, for example, the eldest grandson of the leader - Eugene (1936) - the son of <span>Jacob Dzhugashvili</span> - lives in Georgia, <span>Alexander Burdonsky</span> (son of Vasily Stalin) - lives in Moscow, Ekaterina Zhdanova (1950) - in Kamchatka, and the youngest Stalin’s granddaughter Chris (Olga) Evans lives in the United States. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chris Evans Stalin's granddaughter" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/287161.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  Sisters Ekaterina and Olga are not familiar with each other.  Back in the early 60s, the children of Svetlana Alliluyeva - Joseph and Catherine - renounced the traitor mother who had left the USSR.  And of course, they didn’t even want to know about the birth of their younger American sister.  Joseph, who worked for many years in a Moscow hospital and was an excellent specialist in hematology, passed away five years ago. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ekaterina Zhdanova, granddaughter of Stalin," class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/287164.jpg" width="225"></div>  But the eldest daughter of Svetlana - Ekaterina Zhdanova (granddaughter of Stalin) was known as a "Kamchatka recluse."  She is a volcanologist, and she, apart from science, is perhaps not interested in anything in the world.  She probably forgot about her famous roots.  After the tragic death of her husband V. Kozev, she began to lead a reclusive life.  Even her only daughter and granddaughter rarely visit her.  Interestingly, she would not want to meet her younger sister, who is suitable for her in age as a daughter?

For example, his daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva (from her mother) hid from her paparazzi all her life.  Her two older children renounced her: Catherine and Joseph, and Olga, Stalin's youngest granddaughter, was forced to follow her mother from one country to another.  The girl was born in 1973 in New York.  Her father was an American architect, William Peters.  After marrying him, Svetlana Alliluyeva became known as Lana Peters and acquired <span>American citizenship,</span> but she named her daughter <span>Olga with a</span> Russian <span>name.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="granddaughter of Stalin" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/287391.jpg" width="380"></div>  The marriage with the architect was short-lived.  Svetlana with her daughter left for New Jersey.  The girl was burdened by her Russian name and everywhere was signed by Chris Peters.  In addition, they swept their tracks in this way; many did not even know about their Soviet origin.  However, after the paparazzi were able to figure them out, mother and daughter fled to Europe, to foggy Albion.  Chris began to study at one of the Cambridge schools.  Over time, the girl began to ask her mother about her past, about her grandfather, and then Svetlana told her about the crimes that the leader committed in relation to his people.  Stalin’s granddaughter was shocked by what she heard and began to better understand her mother. <br><br>  When Svetlana Alliluyeva publicly burned her Soviet passport and began to support dissidents, she gained unprecedented popularity in Western society, and her autobiographical book was instantly sold out and brought her two and a half million dollars in income.  When Chris was 13, they went with their mother to the USSR.  Svetlana wanted to introduce her daughter to her brother and sister.

    <p>  However, Catherine had long lived in Kamchatka and did not want to know either mother or sister, and brother Joseph, despite being a doctor, often went to the hospital himself, where he was treated for binges.  Soon they returned to Britain, and the 16-year-old Chris got married, but not having lived with her husband and two years, she divorced him and went to her father in Wisconsin.  Today, Stalin's youngest granddaughter Olga (Chris) lives in Portland, Oregon, and owns an antique shop.  Rarely does anyone suspect that this forty-year-old modest woman is the granddaughter of Stalin who won the war.  This is only evidenced by the photograph stored in her house, in which her famous grandfather Joseph hugs his beloved Svetochka - mother Chris. </p>
