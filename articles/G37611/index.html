    <h2>  Briefly about the main thing </h2><p>  In the territory of the Teberdinsky reserve (Karaevo-Cherkess Republic, Russia) there are Baduk lakes.  How to get to them, every local knows.  These ponds are the main decoration of the protected area.  They were formed as a result of the spill of the Baduk River, the left tributary of the Teberda. </p><p>  The origin of the Baduk lakes is zavalno-dam.  Their history spans about 200 years.  They were formed as a result of the collapse of part of the mountain, which blocked the path of the river flow.  The nearest settlement is the city of Teberda, also located in the reserve. </p><p>  Baduk lakes have ordinal names: First, Second and Third.  The order of counting starts from the lowest reservoir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baduk lakes how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1166674.jpg" width="600"></div>

A pond of medium depth, the maximum value of which is within 4.5 m. The shores of the lake are made of granite.  Around it stretch beautiful forests.  The water in the lake is cool throughout the year, and on the hottest days it does not warm up more than to + 5 ¬∞ .  Baduk lakes are located at a certain distance.  From the first to the second it is only 260 meters. </p><h2>  Second lake </h2><p>  At an altitude of almost 2,000 m above sea level, the Second Lake is located.  Its size is twice as large as that of the First and is 200 m. The distance from the Second to the Third is 60 m. It is worth noting that Baduk lakes have different natural features of the coastline.  The hiking route does not imply an approach to the water of the Second Lake.  This is mainly due to the complex and dangerous coast. </p><h2>  Third lake </h2><p>  The third body of water, which is also called the Big Baduk Lake, is the largest and deepest of the entire cascade.  Its dimensions exceed the length of 300 m, the maximum depth of the reservoir - 9 meters.  Water in the Third Baduk Lake warms up in the hot season to + 10 ¬∞ C, this figure is the highest among all the others.  Another difference of the Third Lake from others is the amazing transparency of the water, which has a turquoise color.  It even has trout. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baduk lakes route" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1166672.jpg" width="600"></div>

On the shores of lakes and in the nearby forests - more than 1,000 diverse representatives of the flora, 500 species of mushrooms, more than 50 species of mammals, almost 3,000 species of various insects and more than 200 species of birds.
