    <h2>  History of the region </h2><p>  The first documented references to the Piedmont region (Italy) date back to the 13th century.  In those days there were many small feudal estates, there was no single government and culture.  Only in the 15th century did these lands form part of the Duchy of Savoy.  In the 18th century, Piedmont formed the basis of the Sardinian state, the capital of which was Turin.  At the beginning of the 19th century, the region was ruled by France for some time.  But since 1820 it has gained independence and has become one of the most developed and prosperous areas of Italy.  It was the locals who became the main driving force in several Italian revolutions.  It was around Piedmont (Sardinian kingdom) that <span>Italy was unified</span> into an integral country in 1860. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
