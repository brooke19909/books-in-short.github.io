An obvious proof of this is the success that the American Family telenovela acquired.  Actors for 7 seasons delight the audience with a talented game.  Their characters endlessly fall into adventure, rejoice and be sad, conflict and reconcile with each other, fall in love and break up.  Who can be called the true stars of the television saga, who plays the main and secondary characters? </p><h2>  "American Family": actors, the story of the creation of the series </h2><p>  It's no secret that viewers of the 21st century make increasingly high demands on the plot of the series, choosing interesting television stories to watch.  It is unlikely that anyone will be enthralled for a long time by the prospect of observing the relationships of ‚Äústandard families‚Äù, consisting of a mother, father and a couple of children.  This fact was taken into account by Stephen Levitan and <span>Christopher Lloyd,</span> whose script served as the basis for the TV series "American Family".  The actors, the story of the creation of the telenovela and interesting facts about the filming have not been in vain for several years occupied fans, as the result of the efforts of the scriptwriters turned out to be unique. </p>

    <p>  A pilot episode of the show was presented to the public in 2009, he was greeted with a standing ovation.  Already a few months later, the television project, which was rapidly gaining popularity, was officially extended for the second season.  At the moment, to the delight of fans of the "American Family", 7 released seasons are presented.  It is planned to continue the beloved by millions of stories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The creators of the show seriously approached the filming of the series "American Family".  The actors who were to play the central characters underwent a serious casting.  Some of the initially approved lead actors have been replaced by others.  For example, Phil Dunphy could be played by Rob Huebel, and the image of Jay, the head of the family, was almost embodied by Craig T. Nelson. </p><h2>  The plot of the series </h2><p>  As the name implies, the telenovela tells the audience the story of a large family.  More precisely, we are talking immediately about the three cells of society that have close family ties with each other.  It is unlikely that viewers will be able to figure out who and who has to, just starting to watch the TV series "American Family".  Actors, we must pay tribute to the creators of the project, really look like relatives. </p>

    <p>  At first glance, the Clare family seems to be the most exemplary of the three cells, with the actress Julie Bowen playing the role of mother.  The young housewife has a husband and three children, each of whom is a bright personality.  The family created by Claire‚Äôs father looks completely different, managing to fall in love with the sultry Colombian, raising her son alone.  Finally, there is also an unconventional couple in the series who are raising an adopted daughter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The image and character of the protagonist change from series to series, which does not allow the audience to get bored with the soap opera "American Family".  Actors thanks to this approach get the opportunity to maximize their characters. </p><h2>  Who is Jay Pritchett </h2><p>  The role of the "patriarch" of the large family of Jay Pritchett, after much hesitation, was proposed by the creators of Ed O-Nill.  This man coped with the task assigned to him, like the other stars of the TV series "American Family" (the actors are fully consistent with their roles).  Throughout his life, Jay adhered to conservative views, did not like to draw attention to himself, was distinguished by hard work, which allowed him to put together a small capital. </p>

    <p>  The life of the "patriarch" turned upside down after meeting with a mysterious burning beauty.  She turned out to be a young Colombian named Gloria, a single mother with a teenage son.  After the wedding, the new wife and son settled in Jay's house, as a result of which his lifestyle has undergone dramatic changes.  This person also has serious problems associated with his own children.  For example, he is unhappy that his son Mitchell declared himself a homosexual and is trying to build his life with a guy.  Jay also does not like the daughter of Claire‚Äôs husband, who gives the impression of a near-by man.  Nevertheless, the father loves his children very much, he is ready at any second to come to their aid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  People starring in the series, in most cases, were unfamiliar to the public before the American Family came out, the actors became famous precisely because of this project.  Among the exceptions is Ed O-Nill, who has already managed to play several memorable roles before.  For example, ‚ÄúJay‚Äù can be seen in the soap opera ‚ÄúMarried, with Children‚Äù. </p><h2>  Jay Pritchett's wife </h2><p>  Of course, the fans of the television saga cannot but be occupied with the personality of the star who embodied the image of the Colombian Gloria, which made the elder Pritchett lose his head in his declining years.  It is interesting to the public, like all other actors playing central characters in the TV series "American Family".  Sofia Vengara is an actress who embodied the image of sexual Gloria.  The career of a star began with the work of a top model.  She can be seen in films such as "Big Trouble", "Blood for Blood."  Sofia also starred in the television projects "The Beauties", "The Simpsons". </p>

    <p>  Gloria was born in a small Colombian village, but <span>personal circumstances</span> forced her to move to the States.  The marriage with Jay was concluded by a girl for love, she is absolutely not confused by the significant age difference.  Gloria also loves her son Manny, whose education she was engaged in solitude before meeting her husband. </p><h2>  Foster son of Jay Pritchett </h2><p>  Manny's role is played wonderfully by a young man named Rico Rodriguez.  He was not known to the public until his appearance in the TV series "American Family", whose actors and characters literally bewitched millions of viewers.  Hero Rico Manny in many ways resembles a mother, as desperate and passionate, sometimes too stubborn and direct.  He has a wonderful relationship with his stepfather, he is always ready to help the guy, he perceives him as his own son. </p><p>  Manny often finds himself in funny situations, so he is loved by the audience.  For example, a teenager is able to offer to meet a girl who is several years older than him. </p><h2>  Julie Bowen and her character </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Claire Dunphy is Mr. Pritchett's own daughter from his first marriage.  The woman playing this heroine became a star only after the release of the described television saga, like many other actors starring in the TV show "American Family".  <span>Julie Bowen</span> can also be seen in the paintings "Lost", "Ambulance", "Boston Lawyers." </p>

    <p>  Most of the time the heroine is devoted to caring for the family.  Claire married at a young age, lives with her husband Phil for more than 16 years.  The young woman is a little upset that the husband cannot get along with her father, who perceives him as a big child.  But Claire has an excellent relationship with her brother Mitchell, she supports his right to a homosexual family. </p><h2>  Who plays husband Claire </h2><p>  The Dunphy couple have three children - two daughters and one son.  Unfortunately Claire, she and her husband are not able to adhere to a common style of raising offspring.  She tries to be strict where her husband is trying to behave democratically.  Phil Dunphy is played by Ty Burell, who, like the other actors in the American Family series, owes his project popularity. </p>

    <p>  Fans will be able to admire Burella in the films ‚ÄúDawn of the Dead‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlack Hawk‚Äù.  In the "American Family" he plays a great adult child. </p><h2>  Children claire </h2><p>  Haley is the daughter of Claire, whose image is created by aspiring actress Sarah Hyland.  The girl is worried about problems typical of her age.  She seems to herself ugly, not well-dressed, useless to anyone.  Often, Haley conflicts with her younger sister Alex, who likes to play her, and her daughter's relationship with her mother does not add up. </p><p>  If Haley is a little stupid, then Alex, played by Ariel Winter, is, on the contrary, overly smart.  The child considers the rest of the family members to be retarded, reluctantly spends time with his brother and sister, growing closed.  Son of Claire - Luke Danfi - has nothing in common with sisters.  Such qualities as curiosity, mischief, vigor are characteristic of him.  Luke gets along well with his father, but hates sister Alex.  The boy is played by Nolan Gould. </p><h2>  The most unconventional family </h2><p>  Spectators who sincerely believe exclusively in traditional family foundations may not like the American Family television project, and actors and roles can shock them.  This is especially true for members of an unconventional cell in society.  Jesse Ferguson got the role of Mitchell, son of Jay.  This is a calm young man, by all means looking for a rapprochement with his father, dissatisfied with his non-standard orientation.  The viewer could remember the actor as Richie Welch from the popular sitcom ‚ÄúClass‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  Eric Stonestreet plays partner with Mitchell Cameron.  Like other actors in the movie "American Family", he is forced to embody the image of a hero who is not much like him in character.  Eric admits that sometimes it becomes difficult for him to play a childishly naive, slightly hot-tempered hero.  Sincere love connects with Mitchell Cameron, however, the dissimilarity of characters often causes a quarrel.  The situation was complicated when an unconventional couple adopted a girl. </p><h2>  TV series reviews </h2><p>  Of course, not only positive reviews receive telenovela "American Family".  Actors, the criticism of which is mainly related to certain acts of characters that seem wrong to the audience, are already accustomed to negative statements addressed to them.  Many radical public figures are also outraged by the fact that one of the families, whose everyday life is revealed in detail in the series, is unconventional. </p><p>  To watch or not to watch the soap opera, numbering already 7 seasons, which has won millions of fans?  Each viewer answers this question independently. </p>
