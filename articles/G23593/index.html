In order to <span>sew a hat</span> from knitwear, a pattern is also needed.  To build it, you need to measure the circumference of the head and the height from the middle of the forehead to the crown.  Based on these values, the product template will be built.  So, on a paper draw a rectangle with sides equal to the height of the head and 1/2 measure of volume.  In the upper part on the template draw recesses that will ensure a perfect fit of the product.  To do this, on both sides of the rectangle on lines equal to the height of the head, the lines are slightly rounded to the middle.  In the center of the pattern also draw a small elongated triangle with a vertex strictly pointing down.  Next, the template is cut out, and it can be used for sewing the product. </p><h2>  Lapel cap </h2><p>  How to sew a hat from knitwear with a small lapel?

But in a hat with synthetic fibers it will be hot and uncomfortable. </p>
