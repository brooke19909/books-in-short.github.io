  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thermal imagers for smartphones</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Thermal imaging cameras are very widely used in modern society.  They are used by the military, builders, rescuers, electricians, as well as to create security systems and surveillance devices.  At the same time, the popularity of these devices has become so vast that it has surpassed the elementary need.  Given this, some companies decided to launch the release of gadgets that can connect with mobile devices on different operating systems.  The first of these devices was FLIR One in the form of a cover for iPhone5, which was presented in 2014 at the exhibition in Las Vegas.  That is why Flir Systems is rightly considered the founder of this industry, and its products are recognized as the best in their field. </p><h2>  Thermal imager models for smartphones </h2><p>  To date, there are several manufacturers of such gadgets.  The most popular of them can be called such brands as: FLIR, Seek and Opgal.  Therefore before <noindex>  <span>choose a thermal imager for a smartphone</span> </noindex>  , it is necessary to study some of the most popular models, and based on their characteristics and tests make a decision.  In this case, it is necessary to pay attention to such parameters as: matrix, resolution and the presence of additional functions that may be useful during operation.  Below is a list of the best modern models of such gadgets. </p><ol><li>  In the first place will be <noindex>  <span>FLIR One for Android</span> </noindex>  second generation with a matrix of 160 by 120 pixels.  This device was made on the basis of the updated Lepton IR module.  It allows you to take pictures with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels and at the same time has a very simple control that can be mastered in just ten minutes.  It can be used in everyday life and in the professional sphere, and the cost of such a thermal imager allows you to purchase it for private use. </li><li>  Seek Thermal for iOs and Android uses a 206 x 156 pixel infrared sensor for its work.  The device also uses chalcogenide lenses and a VOx microbolometer. </li><li>  The Opgal Therm-App thermal imager differs significantly from previous models, primarily due to its cost.  The fact is that Therm-App offers a resolution for devices of its class 384 x 288 pixels.  Professionals really appreciate these parameters, since they are 110.592 pixels in full screen.  Also, this gadget has a lot of additional features that are simply necessary with a professional approach to business.  However, it is precisely its value that drives the buyer towards other models. </li><li>  Smartphone with integrated CAT S60 thermal imager.  This device is unique in its class, because it combines two gadgets at once.  At the same time, it has a maximum degree of protection against water and good shockproof performance.  However, taking into account that the scope of the thermal imager usually extends to those places or conditions where there is practically no communication or is unsafe to use, such an arrangement is impractical. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Where are thermal imagers suitable for smartphones? </h2><p>  It is believed that the scope of these gadgets is very limited.  However, as practice has shown, they are used everywhere and sometimes much more often than professional devices. </p><ul><li>  First of all, such products are used by builders when they detect heat loss in a building.  They are much cheaper than professional equipment and quite cope with the task. </li><li>  Also, these devices have proven themselves in hunting.  At the same time, the patented MSX function of the FLIR One product for Android makes it possible to combine the real picture with infrared, which allows you to get more details.  This sets warm objects against the background. </li><li>  Electricians using a thermal imager can find damage in the wiring, as well as determine the location of the breakdown of insulation. </li><li>  For a car mechanic, the device will detect engine overheating spots. </li><li>  The cook can determine the exact temperature of his dishes. </li><li>  The most widespread such gadgets are among tourists.  They allow you to find your way in the dark or in fog. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Given all the features of thermal imagers and their scope in everyday life, we can conclude that it is best to purchase a product with low cost, but with a clear image.  All this is implemented in the FLIR One model thanks to the MSX function, and Pergamum has the most affordable price and availability of its service center for this gadget. </p></div></article>
