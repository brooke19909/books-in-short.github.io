    <h2>  Arrival at Vera Stone Palace </h2><p>  We begin our presentation from the point of view of a person who has just arrived from the airport to the place of his guesthouse.  Forty minutes of travel from Antalya Airport and before his eyes - entrance to the hotel - an arch with its name and brand name.  Immediately behind it is a parking lot under a canopy for vehicles of staff, as well as vacationers renting cars.  It is striking that the territory of the hotel complex Vera Stone Palace Side 5 (and it is rather big - 32 thousand m <sup>2</sup> ) is very well-groomed, numerous walking terraces are laid on it, it is planted with palm trees, ornamental shrubs, lawns, flower beds.  In addition, it is decorated with numerous bright children's play areas. </p><h2>  Reception </h2><p>  Upon arrival, the hotel staff helps to transfer things to the reception.  New arrivals are awaiting differential service from Vera Stone Palace Side 5 - PP DBL (i.e. per person and double).  Check-in at the hotel itself usually occurs at 14-00.  An observing visitor, considering the reception area located in the central building, will immediately understand why the name of the hotel complex has the word Palace.  It's all about architecture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vera stone palace side 5 reviews" class="if" height="187" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/523076.jpg" width="600"></div>

The huge internal volume of fresh air-conditioned air, as well as the fact that visitors are not constrained by low ceilings, speaks in favor of this name.  Vertical <span>natural light</span> falls here through a glazed roof in the center of this unique building through a stylish atrium equipped on top.  And under the glass dome is equipped with a unique multi-tiered lamp with a translucent design.  The reception area floor is lined with artificial marble <span>imitating</span> marble.

For example, Zitrin (citrine, <span>golden topaz</span> ), Emerald (emerald), etc.  Thus, the entire structure of the hotel can be represented as a kind of precious necklace.  According to reviews of some holidaymakers, it was sometimes funny to them to listen to the staff‚Äôs conversation during the holidays.  Of course, not everyone understands the <span>Turkish language</span> , but because of the names of stones that appear in the dialogs of the hotel staff, it may seem that you hear the communication of jewelers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The impression of the rooms </h2><p>  As usual, on the eve of choosing a hotel complex for holidays, potential vacationers also learned all about the 330 rooms of Vera Stone Palace Side 5.

Children's artificial pond is equipped with an awning, so here a child can relax without a panama hat. </p><p>  The relaxation pool is designed for older people who prefer to swim calmly, without the squeals of kids and the bustle of athletes.

    <p>  The beach of the Vera Stone Palace <span>Side 5</span> hotel <span>(Turkey) is</span> wonderful, sandy, with a smooth entry into the water.  There are enough deck chairs and umbrellas for everyone.  Therefore, taking a seat on it in the morning is not necessary, which is always nice.  The Mediterranean deserves special praise.  No wonder Homer called it wine-growing!  It is almost always calm in the hotel‚Äôs water, only small waves appear in the evening.  Water is warm, like milk, visible to a great depth. </p><h2>  Hotel for families with children </h2><p>  If you read the reviews of spa guests, it is most often referred to as the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù and ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs‚Äù hotel Vera Stone Palace <span>Side 5</span> (Turkey) considered by us.

Positive, friendly animators quickly find contact with children, they know their names.  The hotel created a colorful children's town with beautiful landscaping, playgrounds with swings and attractions, a cinema, two special children's pools.  Thus, a well-thought-out infrastructure for children‚Äôs recreation in Vera Stone Palace Side 5 Side is comprehensively built.  Photos dedicated to spa holidays, perhaps, therefore, delight the eyes with a constellation of children's happy faces and smiles. </p><h2>  Mini club.  Schedule before lunch </h2>
