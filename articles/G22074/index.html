    <p>  However, for those who have never placed an order, the question remains of how to receive a parcel from Aliexpress via post. </p><p>  Thanks to cheap prices and free delivery (in many cases), people are ready to order completely different goods there.  The most active and knowledgeable users even make money by ordering products on the site at very low prices and selling them at a profit for themselves.  At the same time, citizens who find out about the site are often afraid to place an order, because they are not sure that they will be sent a package, or they doubt the quality of the goods, or they don‚Äôt even know how to receive it, how long to wait, and the like.  Let‚Äôs try to make out clearly how to receive a parcel from "Aliexpress" in the mail. </p><h2>  What is Aliexpress? </h2><p>  "Aliexpress" is an online store that sells a lot of goods wholesale and retail at cheap prices.  It also includes the Alibaba Group, a Chinese public company engaged in Internet commerce. </p>

    <p>  Thus, you can really make a purchase from the site at very low and competitive prices.  In addition, do not forget that you can find goods with discounts up to 90% - this promises obvious benefits.  Now we‚Äôll directly analyze how to correctly receive a parcel from Aliexpress. </p><h2>  Step one: place an order </h2><p>  Before you ask yourself how to receive a parcel with "Aliexpress" in the mail, you need to understand the correctness of the first step.  Choosing a product on the site, we can‚Äôt just carry out the order.  Of course, for this you need to register your profile, where you fully and correctly indicate the actual address of residence, so that you can receive notifications when your order arrives at the Russian Post office.  After the registration procedure, filling out the profile, you can proceed to the selection of the product you like, see its characteristics.  A translation into Russian is available on the site.  It is also necessary to read customer reviews and comments (this will help to understand whether it is worth buying a product for this money and how much it will wait for its delivery).  Among other things, you can see on the photo the product is what it really looks like (it is often laid out by those who received the parcel). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Delivery of many goods on the site is free, which is a huge benefit of the store.  In this regard, he enjoys such popularity.  You should be careful not to accidentally order goods with paid delivery, since its cost can be quite large.  If everything suits you, choose the color and quantity, then confirm the purchase and pay for it.  The goods on Aliexpress are paid immediately - this is the system, but then we‚Äôll talk about how to return the money if the goods do not arrive or are damaged. </p><h2>  Step Two: Confirmation and Pending Order </h2><p>  We come to the main question about how to receive a parcel from "Aliexpress" in the mail, after how long it will happen and whether it is necessary to pay for something upon receipt.  As it was said, in most cases delivery is free, it is carried out by a service located in China, and in Russia the goods are transferred to the "EMS Russian Post".  I must admit that the goods from the site last quite a long time - from 15 to 45 days, so if you order a thing as a gift, it is better to do it in advance, otherwise you can be late.  After paying for the order on the site, you will receive a confirmation that the seller has sent your order, and after that you can track where it is and estimate how long it will be delivered.  The system updates the data on the ordered product every 4-7 days, so the buyer will have an idea where the product is. </p><h2>  Step Three: Receiving an Order </h2><p>  Many people ask: <span>"How to get a parcel</span> from Aliexpress in the mail?"  In fact, everything is very simple.  You need to come to the post office of Russia, provide a passport and pick up your purchase.  Notices that your order has arrived at the post office are carried by the postman.  However, for various reasons this may not happen.  Therefore, if you see on the site that the product is already in your area (district), but there has not been an update on its location for a long time, then it may already be in place.  You can use a system such as IML mail.  How to receive parcels from Aliexpress, few know, and this fact is scary when ordering goods to new users of the online store.  Getting an order is a pleasant step, but there are certain nuances. </p><h2>  Last step: product inspection and confirmation </h2><p>  Upon receipt of the order, there are important rules that are best followed so that later there are no problems with the return and claims to the seller.  Firstly, if you see that the packaging with the goods is slightly damaged, then here on the spot, refuse to receive it.  Secondly, in order to later prove to the seller the insolvency of the goods, it is better to shoot on video how you open the package and inspect the goods, check its operability, if it is electronics, etc. </p>

    <p>  Why is this needed?  The problem is that if the purchase does not suit you and there is a need to return it, then a dispute with the seller is inevitable.  The buyer must indicate the reason why he requires a refund and is ready to return the goods back.  Such cases are rare for this online store, because the goods there are usually cheap, and for such a price a person will not spend money to return them.  After all, you will have to pay for the return of goods in person.  It is not cheap and unprofitable.  If everything suits you, then you should confirm receipt of the order in your profile and it is advisable to leave a review with the same photos, so that other people know whether to make an order with this seller, whether the price matches the quality.  Thus, we tried to figure out how to receive a parcel from Aliexpress via post.  Place orders, enjoy shopping and be careful. </p>
