Like all children of that time, a boy at the age of six went to the first grade of the Penza secondary school. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vitaliy Atyushov" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46415/1699752.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  As an additional lesson, Vitaly Atyushov‚Äôs father offered hockey.  The boy tried it - he did it and he really liked it.  It was from 1985 that the hockey life of Atyushov began, he attended the hockey school "Diesel", and after a while became a pupil of "Wings of the Soviets." </p><p>  The little hockey player had a dream - to become as good a player as the members of the Penza hockey club Dieselist, and if you are lucky, you can grow to the level of <span>hockey players of the Russian national team</span> . </p><p>  But he was not a fan of anyone, he did not take autographs from popular hockey players and did not take pictures with them.  The only common photo with the hockey player Tretiak appeared in Vitaly only when he himself became famous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Atyushov Vitaliy" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14322/1702451.jpg" width="465"></div>

The guy proved himself well and a year later he entered the main composition of ‚ÄúWings‚Äù.  But in the period from 1996 to 1998 he played only eleven games for this team, and so he was sent home to his own club Dieselist, where he went out on the ice five times in a short period of time.  Then the guy returned to Moscow in the main part of ‚ÄúWings of the Soviets‚Äù. </p><p>  The next hockey club, for which Vitaly Atyushov played, was the Hammer-Prikamye.  He worked in it for three years and proved to be one of the best defenders in the league. </p><p>  2002 also brought changes to the professional life of the athlete - he became a member of the draft of the national hockey league, but he was chosen by the Ottawa Senators club under number 276.  The hockey player has never played for this team.  In the same year, Atyushov Vitaliy got into Ak Bars - Kazan hockey club.  Here he worked only a year, after which he signed a contract with Magnitogorsk Metallurg. </p><h2>  "Metallurgist" </h2><p>  This hockey club has become a job for Vitaly Atyushov for many years, being the main part of this team, the hockey player achieves great professional achievements and awards.  The young athlete was accepted into the main team immediately, from the first season.  Together with Metallurg Atyushov won all possible awards in the Russian Championship and received the Spengler Cup.  As a member of this hockey club, Vitaliy became famous as a good athlete, he was invited to play for the national team of Russia, after which he became the captain of Metallurg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vitaliy Atyushov hockey player" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46415/1699785.jpg" width="600"></div>

The following year, the team in which this athlete participated won bronze.  In 2009, our team received a gold medal, not without the help and participation of Vitaly Atyushov.  At that championship, the hockey player went on the ice nine times, was able to score two goals and five times acted as an assistant. </p><p>  After leaving Metallurg, the hockey player stayed in the Salavat Yulaev team for several years, in 2013 he moved to the Atlant hockey club, where he worked for about a year.  At Tractor, Vitaly lingered about the same amount, and in 2015 signed a contract with the Amur team, for which he still plays. </p><h2>  About personal </h2><p>  As Atyushov himself says, he does not believe in signs that relate to ordinary life, but when it comes to hockey, the athlete must adhere to traditional actions.  He does not shave or cut his hair before the games.  Vitaly Atyushov is a hockey player who is known to everyone for his beard.  During the participation of the Russian hockey team in the 2011 World Cup in Slovakia, he did not take a razor with him, hoping that his thick long beard would help his team take the lead. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Atyushov Vitaliy Georgievich" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46415/1699786.jpg" width="352"></div>
