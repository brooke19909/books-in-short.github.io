They are three small cascades located on the same river, and are called Baho.  In front of each waterfall, a beautiful lake is formed, which is suitable for swimming.  This place is a favorite vacation spot for both visiting tourists and local residents. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  The name is translated from Vietnamese as "a stream of three lakes", since before each waterfall a natural lake is formed, in which you can swim. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ttnotes.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://ttnotes.com/ba-ho-waterfall.html#gal_post_19967_ba-ho-waterfall-the-southcentral-coasts-and-highlands-3.jpg"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterfall road" class="if uuid-2718644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2718644.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there and what to see along the way </h2><p>  Baho Falls are located 25 km from Nha Trang.  You can get to this place on your own by renting a scooter.  In addition, daily guided tours from Nha Trang are organized on a comfortable bus.  You can also get to your destination by regular bus. </p><p>  The road leads along a serpentine, from where amazing views of the sea and the island.  Next, you need to continue the path along the sea line past a small fishing village.  There are floating shellfish and shellfish farms.  For a small fee, you can enjoy the freshest seafood prepared in one of the local cafes.  There are also plantations for growing pearls, which can be visited as part of a small excursion group. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After driving through the village, continue along the busy highway.  Along the road there are several interesting tourist places that are included in the list of locations mentioned when answering the question of what to see in Nha Trang.  For example, a pagoda located on the coast.  Calling here is a must, the beauty of the temple complex is amazing.  And the view that opens onto the sea surface from the observation deck is simply mesmerizing. </p><p>  Continuing the path to the waterfalls, you should turn onto a quiet village road.  After a few kilometers, you will be at the destination - at the Baho waterfalls.  Travel time without stops is approximately 40-60 minutes on a scooter. </p><p>  If you suddenly get lost, then you can ask any local resident how to get to Baho Falls. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.2387911" data-lng="109.19674880000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/4/3/7/7437.png"></div><h2>  Description of the waterfalls </h2><p>  The tourist route starts at the foot of the hill and leads up along the river bed.  The river, where the Baho Falls in Nha Trang is located, flows from Hoshon Hill 660 meters high. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that each of the three waterfalls does not have its own name.  This is explained by the fact that they flow from each other and are one system.  Most often, tourists end up on the first waterfall, as the road to the other two is more difficult and dangerous. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.citypassguide.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.citypassguide.com/en/travel/nha-trang/attractions/nature/ba-ho-waterfalls"><img itemprop="image" alt="Road to the waterfall" class="if uuid-2718655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2718655.jpg"></div><p>  To reach each of the three waterfalls, you need to make a path through the jungle, walking along a small river.  The road is quite heavy, you will have to climb boulders along the way, so it is recommended to bring comfortable shoes with you. </p><p>  All the complexity of the path is forgotten at the moment when a view of the first Baho waterfall opens before your eyes.  Here you can have a great time after the road, taking a dip in the refreshing clear water. </p><p>  The first waterfall is the largest, there is a cliff from which you can jump into the water, there are always a lot of tourists near it and quite noisy. </p><p>  Those who are ready for a real adventure are advised to go to the second and third cascades.  The distance to the second waterfall with a lake is about a kilometer. </p><p>  At the second waterfall there is a small backwater where you can perfectly swim, there are practically no tourists here, so a relaxing holiday and unity with nature are provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reddit.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3g178x/cliff_jumping_at_ba_ho_falls_nha_trang_vietnam/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bajo Falls" class="if uuid-2718632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2718632.jpg"></div><p>  The path to the third Baho Falls is approximately 300-400 meters and is very difficult.  Only a few decide on it - it is necessary to climb steep boulders, clinging to the brackets driven directly into the stone.  The third waterfall is the smallest.  Here you can also have a great time relaxing in a deserted place. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  Those who decide to visit the Baho Falls in Nha Trang are recommended to go on an excursion early in the morning in sunny weather.  Visiting this place is better to postpone after the tropical rain season, as the road is washed out and becomes unsuitable for walking, the river is crowded, and the debris brought from the hill by the strong current completely spoils the impression of a beautiful place. </p><p>  There are no food outlets in the park, so it is better to take food for a snack with you. </p><p>  It is recommended to carry all things in backpacks, as free hands while traveling are necessary so as not to fall. </p><p>  When planning a trip to the Baho waterfalls, it is necessary to allocate at least 4 hours of free time to enjoy the beauty of nature and swim in the refreshing water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chodalat.vn" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.chodalat.vn/gioi-thieu-web-hay/tham-quan-suoi-ba-ho-o-xu-bien-nha-trang.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baho Waterfall" class="if uuid-2718634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2718634.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost of visiting </h2><p>  Entrance to the park is paid.  The cost of visiting is 25 thousand dong - a little more than a dollar (63 rubles) per person.  The cost of one parking space for a scooter is 4 thousand dongs (10 rubles). </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  After reviewing the reviews of Baho Falls, we can say with confidence that you should definitely visit them.  Many say that the trip was the most memorable of the entire trip in Nha Trang.  This place is ideal for enjoying the nature of the jungle, seeing many exotic animals and relaxing away from the noisy coast with a lot of tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ttnotes.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://ttnotes.com/ba-ho-waterfall.html#gal_post_19967_ba-ho-waterfall-the-southcentral-coasts-and-highlands.jpg"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riverbed" class="if uuid-2718648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2718648.jpg"></div><p>  Baho Falls in Nha Trang is a very accessible vacation for tourists, beckoning with pristine nature, wild jungle, and beautiful ponds.
