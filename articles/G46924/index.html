    <p>  So, the sanatorium ‚ÄúSmall Salt‚Äù was comfortably located just 45 kilometers from the city of Yaroslavl, in the Nekrasovsky district.  There are no major roads and industrial enterprises, it is an ecologically clean area.  The resort is surrounded by <span>pine forest,</span> so vacationers can enjoy the unique natural aromas.  The air smells of pine and juniper, you can hear woodpeckers knocking on trees, birds are singing, and very close to the waves of the Solonitsa River.  The reviews of people who rested here say that all this creates a special atmosphere of comfort, peace and harmony with nature. </p><p>  Since 1965, the sanatorium "Small Salt" of the Yaroslavl region takes vacationers.
