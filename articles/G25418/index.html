Therefore, many are trying to choose a hotel located as close to the beach as possible, and ideally also close to the airport so that the road is not too long.  In Sharm el-Sheikh, this is definitely Sharks Bay.  The area is located only 5 km from the place of arrival, however, this is not the main advantage of the shark bay.  Here, vacationers will find a real coral paradise with a very rich underwater world, which fully allows you to enjoy diving and plenty of snorkeling. </p>
