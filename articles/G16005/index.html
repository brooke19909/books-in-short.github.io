A common reason for this is the inclusion of entertainment subscriptions without the owner‚Äôs knowledge.  In order for people not to fall into such situations and not to lose money, Beeline mobile operator created a service.  With it, you can create an additional balance on your number.  Let's see how this service protects against unwanted subscriptions and how it connects. </p><h2>  The name and essence of the service </h2><p>  The service is called "Cost Control".  When it is connected, an additional balance is created on the phone number.  In Beeline, from the standard balance, ordinary communication services are paid - calls and messages to familiar numbers, Internet traffic.  Only the fee for using the services of infotainment services is debited from the additional. </p><p>  When connecting the service, an additional balance is provided zero.  Do not be afraid that debt will arise on it.  Infotainment services will not write off money in the negative, and they will not be able to get to the standard balance after the appearance of ‚ÄúCost Control‚Äù on the issue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nulled-warez.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Cost Control&quot;" class="if uuid-3185336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3185336.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional balance number </h2><p>  For an extra balance, Beeline has a separate number.  To understand this nuance, we give an example.  Imagine that the number 8 (962) xxx-xx-xx is served by the Beeline mobile operator.  The subscriber used this number to replenish the account.  In other words, for any method of payment for communication services, he indicates all these numbers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The subscriber has activated the "Cost Control" service.  There are 2 balances.  The standard subscriber should recharge by the usual number.  Additional balance is replenished differently.  His number is like a regular number.  The difference is only one digit.  So, the number of the additional balance is 8 (662) xxx-xx-xx. </p><div class="photo" data-original="villagebriefing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Activation of the &quot;Cost Control&quot; service" class="if uuid-3185345" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3185345.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost of service and a team to connect </h2><p>  The service is absolutely free.  You do not need to pay money for its connection.  Also, there is no monthly fee for using the service. </p><p>  How to connect an additional balance on Beeline?  If you are interested in this question, dial * 110 * 5062 # on the phone.  After the pound sign, press the call key.  After sending the command, you will receive a notification on the phone that the application has been accepted and you should wait for the SMS notification.  Literally immediately after that, you will receive a message about the successful activation of an additional balance to pay for the services of content providers. </p><p>  Immediately after connecting the service, you can make sure that an additional balance appears.  Dial * 622 # and press the call key.  After a few seconds, an additional balance will appear on the screen, which is initially zero. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.zillow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Commands for connecting the service" class="if uuid-3185374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3185374.jpg"></div><h2>  Search for a service in your account </h2><p>  You can activate "Cost Control" in your account.  To activate the service on Beeline with an additional balance, go to the official website of the mobile operator.  Log in to your account using your phone number and password.  Go to the section "Connected Services" and click on the link "Go to the directory of mobile services."  In the search bar, enter ‚ÄúContent Provider Services‚Äù.  It is this second name that the service has, which provides an additional balance to the number.  In the search results you will see several services with this name. </p><p>  Before connecting, read the description of each service.  One of them allows you to simply check the cost of content until the moment of subscription.  If you are looking for a way to get rid of the subscriptions imposed on you and keep money on balance, then this service is not for you.  Read the descriptions carefully.  The service that simply provides an additional balance on Beeline to pay for services and does not have any other options is suitable for you.  If you find a service with this description, then feel free to click the connect button. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bolshoyvopros.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Personal account of Beeline subscriber" class="if uuid-3185354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3185354.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional balance service with auto-completion </h2><p>  In your account you will still see the service ‚ÄúContent Provider Services‚Äù with automatic replenishment of the additional balance.  She deserves special attention.  When you connect this service, an additional account is created, and it is automatically replenished from the standard (main) balance. </p><p>  The essence of such a service is not clear.  Many people have a question, why create an additional balance on Beeline, if the money will still be debited from the main account.  This service does not protect against paid content, so it is not recommended to connect it.  You should choose exactly the service on which automatic replenishment of an additional account is not provided. </p><h2>  Transfers between balances </h2><p>  If you plan to sometimes use the services of infotainment services, then you will find useful teams for transferring funds between balances.  To transfer funds from primary to secondary, dial * 220 * (desired amount) # on the phone and press the call key. </p><p>  There is also a team to transfer funds from the Beeline additional balance to the standard one.  To perform such an operation, dial * 222 (desired amount) # on the telephone and complete the introduction by pressing the call key.  Transfers between balances are carried out instantly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sovety.guru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Extra balance for content providers" class="if uuid-3185364" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3185364.jpg"></div><p>  No one is immune from connecting unwanted subscriptions, receipt of paid content on the number.  For this reason, each subscriber should activate the Beeline service with an additional balance for content providers.  It is free and useful.  If it is available, you can not worry that money will suddenly disappear from the phone. </p>
