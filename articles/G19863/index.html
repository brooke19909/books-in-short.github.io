It was a resting place for aristocrats.  At first, the resort was famous for the healing property of thermal springs, and then - for the ski slopes, which stretched more than a hundred kilometers.  Most of them are designed for experienced skiers and professionals.  In the article we find out where the fashionable resort is located, how to get there and how it is interesting for tourists. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The sources of thermal waters of Courmayeur are known from the era of Ancient Rome.  In 1834, baths were erected on this site for the rest of the monarchs, their family members and the aristocracy.  Today, warm pools with healing water in the open air against the backdrop of snow-capped peaks are a true exotic of these places. </p><p>  Due to the location of the Mont Blanc mountains in this place, skiers gathered in Courmayeur.  This gave impetus to the creation of the first school of guides.  Today there are two of them.  In the forties of the last century, the first cableway was built.  This was the beginning of one of the most prestigious ski resorts. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The resort of Courmayeur is located in Italy in the Val da Ost region, which is called the "Celestial Empire", on the border with France.  At this point, the Mont Blanc Mountains rise 4807 metersÔºâ and Monte Rosa 4634 meters.  At their foot is the Courmayeur ski resort. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.79692039999999" data-lng="6.968952400000035" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/6/2/8/10628.png"></div><p>  One of the most fashionable places of active recreation in Italy looks like a traditional alpine town.
