It is already quite strong, but every month there is only an increase.  Almost every six months, the companies are relegated to the flagship in mass production, but such events are not something good due to the rush of manufacturers. </p><p>  Previously, the devices of the top segment could serve their users for years and at the same time not be bored.  At present, the generation is changing every quarter, which is not very correct.  However, our business is not to judge what is true and what is wrong.  With this headache, let the manufacturers deal with it, who have driven themselves into such a hole.  In the meantime, we will review the HTC Sensation XE.  A description of its main parameters will be given below in the form of separate paragraphs. </p><p>  Firms decided to expand the line.  And if Samsung made a choice in favor of creating a new format (and this is nothing more than a hybrid tablet and smartphone Note), then HTC decided to divide one model into several segments.  Actually, this is what we observe in the case of HTC Sensation XE.  The feature shows that this is the flagship musical model.  The parameters were slightly improved, and the headset, which is part of the configuration, is replaced by a better one. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  In the box you can find a phone, a charger for it, as well as a cable like MicroUSB for the charging unit.  There is also various documentation.  This type of delivery is quite typical for most HTC models.  But due to what the phone fell into the category of music, it was due to the replacement of a standard headset with Beats headphones.  Well, a very thoughtful marketing and not just a move. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, at the output we get a slightly modified model called ‚ÄúHTC Sensation XE with Beats audio z715e‚Äù.  The sound characteristics in the smartphone have been improved, but this is understandable.  A headphone case is also included. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  We can‚Äôt talk about any significant differences between Sensation and HTC Sensation XE.  The characteristic makes it clear that the latest model is a real copy of the original.  The difference between them can be seen exclusively in the design of some elements, as well as in colors. </p><p>  So, the XE case is made in black color.  Its back cover has a single color, it is made of both plastic and metal.  This move is probably not accidental, because, according to many users, the original cover (and it was painted immediately in 3 colors) looked ridiculous. </p><p>  XE also has in its design details painted in red.  This is the speaker grid, which is located at the top of the screen, the stroke around the camera, the Beats logo, which is applied to the battery cover, as well as the backlight of the keys.  Due to this color scheme, the smartphone looks quite interesting.  In fact, this distinguishes it from the original, and in a positive way.  It is worth noting that the main style of the company was nevertheless sustained, and the absence of radical changes that are unacceptable on the part of HTC users cannot but please. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Strength </h2><p>  Through the use of a combination of plastic and metal in the HTC Sensation XE Z715E, its strength characteristics have been enhanced.  Fans of wearing smartphones along with extraneous things will be happy about this, because even with this approach, the device will not quickly lose its appearance. </p><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  If in the case of the original, many users complained about the assembly, then problems should not arise in the case of using HTC Sensation XE.  The characteristics of the materials from which the elements of the smartphone are made and assembled indicate that the assembly is at a high level.  Indeed, the volume button, as it was with the original, does not fall off in this model, the case does not creak after a couple of months of operation.  And just the controls are not shaky.  In general, there should not be any modification issues here. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  In all three planes, the smartphone has the following dimensions: height is 126 mm, width - 65.4 mm, and thickness - 11.3 mm.  At the same time, the weight of the smartphone is estimated at almost 150 grams, or rather, at 148. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  The controls are located in the same place as in the original HTC Sensation XE.  The characteristics of these elements show a slight difference in backlight control.  If the original backlight is white, then here it is red.  It is made so that at the same time it is not faded, but it does not hurt the eyes. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  No significant breakthrough in technology was made between the original and XE.  As before, the screen has a resolution of 960 by 540 pixels, S-LCD manufacturing technology.  The screen size is 4.3 inches.  You can‚Äôt say anything bad about brightness, the color rendition does not have significant drawbacks, but there are problems with the corners of the model.  The larger the deviation angle, the more the picture fades on the screen of HTC Sensation XE.  Characteristics say that for the average user the screen is suitable, but obviously not for the fan of watching videos and movies. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Although the Sensation generation camera is better than other manufacturers' models, you still can‚Äôt attribute quality like Sony and Samsung to it.  The camera module in our modification is the same as that installed in the original.  In general, HTC Sensation XE Z715E will not be able to boast of a camera.  Characteristics once again confirm this. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  The 1520 mAh battery has a lithium-ion type, but this is ‚ÄúSensation.‚Äù  In a modified version, the same battery has an increased capacity of 1730 mAh.  It seems that this is a significant difference, but in practice, the autonomous operation of the two devices is not much different. </p><h2>  HTC Sensation XE: specs, photos, performance </h2>

    <p>  Qualcomm chipset is integrated into the smartphone device.  Two cores operate at a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  The size of RAM is 768 MB, and the internal memory reaches 1 GB.  Normal Sensation is equipped with 8 gigabytes (flash drive), and the music modification - 16 GB, which again sets it apart favorably. </p><p>  The speed of the system remained the same.  High quality videos are played in different ways, and this option depends more on the video itself. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  As stated earlier, XE is a musical model.  Accordingly, during its development, such a parameter as the sound of files, music, sound tracks of videos was improved.  The first means by which this became possible is software.  Audio player settings have become more flexible.  This software is related to Beats.  It will always start when the appropriate headphones are connected to the phone. </p><p>  The second remedy is the headphones themselves.  They are original, so you should not worry about the sound quality.  Includes 5 different nozzles.  Thin cable is what confuses users.  However, if you use the headset carefully, it will last a long time. </p><p>  A few words about the <span>headset: the headphones</span> are pretty enough, they are distinguished by a special style.  But users note that Beats reproduce more low frequencies than high ones.  Accordingly, this may not be convenient for everyone. </p><h2>  HTC Sensation XE: specifications, reviews, conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Generally speaking, it can be noted that the modification is suitable for ordinary users who just like to listen to music on a smartphone.  The ‚Äúdialer‚Äù from the phone is good, but it‚Äôs unlikely to please game lovers with its performance.  In addition, active users can safely pass by the model, because for a long time it will not be enough without recharging with active use. </p><p>  There are no significant differences between the original and the modification, except that the delivery kit has changed due to the Beats headset.  And the sound has become better.  The rest is the same good old HTC Sensation. </p>
