  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure and function of the skin</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The human skin is one of the largest organs of the body, which has its own anatomy and physiology and occupies 5% of a person‚Äôs weight.  The structure and functions of the skin are quite complex.  It consists of several layers: the epidermis, dermis (skin) and fatty tissue, and each of them also has several layers in its structure. </p><p>  So, the epidermis has five of them: </p><ol><li>  The main (germ) - produces melanin, thanks to which the skin can acquire various shades.  In this case, the more it is, the darker the skin of a person.  In addition, there is a multiplication of cells. </li><li>  Subulate.  Through the processes of the cells that make up this layer, lymph flows, nourishing the cells and excreting decay products. </li><li>  Granular - contains keratogialin.  On the soles and palms, it has five rows of cells. </li><li>  Transparent - contains eleidine and consists of three rows of cells.  It is developed on the soles and palms, but it is not on the lips. </li><li>  External (horny) - contains keratin, which helps maintain skin moisture levels, here the cells can easily exfoliate.  Moreover, this layer is quite dense and elastic, it protects the skin from mechanical and chemical effects, for example, injuries, cold, burns and other things. </li></ol><p>  Considering the structure and functions of the skin, it is impossible not to note the dermis itself.  It has two layers: </p><ol><li>  The papillary layer - contains thin and delicate fibers. </li><li>  Mesh - contains sebaceous and <span>sweat glands,</span> here the fibers are collected in bundles, such a property of the skin as elasticity depends on their elasticity. </li></ol><p>  Next, we consider the structure and functions of the skin, in particular subcutaneous fat. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fatty tissue is the deepest layer.  It is a grid with segments of <span>adipose tissue,</span> which provides thermoregulation of the whole organism and serves as protection against bruises.  There are large vessels and nerves, as well as muscles and <span>sebaceous glands.</span>  Interestingly, the female layer is slightly thicker than that of men.  It is very weakly expressed on the lips and <span>auricles.</span> </p><p>  The skin, the structure and functions of which are quite complex, has two networks of vessels: </p><ol><li>  A network located at the border of the dermis and adipose tissue. </li><li>  A network located between the reticular and papillary layers. </li></ol><p>  The <span>color of the skin</span> depends on the location of these vessels <span>.</span>  The closer they are to the surface, the more pronounced the blush. </p><p>  It should be said that the structure of the skin in different parts of the body is different.  Dense and rough is located on the soles and palms, on the body it is elastic and elastic.  The most delicate skin is on the <span>face of a person.</span>  <span>The structure of the skin of the face is</span> caused by the weaving of striated muscles into it, so it is mobile. </p><p>  The functions of the skin are quite diverse: </p><ol><li>  The protective function is to protect the body from external factors, including mechanical and radioactive ones.  Also one of the properties of the skin is protection against microorganisms.  The epidermis (stratum corneum) and fatty tissue provide these functions. </li><li>  The absorption function of the skin is the ability to absorb some gaseous, water- and fat-soluble substances.  This function is provided by the stratum corneum of the epidermis. </li><li>  Excretory function - is carried out using the sebaceous and sweat glands under the control of the nervous system.  How well substances are released through the skin depends on the person‚Äôs age and nutrition, as well as environmental influences. </li><li>  Thermoregulation - the body's ability to maintain a certain constant body temperature.  This process is 80% carried out through the skin. </li><li>  Participation in metabolic processes - water exchange occurs in the skin, as well as the exchange of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins and salts. </li></ol><p>  Having examined the structure and functions of the skin, we can conclude that it is an indispensable organ of the human body, participating in its development and life. </p>
