They decorate not only sofas and beds, they are placed on chairs, shelves, on the floor, etc. It is clear that with frequent use they also need proper care - washing, ironing.  And for this, the option of pillowcases with zippers is best suited. </p><p>  But how to sew it in so that it is beautiful and neat?  This question is asked by many beginner needlewomen.  There are lots of instructions on how to embed a hidden zipper in a pillowcase, videos, descriptions, etc., and we offer you our own. </p><h2>  Varieties of Zippers </h2><p>  There are many different types of fasteners - spiral, tractor, secret, with metal and plastic teeth, with split halves and fixed.  For different types of products use their suitable zipper.  When sewing pillowcases on pillows, as a rule, they take inseparable ordinary and hidden. </p><div class="photo" data-original="interiordesainrumah.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the appearance of pillowcases with hidden zippers" class="if uuid-2699271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2699271.jpg"></div><p>  They are practically invisible to things, although they are somewhat more expensive than ordinary ones.  Sewing such a zipper is not much more difficult than simple. </p><h2>  Tools and materials </h2><p>  To work, you need the following: </p><ul><li>  Sewing machine. </li><li>  The selection of fabric is very important - it should not fade during washing, do not shrink.  For decorative <span>interior pillows,</span> choose the appropriate color for the room, and for the children's room - some light, cartoony. </li><li>  Well, forget the threads for sewing, matching the color of the fabric, a few pins. </li><li>  Take the zipper a little shorter than the length of the edge of the pillow to which you will sew it. </li></ul><p>  Before you <span>sew a zipper into the pillowcase,</span> make sure that you have special paws for this work.  For hidden fasteners, paws are needed that allow you to lay a seam next to the cloves.  These tools are available at the store. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.capitalcitysewing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew regular zipper" class="if uuid-2699249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2699249.jpg"></div><h2>  We sew a pillowcase, immediately sewing a regular zipper </h2><p>  Getting started: </p><ol><li>  Cut the fabric - front and back side.  Do not forget to leave allowances for the seams - 1.5-2 cm on each side. </li><li>  Now you need to attach the zipper to the edge of the fabric in the middle of one of the sides and mark the ends of the fastener with pins. </li><li>  Suture the bottom edge.  To do this, step back from the edge of 1.5 cm and draw stitches from both edges of the pattern. </li><li>  Sew from one pin to another by setting the stitch to the widest - you can zigzag.  It does not need to be tightened, since it will subsequently be removed. </li><li>  Place the clasp from the inside with the teeth down in the right place and fix it with pins. </li><li>  Lead the line to the maximum close to the teeth - this is necessary for easy insertion of any pillow with any filler. </li><li>  Having sewn a zipper on one side, do the same manipulations on the other. </li></ol><p>  Remove the previously laid line, and you're done - the zipper is sewn! </p><h2>  How to sew a hidden zipper in a pillowcase </h2><p>  In order to sew a pillowcase or cover onto a pillow, you need 2 rectangles with 23 x 41 sides for the front and 31 x 41 for the back side.  Lightning needs to be taken about 41 cm or more authentic - excess can be cut off. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.momtastic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zipper stitching process" class="if uuid-2699279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2699279.jpg"></div><p>  So, how to sew a zipper into a pillowcase so that it is not visible: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  On a smaller rectangle on each short side, set aside 3 cm and bend it to the wrong side.  Iron.  Do the same thing again. </li><li>  Take another rectangle and set aside 2 cm on it, fold it and do it again.  A piece with a large bend is located at the top and hides the clasp, and a zipper is attached to the smaller edge. </li><li>  Attach the lock to the small rectangle, the edge of the fabric should pass along the cloves.  And with a long zipper length, the material should lie in the center (fix it with pins). </li><li>  Now sew a seam along the very edge, next to the cloves.  The edge of the foot can be used as a ruler for smooth running. </li><li>  In the second piece of material, straighten 1 bend and attach it to the free side of the zipper "face to face" - the fold of the fabric should coincide with the edge of the fastener. </li><li>  From above the edge, you need to lay a seam, letting down 2.5-3 mm - you get a crease that will cover the lock. </li><li>  Now, measuring 3 cm from the hem, you need to draw a strip of chalk, secure with pins and lay a seam. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="sotakhandmade.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="secret zipper with flap" class="if uuid-2699281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2699281.jpg"></div><p>  Having opened the zipper to half, sew the sides of the material near the edges of the zipper and cut off the excess. </p><p>  That's all, how to sew a zipper into a pillowcase we figured out.  Next, you can continue to sew the pillow cover, as usual. </p>
