  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best hotels of Munich: list, photos and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most beautiful cities in Germany provides many options for any type of vacation.  Admire museums, stroll through fairs, attend a good football match - all this is possible in such a big city.  Based on these criteria, you need to choose the most suitable hotel in Munich. </p><h2>  The very center of the city </h2><p>  Munich begins its history from the VIII century, with the old town (Altstadt) and the central square - Marienplatz (directly on the square is the Munich hotel - Marienplatz. This is one of the main attractions of the city. Old and New Town Halls, the Viktualienmarkt market, the largest Frauenkirche cathedral (Church of the Theotokos ") - all tourist routes start from here. It is worth paying special attention to the Church of the Virgin. The Cathedral is 99 meters high is a symbol of the city, so if you are interested, then you need to settle in walking distance from this place.  a. </p><h2>  Louis hotel </h2><p>  One of the best 5-star hotels in the Marienplatz area is the Louis Hotel.  Located on the square itself, the hotel provides an opportunity to watch the life of the center of this ancient city right from the window with a cup of coffee. </p><p>  Judging by the numerous reviews of tourists who visited this hotel, it is very cozy and quiet (despite the central location).  Many of the rooms in this beautiful hotel in central Munich have double doors, so the noise from the corridor is also not audible.  The guests were pleasantly impressed by the sociable and always willing to help the hotel staff, especially those working at the reception.  Many note problems with parking, but this is an old center - in most European cities there is the same problem. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="centurion-magazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Munich hotels" class="if uuid-2381602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2381602.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel bayerischer hof </h2><p>  Another great 5-star hotel, located in the northern part of Marienplatz, next to the famous Kunsthalle Museum of Art.  Located in a seemingly ordinary building, the Hotel Bayerischer Hof impresses with its fantastic interior decoration and stunning interiors. </p><p>  Guests of one of the best hotels in Munich enthusiastically talk about breakfast: in addition to a variety of dishes, quick service and an aesthetic type of food, they are delighted with a place on the terrace overlooking the city!  According to the stories of tourists who visited there, on a sunny day, the experience is simply unforgettable. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the presented Munich hotels are located in the city center, the cost of the apartments is quite high. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Munich hotels Marienplatz" class="if uuid-2381615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2381615.jpg"></div><h2>  4 star hotels </h2><p>  Having departed only 20 minutes from the Hotel Bayerischer Hof, we find ourselves in the area of ‚Äã‚Äã4-star hotels that can impress their guests with a good price and level of service not lower than in the hotels we mentioned above. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Leonardo </h2><p>  Let's start with the hotel, belonging to the worldwide network of Leonardo, - Leonardo City Center.  Spacious comfortable rooms, cleanliness, friendly staff and excellent breakfasts - this is just a small list of good impressions that tourists who visited this hotel received. </p><p>  The hotel is a worthy representative of the Leonardo hotel chain in Munich.  Of the advantages, many tourists note the walking distance to shopping centers (for those who like shopping), to many bars and restaurants (for beer lovers) and to Munich Central Station, from which you can get to almost any corner of Germany. </p><p>  Most city guests give preference to the Leonardo City Center hotel, since it provides high-level service, the apartments are clean and comfortable, the interior is relaxing, and all hotel staff take care of each guest‚Äôs comfortable pastime. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of Munich" class="if uuid-2381625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2381625.jpg"></div><h2>  Mercury </h2><p>  Just two hundred meters from the Leonardo Hotel is a representative of another huge chain - the Mercury City Center Hotel.  One can say about him that in terms of quality of service he is practically not inferior to his neighbor, and even in terms of the quality of the buffet for breakfast. </p><p>  The cleanliness of the rooms and the silence (despite the close proximity of the station) make the stay in this place special and very pleasant.  All hotel staff at any time is ready to help and resolve all issues arising as soon as possible.  As guests note, staying here gives only positive emotions.  Many claim that on their next visit to the city they will again stay at the Mercury Hotel </p><p>  Theresienwiese Square, which hosts the world famous Oktoberfest beer festival, is within walking distance.  Guests who visited the Hotel Mercury (Munich) could not help but note the amazing proximity of the hotel to the central square of Marienplatz and to the Old Town. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.accorhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel mercury munich" class="if uuid-2381628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2381628.jpg"></div><h2>  Budget options </h2><p>  Now we look at Munich hotels in 3 stars and 4 stars, located near the historic center. </p><h2>  Hotel germia </h2><p>  The first to get the attention of Hotel Germania is practically the neighbor of Leonardo and Mercury.  3-star hotel "Germany" in Munich) is a great option for lovers of walking and returning home tired and satisfied, spending 15-20 minutes on the way home.  Especially noted in this hotel (except for cleanliness and comfort) are very friendly staff, always ready to help, suggest, advise. </p><p>  Many recommend this hotel as a transit point where you can stay for one night and continue the trip the next day.  This is because the Hotel Germany is located just a 5-minute walk from the central station.  And if you decide to stay a couple of nights, then after an easy 20-minute walk you will find yourself in the very heart of the country - on the central square of Munich Marienplatz, from where all the tourist routes are just beginning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel germany munich" class="if uuid-2381631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2381631.jpg"></div><h2>  Ibis hotel </h2><p>  In addition to the hotel "Germany", you can recommend two more good places for an overnight stay.  Slightly moving northwest from the center (10 minutes from Leonardo) you can find yourself in the Ibis Hotel, which is a classic hotel of the same chain.  Everything is modest, but clean and comfortable.  Sufficiently convenient location from the station, a little further - the city center, but the prices for this hotel are much lower than prices in hotels of the same level located closer to the city center. </p><p>  Guests who visited the Ibis Hotel (Munich) noted a good, tasty and varied breakfast, after which you do not feel hunger for a very long time.  The small distance from the center helps guests relax in silence after walking through the bustling city and really enjoy your vacation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ibis munich hotel" class="if uuid-2381635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2381635.jpg"></div><h2>  Europa hotel </h2><p>  We continue to move away from the center, on our way there is another representative of Munich hotels in the 4-star category - Europa Hotel.  Decorated in casual style, the hotel impresses with its interior. </p><p>  In the courtyard there is a terrace with tables and umbrellas - here you can relax after a hard day.  A few meters away is a magnificent park - a vast kingdom of greenery and clean air! </p><p>  Based on the reviews of tourists, you can highlight the main features of this place - soundproofing rooms and excellent breakfasts.  Hotel "Europe" (Munich), despite the four stars, can be considered a budget option in comparison with similar hotels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel europe munich" class="if uuid-2381638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2381638.jpg"></div><h2>  Arena Stadt Hotel </h2><p>  As it was said at the beginning of the article, Munich is a city of football, more precisely, the world famous legendary club Bavaria.  If you are a football fan, then you need to settle as close as possible to the <span>Allianz Arena,</span> where Bayern is training.  The best option is Arena Stadt Hotel: 20 minutes and you're in the stadium! </p><p>  In addition, from this hotel in 15 minutes by public transport, you can reach the city center, the Marienplatz square or the world famous Hofbr√§uhaus brewery.  If you are a fan of all kinds of exhibitions (technological, culinary), then the MOC exhibition center is located at an 8-minute walk distance </p><p>  As for the Arena Hotel itself, one cannot but note the cleanliness of the rooms, the friendly staff and the silence outside the window.  As you move farther from the city center, the streets become much quieter.  I would like to note the underground free parking, which is very convenient in the presence of a rented car.  Another feature of this hotel is the Russian-speaking staff, helping people who do not speak a foreign language to feel comfortable and easy. </p><h2>  Moving from the center to the west </h2><p>  Continuing to move away from the city center, we find ourselves in the beautiful Neuhausen-Nymphenburg district.  Most of the hotels located here are designed for large families and people looking for cheaper accommodation.  But it is worth noting that with all the remoteness, the road by public transport to the center takes only 20 minutes or 4 stops. </p><h2>  Novotel </h2><p>  Among the hotels in Munich there is another representative of the world famous chain - Novotel Muenchen City Arnulfpark.  This hotel is able to impress the most sophisticated guest.  Ultra-modern architecture, fantastic breakfasts, great location, cleanliness and comfort - this is exactly why many people come to this luxury hotel. </p><p>  In addition, there are many interesting places near the hotel that can be reached very easily.  The Krone Circus, the BMW Museum are just a few of the attractions.  And if you move west (moving away from the city center), you can stumble upon the huge and most beautiful park Nymphenburg, in whose territory the castle of the same name and several museums are located. </p><p>  Most likely, after visiting all these attractions, you will be tired and happy.  And here this wonderful hotel will come to your aid - the sauna located on its territory will complete the day with complete relaxation after a walk. </p><h2>  Holiday inn express </h2><p>  Walking around this area, pay attention to the next 3-star Munich hotel.  The Holiday Inn chain is traditionally considered one of the cheapest, but adhering to a certain quality standard.  This hotel is no exception.  It is worth highlighting its location - several stops by public transport - and you are either in the city center or at the central station. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the guests, the hotel is simply magnificent, despite the 3 stars.  Comfortable beds, snow-white linen, perfect cleanliness in the corridors and lobby - all this attracts many middle-income clients.  Friendly staff is always ready to help.  There are many grocery stores in the area near the hotel, so there is no problem with food. </p><h2>  South direction </h2><p>  The southern areas of Munich are not so full of sights, but still deserve attention.  For example, a park located on the Isar River with the beautiful Hellabrunn Zoo is a great entertainment for children and adults. </p><p>  Let's look at several Munich hotels located near the zoo. </p><h2>  Holiday Inn Munchensud </h2><p>  Another budget option for the family.  The hotel in Munich is very clean both in the rooms and in the corridors.  Friendly Russian-speaking staff is always ready to help. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of travelers, the hotel is located not so far from the city center - only 20 minutes by metro.  In few hotels in Munich there is a sauna - it is here, so you can always relax and unwind without leaving the walls of the hotel.  Guests are satisfied with their stay at the hotel.  Many claim that they feel at home within its walls. </p><h2>  GS Hotel </h2><p>  The last in our review is the 3-star Hotel Munich.  It is located in the Obersendling district in the southern part of the city.  Created in a modernist style, the hotel gives its guests positive emotions not only with a stylish interior, but also with its kitchen.  Tourists especially like the wonderful breakfast prepared exclusively with fresh products, free wi-fi and cleanliness of the rooms. </p><p>  Of the pluses, it is possible to note the possibility of late arrival, which is problematic in some hotels.  Around the hotel there are many cafes and shops, a luxurious South Park - sometimes you do not want to leave such a place in the center with crowds of tourists. </p><p>  Munich is a small city with a population of just over one and a half million people.  The city is quite compact, so, as you can see, in Munich it is not at all necessary to settle in the very center.  Do not be afraid to stay in an inexpensive hotel - when you go for a walk, in just 20 minutes you will find yourself in the Old Town area among the monuments of history and art.  Experienced travelers are advised to approach very carefully the choice of accommodation, as sometimes it may turn out that a 3-star hotel will be better than a 4-star hotel. </p><p>  Enjoy Munich, its unique atmosphere and extraordinary Bavarian flavor.  The magic of this city makes all those who have already felt the charm of being in it to come here again and again.  In addition, the city is located almost directly in the very center of Europe - from there it is easy to get to Austria and the Czech Republic, Belgium and Holland.  Yes, and travel to Germany from Munich is very convenient. </p><p>  The capital of Bavaria is a city that everyone should visit, because this is the only way to feel the atmosphere of Germany. </p>
