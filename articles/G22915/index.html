But in this article we will not describe the delights of local relaxation, but rather focus on the very practical question of what opportunities people who are going to leave home have to get from Yeysk to Rostov.  Indeed, among the mass of tourists, trains and planes depart to their homelands precisely from this big city.  It is sometimes said that during the holiday season all roads lead to the sea.  But the time is coming when you should think about how best to go back.  In this article, we have collected the tips of experienced travelers on this topic.  Think about it in advance so as not to run into problems at the last moment.  There are several options for such a return, and when choosing one of them, you should decide what you want on the road - convenience, speed, or both. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yeysk Rostov" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1850677.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Car </h2><p>  Between the cities of Yeisk and Rostov, the distance is 183 kilometers if you are traveling by car.  It will take about three hours to get there.  There are many routes, but vacationers usually prefer two.  The first one is along the federal highway M4 (Don).  But there may be traffic jams in high season.  Road works can also hinder rapid progress.  You can try the second option.  These are secondary roads - 250 and 268.  They lead through the villages of Aleksandrovka and Peshkovo.  But traffic on these roads is one-way, so it will be very difficult to overtake.  And in that, and in another case, you will spend about eight hundred rubles for gasoline.  You can also find a fellow traveler on the Bla-bla-car service.  Then the road will cost you not a very large amount - starting from two hundred rubles per person.  Some experienced drivers recommend a route through the village of Kushchevskaya and the city of Azov.  The roads are not the worst, they can be safely called the domestic standard.  If you suddenly get lost, do not hesitate to ask for directions.  Local drivers will be happy to show you and tell you everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yeisk Rostov train" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1850675.jpg" width="600"></div>

From there, night and other long-distance trains already run.  But if you do not mind a long journey under the sound of wheels on rails and at the same time do not like transfers, there is an option for you.  This is the Yeysk-Moscow train at number 232. In summer, it runs every day, and its final stop is Kursky Station.  But it also passes through Rostov.  A train leaves from Yeysk at about ten in the morning, and it is better to buy a ticket for it in 45 days.  Trailers used to go from St. Petersburg to the resort before.  Now, after a day, train 245 runs.  Therefore, you can still get to Rostov on it.  But this option is not suitable for everyone.  In addition, if you arrived at this resort not from the capital, but from distant regions of Russia - Yekaterinburg, Magadan, Murmansk, then it is better, of course, to get to Rostov Airport by bus.  If you choose the option with an electric train, you will also have to change trains at the railway station. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yeysk Rostov bus" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1850685.jpg" width="600"></div>
