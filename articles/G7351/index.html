    <p>  In 1965, Najibullah joined the Democratic Party and led an illegal democratic student society.  In 1969, he was arrested for calling on the people to prepare an uprising, participating in demonstrations and strikes.  In January 1970, he was again arrested, this time for insulting the United States of America and actions contrary to the country's neutrality.  During the demonstration, he and his students threw eggs at the car of Spiro Agnew, the vice president of the United States. </p><h2>  First exile </h2><p>  In 1975, Mohammad Najibullah graduated from the Medical University in Kabul, after which he further focused on the activities of the party, in 1977 he was appointed a member of the Central Committee of the People‚Äôs Democratic Party of Afghanistan.  After the revolution in Saur, he led the revolutionary council and party committee in Kabul.  But disagreements within the party forced him to leave the capital; Najibullah was sent to Iran as an ambassador.  But in October 1978 he was removed from his post and stripped of his citizenship, as a result of which Mohammad Najibullah was forced to leave for Moscow, where he was hiding until December 1979, until Soviet troops entered Afghanistan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Homecoming </h2><p>  Returning to the country, Najibullah began to lead the security service, increasing its staff to thirty thousand employees, before that only 120 people worked in the security service.  However, even here he was not allowed to work calmly, many organizations, including Amnesty International, accused him of involvement in illegal arrests, torture, and violation of human rights.  But there was no evidence of accusations; during his service in the Khad there was no such mass terror and extermination of his own people as under the rule of Amin. </p>

    <h2>  Afghan: Mohammad Najibullah - President </h2><p>  On November 30, 1986, Najibullah was elected President of Afghanistan.  But with his coming to the leadership of the country, a split began again in the party: some supported Karmal, others supported the incumbent president.  In order to at least somehow reconcile the warring parties, in January 1987 they adopted a declaration on national reconciliation.  The declaration prescribed the end of active hostilities and the settlement of the conflict through peaceful negotiations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In December 1989, a few days after the Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan, the Mujahideen launched an attack on Jalalabad.  Mohammad Najibullah declared a <span>state of emergency</span> in the country.  On March 5, 1990, the trial of the arrested Halkists began.  In response, the country's defense minister Shahnavaz Tanay organized an <span>armed rebellion.</span>  Hiding in one of the bunkers, Mohammad Najibullah ordered the suppression of the rebellion, by early March, resistance was suppressed.  The organizer of the rebellion fled to Pakistan, where he subsequently joined the gang of Hekmatyar. </p>

    <h2>  Betrayal from all sides </h2><p>  In 1990, Shevardnadze proposed the liquidation of the Commission for Work in Afghanistan, his decision was approved, along with this, the supply of weapons was stopped.  Thus, the country was left without the support of the USSR, and with it, President Najibullah Mohammad.  Political science is a changeable and inconsistent science, the next blow was delivered by the USA.  In 1991, James Baker signed a decree stopping the supply of arms and ammunition to the conflicting parties in Afghanistan.  This greatly weakened the influence of Najibullah.  On April 16, 1992, Najibullah handed over his post to Abdur Rahim Hatef, who <span>temporarily served as</span> president.  And in April of the same year, <span>General Dostum</span> organized a coup that brought the Mujahideen to power. </p><p>  In the fall of 1992, generals Hekmatyar and Masood accused each other of betrayal and, leaving military equipment and weapons depots, left Kabul.  Then the USSR liquidated its embassy in Afghanistan.  Najibullah and his supporters were offered political asylum by a number of countries, including Russia and the United States, but he decided to stay in Kabul, not wanting to leave the country in such a difficult time. </p><p>  Before the capture of the city, he managed to transport his wife with children and sister to Delhi.  His brother Shapur Ahmadzai, the security chief Jafsar, the head of the office of Tukha and Najibullah Mohammad remained in Kabul.  <span>His life path</span> forced the former president of the country to take refuge in the Indian embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãand then in the UN mission.  The country's governments, constantly changing in 1995 and 1996, demanded to extradite Najibullah.  The harder the blow dealt from the former allies.  Kozyrev (Foreign Minister) said that Moscow does not want to have any business with the remnants of the past regime in Afghanistan. </p>

    <h2>  Last Hero </h2><p>  September 26, 1996, the Taliban captured the <span>capital of Afghanistan, Kabul,</span> Najibullah and his supporters were removed from the UN mission.  He was asked to sign a document recognizing the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, but he refused.  After brutal torture, former President Mohammad Najibullah was sentenced to death.  The execution took place on September 27, Najibullah and his brother were tied to a car and dragged to the presidential palace, where they then hanged him. </p><p>  The Taliban banned the burial of Najibullah according to Islamic customs, but the people still remembered and honored his memory: people in Peshawar and Quetta secretly read prayers for him.  When his body was nevertheless transferred to the Red Cross, the Ahmadzai tribe, in which his grandfather was the leader, buried him in his hometown of Gardez. </p><p>  On the twelfth anniversary of the death of Najibullah, a rally was held for the first time in order to honor his memory.  The head of the Vatan party in Afghanistan, Jabarhel, suggested that Mohammad Najibullah was killed by enemies and opponents of the people on orders from outside.  A 2008 survey of residents showed that 93.2% of the population were Najibullah's supporters. </p>
