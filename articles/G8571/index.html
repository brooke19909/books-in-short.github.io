    <p>  In the XVI century, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent orders here to build a fortress to protect the city from external enemies and invaders forever.  At that time, the settlement gets its current name, which literally means "brilliant", "shining."  In 1957, a strong earthquake struck the city.  As a result, Marmaris was destroyed almost to the ground.  It had to be restored from scratch.  The city received a powerful impetus for economic development in the 80s, when it became one of the tourist centers of Turkey. </p><p>  Among the attractions that especially attract tourists who have taken tours to Marmaris, it is worth noting the ancient castle of Marmaris Fort, which is located in the old part of the city.

    <p>  The hotel has a main restaurant, which runs an all-inclusive system, and there is also a restaurant where you can order dishes for a fee from the menu, because sometimes you can get bored eating at the buffet every day.  Bars are open from 10am.  After 23 hours, all drinks in them are released only for money. </p><p>  As already mentioned, the public beach <span>at Agean Park Hotel</span> is just 50 meters away.  Directly between the beach and the hotel is a promenade.  On the shore, you can rent a chaise lounge, umbrellas or mattresses for a fee.  Towels are not provided. </p><h2>  Hotel room </h2><p>  Of course, it is best to make your impression of Aegean Park Hotel 3 *, the hotel infrastructure according to the reviews of tourists who have already been there.  Most of the rooms are decent, spacious and with good views.  Mostly tiles lie on the floor, everywhere it is well cleaned and light.  TV, hairdryer, air conditioning and shower are working properly.  If you have any difficulties, helpful staff is ready to help.  True, as a rule, your assistants will count on a generous tip.  Everyone who comes to Aegean Park 3 * (Marmaris), in the reviews, note that the size of the rooms is very small for both two and three guests. </p><p>  Among the minuses, tourists are often called irregular cleaning of rooms.  For example, linens are rarely changed.  Daily room service comes down to taking out the trash, cleaning the bed and replacing soap and toilet paper. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Those who were in Aegean Park 3 * (Marmaris), in the reviews note that lunch and dinner will appeal to fans of vegetarian cuisine.  A large number of guests are offered all kinds of vegetables: cucumbers, tomatoes, herbs, various salads, in which all of the above can be found in various proportions.  At the same time, breakfasts are very monotonous.  Guests can choose only boiled eggs, the same vegetables, breakfast cereals that can be seasoned with milk, as well as collect sandwiches from bread, toast, butter, cheese and sausages, and try savory sausages in tomato.  Occasionally, cooks cook an omelet, but a huge queue immediately follows it. </p>

    <p>  The variety does not increase during lunch and dinner.  Only the assortment of hot dishes is different.  Here they are watching.  But the side dishes and salads are very standard.  At the same time, the chef personally lays portions of hot on the plates.  True, it is not forbidden to go for the supplement.  They cook breaded chicken, meatballs, fish and even grilled mushrooms.  Watermelon is most often found among fruits.  True, and it is often sour, which many tourists complain about in reviews.  As in most Turkish hotels, few people can be surprised by the local desserts.  As a rule, these are several varieties of multi-colored jellies and puddings. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The first impression of the hotel is spoiled immediately by the fact that the lobby does not have air conditioning, so no one spends a lot of time there.  Everyone wants to go to the sea or to their personal room for a refreshing cool.  It is stated that the hotel has Wi-Fi, but in fact it is very weak, so you have to spend a lot of time to find out at least some information.  In one of the pools there is a slide (such a mini-water park).  True, it rarely works.  Among the pros note a large number of sunbeds.  Free places always remain at the pools and at sea. </p><h2>  Animation and alcohol </h2><p>  Immediately it is worth noting that one of the main disadvantages is the almost complete absence of animation in the pool.  Unlike other hotels, there is no entertainment program.  The only thing they do is turn on the music near the pools after 22.00, and that‚Äôs it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aegean park hotel 3 hotel infrastructure" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1994859.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Special mention is also made of alcohol, which is available under the all-inclusive program.  It will be most correct to say that alcohol is not for everyone.  Beer is too diluted, and spirits are often almost for one taste and of dubious quality.  Therefore, many tourists prefer to bring alcohol with them, buying it at the airport, in duty-free areas.  Holidays in Turkey are very diverse excursions. </p>
