This substance is very important for the human body, which plays a significant role in many biosynthesis processes and is found in human tissues and organs.  It is an organic keto acid.  Moreover, it is both a <span>carboxylic acid</span> and a ketone, and its formation depends on the conditions and place of the process.  As an acid, it forms salts (pyruvates) and amides, but is most often used as pyruvates. </p><p>  Pyruvic acid occurs during the synthesis or breakdown of amino acids.  It is the end product of glucose metabolism or, more precisely, the glycolysis process itself.  Pyruvic acid is the basis of many metabolic processes in living cells.  It has a special biochemical role, since it is an important link in the protein metabolism of the cell.  This acid is found everywhere in organs and tissues.  A change in its amount occurs with serious diseases of the kidneys, liver, vitamin deficiencies, but especially with a deficiency of vitamin B1.  It is present in human blood, and its norm is 1 mg; in the urine, up to 2 mg of this substance is found normally. </p><p>  When exposed to oxygen, it can turn into acetyl coenzyme A, which is the basis of the reaction of the Krebs cycle (respiratory cycle).  Conversely, if oxygen is not enough, pyruvic acid breaks down, and as a result <span>lactic acid</span> (in animals) and ethanol (in plants) are formed.  Its peculiarity lies in the fact that acid is an intermediate product of the breakdown of sugars during the process of alcoholic fermentation.  If it is placed in an aqueous solution with the presence of yeast, then the decomposition process will occur, and get acetaldehyde and <span>carbon dioxide.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is pyruvic acid?  Its formula can be expressed as follows: CH3COCHOO.  The method of its production is the heating of grape acid.  Other methods are also known: via nitrile from acetyl chloride, pyrolysis of <span>tartaric acid,</span> or by oxidation of hydroxy acids. </p><p>  What is it if you look at it visually?  First of all, it is a liquid with a characteristic smell of <span>acetic acid.</span>  It boils at a temperature of + 165 ¬∞ C and dissolves in alcohol, water and ether.  Pyruvic acid, the formula of which is CH3COCHOOH, has been intensively studied by scientists. </p><p>  It was found that it is found in large quantities in citrus fruits, as well as in honey.  This substance has one interesting use, which has gained distribution only in recent years.  Beauticians called it ‚Äúpyruvic peeling,‚Äù which is an analogue of milk and an alternative to salicylic.  This type of peeling can be superficial or strong in its effect.  It is used when age-related changes are obvious and more serious procedures are needed.  This applies primarily to deep wrinkles, as well as local thickening of the skin. </p><p>  Pyruvic peeling is a very effective effect of acid on the deep, papillary layer of the skin.  It stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen, elastin and <span>hyaluronic acid,</span> because it is they that provide youth, an attractive look to the skin, make the face more fresh and very well-groomed. </p><p>  A cosmetologist, as a rule, prescribes from 4 to 7 procedures for superficial peels with a short interval (from 7 to 14 days).  For medium intensity peeling, the regimen is somewhat different: from 2 to 4 procedures, the interval between which will already be from 21 to 28 days.  Please note that with medium-intensity procedures, it takes time for the skin to recover.  This happens after about 4 days, and maybe later, depending on the type of skin.  If the procedures are taken in the summer, do not forget to use a cream with a high light filter to go out. </p>
