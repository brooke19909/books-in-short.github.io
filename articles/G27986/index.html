What is the process of becoming an individual?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Socialization is a difficult process to study.  Nevertheless, social psychology is actively developing in this direction.  The issues of socialization and what stages a person goes through in the process of formation are fundamental for this science, along with a number of other phenomena under consideration relating to human social life.  And it is so diverse that it‚Äôs hard to imagine what our life would be like if we could figure it all out.  But is it really possible?  Unlikely.  One thing is certain for sure: if society were simple, how would it be boring for us to live, don't you find? </p><h2>  A little bit about socialization </h2><p>  So, what are the stages of the personality in the process of its formation?  There are several theories that try to give an answer.  Each of them for the most part does not contradict the rest.  At the same time, every psychological school looks at the socialization of a person from its own angle.  Someone considers it from the position of social groups.  This is the name of the association of people who have common goals, values.  Society can also be called a social group.  Only in this case can it be considered a large association.  There is not much difference what stages a person goes through in the process of becoming.  The important thing is that the endpoint is almost always known.  Naturally, the process of socialization may not work.  In this case, a person can be considered a marginal or desocialized person. </p>

    <h2>  The difference between marigands and maladies </h2><p>  What is the difference between marginals and those who have fallen from society?  Marginals are, as it were, between society and isolation from it.  However, they may not live in society.  Most often they are not very joyfully received.  In order to somehow survive, such people create their own groups in which similar personalities unite.  They can behave deviantly (with deviations from the norm) and even delinquently (in violation of legal laws).  In this case, we can say that people were desocialized. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  But not everyone comes to such a life.  Some people quite calmly continue to integrate into society.  Very often, the process of socialization through adaptation is considered.  There are several theories about what stages a person goes through in the process of becoming.  We will consider the so-called <span>socio-psychological socialization.</span> </p><h2>  Stages of personality socialization </h2><p>  There are three <span>stages of</span> personality <span>socialization</span> : pre-labor, labor and post-labor.  The first stage is characterized in most cases by childhood, and it continues until a person begins to provide for himself.  If he succeeds, he does not need parents to survive, then we can talk about ending the pre-labor stage of socialization. </p>

    <h2>  Pre-labor socialization </h2><p>  This stage is characterized by the active assimilation of social norms, as well as the gradual integration into a number of societies that are currently relevant for a person.  In the case of pre-labor socialization, this is a school, various sections, circles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Labor socialization </h2><p>  After a person got a job or graduated from school, the stage of labor socialization begins, which characterizes the total flowering of life.  So, at this time, a person can find and realize his vocation and become successful.  This is ideal if the processes of socialization are combined with self-actualization (according to Maslow and other representatives of <span>humanistic psychology).</span>  But it may be that a person continues to socialize, continues to gain life experience, adheres to the norms accepted in society.  But at the same time it does not develop. </p><p>  This is the path of false socialization, when a person seems to be integrated into society, but his social status and status are so small that there is a big risk of flying out of there.  <span>The process of becoming an individual</span> is complex enough to take into account all factors.  But it is directly related to the socialization of man.  Some people say that the process of becoming an individual is socialization. </p>

    <p>  But it is not so.  We just talk so much about the adaptation of man in society, not because it is synonymous with the development of the individual, but because of the great influence of society on the formation of man.  Therefore, we consider what is happening through the prism of adaptation to different groups.  So it cannot be said that the process of becoming an individual is called socialization.  This is fundamentally wrong. </p><h2>  Post-labor socialization </h2><p>  The last stage of socialization is post-labor, which is usually associated with the onset of retirement age.  But since there is a huge number of working pensioners, it can be said that this stage begins after the person has ceased to work actively.  Retirement age is characterized by a gradual weakening of social skills.  From a socio-psychological point of view, old age is given to people, so that norms and principles are passed on to other people, so that their life base becomes much better even at a young age.  That is why grandmothers love to teach so much.  True, this is not always accepted, but there are reverse cases. </p>

    <h2>  Stages of professional development </h2><p>  It is also worth touching on such a topic as the stages of the formation of the personality as a professional.  There are a lot of them, so we can consider the issue only briefly. </p><ol><li>  Newbie.  This is the stage when a person only gets acquainted with his professional activity. </li><li>  The student.  A person begins to master practical skills and slowly gains experience in this matter and self-confidence. </li><li>  Specialist.  Standard operations have been worked out, but people can‚Äôt come up with anything new. </li><li>  Professional.  A specialist with a creative approach.  It is very flexible and non-standard approaches to the most difficult situations. </li><li>  Master.  The man for whom his work is everything.  That is why his approaches are so original, and the results of activity appear so quickly that it seems that the person did not even work.  The same seems to the master himself. </li></ol><p>  These are the five steps.  They are interesting enough, right?  We figured out what stages a person goes through in the process of becoming.  They are clear enough and easy to understand.  The process of becoming a person‚Äôs personality is still very complicated, but at the same time, this information will help the reader slightly increase his knowledge base and fill it with useful information. </p>
