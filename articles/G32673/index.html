The total surface area is 4791 thousand square kilometers.  According to this indicator, it is included in the list of ten largest seas on our planet.  Such an original name is associated with an abundance of coral formations in it.

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The water area is located next to Australia, south of New Guinea.  The <span>sea</span> is separated from the <span>Pacific Ocean</span> due to islands such as New Britain, Solomon and New Hebrides.  Since a significant part of it is located outside the continental shelf, it is deep-sea.  The greatest depth of the Coral Sea is 9140 meters.  This place is known as the Bougainville Depression and is located near the Solomon Islands.  The bottom surface is characterized by a strongly dissected relief and numerous depressions.  In addition, the reservoir is characterized by strong differences in depths.  In shallow water, the bottom is covered with sand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Coral Sea Depth" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/632382.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is located on the southeastern coast of the <span>island of New Guinea,</span> being one of the most picturesque and popular among tourists.  Its length is about 150 kilometers and a maximum depth of 969 meters. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  If you look at the map, you can see that the sea lies in the tropical zone, south of the equator.  Only a small part of it is located in the subtropics.  In this regard, the coast is characterized by a warm climate.  Water temperature is stable and averages 29 degrees in the north and 20 degrees in the south.  Southeast warm trade winds predominate over the sea.  The weather is clear and sunny throughout the year.  The sweltering heat or winter cold practically does not happen.  Even in those cases when the thermometer's column approaches the mark of 40 degrees, a person feels quite comfortable thanks to the light breeze.  The only exception is the coast of the islands, which have long been active volcanoes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Coral sea islands" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/632380.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It should be noted that the region where the Coral Sea is located is a zone of seismic activity.  In this regard, over the past century, earthquakes have been repeatedly recorded here.  The most powerful of them occurred less than ten years ago in the Solomon Islands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Great Barrier Reef </h2><p>  The main attraction that the Coral Sea boasts is the <span>Great Barrier Reef, the</span> largest coral reef on the planet that stretches along the coast of Australia for more than two thousand kilometers.  Its width begins with a mark of 2 kilometers in the southern part and reaches 150 kilometers in the north.  There is a lagoon between the reef and the continent, the depth of which is about 50 meters.  Scientists recognized it as a real natural miracle and the heritage of mankind.  Based on numerous studies, his age is more than ten thousand years.  As for the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reef, it is almost 350 thousand square kilometers.  According to rough estimates, it consists of 2900 tiny and giant reefs.  The Great Barrier Reef also includes many of the <span>islands of the Coral</span> Sea. </p><p>  Every year, a huge number of tourists come from all over the world to see this natural attraction.  The most popular are small shallows and small reefs.  But on the territory of the Great Barrier Reef there are many protected areas that are protected by law.  You can get on them only with special permission. </p><h2>  Coral </h2><p>  The coral sea has become a habitat for 400 species of soft and hard corals.  All of them boast pretty colorful colors that add water to the shades of all the colors of the rainbow.  As can be seen in numerous photos, thanks to them, in clear weather, the water has an emerald color, which at deep depths becomes saturated blue and acquires a purple hue.  Along with this, it should be remembered that the corals extracted from under the water lose their brightness and attractiveness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coral sea bay" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/632372.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  According to scientists, about 1,500 species of fish live in the waters of the Coral Sea.  There are even some species of whales (killer whales and minke whales).  And there are more than 4 thousand species of mollusks.  Among other things, the Coral Sea has become home to some animals, no less mysterious than polyps.  These include the dugongs listed in the Red Book, which are marine mammals from the detachment of sirens.  It should also be noted that six of the seven species of sea turtles known on the planet are found in the local waters.  About 240 species of birds live on the shores washed by the sea.  It should be emphasized that some of them are found only here, therefore, they need protection. </p><h2>  Battle in the coral sea </h2><p>  In the period from May 4 to May 8, 1942, one of the largest and most significant <span>naval battles</span> took place in the Pacific Theater of World War II <span>.</span>  In it, the forces of the allies from Australia and the United States opposed the formation of the Japanese imperial fleet.  This battle in the Coral Sea was the first ever clash of aircraft carrier groups.  Moreover, the crews did not see the enemy‚Äôs ships and did not fire a single shot at each other.  The parties only exchanged air raids alternately.  As a result, on the first day, the Allied forces managed to destroy the enemy aircraft carrier, while the Japanese sank the American destroyer and tanker.  The next day, the enemy fleets lost one more aircraft carrier, and many ships were badly damaged.  After such significant losses of ships and aircraft, both sides retreated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Battle of the Coral Sea" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/632383.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to historians, the Allied fleet suffered more serious losses, because it lost its main ships.  On the other hand, the Australians and the Americans gained a strategic advantage, because for the first time since the start of the war, the Japanese offensive was stopped.  Moreover, it was largely because of their losses on enemy aircraft carriers that several months later the Allies successfully liberated New Guinea. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Since 1969, the water area has been the territory of Australia.  No one lives on the islands.  Due to the abundance of coral reefs, shipping at sea is significantly difficult.  As of today, there are a number of environmental and economic restrictions that are associated with the use of its resources.  Be that as it may, the coast is thriving, and port cities are characterized by rapid growth. </p>
