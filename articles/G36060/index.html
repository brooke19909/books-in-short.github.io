You need to bring the ribbon to the candle in a special way: from the side right at the base of the flame, otherwise the atlas will be smoky. </p><p>  Then the tips of the petals must be burned from one side.  To the flame at a distance of about 1.5 cm, you need to bring the edge that goes along the tape.  The part must be deformed, the more kinks there are, the more beautiful the final result will be. </p><p>  When the petals are ready, proceed to making the middle of the rose.  One of the round parts is flashed with thread in a circle, tightened, stuffed with filler and sewn down.  After that, the finished ball is sheathed with other petals inside out. </p><p>  When several sewn parts form the middle, the petals begin to be sewn with the front side inward.  At the same time, they can be slightly pulled together at the base.  The size and splendor of the future brooch will depend on the number of petals. </p><p>  In this way, you can make several roses of different sizes, group them into one composition and stick to the cardboard base, after gluing it with a satin ribbon.  You can complement the composition with leaves of green satin.  A mount is glued to the resulting decoration, and the brooch is ready. </p><h2>  DIY satin ribbon frill brooch </h2><p>  Clothes decorated with frill always look elegant and refined.
