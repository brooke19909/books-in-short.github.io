    <h2>  Priority task </h2><p>  What was the domestic policy of Nicholas 1?  Briefly formulating the goals, it is first necessary to note that the main task set by the monarch was the codification of laws.  The ruler paid particular attention to the criticism and proposals of the Decembrists, constantly pointing to him the lack of the necessary order and, as a result, the numerous abuses in the administration and the court.  The ruler saw the main goal of codification was to streamline legislation without introducing innovations.  So he wanted to provide the clearest foundation for absolutism.  Almost all codification work was carried out by Speransky. </p><h2>  Codification stages </h2><p>  In accordance with Speransky‚Äôs plan, the streamlining of legislation was to be carried out in three stages.  The first was to collect and publish all the Provisions in chronological order from the time of the reign of Alexei Mikhailovich to the end of the reign of Alexander I. The second stage was the task of publishing the Code of Laws, which were arranged in an orderly and systematic manner.  It was not intended to make any changes to them (additions or corrections).  At the third stage, it was planned to compile and publish a new "Code" - a systematic set of existing legislation.  In this edition, additions and corrections were proposed, taking into account customs and rights, as well as actual state needs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicholas 1 policy briefly" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/558384.jpg" width="428"></div>  The Second Division had its own printing house.  It printed the prepared volumes of the Laws of the Russian Empire (complete collection).  In the period from 1828 to 1830, 45 parts were published.  Three volumes of appendices and indexes were also printed.  All these parts made up the First Meeting.  It included 31 thousand legislative acts for the period from 1649 to 1825.  In addition, six more volumes were published.  They came out during the years 1825-30.  They began the second meeting.  It included regulations issued during the reign of Alexander 2 and Nicholas 1.

When compiling the Code, acts that were no longer valid or replaced by subsequent laws were eliminated.  Text processing of the provisions was also carried out.  All corrections, especially additions, could be made exclusively with the sanction of the Emperor.  The monarch himself controlled the entire course of work.  Previously, the Code of Laws was considered by members of a special commission from the Senate.  After that, its parts were sent to the ministries.  The code of laws was published in 15 volumes in the year 1832.  He included 40 thousand articles. </p><h2>  Other publications </h2><p>  Speransky prepared 12 volumes of Military Decisions, as well as the Code of Laws of the Grand Duchy of Finland and the Western and Ostseen Provinces.  During the reign of Nicholas 1, "Collections of maritime and spiritual laws", as well as "Regulations on the nomadic foreigners of Eastern Siberia" were published. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="policy table of Nicholas 1" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/558385.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Other conversions </h2><p>  Other policies of Nicholas 1 concerned the education and life of the peasants.  The monarch devoted particular importance to serfdom.  Thanks to the publication of a number of laws, the situation of peasants dependent on the landowner became somewhat better.  Normative acts emphasized that serfs are not the simple property of a private person.  They are, first of all, subjects of the state.  More conservative was the policy of Nicholas in the field of education.  In 1828, he carried out a reform of secondary and lower specialized educational institutions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Activity results </h2><p>  The <span>codification of laws</span> carried out during the reign of Nicholas 1 <span>, of</span> course, made it possible to streamline the existing legislation.  However, it did not change the structure of autocratic serf Russia.  In particular, this applies to the political and social field.  Codification did not change the management system, did not eliminate corruption, arbitrariness and red tape, which reached their peak precisely during the reign of Nicholas.  The bureaucracy led to paperwork, which proceeded in an unofficial clerical secret.  In the first half of the XIX century, the number of officials increased significantly.  The monarch perfectly saw all the flaws of the bureaucracy, but it was not possible to eliminate them under the conditions of absolutism.  This was the state policy of Nicholas 1 (briefly). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="domestic policy of Nicholas 1 briefly" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/558386.jpg" width="482"></div>

    <h2>  The position of Russia in the world </h2><p>  By the second quarter of the XIX century, Russia had the status of a strong and large state.  At that time, she was quite capable of independently resolving all foreign policy issues.  At the beginning of the reign of the monarch, the lag of the Empire from Europe in military-technical terms was not so noticeable.  The Russian army was numerous and was considered one of the best in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Foreign policy of Nicholas 1: highlights </h2><p>  The basic course has been preserved in Russia since the end of the 18th century, from the time that the country began to take shape in the huge Eurasian Empire.  After the accession to the throne, the new autocrat announced the continuation of the activities of his predecessor.  However, later the monarch made it clear that Russia in the European arena would rely more on its own forces than rely on "federal solidarity."  Nicholas 1 maintained interaction with the German states, with Prussia, in the first place, since it had long held a leading position in trade relations.  In the same period, there was a clear tendency toward rapprochement between Russia and France and England.  The foreign policy of Nicholas 1 was aimed at strengthening the situation on the Black Sea coast, as well as ensuring the security of the southern borders of the state.  Thus, the central place was taken by the eastern question, in particular, interaction with the Ottoman Empire.  The Black Sea at that time was of great importance for Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the main directions of the policy of Nicholas 1" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/558387.jpg" width="342"></div>

    <h2>  Critical issues </h2><p>  One of them was to ensure the most favorable conditions in the Black Sea straits - the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus.  Thanks to the free passage of merchant ships through them, the economic development of the southern regions of the state took place.  Foreign policy of Nicholas 1 was focused on the Caucasus.  Russia strove to expand its possessions in this region, to finally stabilize the borders in the region, and to ensure safe and free communication with newly acquired territories.  As a result, a solid accession of the entire Caucasus to the Empire was planned. </p><h2>  The beginning of the Russian-Persian war </h2><p>  The enemy in the conquest of the Caucasian territories was Iran.  In accordance with the peace treaty between him and Russia, the latter secured large territories in the Eastern Transcaucasia and the western part of the Caspian coast.  By the 20s of the XIX century, Iran (Persia) began to seek the return of the Karabakh and Talysh khanates.  At the court of the Shah, an anti-Russian group was formed, which possessed a sufficiently large force.  As a result, war broke out.  The commander-in-chief of Iran planned with one blow to eliminate Russia from the possession of the Transcaucasian territories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="foreign policy of Nicholas 1 table" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/558388.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Escalation of tension </h2><p>  The foreign policy of Nicholas 1 did not involve military action.  Upon accession to the throne, the Emperor found rather tense relations between Turkey and Russia.  However, he considered it impractical to start fights over the Greeks.  Initially, Russia, along with Great Britain, exerted diplomatic pressure on Turkey.  The beginning of the thirties of the XIX century was a very busy period both in the Middle East and in the European direction.  In the 1830-31s.  a wave of revolutions has passed in Europe.  She touched Russia.  Immediately after the Persian and <span>Turkish wars</span> ended, the Empire had to come into conflict with Poland.  The uprising in this country was facilitated by the <span>revolutionary situation</span> in France and Belgium.  As a result, in 1830, open unrest began in Warsaw.  The Romanov dynasty was declared deprived of the throne in Poland.  An interim government was formed.  An army of rebels was created.  Initially, they were successful.  However, the forces were unequal.  Soon, the royal troops crushed the rebellion.  In accordance with the published Decree, Poland was declared an integral part of Russia.  Towards the end of the forties, a new, even more formidable wave of uprisings rose in Western European territory.  In France, a revolution broke out in 1848, in February;  in Germany, Moldova, Wallachia, Italy and Austria - in the spring.  The events that took place, Nicholas 1 regarded as a direct threat to the autocracy in Russia.  It was in this connection that he decided to actively participate in the suppression of the revolutionary movement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the results of foreign policy of Nicholas 1" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/558389.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Post-war period </h2><p>  After the end of the revolutions in Europe 1848-49-ies.  the activity of Nicholas 1 was aimed at strengthening the strategic position of the Empire.  The priority was the issue of the Black Sea straits.  According to the agreements in force at that time, the Russian Navy opened the way along the <span>Dardanelles</span> and Bosporus straits.  Along with this, Nicholas 1 sought to strengthen political influence in the Balkan Peninsula.  At the expense of Turkey, England intended to strengthen its position in Asia Minor, as well as in the Caucasian territories, and thus push Russia away from the sea lanes.  <span>The Crimean War</span> showed the technical and organizational backwardness of the Russian state from Western countries. </p><h2>  The results of foreign policy of Nicholas 1 </h2><p>  The intervention of Russia in the affairs of Europe, the desire to protect the old order provoked the outrage of liberal circles.  The Russian monarch even received a nickname.  He was nicknamed the "gendarme of Europe."  As a result, both the peoples and the governments of other countries did not like Russia and were afraid of its arrogant reactionary tsar.  They were glad of every opportunity to destroy the influence and power of the Empire in European affairs. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The foreign policy of Nicholas 1 is described above.
