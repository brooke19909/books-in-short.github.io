The overthrow of the monarchy, the revolutionary movement and striking examples of terror overshadowed even the bloody events of the October Revolution of 1917 in their cruelty.  The French prefer to bashfully keep silent and in every way romanticize this period in their own history.  <span>The significance of the</span> French Revolution is hard to overestimate.  A vivid example of how the most bloodthirsty and terrible beast, dressed in the robes of Liberty, Equality and the Brotherhood, is ready to stick its fangs into anyone, and his name is Revolution. </p>

    <h2>  Prerequisites for the beginning of the revolution: socio-economic and political crisis </h2><p>  Having ascended the throne in 1774, <span>Louis XVI</span> appointed Robert Turgot the general controller of finance, but the wide range of reforms proposed by this politician was rejected.  The aristocracy strenuously clung to their privileges, and all requisitions with duties were a heavy burden on the shoulders of the third estate, of which 90% were representatives in France. </p><p>  In 1778, Turgot was replaced by Nekker.  It abolishes serfdom in the royal domains, tortures during interrogations, limits the costs of the court, but these measures were only a drop in the bucket.  Absolutism did not allow capitalist relations to mature in society.  Therefore, the change of economic formations was only a matter of time.  There was a deepening economic crisis, expressed in rising prices in the absence of production growth.  Inflation, which hit the poorest segments of the population painfully, was one of the catalysts that spurred the growth of revolutionary sentiments in society. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The U.S. War of Independence, which inspired hope in the revolutionary French, also set a fine example.  If we talk about the Great French Revolution briefly (and about the prerequisites that are ripe), it should be noted the political crisis in France.  The aristocracy considered itself located between a rock and a hard place - the king and the people.  Therefore, she violently blocked all innovations that, in her opinion, threatened liberties and preferences.  The king understood that something needed to be done: France could no longer live in the old way. </p><h2>  Convening of the General States on May 5, 1789 </h2><p>  All three classes pursued their goals and objectives.  The king hoped to avoid a collapse of the economy by reforming the tax system.  The aristocracy - to maintain its position, it clearly did not need reforms.  Ordinary people, or the third estate, hoped that the <span>General States</span> would become the platform where their demands were finally heard.  Swan, cancer and pike ... </p>

    <p>  Fierce disputes and discussions, thanks to the huge support of the people, were successfully resolved in favor of the third estate.  Of the 1,200 seats, 610, or most, went to representatives of the broad masses.  And soon they had the opportunity to show their political strength.  On June 17, representatives of the people, taking advantage of confusion and vacillation among the clergy and aristocracy, announced the creation of the National Assembly, vowing not to disperse, until a constitution was developed.  The clergy and part of the nobles supported them.  The third estate showed that it is necessary to reckon with it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The capture of the Bastille </h2><p>  The beginning of the Great French Revolution was marked by a momentous event - the capture of the Bastille.  The French celebrate this day as a national holiday.  As for historians, their opinions were divided: there are skeptics who believe that there was no capture: the garrison itself voluntarily surrendered, and everything happened because of the frivolity of the crowd.  Immediately need to clarify some points.  There was a take, and there were victims.  Several people tried to lower the bridge, and he crushed these unfortunates.  The garrison could resist, he had guns and experience.  There was not enough food, but history knows examples of the heroic defenses of fortresses. </p>

    <p>  Based on the documents, we have the following: from the Minister of Finance Nacker to the deputy commandant of the fortress Pujo, everyone spoke out about the abolition of the Bastille, while expressing universal opinion.  The fate of the famous fortress-prison was a foregone conclusion - it would have been demolished.  But history does not know the subjunctive mood: on July 14, 1789, the capture of the Bastille took place, and this marked the beginning of the Great French Revolution. </p><h2>  A constitutional monarchy </h2><p>  The determination of the people of France forced the government to make concessions.  City municipalities were transformed into a commune - an independent revolutionary government.  A new national flag was adopted - the famous French tricolor.  The National Guard was led by de Lafayette, who became famous in the US War of Independence.  The National Assembly began the formation of a new government and the development of the Constitution.  On August 26, 1789, the ‚ÄúDeclaration of Human and Citizen Rights‚Äù was adopted - the most important document in the history of the French Revolution.  It declared the fundamental rights and freedoms of the new France.  Now everyone had the right to freedom of conscience and resistance to oppression.  He could openly express his opinion and be protected from attacks on private property.  Now everyone was equal before the law and had equal obligations to taxation.  <span>The significance of the Great</span> French Revolution was expressed in every line of this progressive document.  While most European countries continued to suffer from social inequality generated by remnants of the Middle Ages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And although the reforms of 1789-1791.  much has changed dramatically, the adoption of the law on the suppression of any rebellion was directed against the poor.  It was also forbidden to join in unions and carry out strikes.  The workers were again deceived. </p><p>  On September 3, 1891, a new Constitution was adopted.  She gave the right to vote only to a limited number of representatives of the middle strata.  A new Legislative Assembly was convened, whose members could not be re-elected.  All this contributed to the radicalization of the population and the possibility of terror and despotism. </p>

    <h2>  The threat of external invasion and the fall of the monarchy </h2><p>  England was afraid that with the adoption of advanced economic reforms the influence of France would increase, so all the forces were thrown to prepare for the invasion of Austria and Prussia.  The patriotic French supported the call to defend their homeland.  The French National Guard advocated the removal of the king‚Äôs power, the creation of a republic, and the choice of a new national convention.  The Duke of Braunschweig issued a manifesto stating his intentions: to invade France and destroy the revolution.  After they found out about him in Paris, the events of the French Revolution began to develop rapidly.  On August 10, the rebels went to the Tuileries and, defeating the Swiss guards, arrested the king's family.  Radiant persons were placed in the Temple fortress. </p><h2>  War and its influence on the revolution </h2><p>  Briefly describing the Great French Revolution, it should be noted that the mood in French society was an explosive mixture of suspicion, fear, mistrust and bitterness.  Lafayette escaped, the Longvey border fortress surrendered without a fight.  The purges, arrests and mass executions on the initiative of the Jacobins began.  The majority in the Convention were Girondins - it was they who organized the defense and even won victories at first.  Their plans were extensive: from the liquidation of the Paris Commune to the capture of Holland.  By that time, France was at war with almost all of Europe. </p><p>  Personal disputes and squabbles, a drop in living standards and an economic blockade - under the influence of these factors, the influence of the Girondins began to fade, which the Jacobins took advantage of.  The betrayal of General Dumurier was an excellent reason to accuse the government of aiding the enemies and remove it from power.  Danton headed the Committee for Public Safety - the executive branch was concentrated in the hands of the Jacobins.  The significance of the Great French Revolution and the ideals that it upheld lost all meaning.  Terror and violence swept France. </p><h2>  Apogee of terror </h2><p>  France was going through one of the most difficult periods in its history.  Her army was retreating, the southwest under the influence of the Girondins raised a rebellion.  In addition, supporters of the monarchy became more active.  The death of Marat shocked Robespierre so much that he only craved blood. </p>

    <p>  The functions of the government passed to the Committee of Public Salvation - a wave of terror swept France.  After the decree of June 10, 1794, the defendants lost their right to defense.  The results of the Great French Revolution during the dictatorship of the Jacobins - about 35 thousand dead and over 120 thousand fled to emigration. </p><p>  The politics of terror so swallowed its creators that the republic, becoming hated, perished. </p><h2>  Napoleon Bonaparte </h2><p>  France was bloodless by civil war, and the revolution weakened its pressure and grip.  Everything has changed: now the Jacobins themselves were persecuted and persecuted.  Their club was closed, and the Committee for Public Safety gradually lost power.  The Convention, defending the interests of those who have enriched themselves during the years of the revolution, on the contrary, strengthened its position, but its position remained precarious.  Taking advantage of this, the Jacobins rebelled in May 1795, which, although it was severely suppressed, but this accelerated the dissolution of the Convention. </p>

    <p>  Moderate Republicans and Girondins created the Directory.  France is mired in corruption, debauchery and a complete decline in morals.  One of the most prominent figures in the Directory was Count Barras.  He noticed Napoleon Bonaparte and promoted him through the ranks, sending him on military campaigns. </p><p>  The people finally lost faith in the Directory and its political leaders, which Napoleon took advantage of.  On November 9, 1799, a consular regime was proclaimed.  All executive power was concentrated in the hands of the first consul - Napoleon Bonaparte.  The functions of the other two consuls were only advisory in nature.  The revolution is over. </p>

    <h2>  The fruits of the revolution </h2><p>  The results of the Great French Revolution were expressed in a change in economic formations and a change in socio-economic relations.  The church and the aristocracy finally lost their former power and influence.  France has embarked on the economic track of capitalism and progress.  Her people, seasoned in battles and tribulations, possessed the most powerful combat-ready army of that time.  The significance of the Great French Revolution is great: the ideals of equality and dreams of freedom have formed in the minds of many European peoples.  But at the same time there was a fear of new revolutionary upheavals. </p>
