Its population is approximately divided in half by Serbs and Hungarians.  The mixture of two cultures made this place unique and very attractive for curious tourists. </p><p>  Subotica is located in the north of the country, in a region called Vojvodina.  The city changed its name several times.  And now they continue to call him differently.  For the Serbs, he is Subotica, for the Hungarians - Zabadka, and for the Germans and the German-speaking population - Maria Theresiapol. </p><p>  Today, people of many nationalities live in Subotica (Serbia).  Most of them are Hungarians.  This is due to the fact that the city is located near the Hungarian border, only 10 kilometers away. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Subotica is the fifth largest city in Serbia and the second in the Vojvodina region.  The population is slightly more than 100 thousand people.  The local community lives in the city itself and in the eighteen surrounding villages. </p><p>  Due to ancient history, archaeological excavations are often carried out here.  On the shore of Lake Ludash, objects of the ice age were discovered.  In different eras, there were Scythians, Goths, Huns, Dacians, Avars, later Slavs on this territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nadasdiszabo.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Subotica city in Serbia what to see" class="if uuid-2951706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45994/2951706.jpg"></div><p>  There is no own higher education institution in the city, but a branch of Novi Sad University is operating.
