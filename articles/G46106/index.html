One of the attractive buildings is the Botanical Garden residential complex, which is being developed and created by the Pioneer group of companies.  This developer has proved itself from the best side, in addition, each residential complex designed and built by its specialists has an attractive appearance. </p><h2>  Project Features </h2><p>  LCD "Botanical Garden" is the embodiment of ideas about comfort and convenience that are actively practiced in housing construction today.  This territory is conveniently located in the very center of Moscow, next to the <span>Main Botanical Garden</span> and very close to metro stations.  The residential complex "Botanical Garden", according to the project, consists of 9 buildings, which will be erected in four stages.  Active construction is currently underway. </p>

    <p>  The phased construction will be as follows: </p><ul><li>  first two towers of buildings with 24 floors and buildings of varying number of floors will be built, in which 683 apartments are planned; </li><li>  the second stage is the construction of 3 <span>multi-storey buildings,</span> which are built on the basis of monolithic technology with a focus on ventilated facades; </li><li>  in the third stage, multi-section buildings will be erected in 464 apartments, which will already be sold with finished decoration. </li></ul><p>  These three lines, according to the project, are comfortable class housing.  But the last one will be a business-class building, in which it is planned from 7 to 17 floors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Infrastructure development </h2><p>  When buying an apartment, we are looking for options that would be convenient in all respects.  The residential complex Botanichesky Sad (Moscow) is conveniently located in the city center in close proximity to metro stations.  During the construction, educational institutions (kindergarten and school), playgrounds will also be erected.  As noted in the Pioneer company, during the development of the project, great attention was paid to ensuring that those who bought apartments in a residential complex could immediately resolve the issue with the place where their children would be studying. </p>

    <p>  Especially for this, a school for 550 children and a kindergarten for 240 children will be erected, and both institutions will be combined into one building.  The residential complex "Botanical Garden" in Moscow ("Pioneer") involves the placement of an educational institution next to a landscaped park area.  It, in turn, is located on the banks of the Yauza - it is here that the windows of the garden and the school will go. </p><h2>  No cars in the yards! </h2><p>  Another feature of the complex is the implementation of the concept, which involves the organization of a yard space without cars.  This will be achieved by the construction of several underground parking lots at once, which will unload the yard territory and allow it to be equipped more rationally.  As the developers themselves note, the implementation of such a concept will make the Botanical Garden residential complex even more convenient and comfortable for living.  In addition to the harmony of the facades, the buildings are distinguished by a well-planned layout.  And it also helps to create a pleasant environment for residents. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  About architecture features </h2><p>  The residential complex "Botanical Garden" ("Pioneer") catches the eye with an original design solution.  The embodiment of the visual concept was done by Japanese architects Nikken Sekkei. </p>

    <p>  The largest architectural and design bureau in the world sought to ensure that the spirit of change prevailed in buildings.  This is the main motive, which is expressed in the displacement of building elements and their alternation.  By the way, for Japan such a constructive approach is quite traditional.  Due to the displacement of the planes, the towers are given a special rhythm that fits perfectly into the surrounding natural space. </p><h2>  Focus on the upper floors </h2><p>  The top floor deserves special attention: to emphasize its height and at the same time lightness, architects shifted the main contour of the building in depth.  Terraces were also created - they offer excellent panoramic views of the surrounding space.  By the way, the towers will also be illuminated at night due to lighting devices mounted in the roof. </p><h2>  Finishing for every taste </h2><p>  The residential complex "Botanical Garden" offers its customers several types of apartments - comfort and premium - as well as commercial real estate.  All apartments embody a new standard of living and will appeal to those who seek to express their individuality. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, the decoration of the apartments will be different: </p><ul><li>  The basic finishes will be made in a classic or modern style in a dark or light version.  High quality materials created by Russian and European brands are used for cladding. </li><li>  Individual finishing is an opportunity to personalize your future apartment, embodying in it any necessary additional options or technological solutions.  Thanks to a wide palette of materials that are harmoniously combined, it is possible to carry out repairs in accordance with individual parameters, up to the selection of plumbing or the installation of a warm floor. </li><li>  Public areas, entrance groups, lounge areas are also thought out by Japanese craftsmen and are comfortable and cozy. </li></ul>

    <p>  The company has already erected the Botanical Garden residential complex in Voronezh.  The layout of the apartments in it, as well as the number of rooms, is very different.  The buildings are located next to the Botanical Garden and Dynamo Recreation Park, surrounded by forest stands.  Thanks to this, a favorable environmental situation is created on the territory of the complex.  Here, attention is paid to landscaping, arranging walking paths, as well as playgrounds and sports grounds. </p>
