Types of Routes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Krasnodar is one of the largest transport hubs in the country.  This city is visited by large and small businessmen.  Here, there are tourists passing by, hurrying to the best Russian resorts.  You can get to the capital of the Cossacks without any problems at any time of the year.  From here to the sea is only two hours away, but still this is not a resort.  How much to fly from Krasnodar to Moscow?  What other ways are there to get to this city? </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.tvzvezda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnodar city" class="if uuid-2616770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2616770.jpg"></div><h2>  By plane </h2><p>  A resident of Belokamennaya, who has never been to the southern capital of Russia, which is exactly what this city is called, before the trip usually wonders how much to fly from Moscow to Krasnodar.  It’s not easy to buy a ticket to coastal cities in high season.  That is why often future holiday-makers get to Sochi, Adler or Abkhazia via Krasnodar. </p><p>  The distance between this city and the capital is about two thousand kilometers.  How much fly from Moscow to Krasnodar depends on the airline.  In this direction, the fastest is Yakutia.  How much to fly to Krasnodar from Moscow if you use the services of this airline?  Less than two hours, or more precisely, an hour and fifty minutes. </p><p>  With “Transaero” fly the longest.  About two hours and fifteen minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourister.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Airport Krasnodar city" class="if uuid-2616774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2616774.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, the question of how much to fly by plane from Moscow to Krasnodar can be answered in different ways.  Depends on the airline.  However, on average - two hours.  The cost of a plane ticket is from five thousand. </p><p>  So, we found out how many hours to fly from Moscow to Krasnodar.  But there are people who are panicky afraid of airplanes.  What should they be?  Are there any other ways to get to the southern capital of Russia?  Of course.  This can be done by bus, by car or by rail. </p><h2>  By train </h2><p>  The railway station is one of the main attractions of the city, because it is an architectural monument.  Trains depart from here to Novorossiysk, Anapa, and Abkhazia. </p><p>  Of course, it is easy to get to Krasnodar from Moscow.  A reserved seat ticket costs about 2,500 rubles. </p><p>  There is another station in the city, but it serves exclusively suburban trains. </p><p>  Trains to Krasnodar leave from the Kursk station.  This is a rather tedious route.  The road takes 30-36 hours. </p><h2>  By bus </h2><p>  Krasnodar station accepts buses from different cities of Russia.  Including from Moscow.  A ticket costs about 2,000 rubles.  Buses depart four times a week from the Sadovod shopping center, located in the southeast of the capital.  The road takes about 18 hours.  You can also go to Krasnodar from the Krasnaya Vorota bus station.  However, the trip will have to spend almost a day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.avtovokzaly.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnodar bus station" class="if uuid-2616776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2616776.jpg"></div><h2>  By car </h2><p>  This is a pretty convenient way.  The highway M-4 passes through Krasnodar.  The road is in excellent condition.  True, there are bad areas in the Voronezh region, and in the same place, one settlement often has congestion.  The rest of the way from the capital to Krasnodar can be overcome comfortably in 16 hours, unless, of course, you stop at every gas station, of which there are a lot of shops, including cafes and cafes. </p><p>  From Krasnodar to Sochi can be reached by bus in 8 hours and in about the same time to Sukhum.  But the fastest way, of course, is by plane.  The flight time will be only 50 minutes. </p>
