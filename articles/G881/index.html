    <h2>  The history of the world famous stadium </h2><p>  The Stade de France was built in 1998.  Its construction was timed to the World Cup.  In Paris there is another arena - ‚ÄúParc des Princes‚Äù, but it supposedly accept no more than 50 thousand guests.  Therefore, it was decided to build a sports complex that would be able to accommodate 80 or more thousand people. </p><p>  The construction of the Stade de France (Paris) began in 1995 - three years before the cherished date.  It lasted more than 30 months.  At the end of January 1998, the arena was inaugurated.  At the opening ceremony, journalists, fans, athletes and top officials of France saw that the country received an excellently equipped sports complex, which could also be a concert venue of world significance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The opening of the Stade de France stadium was accompanied by a friendly match between the national teams of Spain and France.  It was during her time that the only legendary goal in the match was scored by Zinedine Zidane.  During the 1998 World Cup, nine matches took place in the arena, in addition, a couple of Champions League finals were held here.  <span>The 2016 European Football Championship</span> was also held at this stadium. </p><h2>  Arena construction </h2><p>  In the vicinity of Paris, it was extremely difficult to find a place for the construction of the arena, so the Stade de France stadium was decided to be built in the suburbs of the metropolis.  It was originally planned to place the complex in Melun Senar, but the organizers of the World Cup received many complaints that it would be too far away.  So there was a decision to build a future attraction in the burial place of the French kings - in Saint-Denis. </p><p>  On the territory of the abandoned gas developments, construction work began on the construction of the stadium.  Several French architects became ideologists of the arena design.  Their names are known to many.  These are Rezhambhal Michelle, Claude Constantine, Michelle Makari and Eimerick Zublen.  The design of the complex is influenced by the Roman Colosseum. </p><p>  Designers did everything in such a way that, if necessary, you can disassemble one of the stands of the stadium.  This is necessary when it is necessary to make room for the arrangement of treadmills and athletics sectors.  The lower rows of stands in the arena are mobile and easy to clean.  At the same time, the stadium will accommodate 70 thousand spectators.  The architects also provided a collapsible roof over the stadium, which protects athletes and fans from various weather conditions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The construction of the stadium cost 285 million euros. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stadium stud de france" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1375616.jpg" width="600"></div>
