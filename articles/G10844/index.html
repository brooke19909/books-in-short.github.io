  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to get a loan secured by real estate?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The protracted crisis is forcing people to increasingly seek money loans from banks and MFIs.  At the same time, the percentage of those whom banks consider to be positive and trustworthy customers ‚Äî with a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù salary, official employment, and a high level of income ‚Äî is becoming less and less.  And this means that if you urgently need a large amount of money, it is not a fact that the bank will lend it to you without any problems. </p><p>  If we are talking about 10-15 thousand rubles, MFIs are at your service for every taste - there are even those where the required amount will be transferred directly to your card via the Internet in 5 minutes, for example, a service <!--noindex--><noindex>  <span>online loans</span> </noindex><!--/noindex-->  "Robot Seimer."  And the requirements for employment and official income there are much milder.  Well, and if the problem is estimated at several hundred thousand - many begin to think about a loan secured by property. </p><p>  <strong>Where will they give money on the security of an apartment?</strong> </p><p>  The most obvious answer is at the bank.  The pluses are clear - interest rates are lower, loan amounts are higher, and there is more confidence in the bank.  But there are also disadvantages: the bank will evaluate not only the liquidity of your property, but also you as a borrower.  And this again brings us back to the issue of ‚Äúwhite‚Äù income, an employment contract, and, in addition, a positive credit history. </p><p>  The process of applying for a loan secured by an apartment in a bank is quite long, includes property valuation, compulsory insurance of both property and the borrower. </p><p>  An easier way is to contact an MFI.  Some microfinance organizations also issue loans secured by apartments, usually the maximum amount of such a loan is 1 million rubles.  You do not need to confirm your income, the credit history does not play a role, the maximum period is a couple of years.  Interest, of course, will be higher than at the bank, but likewise the likelihood of approval. </p><p>  If, for some reason, a refusal is received at the MFIs, then you can apply for a similar service to a private person on the Internet sites of the P2P financial market.  True, the probability of fraud here is much higher than in a bank or <!--noindex--><noindex>  <span>MFI</span> </noindex><!--/noindex-->  . </p><p>  <strong>How not to be on the street?</strong> </p><p>  Whichever option you choose, you need to remember that this type of loan is a pretty risky thing.  The slightest carelessness can cost you housing.  Therefore, everything must be done so as not to lose property: </p><p>  - carefully read the contract, paying attention to the clause that for the duration of the loan the apartment remains at your disposal, with the right to live in it; </p><p>  - check for specific points in the contract, the unintentional violation of which may lead to its early termination: a ban on renting, a ban on registering someone, a ban on repairs, as well as a mandatory notification to the creditor in case you change your job; </p><p>  - make sure that the lender cannot unilaterally raise the loan interest rate; </p><p>  - and, of course, not to allow late payments, since the creditor in this case has the right to terminate the contract unilaterally, demanding to pay the debt immediately and in full.  Another unpleasant option - the apartment will be put up for auction. </p><p>  There are many more nuances, so the best option would be to show the contract to the lawyer before signing and discuss with him all the contentious issues of the transaction. </p><p>  <strong>Alina Ovsyannikova</strong> </p><p>  <strong>based on materials https://www.zaymer.ru/</strong> </p></div></article>
