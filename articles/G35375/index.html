  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to take pictures</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A camera is now available in almost every family, in every home.  Photography in general is perhaps the most popular and accessible art form.  With a camera, literally anyone can become a real artist, not even knowing how to draw.  Modern digital technology can make any person a photographer, and you don‚Äôt have to think about the exposure and configure other shooting parameters, you can just point the camera ‚Äúat the target‚Äù and click on the button, and the picture is ready. </p><p>  With a light and compact digital camera, any traveler can bring home a very large number of "digital memories" of a trip to exotic Thailand or the fabulous Maldives ... This secret and accessibility is the secret to the enormous popularity of modern amateur photography.  But far from always, looking at pictures from the Maldives archipelago on a computer screen, you can recognize in them those truly heavenly places where the lens of the digital "soap dish" was aimed ... </p><p>  Why is this happening?  How to make a beautiful photo that conveys all the charms of the plot?  Is it really necessary to buy a very expensive professional camera with many features?  But the most interesting thing is that very often the pictures taken even by a highly professional camera also look gray and nondescript ... </p><p>  Of course, a lot depends on the quality of the camera, but the price of the camera is not a determining factor in obtaining beautiful photos.  A camera is just a tool in the hands of a photographer, just as brushes and paints act as tools for an artist.  So, you just need to know how to take pictures correctly and how to correctly use all the opportunities that his camera provides to the photographer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to understand how to learn to take pictures beautifully, one must firmly note for oneself: to get a beautiful artistic picture it is not enough just to throw the camera and press the button.  With such a shooting, good photos can happen except by accident, but many wonderful moments will be simply irretrievably lost ... </p><p>  To get a complete picture of how to take pictures for yourself, you‚Äôll have to touch a little on the history of photography.  Ever since the invention of photography, little has changed in the very foundation of photography.  Of course, modern technologies have appeared, but they relate mainly to image registration, settings and all kinds of amenities that make life easier for the photographer. </p><p>  But the whole image is still formed by a beam of light that has passed through the lens, and the laws of photocomposition, borrowed from the painting, are still valid and will work in the next millennia, just like the concepts of "golden section", "light", "shadow "," Exposure "and many others ... </p><p>  You can only fully learn how to take pictures correctly and how to make a beautiful photo in practice.  Therefore, pick up your favorite "number" and - go! </p><p>  To begin with, let‚Äôs analyze the case when you have a fully automatic ‚Äúsoap box‚Äù or an expensive camera with automatic mode turned on in your hands.  We accept as data that the automation is configured and works flawlessly. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One of the most common mistakes of an amateur photographer, especially a tourist, is the desire to photograph a person against the background of an interesting natural or architectural object or sculpture of significant size, with the person being shot being put in close proximity to the memorial object.  In order for ‚Äúeverything to enter,‚Äù the photographer moves a considerable distance.  As a result, the person in the picture comes out barely distinguishable, and in the foreground often it turns out just an empty space.  The solution to this problem can be a simple placement of a person closer to the photographer. </p><p>  Compose the frame so that the plot-important part occupies a large part of the image area, otherwise you can get pictures that show only the head of the person portrayed in the lower part, and everything else takes either a dazzling sky or a background landscape. </p><p>  When shooting against the light, you run the risk of getting only dark <span>silhouettes of people</span> against a bright background: the automation will honestly work out the exposure according to the weighted average brightness and will produce such an unfavorable result.  To get a shot under the given conditions, turn off the automation and set the exposure to the plot-important part.  Or you can choose automatic shooting mode against the light or enter a correction if the camera allows it.  Otherwise, refuse to shoot. </p><p>  When shooting general plans in cramped lighting conditions (for example, in a concert hall) with an inexpensive soap dish with a built-in flash, most often the pictures are dark and ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù.  For such filming, you need to use more serious equipment. </p><p>  In order to learn how to take pictures correctly, it is not enough to read one article or instructions for an expensive camera.  It is necessary to study the basics of photocomposition and photographic equipment, to study the works of outstanding masters of the present of past years, and most importantly, to develop a sense of the Beautiful in oneself.  This is the only way to learn how to learn to take pictures beautifully. </p>
