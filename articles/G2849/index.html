  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Which Thailand Hotels Cause The Greatest Admiration For Tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Thailand is a terrific country, completely immersed in exotic.  Buddhist temples, tropical plants, amazing flora and fauna, velvet beaches make this country fantastically beautiful and diverse.  Even during the <span>Vietnam War,</span> Americans came here to rest.  And now the country is enjoying tremendous success among tourists.  Rest here always promises to be pleasant and unforgettable.  In order for a trip to Thailand not to result in disappointment, the first thing is to decide which hotel to stay in, and the quality of rest depends on it.  All hotels in Thailand meet international requirements and can satisfy even the most sophisticated tourist.  Consider several hotels that are most in demand among holidaymakers. </p><p>  HiltonPattaya5 * is an excellent hotel with high quality service, built in 2010.  It is part of the huge CentralFestivalPattaya shopping center.  All hotels in Thailand can only envy HiltonPattaya's convenient location and enjoy stunning panoramic views of the sea and the surrounding landscape.  The hotel is close to many beaches, restaurants, nightclubs and shops.  For vacationers, all conditions have been created for a pleasant pastime: 6 restaurants where you can enjoy delicious <span>exotic dishes, a</span> fitness center and an outdoor pool.  In beauty salons and massage, SPA-centers you can undergo wellness treatments.  For active people, the hotel has a gym and a golf course.  For children organized playgrounds, clubs and pools.  All rooms are well equipped and very comfortable.  In Pattaya, the DusitThani Hotel with Thai-style rooms is also in low demand.  It combines urban and beach activities.  On site you can find the Chinese restaurant Empress, wellness centers and sports grounds.  The only negative of this hotel is the high cost of the rooms.  One room costs about $ 200 per day. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  SheratonGrandLaguna is a five-star Thai-style hotel located on the shores of the <span>Andaman Sea.</span>  This place attracts vacationers with its unique tropical gardens, architecture and beautiful white sandy beaches.  It is located in the city of Phuket, in the center of a beautiful lagoon.  Here, tourists have the opportunity to view other hotels in Thailand and evaluate their service.  SheratonGrandLaguna offers guests to visit restaurants with masterpieces of Thai cuisine, lagoons, pools, SPA centers and stunning flowering gardens.  An excellent choice for active and family holidays.  In Phuket, there is another comfortable LeMeridien hotel, located in a picturesque place with golden beaches, a turquoise lagoon and <span>beautiful scenery.</span>  Most of the hotel rooms have beautiful views of the azure sea.  Near LeMeridien is Patong - the concentration of the nightlife of these parts, which attracts a lot of young people here.  A few drawbacks of this hotel - restaurants are quite expensive, expensive things can not be left in the rooms.  Theft among staff is quite developed here. </p><p>  Hotels in Thailand with 4 stars are also very popular, among which LongBeachGarden, located in the resort of Pattaya, can be distinguished.  Luxurious Balinese-style architecture, well-equipped rooms, high-quality service and a range of services and entertainment will leave only <span>positive emotions.</span>  Also, a very interesting and famous hotel is HardRock 4 *.  It impresses visitors with its stylish design with a huge number of musical instruments.  Opposite the hotel there is a large swimming pool stretched across the entire hotel.  The original design, entertainment and discos are full of fun, all the conditions for sports and a comfortable stay.  The disadvantages of this hotel - do not serve tea and coffee, the staff in English does not understand tourists well. </p><p>  The best hotel reviews in Thailand relate mainly to these hotels.  A trip to Thailand with a stay in these hotels will be the best vacation full of unforgettable moments and vivid impressions. </p>
