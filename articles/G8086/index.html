We will only say that this city of the Black Sea coast has long been a tidbit. </p><p>  Broken roads, low level of service and “homeless” public beaches interfere with the charm of the ancient city today.  However, most travelers compensate for the dull landscape with local attractions <span>(Genoese fortress,</span> art gallery, <span>Karadag nature reserve</span> and others). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels of Feodosia" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1021996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for housing, then the choice is quite large.  Apartments and the private sector are most popular among tourists because of the low cost, although some hotels in Feodosia also keep prices at an average level.  We will talk about the most popular hotels in the resort and the services they offer. </p><h2>  Atlantic </h2><p>  <span>Hotel service</span> in Russia is developing quite rapidly.  Previously, travelers could not have imagined the famous all-inclusive system on the Black Sea coast.  Today the Atlantic Hotel (Feodosia) offers to spend magnificent summer vacations at the “European” level. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Three meals a day, rooms of various categories, a heated pool, a bath complex, a SPA center and lots of entertainment are waiting for everyone who chooses to relax in the Atlantic.  On the territory there is a playground for the youngest guests. </p><h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  Guests can book a double, triple or quadruple room, as well as suites and apartments with a kitchenette.  The interior is made in calm colors, which further contributes to relaxation. </p><p>  A small restaurant is responsible for the food of the guests, where a familiar buffet is served. </p><h2>  Travelers opinion </h2><p>  The main advantage, according to reviews, is the proximity to the sea.  The beach is a five minute walk.  In addition, guests celebrate a varied diet with many local fruits and vegetables. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Atlantic Feodosia" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1021995.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The Atlantic Hotel (Feodosia) has a small number of rooms, and in the season the number of guests reaches the maximum mark.  In this regard, the restaurant can not cope with the supply of food, even in two shifts. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the work of personnel who are trying to solve all problems as quickly as possible and leave only the best impressions of the rest. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Theodosius </h2><p>  Each Russian city has a hotel of the same name.  Feodosia was no exception, so we will talk about the services that the hotel provides at the address: st.  Pushkin, house 11. </p><p>  Travelers really like the Feodosia Hotel.  Reviews of rooms, food and service immerse us in dreams of a perfect vacation.  A modern four-story building, a small area and parking, as well as developed infrastructure suggest that the hotel owners care about the comfort of the guests. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  “Feodosia” offers 78 rooms for every taste and budget: </p><p>  - Single. </p><p>  - Standard A. </p><p>  - Standard B. </p><p>  - Junior Suite. </p><p>  - Lux. </p><p>  - Panoramic suite. </p><p>  Regardless of the selected category, all rooms are equipped with modern furniture, electronic locks, refrigerators, safes and cable TV.  The windows offer magnificent views of the sea and the old part of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel feodosia reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1021992.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The price includes breakfast, and lunch and dinner are offered at very reasonable prices - 400 and 360 rubles, respectively. </p><p>  A tour desk, a playground, a restaurant, guide-interpreter services and a 24-hour reception are the main advantages noted by guests. </p><p>  One of the few drawbacks is the location of the hotel - the distance to the beach is 200 meters. </p><h2>  "Scarlet Sails" </h2><p>  Not all hotels in Feodosia can boast a large territory, but “Scarlet Sails” is a pleasant exception.  Here guests enjoy a landscape park, the creation of which was worked by professional architects and designers.  The famous Golden Sands Beach and the city promenade are 50 meters away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels of Feodosia" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1021993.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Hotel “Scarlet Sails” (Feodosia) is often chosen for families with children, because it is here that you can guarantee comfort and safety.  However, for youth there will certainly be entertainment, for example, the Zurbagan nightclub and the Tobacco &amp; Whiskey bar. </p><h2>  Comfort and coziness </h2><p>  Hotel “Scarlet Sails” (Feodosia), built in 2007, offers 53 comfortable rooms.  Placement options: </p><p>  - Single standard (from 2800 rubles). </p><p>  - Double standard (from 4200 rubles). </p><p>  - Lux (from 10 200 rubles). </p><p>  - Suite (from 14,400 rubles). </p><p>  Most of the rooms have magnificent terraces, as well as everything you need for a good rest: hairdryer, air conditioning, cable TV, Wi-Fi, an individual safe and a minibar. </p><h2>  Children and parents </h2><p>  It is unlikely that anyone will argue that sometimes even the most loving parents need a break from their beloved babies.  For young guests, the hotel offers wonderful sessions in the games room. </p><p>  While qualified teachers will look after the children, their mothers and fathers can look into the Assol health and beauty center.  Here you will find a huge selection of wellness services, a gym, a swimming pool, a hammam and a Finnish sauna. </p><p>  For the fair sex, we strongly recommend a cosmetologist’s office where they offer all kinds of anti-cellulite programs, peels and body wraps, massage services and SPA treatments for face and body. </p><h2>  Solid Four </h2><p>  Hotels in Feodosia are just beginning to comprehend the basics of high-quality service, and, as a rule, the number of stars on the sign does not always correspond to the real situation.  However, the Scarlet Sails complex has nothing to do with this situation, and the reviews of travelers only confirm this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Scarlet Sails Feodosia" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1021994.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Great location, beautiful and green areas, infrastructure, comfortable rooms and friendly staff - you will agree, it is very similar to the description of an ideal hotel.  The Hermitage Restaurant is considered one of the best in the city, and in the evenings you can enjoy the sunset and enjoy a glass of Crimean wine in the rooftop bar. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, a weak Wi-Fi signal in the rooms and the maintenance of the beach area are most often noted. </p><p>  It is worth noting that other hotels in Feodosia did not receive such high ratings from travelers, therefore, the rating of the Scarlet Sails hotel complex remains one of the highest in the resort. </p>
