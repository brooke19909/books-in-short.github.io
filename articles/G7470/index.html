The life of this monarch is haunted by one secret.  His character, traditions and skills changed dramatically after the Great Embassy.  Moreover, the face, figure, weight and height of Peter 1 also raised many questions. </p><h2>  The childhood of the future king </h2><p>  The first All-Russian Emperor was born on the night of May 30 (June 9), 1672.  It is not known where exactly he was born: some indicate the Kremlin‚Äôs Terem Palace, others indicate the village of Kolomenskoye.  His parents were Alexei Mikhailovich and <span>Natalya Naryshkina</span> (imperial couple).  The boy was a direct contender for the throne.  When the baby was four years old, his father died.  The monarch was declared Fyodor the Third, who became the guardian of the prince.  His accession to the throne pushed into the background Natalia Naryshkin.  She was forced to go to the village of Preobrazhenskoye. </p>

The teachers were simple clerks who had little understanding in the sciences, while in Europe noblemen were taught by university graduates and the brightest minds of the time.  But the boy compensated for the lack of knowledge with practical talents.

    <p>  In the sixth year of rule, Tsar Fedor the Third died.  His place could be taken by a weak Ivan, the eldest son of Alexei Mikhailovich from his first wife, or ten-year-old Peter, a son from another wife.  The choice was made in favor of less.  So, in 1682, the boy became king. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A few years later, the people split up: some loved the monarch, others hated.  This was due to his sympathy for Europe.  Many claimed that the sovereign father was replaced abroad.  This was evidenced by numerous changes, including the growth of Peter 1 was discussed. </p><h2>  External data </h2><p>  From childhood, the king was distinguished by amazing beauty.  Everyone around admired his appearance.  The emperor was especially struck by his gigantic growth.  In the crowd, his head was glorified over others.  But, despite the high growth, Peter was thin and had a small clothing size.  Narrow shoulders, short arms and a disproportionately small head set him apart from others.  The hair was dark, short cut, curled at the ends. </p>

    <h2>  Trip to europe </h2><p>  Taking into account the traditions, Ivan's relatives - Miloslavskys - wished their representative to take the throne.  Therefore, in the same 1682, both applicants were called rulers.  Little Peter was sent away from the yard.  In the villages where the boy lived, he was fond of military affairs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1689, at the request of his mother, the guy married an unloved girl.  A few months later he began to rule alone. </p><p>  In 1697, the king went on a trip to Europe.  The monarch went to other countries incognito.  Studied Western art of government abroad, adopted other people's laws and lifestyle. </p><p>  Upon returning, relatives and friends noticed that the <span>appearance</span> and growth of Peter 1 had changed.  The man was called an impostor. </p><h2>  Monarch substitution </h2><p>  There were many reasons for not trusting the new ruler.  His political program has completely changed.  Now he is not looking for allies against Turkey, but directs his anger towards the aggression of Charles XII.  His spiritual consciousness fell sharply.  Weak knowledge of the Russian language.  From now on, he despises his people and ignores his traditions. </p>

But if internal changes could really be caused by the influence of foreign countries, then external changes could not be explained.  There are legends that the king returned as a giant.  The growth of Peter 1 in cm, according to some reports, reached 220. Other sources put the ruler under the bar of 2 meters.

    <h2>  Physical and spiritual changes </h2><p>  Found a lot of evidence that the king was an impostor.  One of the main ones is physique.  Before the Great Embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãthe emperor was of medium height, inclined to fullness.  A man with a height of 204 centimeters came from abroad. </p>

Parents, like grandfathers, did not differ in such parameters.  In those days, a man two meters tall was considered a giant.  In connection with the change in body, the emperor asked him to replace the entire wardrobe.  Since then, he wore exclusively European outfits, neglecting Russian clothing.

    <p>  You can trace the changes in portraits, which depicts Peter 1 in full growth before and after 1698. </p><p>  It is worth noting that immediately after returning home, the king, without even meeting his wife, sent her to the monastery.  Also, according to the chroniclers, it was not the 28-year-old autocrat who returned, but the 40-year-old man.  The code of ethics has been strikingly dropped.  The emperor went wild, drunk, led a wild life.  He did not listen to Russian music, but propagandized foreign motives.  He moved the capital to St. Petersburg, while Moscow was considered a symbol of the invincibility and unity of the Russian nation. </p>

    <h2>  Real facts </h2><p>  The answer to the question of how tall Peter 1 is in cm can be given by every man.  To do this, you need to visit the imperial chambers, look at things and try to lie in his bed. </p><p>  <span>The heavy nature of the</span> sovereign scared the courtiers.  This feature is directly related to its growth.  The doors of the estates were made in standard sizes, so in order to enter the room, a giant two meters high had to bend down.  Many historians believe that, given the tough temper that legends were about, the king would not tolerate this. </p><p>  Each visitor to the museum, where the monarch‚Äôs belongings, saw that Peter 1 wore. Height, foot size can be determined by his clothes. </p><p>  Separately, small beds can be noted.  The king with his mythical growth would have to sleep while sitting, and the man did not possess such talent. </p><p>  Learn the truth will help the Zoological Museum of St. Petersburg.  There is a stuffed animal of the emperor‚Äôs favorite horse.  Lisette (the king gave her that name) was of medium build.  A man whose height is more than 200 centimeters would not fit on her. </p><h2>  Legend breaking </h2><p>  About how tall Peter 1 was, modern researchers say very different.  There are historians who are still looking for information about the replacement of the king.  Hundreds of articles have been written on how and where exactly the replacement took place.  But this information is fiction. </p><p>  Science claims that over the past 200 years in the process of <span>evolution, man has</span> grown by 10 centimeters.  With each <span>century, the average</span> length of life increases, puberty begins later.  In the nineteenth century, average growth was 165-180 centimeters.  But three hundred years ago, people with a height of 120-140 cm were considered normal. </p>

Researchers believe that centimeters were added because people of a past era were incredibly low compared to their contemporaries.  It was on such grounds that the legend of the replacement of the king arose.
