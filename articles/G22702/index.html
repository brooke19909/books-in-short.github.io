Quarenghi in the 18th century.  This building is part of the <span>Vorontsov Palace</span> complex <span>.</span>  The history of construction, architecture and unusual facts will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  The Maltese chapel is part of the Vorontsov Palace, but it was built later than the main building of the complex.  The palace was created by the famous architect of the time B.F. Rastrelli from 1749 to 1757.  The building was so expensive that six years later <span>Count Vorontsov</span> was forced to transfer his palace to the state treasury due to numerous debts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="petersburglike.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Altar in the Maltese Chapel" class="if uuid-2596037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2596037.jpg"></div><p>  For seven years, until 1770, the palace was empty, and then they began to use it as a guest house.  At various times, the prince of Prussia, Nassau and the nobles stayed here.  However, after the accession to the Russian throne of Paul I, who later became the Master of the Order of Malta, the former palace of Count Vorontsov was given for use by the Maltese knights.  After the capture of Malta by Napoleon I in 1798, the knights were forced to seek refuge for their order, which was granted to them by Emperor Paul I. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Start of construction </h2><p>  From the end of the 18th century, <span>Giacomo Quarenghi</span> was a court architect and was engaged in the design and construction of buildings on the orders of the emperor.  From 1798 to 1800, he began the construction of the Maltese chapel and attached it to the main building of the palace.  In mid-June 1800, the erected church was consecrated by the archbishop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="petersburglike.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capella painting" class="if uuid-2596032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2596032.jpg"></div><p>  The chapel was erected in honor of St. John of Jerusalem and adjoined the Vorontsov Palace from the side of the courtyard garden.  The building of the Maltese church is deservedly considered one of the best buildings of D. Quarenghi.  The interior of the temple is inherent in majestic monumentality and at the same time, simplicity of design and ideal proportions. </p><h2>  Church Description </h2><p>  The Maltese <span>chapel (St. Petersburg)</span> is a columned hall with a semicircular apse and two aisles (side, additional altar).  The interior is painted, there are a large number of elements made in sculptural and stucco technique.  Some elements of the details are lined with artificial marble, most of them are preserved today. </p><p>  The church is built in the shape of an elongated quadrangle, choirs (upper galleries) are located on both sides, a magnificent organ is installed next to them, which was moved here from the Tauride Palace.  Light enters the Maltese Chapel through semicircular windows located near the choirs and above the doors at the entrance.  Near the wall, under the half-arch, is an altar, in the upper part of which is depicted John the Baptist.  The chapel arch is skillfully painted in the style of Maltese temple painting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="interesniy-spb.livejournal.com" data-author=": vezenin, "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the chapel" class="if uuid-2596053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2596053.jpg"></div><p>  All church utensils, as well as two chandeliers, are covered with gilding and shine with a magnificent luster.  Next to the altar, under the canopy, is a red armchair upholstered in velvet, on which Paul I, who was the Master of the Order, sat. </p><h2>  Chapel in the XX-XXI century </h2><p>  After the revolution, in October 1917, the Petrograd infantry school of the Red Army, which was later transformed into an infantry school, was located in the Malta chapel of the Vorontsov Palace.  In 1955, the Suvorov School appeared here.  The chapel was used by schools as a club.  Utensils and most of the items in the temple were betrayed to the city museums. </p><p>  The chapel was repeatedly restored and repaired.  The last restoration lasted from 1986 to 1998.  In 2002, the Museum of the History of the Cadets of Russia was opened in the Maltese Chapel of Quarenghi.  Currently, the chapel is used as a concert hall, where the organ regularly plays, which has been preserved since the time of construction. </p><h2>  Concerts in the chapel </h2><p>  The chapel is known for its concerts of organ music and choral singing.  This place, due to its unique acoustics, attracts many music connoisseurs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.afisha.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Organ pipes" class="if uuid-2596047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2596047.jpg"></div><p>  Tickets for a concert in the Malta Chapel are not easy to buy, even despite their low price, which is 200-250 rubles.  Music lovers rush here to hear the organ and choir, and architecture lovers to see the beauty of this building. </p><p>  Therefore, as soon as tickets appear, they are immediately sold out.  You can get to the church territory only with a ticket, which is a pass, otherwise the protection of the Suvorov School simply will not let you through.  Children under seven accompanied by adults can attend for free. </p><p>  The Maltese chapel has become a unique center of organ music in St. Petersburg.  Here you can always hear artists giving concerts around the world.  This attracts connoisseurs of the organ. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who visited the Maltese Chapel of St. Petersburg, talk about the magnificent architecture of this building, which managed to be preserved to our time.  This church is not like any other church located in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  Those who were lucky enough to get tickets for a concert in the chapel talk about the unusual acoustics that are immediately felt by the audience inside.  The sound vibrations from the organ are so strong that you somehow feel them with your skin, the sound surrounds you from all sides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vaults of the chapel" class="if uuid-2596023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2596023.jpg"></div><p>  Connoisseurs of architecture who visited the Maltese Chapel speak of the magnificence of Quarenghi's plan, who managed to create a real masterpiece.  The temple ideally combines all the elements that are emphasized by the magnificent painting. </p><p>  Those who visited the chapel attached to the palace celebrate the beauty of the whole complex.  Its unusualness lies in the fact that the Vorontsov Palace was built by Rastrelli, and the Maltese church was rivaled by Quarenghi.  However, despite this, the whole complex as a whole turned out to be very harmonious and looks like a single architectural concept. </p><p>  Once in Northern Venice, as St. Petersburg is called, take some time to visit this beautiful building.  The magnificent architecture, wonderful paintings and the atmosphere of this place will please anyone.  After visiting this unique place you will have a lot of positive impressions that you will carry through your life. </p>
