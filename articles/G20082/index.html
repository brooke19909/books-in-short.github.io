Description of the city, history, attractions and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most famous cities in Germany is an important fair center of the country.  The huge exhibition complex is not so popular among Russian tourists, and often our compatriots, who cannot be blamed for geographical illiteracy, are interested in: "Hanover - where is it?" </p><p>  However, foreign travelers adore the original city because it honors its traditions, remembers its rich history, takes care of ancient monuments of architecture, which are not many here. </p><h2>  Some facts about the capital of Lower Saxony </h2><p>  For those who are interested in a charming village and will certainly want to visit it, it is worth telling where Hanover is and in which country.  "City on a high bank" (this is the official translation of its name) is located in the central part of Germany, between the <span>rivers Weser</span> and Laine.  Situated near the Graz Mountains, it is the capital of Lower Saxony.  Drowning in greenery, the administrative center is considered the main transport hub of the country, because it is located where railway lines intersect.  Every day 700 trains leave from here.  The local airport has connections with many cities in the world, including Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is hannover" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2050115.jpg"></div>

There are several bus routes. </p><h2>  A bit of glorious city history </h2><p>  On the territory of the modern pearl of Germany, whose population is more than 500 thousand inhabitants, the first settlements appeared even in the Paleolithic.  Later, fertile land attracted the attention of unfriendly tribes.  In the 8th century, Hanover, whose history is rich in events, is part of the Frankish Empire and, after four centuries, turns into the largest shopping center.  Being the capital of the influential Hanover kingdom, it subjugates other cities.  However, after the Austro-Prussian war, the locality loses its power and becomes the property of Prussia. </p><p>  From here Peter the Great cut a "window to Europe": this is the first city visited by the tsar who left the borders of Russia.  It was then that everyone learned about Hanover - where it is and what it is famous for. </p><p>  After the 1945 war, British troops enter Hannover, which has almost been wiped off the face of the earth, and later it joins the Federal Republic of Germany, the newly formed state. </p><h2>  Roter Faden - red tourist trail </h2><p>  Hanover - where is it?  How will he surprise his guests?  Especially for vacationers who want to independently get acquainted with the main monuments of the city, the so-called red thread stretches across all the streets.  An orientation line helps you explore the most interesting places without missing a single sight.  Tourists who go along it do not need a guide, and the entire route covers 36 main monuments of the city.  Centuries-old buildings are almost gone: more than 80% were destroyed during the war. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hannover where is it" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/2051208.jpg"></div>

The magnificent structure is very reminiscent of a beautiful palace, as if descended from the pages of children's fairy tales.  Carved bas-reliefs, symmetrical towers, a bright purple roof, a baroque dome attract the eyes of admiring tourists.  The town hall even has a talisman that protects it from misfortunes - on the facade, the national hero Til Ulenspiegel shows everyone his tongue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is hannover located in which country" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/2051212.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At an altitude of 100 meters is an observation deck, and it offers stunning views of the adjacent <span>green park.</span>  Now the walls of the town hall house the historical museum and the city administration. </p><h2>  Lutheran Church Marktkirche </h2><p>  On the territory where the city of Hanover is located, Lutheranism was the state religion for many years.  The spacious Market Square gained fame thanks to the architectural monument of the XIV century, creating its recognizable appearance.  The main Lutheran temple of Lower Saxony has important historical and cultural significance, and it is no coincidence that it appeared in a crowded square, where life has always been in full swing.  The interior of Martkirche is ascetic, as the Lutheran religion preaches restraint and simplicity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Despite its considerable age, the church has been perfectly preserved, and its high tower is recognized as the hallmark of Hannover. </p><h2>  Hannover, Germany: holidays </h2><p>  In a city where everything is pleasing to the eye and conducive to relaxation, the picturesque landscape spoiled the old swamp, and in the 30s of the last century an artificial reservoir appeared in its place.  Lake Mash, the coast of which is strewn with entertainment venues and cozy restaurants, attracts tourists eager for unity with nature.  Those who wish can ride a boat in the mirror surface of the reservoir, enjoying the landscapes.  In addition, both pedestrian and bicycle paths for fans of breathing fresh air are laid here. </p><p>  The old park, established in the 17th century, is compared by admiring guests with the majestic Versailles gardens, famous for their splendor and beauty.  The green oasis, decorated with numerous fountains, marble sculptures in the antique style, mysterious grottoes, causes great interest of foreigners.  The peaceful Herrenhausen Gardens, the territory of which is divided into several parts, is a real celebration for all lovers of beauty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the city of Hanover" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2050129.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For 17 years there has been a zoo in which more than three thousand species of animals live.  Converted to a theme park, Hanover Adventure Zoo is considered one of the most beautiful in Europe.  Divided into several zones, the attraction is visited annually by more than a million people.  Visitors will find themselves in an impenetrable jungle, virgin prairies, enjoy the uniqueness of the underwater world. </p><p>  In the territory where Hanover is located, you can see a wonderful architectural creation, made in the style of classicism.  The opera house, the facade of which is decorated with stone sculptures by German artists, poets and composers, is visited not only by an adult audience, but also by children. </p><h2>  Where else to go? </h2><p>  If the weather does not have a rest in the lap of nature, then the town offers a lot of options to spend time with benefit.  Not far from Hanover is an amazing architectural work - the old <span>castle of Marienburg.</span>  The summer royal residence, which is an example of the neo-Gothic construction of the country, was erected in the 19th century.  The pretty turrets of the historic monument rise above the valley of the Laine River. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hannover germany reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2050131.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Opposite the city hall is the Lower Saxony Museum, famous for its many exhibits.  Its ethnographic and archaeological collections, numbering about two thousand artifacts, are recognized as the richest in Germany. </p><h2>  Showroom </h2><p>  Even before the First World War, architect P. Bonatz built a central exhibition hall surrounded by a beautiful park.  The venue for important meetings and celebrations gathers millions of curious people from around the world. </p><p>  27 pavilions of the gigantic structure are located on a vast territory covering 498 km <sup>2</sup> .  When the international exhibition of the achievements of the world economy was held here, the locals built the largest wooden roof on the planet. </p><h2>  Fancy Giantess Sculptures </h2><p>  Hannover is given an unusual zest by amusing sculptures of fatties that appeared in 1974.  Once upon a time, residents of other German cities made fun of the creations of the Frenchwoman Niki de Saint-Fall, who created pieces of monumental art in the style of the avant-garde.  However, now Nanas of gigantic size and ridiculous coloring, installed on the Lane promenade, are considered symbols of a busy city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hannover germany vacation" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2050114.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What do vacationers say about the city? </h2><p>  Travel reviews of Hanover (Germany) are full of conflicting opinions.  Some believe that this is a boring and unremarkable provincial city.  Others admit that falling in love with him at first sight is quite difficult, but it is better to find out the capital of Lower Saxony, how a natural desire arises - to return here again. </p><p>  This is a very cozy village, full of special charm and energy of our time.  Good-natured residents cannot imagine their life without holidays.  Temperamental Germans gladly take part in events held in the open air, and infect foreigners with their joy. </p><p>  As tourists note, Hanover (where we already found out) is a real paradise for discerning gourmets.  More than one and a half thousand restaurants, bars and cafes offer very satisfying dishes of national cuisine, which you must definitely try. </p><p>  In addition, avid shopaholics will not remain disappointed: the city is famous for its numerous boutiques located in its very center.  From here are taken away as designer items and jewelry made of silver or gold, as well as outfits of well-known brands.  Antique lovers buy antiques at very nice prices.  It must be remembered that all stores are open until 20.00, and Sunday is declared a day off. </p><p>  The greatest number of vacationers comes here from May to September, when there is warm weather without precipitation.  It is best to book rooms in hotels and hostels in advance. </p>
