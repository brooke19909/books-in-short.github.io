    <h2>  Buryatia - the land of mountains and beauty </h2><p>  Bizarre mountains or deep pits, snow caps at the peaks and flowering greens at the foot, turbulent rivers and clean air - these unique conditions are presented to us by the hospitable Buryatia.  The climate in these parts is sharply continental: in winter it is very cold, but summer gives so much sun that you will feel like on the coast of the warm southern sea.  The stormy river Kyngarka, which boasts clear waters and unbridled waterfalls, escapes from the <span>high mountains</span> to the Tunkinskaya valley.  Here, where <span>the Sayan mountains</span> lowered their slopes, and the sanatorium "Arshan" was located. </p><p>  Generous rocks give a person unique mineral water and healthy mud, which eliminates many diseases.  Powerful pine forests surround the sanatorium, and an impenetrable taiga is very close. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is as if nature specially gathered in one place all the conditions for man, even the air here has a powerful effect on the body. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Sanatorium "Arshan" was founded almost 90 years ago.  Patients came here not only from the immediate vicinity, but also from all over Russia.  The unique mountain climate, carbonic water with different mineral contents, unique landscapes, silt sulfide mud - all these factors made the hospital absolutely unique.  The fact is that nowhere else in the country can one encounter such a symbiosis of nature and its healing gifts.  The Tunkinsky valley is located at an altitude of almost 900 m above sea level - and this fact allows vacationers to breathe the purest ionized air all year round. </p><p>  The sanatorium was often reconstructed and new rooms and laboratories were added, the last repair was carried out in 2009.  Such an event made it possible to provide better medical services to vacationers: new equipment was installed, and recreation facilities were improved. </p><p>  At present, the sanatorium is positioning itself as a mountain-climatic and <span>balneological resort,</span> which spreads over 193 hectares of virgin forests and mountain valleys. </p>

    <h2>  Holy mountains </h2><p>  The truth is said that a person who has at least once seen the mountains is imbued with a devoted and pure love for this creation of nature.  Having visited the sanatorium ‚ÄúArshan‚Äù (Irkutsk region), you can enjoy this grandiose spectacle: in winter they amaze with snowy grandeur, reminding the giants on guard of your peace, well, and in the summer a riot of herbs and flowers will not leave you indifferent.  Many doctors say that relaxing in the mountains is much more beneficial than going to sea.  After all, these natural giants give not only aesthetic pleasure, they create a special microclimate: the valley is surrounded by ridges that do not allow cold cyclones to penetrate in the summer, there is practically no drought.  And in winter, severe frosts do not cause much discomfort, since the mountain air is not too humid. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, the huge number of sunny days in this region creates an amazing effect: due to the increased level of ultraviolet radiation and clean air, deep <span>ventilation of the lungs</span> occurs <span>.</span>  And such a natural phenomenon helps to lower blood sugar, regulates blood pressure, helps the body develop immunity to viral infections. </p><p>  So do not miss the opportunity to improve your health - you will always find "Arshan" (sanatorium).  Sayan mountains are mountains that locals are proud of, because they give health and help to cure many diseases.  And unique muds with a complex mineral composition are found only in these places. </p><h2>  Accommodations </h2><p>  If you decide to relax in this resort, check out what kind of accommodation you will be offered.
