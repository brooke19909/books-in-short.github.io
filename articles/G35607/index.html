    <h2>  A few historical facts </h2><p>  For the first time, the Talov Cups (photo you can see in our article) were mentioned in 1895 in the work of A. M. Zaitsev, professor of the Department of Geology of Tomsk University.  The mineral composition of these travertine deposits was investigated and described later (1988) by V. A. Bazhenov. </p><h2>  Talov Bowls: description </h2><p>  In the <span>Tomsk region</span> there are several places where various forms of calcareous rocks come to the surface of the earth.  One of the most interesting cases of the appearance of calcareous tuff is Talovskiye Chalice.  These calcareous formations are really similar in shape to bowls.  They consist of calcareous tuff, formed by waters that reach the surface of the earth, which contain a lot of lime.  Travertine (calcareous tuff) is a porous light rock, usually light gray in color. </p><p>  At depth, groundwater is enriched in calcium carbonate.  A relatively large depth of water contains a large amount of carbon dioxide, which helps dissolve calcium carbonate.  Coming to the surface, the water largely lose carbon dioxide, and some of the water evaporates.  The concentration of calcium carbonate approaches the saturation limit, and it precipitates. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Talovskiy bowls Tomsk" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1451845.jpg" width="600"></div>

The largest of them is the Big Bowl.  This is a travertine pool about two meters wide and about three and a half meters long.  The height of its walls is about fifty centimeters.  The depth of the Chalice is about one and a half meters.  The flow channel is a little over two meters.  The thickness of the walls of the bowl increases to the base.  Water temperature +5 ¬∞ .  Old-timers in these places claim that water used to beat out a fountain from it.  Now there is no former pressure, and the water level has significantly decreased. </p>

    <p>  Local traditions (not verified) tell that they tried to transfer the Big Chalice to the church.  The remnants of the logs, which were supposedly needed in order to raise the bowl, are visible today in the water tanks.  From the Big Bowl closer to the stream there were two more cones.  Now in their place you can see the rounded recesses located in the valley of the stream. </p><h2>  Small bowl </h2><p>  The Small Bowl is very beautiful.  This is a small spring with a long travertine trough.  Its diameter is just over a meter.  There are three more vessels of smaller sizes.  Interestingly, despite the fact that the Talov Cups were described at the end of the 19th century, the locals discovered them about 50 years ago.  An archaeological group was sent immediately <span>to Tomsk</span> .  For a week, specialists studied the composition of the bowls, examined the water and solved the mystery of the appearance of unique structures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  I must say that there is still no exact answer regarding their appearance.  But there are two possible versions.  Some researchers believe that the Talov Bowls (Tomsk) are artificial, while others claim that these are the Grail bowls that came to us from myths, and their age is several million years.  Evidence in favor of a particular version does not exist - only assumptions and conjectures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="talovskie bowls tomsk how to get there by car" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1451843.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The famous <span>landmark of the Tomsk region</span> is located in the forest, in a clearing of about 300 square meters.  All Chalices have a mouth where excess water flows from.  At the same time, at the Little Bowl, water continues to flow along the limestone shaft for another ten meters.  The water is magnesian-calcium, slightly mineralized. </p><p>  In winter, it does not freeze and flows, forming streams on the ground and underground.  If the Bowl jumps, then after a couple of moments you can see bubbles of carbon dioxide, which will begin to rise to the surface.  And of course, you should try the water - it is very tasty, especially in the summer heat.  It is popularly believed that the Talov Cups are filled with healing water, which helps with diseases of the skin and eyes, and diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. </p><h2>  How do the Chalices grow? </h2><p>  Water constantly pours over the edge of the vessels and thus creates more and more layers of salt.  In addition, the process of metasomatic substitution of moss is actively undergoing, which affects the growth of travertine bowls.  This is a kind of symbiosis of bernnessite (manganese mineral) with moss and <span>calcium bicarbonate.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Talov bowl photo" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1451842.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Legends </h2><p>  Talov's Chalice is fanned with numerous legends.  The most common of these is that it is a prototype of the Holy Grail.  Traditions about him came to this land from Western Europe. </p><p>  The legendary Holy Grail was a cup in which the blood of Christ was located, in connection with which it acquired miraculous properties.  The owner of such a vessel predicted the future, could influence human destinies, and accomplish great, but certainly good deeds. </p><p>  As follows from this legend, the Goths, who wandered from Europe to the eastern regions of Siberia, brought a prototype of the holy cup and secured it on the local lands.  Then the Goths moved west, leaving the tales of the famous chalice.  Since ancient times, it is believed that the Grail was safely hidden in the vastness of Siberia.  The same legend confirms that on the banks of the Ob, in the territory of present Tomsk, there was also the kingdom of John. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Talov bowls in the Tomsk region" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1451838.jpg" width="563"></div>

    <p>  Regardless of whether this story is true or not, the Talov Cups are magnificent: large oval-shaped vessels, inside coated with a rare mineral - Bernessite.  <span>An interesting legend,</span> as well as the beauty of this natural object, its originality became the reason that the Talov Cups were included in the list of Tomsk Miracles. </p><p>  The small area where the limestone vessels are located has become very popular among tourists.  It is not difficult to get here both in winter and in summer.  Talov Bowls are part of a complex ecosystem that is fairly easy to break.  Therefore, I would like to encourage all visitors to this place to remember this.  Abandoned garbage, places from fires, muddy water in vessels and trampled grass - this is often how this unique place looks after visiting some tourists. </p><h2>  Visiting Rules </h2><p>  This place has always been of interest to tourists.  For this reason, until recently, the area around it was in very poor condition.  But more recently, the staff of protected areas completely cleared the territories and now they are very strictly monitoring the order.  Before entering the conservation area is a shield that lists the simplest rules that should be followed when visiting it.  Of course, if you want your children and grandchildren to be able to see this natural attraction after you: extinguish bonfires, do not leave trash behind, do not break or destroy green spaces, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Talov bowls in the Tomsk region" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1451839.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Talovskiy Chalice (Tomsk): how to get? </h2><p>  A popular attraction of the city is located near the village of Basandayki <span>(Tomsk region).</span>  And he, in turn, is removed 45 km from Tomsk.  To get to the village, you need to use the train, which runs from the train station in the morning and evening. </p><p>  In addition, the village of Basandayki can be reached by bicycle or ski (depending on the season) or walk on foot if the weather permits.  The distance from the platform ‚ÄúSite 41 km‚Äù is not more than 3.5 kilometers. </p><h2>  Car ride </h2><p>  Surely, motorists will also want to visit the Talov Bowls (Tomsk).  How to get there by car?  It‚Äôs not difficult at all.  A good asphalt road has been laid from Stepanovka to Mezheninovka.  Upon reaching the village of Mezheninovka, turn right before the sign onto the gravel road and follow it for another four kilometers. </p><p>  On the right through the aspen grove you will see the railway platform you need.  It‚Äôs easy to find a trampled meadow where you can leave your car.  Then you should go up to the stop, cross the railway track and walk along the embankment in the direction opposite to the city.  At the milestone with the inscription "41 km" we turn right, into the forest.  After about ten meters, you will exit onto a road ridden by ATVs.  Go forward 3.5 km along her track. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tal bowls description" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1451840.jpg" width="600"></div>
