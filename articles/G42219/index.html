    <p>  If you plan to travel by car to Prague from Moscow, then, first of all, you need to contact the Czech Embassy <em> </em>  for a Schengen visa.  Another option is to visit a visa issuing center.  In order for the Czechs to be calm that you will not be left in the country without a roof over their heads, they will certainly require you to receive fax confirmation that the room in any of the hotels has been booked.  By the way, confirmation by e-mail will not suit them, so book a room in advance and wait for confirmation of the operation from there.  To do this is quite simple on any of the sites, then contact the hotel and discuss the timing of receiving a fax.  It will also require statements from your accounts.  You must prove your solvency, at least 50 euros should go out per person per day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To overcome the route Moscow - Prague by car, the following documents are also required: </p><ul><li>  Passport </li><li>  Technical passport for the vehicle. </li><li>  Rights (driver's license) - better, of course, international. </li><li>  The issued green card. </li><li>  Car insurance. </li><li>  Insurance for all passengers, covering at least 30 thousand euros for each. </li></ul><h2>  Car preparation </h2><p>  Before starting the trip Moscow - Prague by car, you must take care of the technical condition of your vehicle.  Go through the <span>running gear diagnostics</span> , electricians, and retool your car seasonally.  Check the expiration dates of all drugs in the medicine cabinet for a fire extinguisher.  The presence of emergency stop signs, tow rope is mandatory, repair kits, additional splitter cords may be needed.  The spare tire must be in good condition.

    <h2>  Route selection </h2><p>  Know that by choosing the route Moscow - Prague, the distance by car in any case will have to be covered through Belarus and Poland.  Many when preparing the route use the Google maps service.  After the start and end points are entered into the route selection, and this is Moscow - Prague, the service will offer you several routes to choose from.  How long does it take to get from Moscow to Prague by car?  If you do not stop to rest in Poland, then you can overcome the path in about a day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, there are two ways to choose: </p><ul><li>  <em>Moscow - Brest - Warsaw - Wroclaw - Prague.</em>  This route is about 1950 kilometers, but in fact it takes longer to get there, since the road is laid through many settlements where speed is allowed within 50 km / h, and even less along the mountain section. </li><li>  <em>Moscow - Brest - Warsaw - Katowice - Brno - Prague.</em>  If you decide to get on this route, then the only minus is you will not admire the beauty of the mountain scenery.  In general, this road is longer, the distance will be two thousand kilometers.  But on the other hand, you can drive along the entire route at an average speed of 100 km / h, and on an ideal <span>expressway.</span>  Many sections of the road here are paid. </li></ul><p>  So, before deciding on a route, study what cities you will travel through, what interesting places you can see, where to relax and eat. </p>

About 600 km to move around the territory of the republic, by the evening you will find yourself in Brest.  It is better to stay overnight, and in the morning already cross the border with Poland.  From here to her five minutes go. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Before crossing the Polish border, an <span>environmental fee</span> must be paid <span>.</span>  Moving is carried out either at the Brest - Terespol point, or to the south, in Domachevo.

    <h2>  Travel in Poland </h2><p>  The path from the Polish border to Prague will be no more than three hundred kilometers.  It is necessary to purchase a vignette, it gives the right to move freely on local freeways.  You will not see any border post anymore, only signs will inform you that you are already in the Czech Republic.  Driving through Poland, do not miss the opportunity to visit local attractions, because this country is considered one of the most beautiful in Europe.  When planning a trip Moscow - Prague by car, include Warsaw in the route.  A hotel room can be booked in advance via the Internet.  Highlight the day and visit the most interesting places here. </p><h2>  Sights of Warsaw </h2><p>  Warsaw has been the capital of Poland since 1596.  Many people compare the city with the Phoenix bird, because after the defeat by the Nazis there was practically nothing valuable left.  But the efforts of the people on the surviving drawings, fragments, drawings were restored the main historical architectural monuments.  Now Warsaw is one of the ten most beautiful European cities. </p><p>  The Old Town is considered a historical place here - locals call it Stare Miasto.  Each house has its own pedigree.  On Castle Square, you can take a unique photo at the column of <span>Sigismund III.</span>  This king ruled the country for 44 years.  In the cathedral of St. John, all coronations took place.  The royal castle was restored until 1970, even today, art historians are buying up the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat were removed from it during the war.  Nove Miasto, located to the north, represents a whole string of palaces that compete in beauty.  In the Cracow Suburb, which connects the Center and Stara Mesto, the Presidential Palace is located.  It has been operating since the seventeenth century.  Nearby you can admire the Church of St. Anne, the Basilica of the Holy Cross. </p>

    <h2>  Czech </h2><p>  We return to the route Moscow - Prague.  The distance by car from Warsaw can be overcome in just a few hours.  The fact that you are already in the Czech Republic, in Prague, you will learn only by reading the signs.  Czech is spoken in the country; young people speak English well.  The quality of roads here is different, there are places with perfect coverage, and there are emergency ones.  Do not forget to purchase a vignette, the fare on the highways here is paid.  The vignette must be correctly attached to the windshield, otherwise you can get a fine.  At gas stations, you can quickly pay by card, only after you filled in gasoline. </p><h2>  Parking </h2><p>  So, from Moscow to Prague, we have covered all the kilometers by car, we ended up in the city.  How are things with parking here?  Parking spaces are quite expensive, but breaking them will be even more expensive.  Cost per place varies by zone.  There are several, they differ in color.  The blue zone is specially for residents, the green is 6 hours, the orange is 2 hours.  We saw a parking sign and a white line - next to the parking meter.  Carefully read the parking conditions, very often it is free.  It‚Äôs much more difficult to park in the center, so many people choose places near hotels or shopping centers.  If you come to Prague for a long time, it is better to leave the car in the P + R parking lot and get around by public transport. </p>
