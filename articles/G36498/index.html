  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ten of the most high-profile information leaks associated with the release of new Apple products</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Apple is a company known for its atmosphere of total secrecy, in which work on each of its products takes place, and carefully planned "leaks" during which it becomes known about the new properties of its products.  In anticipation of the release of the new generation of iPhone, the SearchInform analytic center, which develops data leak protection tools, has prepared a selection of the most striking leaks related to Apple in the history of the apple corporation. </p><ol><li>  The leak of design and technical characteristics of the stylish G4 Cube mouse back in 2000 made the most noise.  It is not surprising, this is the first time in the history of the company.  Actually, the lawyers worked out well.  The employees responsible for the leak paid for their carelessness with jobs. </li><li>  Apparently, the ‚Äúdebriefing‚Äù in 2000 had the necessary impact on the team, since the next Apple leak occurred only in 2003.  Then the network got data on the Power Mac G5.  And the original source was the company‚Äôs website www.apple.com.  Then the time until the release of the new laptop was only 10 days.  Although, perhaps this was just the beginning of the use of deliberate "leaks" by the marketing department of the company. </li><li>  In July 2007, information about the creation of an aluminum keyboard for the iMac got on the network, although the novelty appeared on sale only in August of that year.  Then the forum‚Äôs source was announced the source of a leak on one of the Chinese online stores, which allegedly posted photos of factory workers where they collected keyboards. </li><li>  2 months before its official release in 2008, images and specifications of the iPhone 3G appeared on the network. Initially, the company called the incident ‚Äúfake‚Äù.  However, it soon became clear that the leak really had a place to be.  The only thing that is not clear is where the 3D sensor came from.  It‚Äôs just in the standard configuration of the iPhone 3G is not provided.  All other information, however, was confirmed by the affected party. </li><li>  In October of the same 2008, Apple made another mistake in its strict regime of secrecy (or, again, <span>the marketing department</span> worked <span>wonderfully).</span>  This time, the public became information about the new MacBook Pro Unibody laptop.  The leak occurred three months before the device went on sale (a curious pattern, right?).  And this is an absolute record for such a technique.  However, in this situation, the company, as they say, escaped with a slight startle.  Technical specifications and other important information were kept secret. </li><li>  In the same long-suffering year of 2008, in the month of January, a new iPhoneOS 1.1.3 firmware was published in the public domain.  Actually, Steve Jobs himself was already very pleased with the advanced development and often mentioned it in an interview.  However, looking at the previous list of ‚Äúleaks‚Äù, you are not surprised that three weeks before the release, someone ‚Äúhijacked‚Äù a new development of the company. </li><li>  In 2010, another significant leak of "apple" information occurred.  This time, users of the global web have learned what the iPhone 4S looks like.  The technical characteristics and design of the new product was put on public display 10 months before the appearance of new phones on sale.  Then, over the course of the year, photographs of the front panel, A5 chip, and even a new assembled telephone ‚Äúmerged‚Äù on the Internet.  The apogee of marketing efforts was the case when Apple employees accidentally posted the name of a new device (iPhone 4S) in the latest test version of iTunes.  And all this, of course, shortly before the device itself was released. </li><li>  2011 was also fruitful in terms of leaks.  Then from Apple twice "floated" information about the iPhone 5. How was it.  First, the Internet got a picture of the front panel of a new gadget.  Actually, the incident did not cause any commotion.  Since the pictures were not clear, and they appeared under a rather amusing rumor about the release of the budget version.  However, already next week the network ‚Äúblew up‚Äù a more interesting shot.  A good quality photo depicts a motherboard with the A7 chipset.  Along with this, comprehensive technical characteristics of the device were published. </li><li>  In 2012, the evening before the premiere of the iPad, pictures and technical specifications of the new product appeared on the network.  The source was called the resource http://www.engadget.com/.  Of course, despite the "leak", the presentation was successful, and the very next day a new gadget could be purchased. </li><li>  And finally, the latest news.  Most recently, information appeared on the network about the release dates of the iPad Pro (aka iPad Plus).  Along with this, photos of the long-awaited new items hit the Internet.  The assurance of anonymous "well-wishers" release will take place in November this year.  And the release of the iPad Air 3 - no later than 2016. </li></ol><p>  At the end of such a collection, in theory, there should be a conclusion that all these information leaks have nothing to do with, for example, what users of Ashley Madison experienced, and are more likely connected with the efforts of PR specialists and marketers.  This conclusion, of course, suggests itself, because all these leaks not only did no harm to Apple, but, on the contrary, fueled the public‚Äôs interest in its devices.  But it‚Äôs hard to say anything for sure in the case of a company with millions of loyal fans waiting for each new product release with bated breath.  Journalists and fans of the "apple" are interested in these leaks no less than the corporation itself, and we all know that if the stars in the sky light up, then someone needs it. </p></div></article>
