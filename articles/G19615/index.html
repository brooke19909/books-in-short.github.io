    <p>  The years 1917-1921 were the most difficult period in the history of our country.  Bloody wars with many warring parties and the most difficult geopolitical situation made them such. </p><p>  <strong><span>The policy of war</span> communism: briefly on the situation of the CPSU (b)</strong> </p><p>  During this difficult time, many contenders fought for every piece of its lands in various parts of the former empire.  German army  local national forces trying to create their own states on the shards of the empire (for example, the formation of the UPR);  local popular associations commanded by regional authorities;  Poles who invaded Ukrainian territories in 1919;  White Guard counter-revolutionaries;  Allied last formations of the Entente;  and finally, the Bolshevik units.  Under these conditions, the complete concentration of forces and the mobilization of all available resources for the military defeat of all opponents was an absolutely necessary guarantee of victory.  Actually, this mobilization on the part of the Communists was military communism, carried out by the leadership of the CPSU (B.) From the first months of 1918 to March 1921. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Politics of <span>War Communism:</span> Briefly on the Essence of the Regime</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="civil war briefly" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/215817.jpg" width="309"></div>

    <p>  In the course of its implementation, the aforementioned policy caused a lot of conflicting assessments.  Its main points were the following measures: </p><p>  - nationalization of the whole complex of industry and the banking system of the country; </p><p>  - state monopolization of foreign trade; </p><p>  - forced labor service of the entire population capable of working; </p><p>  - food dictatorship.  It was this point that became the most hated for the peasants, since part of the grain was forcibly confiscated in favor of the soldiers and the starving city.  The <span>food</span> surplus is still often exhibited as an example of the atrocities of the Bolsheviks, but it should be noted that with its help the <span>food problems of</span> workers in the cities were substantially smoothed out. </p><p>  <strong>The policy of war communism: briefly on the reaction of the population</strong> </p><p>  Frankly, military communism was a forceful way of forcing the masses to increase the intensity of work to win the Bolsheviks.  As already mentioned, the bulk of the discontent of Russia - the peasant country at that time - was caused by the surplus appraisal.  However, in fairness, it must be said that the White Guards used the same technique.  It logically flowed from the state of affairs in the country, since the First World War and the Civil War completely destroyed the traditional trade links between the village and the city.  This led to the deplorable state of many industrial enterprises.  At the same time, there was dissatisfaction with the policies of war communism in the cities.  Here, instead of the expected increase in labor productivity and economic recovery, on the contrary, there was a weakening of discipline in enterprises.  The replacement of old cadres with new ones (who were communists, but far from always qualified managers) led to a noticeable decline in industry and a decline in economic indicators. </p>

    <p>  Despite all the difficulties, the policy of war communism nevertheless fulfilled its role.  Although not always successful, the Bolsheviks were able to gather all their forces against counter-revolution and survive in the battles.  At the same time, it provoked popular uprisings and seriously undermined the authority of the CPSU (B.) Among the peasantry.  The last such mass rally was the Kronstadt event, which occurred in the spring of 1921.  As a result, Lenin initiated the transition to the so-called <span>New Economic Policy.</span>  <span>The NEP of</span> 1921 helped to restore the national economy as soon as possible. </p>
