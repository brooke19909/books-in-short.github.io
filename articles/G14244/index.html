Yes, if you are still planning a trip to visit or, on the contrary, a visit of guests, then you can not do without the distribution of gifts.  And if in the script of the <span>New Year's party</span> any contests or even a <span>win-win lottery</span> are included <span>,</span> then here it is worth thinking seriously. </p><p>  And the ability to make cute trinkets with our own hands comes to our aid.  For example, using the skill of beadwork, we can create so many beautiful little things! </p><p>  How to make a snowman out of beads will be described below.  A snowman made of beads can be of two types: simple, which can be used as a pendant or Christmas tree toy, or voluminous, which can be set under a Christmas tree, on a windowsill or chest of drawers.  Consider the manufacturing options for both types of snowmen. <br><strong></strong></p><p>  <strong>Snowman made of beads.</strong> </p><p>  Plain <strong> </strong>  a snowman made of beads is very simple.  Here we will use one of the most common weaving techniques.  In fact, it will be a little transformed bead weaving.  For this craft we will need: white beads, red (for a smile), black (for eyes and buttons), brown (for twigs) and wire. </p><p>  Let's get to work.  We put white beads on the wire.  This will be the first row.  After that we put on the beads of the second row (there will be two more of them) and pass the wire through them with the ends facing each other, as is done when we weave from beads.  In this technique we weave the whole snowman, changing only the number of beads in the rows.  Also, replacing white beads with colored ones, we weave out buttons, eyes, mouth and nose. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We will give you an approximate description of the rows according to the number of beads in each (weave a snowman from bottom to top): <br>  1 row: 9 white beads; <br>  2 row: 11 white beads; <br>  3 row: 13 beads, 12 white and central black (button); <br>  4 row: 15 white beads; <br>  5th row: 15 beads, 14 white and 1 central - black; <br>  6 row: 15 white beads; <br>  7th row: 15 beads, 14 white and 1 central - black; <br>  8 row: 13 white beads; <br>  9 row: 11 white beads; <br>  10 row: 9 beads, 6 white, 3 central red; <br>  11 row: 11 white beads; <br>  12 row: 11 beads, 9 white and every fourth red (get 2 beads); <br>  13 row: 11 beads, 9 white and 2 black (we place them over the corners of a smile); <br>  14 row: 9 white beads; <br>  15 row: 7 white beads. </p><p>  From brown beads and wire we make hand branches and fix separately.  If you follow these instructions, then you will get a wonderful snowman made of beads, the implementation of which took no more than half an hour. <br><br>  <strong>Volumetric snowman made of beads</strong> <br><br>  A voluminous snowman made of beads is made a little more complicated than a simple one.  We also need a fishing line or wire, white, red and black beads.  Let's start with the manufacture of the frame, outwardly it will resemble two strips intersecting each other, each of which is performed in the same technique as an ordinary snowman made of beads.  The stripes will consist of two beads.  As a result, we will have to get a cross with four central beads, from which three rays of 9 pairs of dialed beads and one ray consisting of 11 pairs diverge.  The ends of the rays must be weaved together.  Thus, we get a frame for the bottom ball of the toy.  Then, fixing the fishing line at the bottom of the frame, we fill the voids between the interwoven rays, moving in a circle and stringing the right amount of beads, to form a fully braided ball. </p><p>  In order to keep the snowman in shape, you can put foam rubber or a ball of the appropriate size inside.  We weave the head in exactly the same way, only we make it of smaller diameter and make mouth and eyes from colored beads, and on the base ball we need to make buttons from beads of a different color.  You can make a snowman hands - twigs, as with a regular snowman weaving.  And you can even weave him a broom, hat or bucket on his head. </p><p>  Making frame strips larger or smaller, you vary the size of the toy.  Also, the size may be affected by the size of the selected beads.  It all depends on your imagination!  The voluminous snowman will serve not only as a wonderful <span>Christmas decoration</span> for your home, but also as a wonderful toy for your child. </p>
