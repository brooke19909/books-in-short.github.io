Numerous tourists visit the islands every year in search of relaxation in a tropical paradise.  Indeed, the brochures of travel agencies promise the opportunity not only to soak up the warm sun, but also to have fun. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Where are the islands of Similan?  They are scattered in the Andaman Sea, only 70 kilometers from the province of Phang Nga, which they are part of.  In translation, the name of the archipelago means nothing other than "nine" (by the number of islands). </p><h2>  What is similan? </h2><p>  Similan - islands in Thailand, which are a national park.  In total, there are nine islands, which in 1982 were declared a national treasure.  Amazingly beautiful places are among the top ten in the world.  The islands are known as an ideal place for diving.  A diverse underwater world, palm groves, jungle, impeccable beaches and clear sea - all this is Similan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="similan-islands.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="similan island where is" class="if uuid-3044427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3044427.jpg"></div><p>  You can visit the islands during the dry season, which lasts from October to May.  I must say that the islands are uninhabited.  In season, numerous tourists come to them during excursions.  The rest of the time, the region is completely deserted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  I must say that on the Similan Islands there are no hotels, airports, land transport and other infrastructure elements.  Therefore, it‚Äôs simply pointless to look for apartment reservation options on the maps.  And ferries do not go to the islands either.  You will be surprised, but there is not even a single pier.  Access to the islands is possible only by tourist boats.  By the way, travelers are allowed to visit only two of them.  Near others, you can only swim, dive and enjoy nature. </p><p>  All Similan islands have their own name and serial number.  So, island No. 8 is Similan, No. 4 is Miang, No. 6 is Nok.  However, local residents call them simply by numbers.  You can visit only islands 4 and 8. </p><p>  The granite islands of Similan are of volcanic origin, in this they are similar to the Seychelles.  They are covered with lush vegetation and beautiful white sands off the coast.  From the living creatures on the islands there are large crabs and bats, which are called flying foxes, hermit crabs. </p><h2>  How to get to the islands? </h2><p>  As we mentioned earlier, you can get to the Similan Islands in Thailand only during the dry season.  The national park is open for visiting only at this time - from October 16 to May 15. </p><p>  The easiest way to get to the Similan Islands from Phuket, acquiring a guided tour.  The cost of a one-day excursion to Similan from Phuket is approximately $ 70 (from 4,700 rubles) for adults, and for children - $ 54 (from 3,600 rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="similan-islands.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Similan island in Thailand photo" class="if uuid-3044422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3044422.jpg"></div><p>  To get there, you need to overcome 53 kilometers to the port of Khao Lak, after which you will rush for another hour to the Similans by speed boat.  Please note that the trip is not long, and the boat is very shaking.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to prepare in advance and take a tablet from pitching. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can get to Similan island yourself.  To do this, you need to get to Khao Lak by taxi or bus, and then go to the main port - Taplam.  It is from him that boats go to the National Park.  The first comes out at 8:30.  By the way, the boat belongs to the park, it can deliver you to islands 4 and 8. The fare on both sides is more than five thousand rubles.  As you can see, it‚Äôs easier to go on a trip as a group, since it is much more convenient, and the cost is no different.  So why complicate your life? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nationmultimedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Similan island in Thailand photo" class="if uuid-3044405" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3044405.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, many of us usually prefer independent trips.  But in this case, a group tour is the most convenient option.  The cost of the tour includes a transfer to the islands, as well as an interesting travel program for the most beautiful beaches and picturesque bays: </p><ol><li>  Transfer from the hotel to Khao Lak and back. </li><li>  Excursion to three islands with stops during which you can swim in the sea and dive. </li><li>  Lunch with refreshing drinks. </li></ol><h2>  Where to live? </h2><p>  Spending the night on the Similan Islands (Thailand) has been banned since 2018.  Alternatively, you can go overnight for 2-3 days to Surin.  You can come to the island for one day.  However, you can not hope for comfortable rooms in Surin.  Living conditions are close to Spartan.  It offers tents and bungalows.  There are no hotels on the Similans in the usual sense for us.  And yet here you can find rooms with air conditioning and fans.  The bungalow even has electricity, a shower and a toilet.  And for those living in tents, only a shared shower with fresh water is available. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.nationmultimedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Similan Islands photo" class="if uuid-3044402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3044402.jpg"></div><p>  On islands No. 4 and 8 there are several cafes with a meager selection of dishes.  If you don‚Äôt risk eating a local lunch, bring some food with you. </p><h2>  Travel preparation </h2><p>  What you need to take with you to the Similan Islands, photos of which are given in the article?  Experienced travelers recommend taking: </p><ol><li>  Towels and swimsuit. </li><li>  Waterproof sunblock. </li><li>  Sunglasses. </li><li>  Headdress. </li><li>  Remedy for mosquitoes (insects in the shade bite even in the afternoon). </li><li>  Pills for motion sickness. </li></ol><p>  Since the Similans (Thailand) are of interest from the point of view of scuba diving, it does not hurt to bring a snorkel, flippers and mask with you if you want to enjoy the beauty of the underwater world.  If you do not have your own equipment, then you can rent it in Khao Lak.  For those guests who do not know how to swim, swimming vests are provided on boats. </p><p>  The Similan Islands in Thailand (see photo in the review) have a very bright sun, so there is a very high risk of serious burns.  Unfortunately, having sunscreen alone is not enough.  Protective clothing should be taken into account.  Experienced tourists strongly recommend having a few light natural shirts or T-shirts with long sleeves.  One of them is useful for walking along the shore and for a trip in a boat, and the second must be worn for swimming.  This will protect you from sunburn.  Do not be fooled if the sun hides behind the clouds.  This does not mean that you are safe.  In cloudy weather, the likelihood of burns is even higher as people lose their vigilance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourradar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Similans Thailand" class="if uuid-3044436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3044436.jpg"></div><p>  When leaving the boat ashore, be sure to grab your shoes with you.  The journey to the observation deck will take place along paths dotted with stones and branches.  Of course, on the islands it is forbidden to walk in shoes, but no one monitors the implementation of the rules in tropical thickets. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  The most interesting for tourists are the beaches.  Indeed, for their sake, they come not only to Thailand, but also to the Similans.  The most famous of them is the Dopald Duck beach on Koh Similan (island No. 8).  Two beaches on the island of Koh Miang are no less attractive. </p><p>  The beautiful coast on island No. 1, it is considered the longest on the archipelago.  However, for tourists, access is closed because large sea turtles nest on the beach.  The coast is closed for environmental reasons. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Similan Islands from Phuket are not so far.  However, the weather conditions on them are significantly different for the better.  The weather on the islands is more sunny than on the mainland.  A similar phenomenon is connected with the fact that ascending air currents over land masses lead to the formation of clouds, which often hide the sun over resorts. </p><p>  But above the Similans such clouds do not form, because the islands have too little area. </p><p>  If you see bright brochures that depict islands - these are not at all the wonders of Photoshop.  The sun on the Similans is incredibly bright and dazzling.  The weather on the islands is always beautiful.  By the way, the islands of Surin and Tachai can also boast a bright sun.  The best time to visit the region is a dry season. </p><h2>  Diving and snorkeling </h2><p>  Any excursion to the Similans includes several stops for snorkeling.  Organizers usually provide all inventory.  If you are more interested in diving, then all the conditions for this are created on the islands.  The diving centers in Khao Lak and Phuket are incredible, so you can use the services of any of them.  According to tourists, there are much more diving schools in resorts than vacationers themselves.  Even if you settle somewhere on the outskirts of the resort, finding a diving center is not difficult.  Any of them organizes trips for diving anywhere in the Andaman Sea. </p><p>  To dive, you will need the appropriate certificate and money.  As you know, diving is not an expensive pleasure.  There are a lot of Russian diving centers in Thailand.  If your English is far from ideal, then acquiring a tour with compatriots is not difficult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelweekly-asia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Similan Island Thailand" class="if uuid-3044395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3044395.jpg"></div><p>  The cost of diving tours to the Similan Islands ranges from 4,500-5,000 baht (9-10 thousand rubles).  If you want to devote several days to diving, then you will have to pay such a price for each of them.  Experienced travelers find it worth a few days to go to Similan.  The fact is that there are at least a dozen dive points in the islands.  All of them are very different and worthy of close attention of travelers.  A multi-day trip will allow you to admire Similanmi at sunrise and sunset, this amazing sight is a must see with your own eyes. </p><h2>  Turtles </h2><p>  Large turtles, reaching a meter in length, live in southern Thailand, including the Similan Islands.  Many people believe that these creatures are very slow.  But actually it is not.  Sea turtles swim very well, and they behave in the water very gracefully. </p><p>  The phlegmatic nature of turtles is more prejudice than truth.  Animals are confident in their armor, and therefore can allow themselves to behave slowly in the presence of man.  Turtles are very curious and playful.  They really like bananas.  Therefore, you will have the opportunity to feed a large animal with it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="snorkelingthailand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Similan Island in Thailand" class="if uuid-3044391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3044391.jpg"></div><p>  The weight of turtles reaches 50 kilograms, which is far from the limit.  Adults weigh 60-80 kg.  The largest animals reach a length of a meter, and weigh up to 100 kg.  The likelihood of meeting turtles on the Similans is quite high, because they are given island No. 1. </p><h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  The islands are known not only for their rich underwater world.  They are also inhabited by 16 species of bats and flying foxes.  Of the feathered on the Similans you can find Nicobar pigeons and fruit pigeons.  In total, more than 39 species of birds live on the islands. </p><h2>  Co similan </h2><p>  The island of Koh Similan is the largest on the territory of the archipelago.  It was he who gave the name to the entire island group.  The dimensions of Co Similan reach a length of 1.4 kilometers and a width of 4.3 kilometers.  The island is the most visited of all in the archipelago.  It houses a campsite for tourists.  In addition to beautiful beaches, Ko Similan has picturesque cliffs.  The rock "Seil Rock" is a symbol of Similan. </p><h2>  Other islands of the archipelago </h2><p>  Koh Miang Island is another inhabited island of the archipelago.  Its main attraction is a beautiful beach.  The island also has a jungle trail.  You can spend the night and dine on it. </p><p>  Island No. 1 is the southernmost point of the archipelago.  It is famous not only for the longest beach, but also for the diving points located around it.  Access to the island itself is closed. </p><p>  One of the islands of the archipelago is a rock, a significant part of which is under water.  But the surface part is very similar to the head of an elephant.  The rock is considered the best dive point of the archipelago, because it is here that you can meet large underwater inhabitants. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists vacationing in Thailand are wondering what is best to visit: Surin Island or Similan?  Experienced travelers recommend choosing the Similans.  The archipelago is interesting in terms of beautiful beaches and diving.  The underwater world off the coast of the islands is very beautiful and interesting.  Here you can see rare inhabitants and real corals.  The real luck is meeting with sea turtles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.phuket101.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Surin Island or Similan" class="if uuid-3044432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3044432.jpg"></div><p>  To complete the experience, it is best to go to the islands for a few days.  This will allow you to admire the natural beauties not during the influx of tourists.  Accommodation on the islands is possible in wooden bungalows or in tents.  Local rooms cannot boast the same comfort as apartments in hotels on the mainland.  However, this does not interfere with a great time in the lap of nature.  Experienced travelers recommend refraining from visiting the islands with small children.  The fact is that the road to them by boat is not so close.  Even adults along the way often get sick.  Well, it can be difficult for children.  In addition, very bright sunlight can adversely affect the delicate skin of babies.  And the abundance of insects does not contribute to rest with the kids. </p>
