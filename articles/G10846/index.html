    <h2>  Hurghada </h2><p>  Why come here, despite the not-so-calm political situation?  Because sandy beaches and picturesque landscapes, tourists who love sea vacations, will never be exchanged for anything.  Hotels of Egypt (5 stars, Hurghada) - the first line or the second - all are located in the resort safe zone.  Of course, provided that tourists observe safety precautions, they behave correctly and do not <span>climb into trouble.</span> </p><p>  What is interesting to see here?  Firstly, the wonderful <span>Karnak Temple</span> and the Monastery of St. Anthony.  It will also be interesting to learn that granite was once mined on Mount Mons Claudianus.  In the Christian temple, you can order the service any day.  If your children accompany you on a trip, then take them on an excursion to the large aquarium of Hurghada - the delight of little visitors will not be described! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The coastal area pleases with its calm entrance to the sea, therefore it is safe to have children here.  Artists from Europe often come to the city with concerts and performances, so tourists have the opportunity to enjoy such entertainment along with diving, relaxing on the beach, shopping and excursions.  This city lives off tourists, and Egyptian 5 star hotels will offer you maximum comfort.  Hurghada, the first line of which is completely built up, is very hospitable at any time of the year! </p><h2>  Hotel Stay </h2><p>  Some tourists, especially those who are not coming to Egypt for the first time, practice renting private housing.  But this is fraught with certain risks, ranging from the degree of personal security in the private sector, obtaining medical care, ending with the quality of drinking water and other possible domestic problems (including with neighbors).  The vast majority of guests who come to sea vacations prefer hotel accommodation.  The five-star hotel category is characterized by increased comfort not only in terms of entertainment and various types of activities for tourists, but also in the excellent cuisine offered by highly qualified chefs, as well as a high level of comfort and service in rooms and throughout the hotel.  The best rating criteria that 5-star hotels in Hurghada receive (first line) are guest reviews at any time of the year, and not only in those seasons when there are few visitors, and staff can calmly breathe, give customers the necessary attention and provide them with comfort top level. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  What are the remarkable 5 * hotels of Hurghada?  Stars, the first line does not yet mean that the hotel is elite, and starry sometimes does not at all correspond to the quality of service and level of comfort.  Dau is an expensive hotel with truly luxurious service and an individual approach to each client.  According to the majority of tourists who visited it, Dow Beach is one of the best hotel complexes in Hurghada.  Five restaurants, one of which is located by the pool and one on the beach, offer a variety of Mediterranean, Oriental and Italian dishes. </p><h2>  Hilton Plaza Hotel </h2><p>  Many <span>hotels in Egypt (5</span> stars, Hurghada) - the first line or a little distance from the sea - amaze their tourists with their appearance.  Each hotel attracts attention in its own way, and, as they say, is greeted by clothes.  From a distance, the Hilton Plaza Hotel looks like a huge liner, striking with its dazzling snow-white performance.  The chic appearance meets the expectations of the guests - fully equipped rooms, the interior decoration of which in sandy shades also leaves no chance for guests to claim.  The beach has a gentle slope, so it will be convenient for everyone - for the elderly, children and surfers!  The hotel has nine restaurants and bars. </p><h2>  Hilton Hurgada Resort </h2><p>  Hilton Hurghada Resort worthily occupies a place of honor in the galaxy formed by the hotels.  Hurghada, the first coastline, 5 * (stars are still not in vain awarded), has this type of hotel in which every little thing should be thought out and the best conditions for tourists to relax.  A picturesque place, territory, room decoration - everything suggests that guests, once having arrived at the Hilton Hurghada Resort, should not even think about settling down somewhere else on their next visit to Egypt.  The hotel complex offers all kinds of entertainment for guests, from spa treatments to sports events, as well as various <span>entertainment programs for children.</span>  All rooms have European interiors with oriental motifs. </p>

    <h2>  Continental resort </h2><p>  Continental Resort offers all the amenities available to the best hotels.  Hurghada, the first coastline, 5 * (stars determine the classiness of the hotel), - a place where water transport rental, diving and snorkeling are organized at the highest level.  Despite the fact that the hotel is not at all new, it has not lost its high level of service over the years, it has not had fewer clients, and the guests' reviews are almost all positive. </p><h2>  Sea gull </h2><p>  Hotels of Hurghada 4, 5 stars offer a lot of interesting things - the first line of the sea, after all, will not surprise anyone, which means that we need to take something else!  For example, guests at Sea Gull can confidently claim that their stay was original.  This is proved by the hotel restaurant, which is located on a movable rotating platform, and the process of eating is associated with the contemplation of the beauties of nature and landscape.  On the territory, in addition to the basic necessary amenities and entertainment, there is a mini zoo, so children will definitely like it! </p>

    <h2>  Four stars - a worthy choice </h2><p>  The choice of tourists does not always fall on 5 * hotels.  Hurghada (the first coastline can please the guests of sunny Egypt with more than just five-star hotels) offers four-star hotels such as the Mercure Hurghada Hotel or the Old Palace Resort.  They constitute a serious competition to the above hotel complexes.  Excellent service, comfortable rooms, an extensive entertainment program and other pluses allow us to say with confidence that guests will be satisfied and will not regret the money spent. </p><p>  Especially loved by those who often travel to Hurghada, the Alf Leila Wa Leila and Jungle Aqua Park hotels, which are next to each other, belong to the same network, and many services of one hotel are available for guests of another.  These complexes have the status of "four stars" and are located on the second line, and you will have to go to the sea by shuttle or walk 10-15 minutes, across the road.  But in the hotel "Jungle Aqua Park" is a wonderful water park with a large number of different slides for every taste.  The water amusement park is open from 10 am to five in the evening. </p><h2>  Five Star Pets </h2><p>  But no matter how good it is at the Jungle Hotel, remoteness from the sea plays a big role in choosing a hotel.  Therefore, probably, they include the 5 * hotels of Hurghada, favorite by tourists, (stars, first line, reviews will say this better than any independent expert evaluations).  Sunrise Garden Beach, Citadel Resort, Albatross Palace, Grand Azur Hurghada or Jasmine Hurghada - all these five-star hotel complexes are within easy reach, and many of them have their own lagoon with pleasant fine gentle sand, and guests appreciate the service and amenities of these hotels. </p>
