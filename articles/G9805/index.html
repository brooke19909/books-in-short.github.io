    <p>  This city is actually one of the favorite holiday resorts.  This fact can easily be justified in just a few words: wide beaches, good service and lots of entertainment. </p><p>  The total length of the coastal zone of the resort reaches 146 kilometers, while there are a lot of sanatoriums and boarding houses along its entire length. </p><p>  Perhaps, it is not surprising that the beaches in Sochi (both ennobled and wild) are quite numerous.  In total, there are 131. Here, 101 rest areas are private.  They are carefully guarded and maintained. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  30 places, including the central beach of Sochi, are classified as urban, admission to them is free, and that is why they are very popular both among the local population and among numerous guests. </p><p>  Fans of secluded relaxation, who believe that the best beaches in Sochi are, as they say, sections untouched by civilization, will also not be offended.  There are also wild recreation areas where you can light bonfires, set up tents and park cars. </p><h2>  What services do beaches provide in Sochi? </h2>

    <p>  If we talk about resorts, the <span>beaches of Sochi, wild</span> and semi-desert, it is simply impossible not to remember.  Calmness, solitude and vast expanses - all this combines the coast of the village called "73rd kilometer".  This territory is located in the center of Greater Sochi and stretches for more than 1.5 km with a width of up to 50 m. </p><p>  A gentle entry into the water, without any differences, and a large number of breakwaters contribute to a safe vacation with children in an ecologically clean place with stunning views of the young mountains of the Caucasus. </p><p>  There are no bars and restaurants, there are never crowds of vacationers, and that is why the beach is considered a favorite vacation spot for local fishermen. </p><h2>  Beach "Swallow" (microdistrict Mamaika) </h2>

    <p>  This beach, unlike many others in Sochi, is paid and belongs to the Oktyabrsky sanatorium.  You can get there from 8:00 to 20:00. </p><p>  There are advantages here.  Firstly, it is the presence of a service comparable to the leading European resorts.  Secondly, the beach area is completely fenced and well-guarded, so you can not be afraid for the abandoned property, boldly enjoying the sea and relaxation. </p><p>  Also on the beach there are many shops with souvenirs, bars, restaurants, and points that rent sports equipment. </p><p>  The beach itself is small, only 200 meters long and up to 20 wide.  The beach is strewn with small pebbles mixed with sand. </p><p>  The descent into the water is smooth, there are no sudden changes, and in some places, wooden flooring has been specially installed for convenience.

    <p>  Not everyone knows that one of Sochi‚Äôs healing beaches belongs to the Stavropol Territory.  The recreation area is available from early morning until late evening, but, unfortunately, not everyone can get there, but only presenting special passes. </p><p>  The length of the beach is about two hundred meters, and the width in some places reaches 40 meters.  As well as on all departmental beaches, there are rental points for a variety of beach equipment, in particular, umbrellas and sun loungers.  In addition, you can rent swimming equipment (inflatable circles, mattresses, life jackets), balls and equipment for playing table tennis and badminton. </p><p>  If desired, there is the opportunity to ride on catamarans and scooters.  Specially for people with disabilities there are aerarias.  After swimming, it's nice to stroll along the green and clean promenade, sit in a cafe, have a bite to eat or eat tightly. </p><p>  There are rescue towers on the beach, and there is also an emergency medical center. </p><h2>  Beach resort "Salute" </h2>

    <p>  Under the control of the <span>Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian</span> Federation is the beach area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Salyut sanatorium.  For many years this beach has been called "Santa Barbara" in honor of a cafe with the same name located on the seafront. </p><p>  Everyone can get to the two hundred meter coast (from 8:00 to 20:00).  The beach is not only loved by locals, but is also popular with city guests. </p><p>  The advantage is that everyone can drive up to him in his own car, motorcycle or bicycle.  The vehicle will be completely safe to wait for its owners in a special, superbly guarded parking lot. </p><p>  The cleanliness of the coastal zone is ensured regularly, and the administration decided to do this in a logical way, that is, by installing garbage baskets and containers, as well as equipping free toilets. </p><p>  There is also a medical center where they provide immediate assistance in injuries, sunstrokes or burns. </p><p>  Rescue stations have been established, from where superbly trained specialists are observing the sea.  "Salute" has everything you need for relaxation: you can rent sunbeds or umbrellas, rent scooters, catamarans or go on the high seas for a trip on a sailing ship. </p><h2>  Beach "Lighthouse" </h2><p>  Probably everyone who is going to relax in Sochi, not to mention the locals, at least once in his life heard of a beach called "Lighthouse". </p><p>  In the summer months, it is on this piece with a length of 500 meters and a thirty-meter width that the active beach life of the city focuses. </p><p>  Here you can feel a good rest in <span>Sochi.</span>  <span>The coast is</span> strewn with small pebbles, which gently tickles the heels, and a smooth descent into the water contributes to the gradual immersion and getting used to the water.  No sharp changes, no strong waves.  And all this is surrounded by gorgeous nature. </p><p>  Along the beach there are many entertainment centers, cafes, bars and even relatively cheap dining rooms.  There are also numerous rental points for sun loungers and umbrellas.  You can ride on catamarans, "bananas", scooters, "pills".  Parachutes, diving, boat trips - these delights of a summer vacation are also available at affordable prices. </p><p>  Those who like fun slides and clean pools can visit the central water park in Sochi.  It offers a lot of entertainment - both for adults and for children. </p><p>  In addition, there is a mini version of the water park created specifically for children, as well as the Festivalniy summer cinema, where concerts are constantly organized in the summer season and the latest film industry shows are shown. </p><p>  In general, it is quite possible to conclude that travelers will actually enjoy a vacation in a city like Sochi.  Riviera Beach, as well as Lighthouse, Dream by the Sea and the rest - both wild and ennobled, are eagerly waiting for their guests at any time of the year. </p>
