Craftswomen used ropes woven from plant fibers.  Later, when weaving began to develop, ribbons appeared in a modern form.  Art itself, according to researchers, arose thanks to the French king Louis XV.  But to this day, everyone is fascinated and intrigued by paintings from tapes.  With your own hands you can create a real miracle.

They can be from satin or silk.  As a basis, it is better to choose a more dense, but elastic fabric: linen, jeans, silk, velvet.  According to experienced craftswomen, mesh material is best suited.  For example, a ready-made <span>canvas for embroidery.</span>  It must be well stretched on the hoop (their diameter can be eight to ten centimeters) or on a special frame.  There are devices with a stand, they are convenient to install on the floor or on the table.

The tape should pass into it freely, without twisting.  Previously, it must be cut obliquely.  Then, for reliable fastening, you should pierce it through the needle at a distance of two to three centimeters from the beginning, and then stretch the fabric closer to the needle‚Äôs eye.  Now pull the short end down.  Get a knot. </p><p>  Colored stripes made of silk are suitable for embroidering a picture with ribbons, and for decorating clothes.  They are very convenient in that they do not crumple.  Satin or moire are easy to wash, and they do not fade.  They can be embroidered on almost any fabric.  Organza braid is also used.  The image is voluminous and tender.  Lace and veil ribbons will complete the picture.  Necessarily need threads for embroidery.  They draw the <span>outline of the picture</span> or fix colored fabric strips from the inside of the work. </p><h2>  Types of Stitches </h2>

It is performed as follows.  The fabric is pierced with a needle from the inside, the tape is pulled to the front side, and then it is passed through the canvas again.  Thus, for example, leaves are obtained from flowers or their stems.  The stitch length can be varied depending on the intended pattern.

Often, craftswomen use floral motifs, landscapes, images of cute pets.  If you are not confident enough in your own abilities, for example, specialized needlework magazines will come to your aid.  The drawing needs to be transferred to thick cardboard or paper, to pierce the area of ‚Äã‚Äãfuture stitches with a pin or needle.  Then the contours of the image are transferred to the fabric.  The selected drawing is best applied with a pencil.  It is necessary to make the contours soft so that they are not visible after the end of work.

    <p>  The flower is embroidered as follows.  Five stitches are arranged radially.  Then, moving from the center in a circle, thread the tape above and below them.  Sometimes for an integral composition, individual elements are made, and then they are joined together on a canvas. </p><p>  You can embroider a picture with ribbons with roses made in another way.  To do this, fold a strip of satin at right angles.  The ends in turn are wrapped up, weaving them into a cord.  Its length should be from five to seven centimeters.  Then you must simultaneously hold both ends of the tape with your fingers and carefully pull on one of them.  As a result, the cord will assemble into a rose.  So that the flower does not crumble, it must be fixed at the base with two stitches.  They should go through its middle.  The edges of the tapes must be treated with glue or scorched with matches.  Thus, the fabric will not open. </p><h2>  Useful tips for craftswomen </h2><p>  Stitches need to be done carefully.  Each time stretching the tape through the canvas, it is imperative to straighten it.  Then the embroidery will look very beautiful.  The first to perform flowers.  If they are all of the same color, the transition from one to the other is done from the wrong side.  But if the distance between the embroidered objects exceeds four centimeters, it is better to cut the tape and start over again.  Then make leaves.  The result is simply magnificent pictures of flowers, from the ribbons you can also make bees, moths and much more. </p><p>  To fix the seam, the tape must either be sewn to the fabric or displayed on the wrong side of the canvas.  In the latter case, make a neat loop and hold the needle under the ready-made embroidery stitches.  After completing the work, when pink satin buds bloom on the canvas, you can decorate it with beads, rhinestones and beads.  These items would be a very appropriate addition.  Also, the pattern is decorated with knots and stitches. </p><p>  For a craftswoman to embroider a picture with ribbons is not difficult.  Work captivates, captures and takes a little time.  The needlewomen create the most delicate, similar to real flowers, light butterflies, birds.  Such a picture will not only decorate the interior of the apartment, but will also serve as a great gift to relatives and friends. </p>
