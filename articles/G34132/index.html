The operators, not knowing how to attract the user, began to open services with the ability to view their favorite channel directly from their phone.  Experts predicted that mobile television would become very popular in the modern world, and they were right.  Being constantly late for people, I really liked the opportunity to watch programs on the go.  Especially popular are sports broadcasts, for example, football championships.  Let‚Äôs take a closer look at what mobile television is and discuss whether it is necessary in principle. </p>

    <h2>  DVB-H </h2><p>  In our country, television on mobile phones came later than in Europe and Asia.  The first broadcasting companies used Digital Video Broadcasting - Handheld.  It has long become official in the Russian Federation, and some radio channels have been released for its work.  Soon, large operators also got the opportunity to develop services based on technology.  Beeline mobile television has become the most successful and widespread in this area.  Broadcasting DVB-H is carried out using relay towers.  To view the transfer does not require an Internet connection and high <span>speed data transfer.</span>  By the way, MegaFon preferred this particular method of broadcasting.  At the same time, the company‚Äôs costs are minimal due to the wide distribution of TV towers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To watch a TV channel according to this standard, you must have a special receiver and software in the phone to display information on the phone.  DVD-H technology works at a constant speed of 8 Mbps.  You can watch programs even when roaming. </p><h2>  Mobile TV over IP </h2><p>  MegaFon was the first to introduce the Mobile TV service over a <span>cellular network,</span> possessing in 2004 the best data transfer technologies.  <span>MTS mobile television</span> appeared a little later, but it hit them at the same time.  At first, the service was provided in Moscow, and a year later it spread to St. Petersburg.  The user got the opportunity to watch news, programs, clips and much more.  To view it, you need 3GP video support, as well as a RealPlayer player.  In addition, WAP access was required.  With the development of smartphones, it became possible to watch broadcasts in high quality, and even more channels became available.  Some of them require a paid subscription. </p>

    <p>  The service has become quite massive, by 2009 it was connected by more than one hundred thousand people.  Today, a mobile phone with television is not surprising for users, but ten years ago it was new.  The next operator to launch the service was MTS.  The option worked only in EDGE networks, so it was not possible to get a high-quality picture.  The service has become widespread in regions where networks are less busy.  It was impossible to enjoy watching your favorite show: despite the high degree of video compression, slide shows often turned out.  In Russia, mobile television from MTS in those years did not become widespread, but in Uzbekistan, the company was doing well. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another company that used IP technology to broadcast TV channels was Sky Link.  In 2006, at one of the exhibitions, she demonstrated the capabilities of her services.  600 kbps was enough to get a good, stable image.  A plus was the low payment.  Windows Mobile users even got the opportunity to watch about 20 channels for free, paying only for traffic. </p>

    <h2>  Programs for viewing </h2><p>  In addition, most smartphones support mobile Internet TV, which you can watch by installing a small application.  The most popular is SPB TV, which has proved itself to be the best on the market.  It works on all known platforms.  The installation file has a size of several megabytes.  It is often preinstalled on many modern communicators.  New applications regularly appear, but it is very difficult for them to get around SPB.  The program does not require high-speed Internet, has more than a hundred channels from different countries, perfectly adapts to small displays. </p><p>  After installing such an application, the user is independent of the operator.  TV shows can be watched for free, paying only for traffic.  Of course, it is better to have high-speed Internet and a large packet of traffic so as not to feel discomfort when viewing. </p><h2>  Mobile TV in the world </h2><p>  Despite the rapid development, the technology has not received proper distribution.  The reason may be that many users do not really need a TV in their mobile phone.  Many US carriers provide mobile television services to their users.  Half of the channels are available free of charge, the other part requires a subscription. </p>

    <p>  Today, mobile TV is available to any smartphone owner.  Of course, most devices only support IP viewing.  Operators regularly offer services that allow you to view a huge number of channels.  Growing and quality.  Even on large displays, you can get a high-quality picture due to the data transfer speed.  The development of such services is particularly facilitated by sporting events.  Each football championship is accompanied by a growing interest in mobile TV services.  The cost that operators have to pay is also reduced.  You can completely avoid the additional costs by downloading a free program for watching television. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Mobile TV is a rather interesting service that will appeal to fans of watching various programs.
