    <h2>  History of the Royal Castle in Kaliningrad </h2><p>  The Kaliningrad region is the only one in Russia that is separated from our vast country by other states.  And when you walk around the city, you can find it in a rather strange settlement.  Here, there are purely Soviet districts that cause gloom with their dullness, and typical Burger quarters, which are more pleasant to wander around.  Kaliningrad is also today a modern Russian port city, but in 1255, when it was founded, the area belonged to Prussia.  Then it was decided to establish a stronghold at the time of the conquest of lands, which was what the crusaders of the Teutonic Order did.  This point on the map was named K√∂nigsberg, which translates as ‚Äúroyal mountain‚Äù - in honor of the Czech king Przemysl II, who gives funds for the development of the settlement. </p><p>  In the same year, 1255 a castle was laid.  It will be more accurate to say that the history of the city originates from the moment this architectural structure was formed.  The Middle Ages are generally a very interesting and at the same time terrible time when the most unexpected events took place.  And just then, the fight against the Gentiles was almost the main goal, a noble deed.  Therefore, often when mentioning that era, one can hear about the Crusades, in which everyone who was waiting for "spiritual salvation" took part.  So, returning to the topic: K√∂nigsberg Castle, on the undertaking of King Ottokar II and Grandmaster of the Teutonic Order Peppo von Ostern, was erected "to defend the Christian faith." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The decision to build was made in 1254, immediately after the celebration of Christmas.  By January 17 of the following year, Ottokar II leaves ‚Äúgenerous gifts for the construction of the castle‚Äù, as the chronicler of the Order Peter from Duisburg writes.  In the spring, work began on the construction of Konigsberg, and, it is worth noting, on a fairly large scale.  First, on the site of the previously burnt Prussian fortification of Twangeste, a wooden fortress was built that went into the ground.  Further, it was planned to build a stone defensive structure, which would occupy the entire spacious plateau of the Royal Mountain, located at an altitude of 20 m above the level of the Pregel River.  In 1256, the <span>Knights of the Teutonic Order</span> fenced off a stream, thus obtaining the Castle Pond, which was extremely necessary in those days, from which the moat was replenished.  By the way, it was here that the first mill was built. </p><p>  In 1260 there was a Prussian uprising - the largest in history.  They destroyed all the Christians they managed to capture, and also burned many <span>castles, fortresses</span> and other buildings.  A year later, the Prussians reached the Royal Castle, besieged it, capturing and destroying the settlement.  The Konigsberg castle had not yet been completed, but it adequately withstood a two-year siege and a fierce battle. </p><p>  In the following years, the Royal Castle (Kaliningrad) was constantly changing, rebuilding, transforming, becoming larger, more beautiful and stronger.  By the XV century it was already an impregnable and quite powerful fortress, which was a big problem to take.  However, after some time, the walls ceased to be protection against guns.  Gradually, various works of art and valuable books accumulated here.  So the castle turned into the cultural center of Prussian land. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1525, K√∂nigsberg officially became the residence of the first secular ruler of Prussia - Duke Albrecht.  But the gentleman becomes cramped and bored in the faceless chambers of the castle, and he decides on a grand restructuring.  During this ‚Äúbuilding revolution‚Äù, an eastern wing appears, later named after the Duke. </p><p>  In the era of the Renaissance, the palace, which had already managed to transform, became even more beautiful.  The Royal Castle (Kaliningrad) was completely completed and became a magnificent aesthetic residence of the Prussian Dukes. </p>

    <h2>  "Death" of the Royal Castle </h2><p>  The construction founded by the Czech king lasted until 1968.  The castle suffered its first destruction during the Second World War.  Aerial bombing caused major damage to the building, but, oddly enough, it still retained its beautiful and slightly formidable appearance.  In addition, it could be restored.  But time passed, and the matter did not advance beyond the discussions.  Many people were against the restoration of Koenigsberg.  No wonder, after all, in 1945, the newspaper Pravda called the castle ‚Äúa decayed tooth in the mouth of a fascist viper.‚Äù  It caused unpleasant emotions in people, and a lot of money was required for its restoration.  It is not known how long this architectural structure would have stood in ignorance, if not for Kosygin.  At the end of the 60s of the last century, when the question ‚Äúwhat are these ruins in the city center‚Äù was answered that they were going to make a local history museum, Kosygin was indignant: ‚ÄúShould I open a museum to Prussian militarism?  Take it down immediately! ‚Äù  So the fate of K√∂nigsberg was decided.  Although there is no evidence that this was indeed so. </p>

    <h2>  Description of the Royal Castle </h2><p>  K√∂nigsberg Castle had a maximum length of 104 m and a width of 66.8 m. The tallest building in the city was the Castle Tower, which was rebuilt in the Gothic style in the years 64-66. </p><p>  Over the 7 centuries of existence, this structure has been repeatedly modified.  Therefore, it combined all the once fashionable styles: Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and even Rococo.  At the same time, its purpose also changed.  At first it was a defensive structure, then a castle, then fashionable ducal residences, then a museum complex, and then a place in which spiritual life was concentrated. </p><p>  Another thing is interesting - the components that make up the Royal Castle (Kaliningrad): </p><ul><li>  The place where the coronation of the Prussian kings took place is the Castle Church. </li><li>  Collection of manuscripts and books - ‚ÄúSilver Library‚Äù. </li><li>  Located in the basement of the wine restaurant "Blood Court". </li><li>  Shelter "Firmari". </li><li>  Castle tower with a clock. </li><li>  Large hall for receptions. </li><li>  The Oatmeal Tower is an octagonal structure. </li><li>  Castle Pond. </li><li>  The baroque outbuilding with the royal chambers called Friedrichsbau or Unfriedtbau.  It included several halls: Throne, Mirror, Leather, Hunter, Ceramic, Order of the Black Eagle, as well as the ancestral hall;  the former premises of the Imperial Salon, the Crown Prince‚Äôs chambers, the imperial wardrobe and the imperial bedroom;  the birth rooms of Frederick I, banners and standards, Queen Louise;  dining room and cabinet of the emperor. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Archaeological site of the Royal Castle in Kaliningrad </h2><p>  Archaeological work was carried out for 7 years, until 2008.  Then, due to lack of funding and complete indifference on the part of the Kaliningrad City Hall, the excavations were stopped.  But the question of the need to continue conducting archaeological work remains open. </p><h2>  Awaiting Recovery </h2><p>  In 2009, a program was developed to reconstruct the center of Kaliningrad, even a competition was held, but only the development of the territory of the former castle did not take place due to the development of the financial crisis.  Then they decided to hold a referendum again, but when the governor and the regional government changed in 2010, this issue was no longer raised. </p><p>  Today it is known that the restoration of the Royal Castle in Kaliningrad will nevertheless take place.  So far, only reconstruction is planned, but the main thing is that the city hall has found a sponsor of the work. </p>

The ruins of the Royal Castle are located on the Central City Square, next to the House of Soviets (Shevchenko, 2). </p><p>  Today, the question of the restoration of Koenigsberg is quite acute.  Many people are inclined to believe that Russians do not need such a sight that this is not our story.  Others believe that the Royal Castle must be brought to normal.
