Socially significant topics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now it has become fashionable to use the words ‚Äúsocially significant‚Äù.  But what do they mean?  What advantages or specifics do they tell us?  What tasks do socially significant projects carry out?  We will consider all this in the framework of this article. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Let's turn to the most important legislative document - the Constitution.  According to her, the state takes upon itself the responsibility of providing its citizens with basic needs.  These include food, education, work, housing, health, protection against external and internal threats, and so on.  Therefore, everything that works to accomplish this task is a socially significant object. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="socially significant" class="if" height="248" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1365150.jpg" width="600"></div>  It should be noted that when these words are applied to the problem, it means that it does not concern one person, but at least a significant part of society.  As an example, we can cite low pensions, high crime rates and so on.  Among the objects for us, interest (within the framework of this article) is represented by those that have a certain social significance, since they provide a person‚Äôs needs for vital services, products and goods:

For this, grouping by similar parameters is used.  And if you have to talk about people?  Then socially significant qualities are of great importance.  An example is the teacher training process.  After all, these are important specialists, on whose activities the future of society depends.  Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that they possess all the qualities and skills necessary for work.

Socially significant projects contribute to their unification to solve a specific problem.  Participants in the process can be both public institutions and individuals or their association.  If we develop the situation that was touched upon earlier with teachers, we can take as an example the work of libraries, orphanages or development centers, and so on.  So, a similar socially significant project can work in the following areas:

So, if a tooth hurts - this is an individual problem.  But if the dental industry of the country is in decline, then this is a drawback for the whole country.  Then socially significant organizations begin to deal with such topics.  Such can be considered the association of dentists or the movement for high-quality medicine.  Another indicator of the importance of the topic can be called regularly emerging discussions, conflicts and so on.  As an example, we can recall corruption.  Everyone treats her negatively (at least in words), they want her to disappear - but this still does not happen.  Therefore, discussions about this phenomenon are raging, and very often they turn into violent skirmishes and mutual accusations.  Well, who knows, perhaps this is just a kind of show, a performance to distract people.

    <h2>  Motivation </h2><p>  So, a person can take part in something socially significant and important.  The basis of his activities is motivation.  She can express a wide range of needs: in self-realization, in communication, in the application of her leadership potential and so on.  Moreover, participation can be expressed in a significant range of actions, starting from brute force work and ending with value-oriented manifestations.  It should be noted that motivational activity, which is not supported by an underlying need, is usually situational, short-lived and can easily cease to exist.  Thanks to this, one can observe a large number of various initiatives that were abandoned even before they were brought to an end.  A lot of this contributed to the difficulties of implementation. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

Of course, in our conditions, the greatest attention is paid to topics.  So, how can one not recall the economic crisis that has been going on for two years, the freezing of the funded part of the pension (continued until 2019) and other problems that stubbornly do not want to be resolved.  Socially significant projects could help to cope with them, but, alas, in our realities they are not something too widespread and large-scale.  Although you should start with something.  Perhaps one of the readers of this article will be able to come up with a fresh solution to some socially significant topic or propose a project that will answer a large number of questions that are relevant today.  Be that as it may, it is necessary to study and think what to do with the current situation.  And do not hide your thoughts in a distant box, but bring them to the court of society.  Indeed, even if one person does not have the strength to realize something, this does not mean that someone else will not take up the solution to the problem.  And together even the mountains will be much easier to roll.
