What to do?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, Sberbank actively advertises its services, comes up with new ones and improves old ones.  They make it possible to spend less time in queues, conveniently perform operations, control accounts and so on.  All this can be done without visiting the department.  Isn't that a miracle ?!  But, it so happens that not all services work properly.  No, this is not because they are bad, just the creators missed something, and you need to refine it, or just a technical failure occurred.  We will talk about the Mobile Bank service, in particular, why the alerts on the phone suddenly stopped. </p><h2>  What problems may arise in the operation of the service? </h2>

    <p>  At first it might seem that each service provided by Sberbank should be carefully thought out and useful for customers, but over the long period of existence of this system, many users were unsatisfied with either the service, the cost of the service, or some other problems that sometimes arise due to unfinished technical part.  If you start to understand this issue, it turns out that when SMS does not come from Sberbank (‚ÄúMobile Bank‚Äù), it is not the bank that is to blame.  But best of all, before you go to the office and activate the service, find out what problems you may encounter and how they are solved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What are the problems when connecting? </h2>

    <p>  1. Connection failed.  The period during which the service is activated is no more than three days, but some customers do not receive SMS from Sberbank's Mobile Bank due to the failure and the service was not connected.  Moreover, this issue does not always work out for employees in one week.  Such situations arise very rarely and, as a rule, the reason is that the service is incorrectly connected. </p><p>  2. Too much cost.  Most customers believe that you do not need to pay 60 rubles for such a service, supposedly it is not worth it. </p><p>  3. Someone doesn‚Äôt receive SMS from Sberbank‚Äôs ‚ÄúMobile Bank‚Äù, but someone sends them too much.  Indeed, sometimes it happens that the bank sends a lot of messages, in addition, in some cases they are the same.  In addition, a situation may arise that SMS from the "Mobile Bank" Sberbank stopped receiving.  In such a situation, the service may become unavailable at all. </p><p>  4. You cannot connect multiple cards to the system.  This is very inconvenient, since today most customers use multiple cards. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  5. There is no way to disable services provided for extra money. </p><p>  6. When connecting an "economical" package, you cannot recognize the balance on the card automatically. </p><p>  7. Not too reliable service.  Its protection and security is not at the highest level, because the bank is not responsible for the distribution of confidential information.  Due to the lack of the necessary level of protection, precedents of fraudulent actions occur.  With the loss of a cell phone, anyone who finds it can easily and simply transfer funds to their account. </p><h2>  Should I connect the service? </h2>

    <p>  Given all of the above, you should think very carefully about whether to connect this service.  But, in general, she can be a very good assistant when paying for services, purchases, loans and much more.  This is especially useful if the client lives far from the office. </p><h2>  Why do not SMS from Sberbank ("Mobile Bank") come?  What to do? </h2>

    <p>  It is very convenient to receive messages from the bank about all operations, as this is the fastest way to inform when paying for cellular communications or performing other operations on the card.  Therefore, when SMS from the ‚ÄúMobile Bank‚Äù of Sberbank does not come, most customers begin to feel uncomfortable.  At this time, everyone begins to wonder: for what reason is this happening? </p><p>  Very often, Mobile Bank stops working for the following reasons: </p><ul><li>  Technical malfunction (may occur both in the bank and the telecom operator).  If you suddenly did not receive a notification, do not panic.  You must first wait a bit and, if necessary, find out what is the reason. </li><li>  Phone breakdown.  Problems in the system sometimes arise because the device stops receiving incoming messages.  In this situation, try inserting your SIM card into another phone and checking if messages will arrive. </li><li>  There were not enough funds on the card to pay for the service.  Sometimes SMS from the ‚ÄúMobile Bank‚Äù of Sberbank does not come due to lack of funds on the card to pay for the service.  A full package costs 30 or 60 rubles, and if the owner does not receive messages, then perhaps you should replenish the account.  As a rule, if a service limits its operation, an SMS arrives, and after topping up an account everything is restored. </li></ul><h2>  What to do if SMS do not come? </h2>

    <p>  In addition, if you are concerned about the question of why SMS (Mobile Bank, Sberbank) does not come, you should first make sure that the service is turned on, as users sometimes confuse commands and block the option.  To do this, call the hotline or visit the bank office. </p><h2>  Do not receive SMS from Sberbank ("Mobile Bank").  Where to go </h2><p>  There are a lot of reasons for the messages from the bank to stop arriving on the phone.  But the most common of all and at the same time the simplest is that a negative account has formed on the balance of the card or phone.  For the normal operation of the service, you need to pay for it regularly.  Do not forget that the amount is debited automatically, therefore, with a lack of funds, the option is blocked.  Of course, the replenishment of the account is the solution to the problem.  After that, the service will automatically recover, but it may take several days. </p><p>  In all other situations when the service stops working, you must either contact the hotline, where the operator will help to find out and eliminate the cause, or to the nearest office. </p>
