It all started with the organization Interros-Dostostvo, to which in 1996 the NPF Norilsk Nickel was added.  Actually, under the name “Norilsk Nickel” the pension fund is most famous.  Four years ago, a decision was made to rename Norilsk Nickel to Heritage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pension fund norilsk nickel personal account" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2146465.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But the merger did not end there, and in the period from 2014 to 2016, Heritage, that is, the former Norilsk Nickel, was included in the Gas Fund along with Kit Finance and Promagrofond.  Starting from 2017, all clients of these organizations are served by the Gazfond institution.  More details about the activities of this fund, as well as its services and rating will be discussed below. </p><h2>  Fund changes </h2><p>  To date, the Heritage Pension Fund (Norilsk Nickel) announces the completion of the reorganization process in the form of the merger of the Gazfond pension savings company, which is the largest in its sphere in assessing the scale of assets to be combined at the same time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  NPF "Gazfond" has joined the institution "KIT-Finance", which has replenished its client base with two million people.  In turn, “Heritage” has joined another eight hundred thousand customers to the newly-made “Gazfond”.  And thanks to the Promagrofond, more than two million people have been added.  As a result, the total number within the association already exceeds six million customers, and the amount of pension savings is 425 billion rubles.  The pension fund of the combined organization "Gazfond" is 16 million rubles. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="private pension fund norilsk nickel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2146464.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  According to the laws of succession </h2><p>  "Gazfond" in succession continues to fulfill obligations to all customers of the affiliated structures.  Service contracts and agreements is carried out in all offices of the new integrated network.  It is important to note that the reorganization does not imply a renegotiation of contracts with respect to compulsory pension insurance and non-state security. </p><h2>  What benefits did customers receive as a result of the merger? </h2><p>  The merger took place under a strong brand, which guaranteed investors additional confidence and reliability, confirming the correct choice of fund for the formation of future retirement capital.  The status, as well as the voice of the created fund, has become much stronger. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The combined structure today consolidates the experience, knowledge, skills and best practices in doing business of all four foundations.  Currently, the fund’s experts conduct outreach among potential clients, develop and increase the financial literacy of the population.  In addition, the new organization operates and develops as part of long-term financial planning and cooperation. </p><p>  As a result of the merger, the infrastructure of the four funds expanded the geographical access to provide services and provided the services aimed at remote servicing. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Norilsk Nickel Pension Fund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2146470.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The following areas of activity can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Implementation of private pension provision. </li><li>  Provision of early non-state pension provision. </li><li>  Compulsory pension insurance. </li></ul><p>  In addition to compulsory pension insurance, Gazfond (that is, the Norilsk Nickel Pension Fund too) provides its customers with individual cash accumulation plans.
