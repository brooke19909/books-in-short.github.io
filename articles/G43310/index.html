Sights and interesting facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On the banks of the Isar River, which flows through the territory of Bavaria, which is part of Germany, Munich is located.  What to see in this city? </p><p>  The city, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 30 thousand hectares, has preserved architectural and historical cultural monuments throughout its centuries-old history.  And in our time it has become a tourist center of the state, located in the central part of Europe. </p><p>  In the article we will talk about the sights of the <span>capital of Bavaria,</span> which annually receives about three million tourists from all over the world. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The name comes from the ancient German word "Munichen", which in translation sounds like "among the monks."  This is due to the fact that, according to preserved historical documents, monks from the <span>Benedictine monastery of</span> Sheftlarn, founded in 762, settled on one of the hills located in the territory of the future city. </p><p>  Now on the site of this settlement is the church of St. Peter.  The first mention of this area dates back to 1158.  In 1175, the settlement, thanks to its development, received the status of a city, which was inhabited mainly by Bavarians (a tribe that lived on the territory of modern Bavaria). </p><p>  After 65 years, Otto II the Most Serene (the Duke of Bavaria from the dynasty of the German feudal family Wittelsbach) took possession of the city.  In 1255, Munich became the capital of the Duchy of Upper Bavaria.  This happened after the division of Bavaria into two parts: Upper and Lower.  After 250 years, the unification of the <span>Bavarian lands</span> took place <span>.</span>  Then Munich became the main city of the united state of Bavaria.  In 1806, it received the status of a kingdom.  After some time, the construction of new urban infrastructure buildings began in the city. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  King of Bavaria Ludwig I (son of King Maximilian I) invited many famous cultural figures from other European countries.  Then Munich became the cultural capital of the southern part of Germany.  After the end of World War I, the Weimar Republic was formed in Germany, which included Munich as the capital of Bavaria.  During World War II, the city was partially destroyed by airstrikes of the allied forces of the anti-Hitler coalition. </p><p>  After the end of hostilities, the center of Bavaria fell into the American zone of occupation.  Within three years it was restored and became part of the Weimar Republic, which was officially renamed the Federal Republic of Germany on May 23, 1949. </p><p>  An interesting fact: the modern city has its long-standing motto ‚ÄúMunich loves you‚Äù, which reflects the attitude of the indigenous people towards the guests. </p><p>  The local travel agencies organize daily walking and bus excursions to the main attractions of the city with a long history.  What to see in Munich on your own? </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old pinakothek" class="if uuid-2391841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2391841.jpg"></div><h2>  Old Pinakothek </h2><p>  In the old part of the city is an art gallery.  At one time, the Duke of Bavaria, William IV, ordered the great masters of that time paintings on historical themes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among the first, which were the basis of the future world famous Munich Pinakothek (the name is taken from the ancient Greeks), there was a world masterpiece by the German artist Albrecht Altdorfer "The Battle of Alexander the Great with Tsar Darius." </p><p>  All these paintings were at that time inaccessible to the German people.  Duke Louis I was instructed to build a museum building.  And in 1836 it was open to the public. </p><p>  Now tourists can see more than 700 paintings located in 19 halls.  Among them are paintings by Raphael, Rubens and other world famous artists. </p><p>  Opposite the Old Pinakothek is the building of the New Pinakothek.  The works of artists of the XIX ‚Äì XX centuries are exhibited there.  Here's what to see in Munich for 1 day.  Nearby is the Pinakothek Moderne Gallery.  In it, art lovers can get acquainted with the paintings of painters of the XX century.  The cost of one ticket is 6 ‚Ç¨.  Admission is free for children under 18 years old. </p><h2>  Glyptothek </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Munich Glyptothek" class="if uuid-2391844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2391844.jpg"></div><p>  What to see in Munich on their own for art lovers?  Now in the city there is a glyptotek (in translation - "sculpture storage"). </p><p>  The construction of the building was completed by the German artist architect Leo von Klenze in 1870.  It was intended for a royal environment, and Roman and Greek sculptures of past centuries were kept here.  Admission to the glyptotek is paid - 6 ‚Ç¨. </p><p>  The museum is a building of 13 halls.  Each has a unique interior.  In it, tourists can view the preserved originals of three-dimensional artistic images. </p><p>  Among them are the Shadow Kuros, the Munich Kuros and other world-famous sculptures.  Nearby you can see a copy of the front gate of the Acropolis of Athens, where sculptures in the form of bas-reliefs glorify the struggle of the Greek people for their independence. </p><h2>  Hofbr√§uhaus </h2><p>  Thinking over the list of what to see in Munich in 3 days, it is worth including Hofbr√§uhaus.  On the Platzl street is one of the main attractions of Munich.  It is called the Hofbr√§uhaus beer restaurant (court beer house).  This establishment was founded in 1589 by the Duke of Bavaria, William V the Pious. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hofbr√§uhaus beer restaurant" class="if uuid-2391864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2391864.jpg"></div><p>  In those days, only dark beer was produced.  Duke Maximilian I (son and heir of William V) did not like this drink.  And in 1602, by his decree, it was forbidden to produce white wheat beer throughout Bavaria.  This ensured the existence of a monopoly for his court brewery. </p><p>  Five years later, it was decided to build a new brewery in the Bavarian capital.  The construction was completed in 1897 on the Platzl street, which has been preserved to our time. </p><p>  Wondering what to see in Munich, tourists should pay attention to this restaurant.  The institution is quite unusual.  Now Hofbr√§uhaus consists of three halls.  Hall "Schwemme" (translated from German - "cellar") - the main one.  It is located on the ground floor.  In the center of the room there is a platform for a restaurant orchestra, which daily performs national Bavarian musical works for visitors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="restaurant hofbrohaus" class="if uuid-2391870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2391870.jpg"></div><p>  The second floor is occupied by the office of ‚ÄúBreustuberl‚Äù (beer room).  This retro room is equipped with antique furniture from past centuries.  The largest in area is the front door.  There are dancing evenings and other entertainment for visitors to the restaurant.  Tourists have the opportunity to visit this attraction and try the traditional <span>Munich beer of</span> three varieties: dark Hofbr√§u Dunkel, light Hofbr√§u Original and M√ºnchner Wei√üe (wheat beer). </p><h2>  Interesting facts about the beer restaurant </h2><p>  Having figured out what to see in Munich, you can consider some interesting facts about the Hofbr√§uhaus: </p><ul><li>  The melody for the popular song ‚ÄúHofbr√§uhaus‚Äù stands in Munich, which later became the anthem of the brasserie, was composed by a resident of Berlin, Vig Gabriel. </li><li>  Beer restaurant was often visited by Lenin and Hitler. </li><li>  In 1970, a large iron safe with cells appeared here.  There are beer mugs of regular visitors.  It is noteworthy that the cells are inherited. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Schloss Blutenburg Castle" class="if uuid-2391850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2391850.jpg"></div><h2>  Schloss-Blutenburg Castle </h2><p>  What to see in Munich in winter?  Sights.  We will meet one of them now.  Bluetenburg Castle is located in the Munich Obermenzing district.  Its western part is washed by a small river Wurm, and on the eastern side - by the waters of two lakes. </p><p>  Thanks to this location, it seems that the castle complex was erected on the island. </p><p>  If you are thinking about what to see in Munich in 2 days, include this attraction in the list of places you plan to visit.  The construction of the castle dates back to the beginning of the 13th century. </p><p>  The original view was not preserved, since from 1431 and for the next seven years, the castle was rebuilt by the Duke Albrecht III.  After some time, the master became his son, Duke Albrecht IV.  Next to the main building (the manor house), surrounded by a wall with four defensive towers, he erected a chapel.  Here's what to see around Munich!  Tourists can visit it and see the altar preserved to our time.  Its author was the Polish artist Jan Polak. </p><p>  In 1676, the German notary Anton von Burham became the owner of the castle.  He rebuilt the main building of the complex in the Baroque style.  The last owner was King Max I. By his order, a defensive wall was dismantled.  And after his death in 1827, the castle building became the property of the state. </p><p>  Now on its territory is the Munich International Youth Library.  It contains more than 400 thousand books of various directions. </p><p>  Tourists can explore the territory of the castle, visit the library and enjoy traditional German cuisine in the restaurant, prepared according to old recipes. </p><h2>  The legend of the castle Schloss-Blutenburg </h2><p>  Translated, the name of the castle means "flower mountain."  This is due to the fact that there was a hunting lodge on the hill.  In its place, a landmark of Munich was built. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="castle chapel" class="if uuid-2391854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2391854.jpg"></div><p>  There is a legend that says that in the spring Flower Mountain you can find a blossoming rose.  It is necessary to touch it, and the desire made at the same time must necessarily come true. </p><h2>  Nymphenburg </h2><p>  In the western part of the city is located one of the symbols of Munich - the Nymphenburg palace complex.  The history of the erection of the future pride of all of Germany was begun in 1664.  Construction work was dedicated to the birth of Ferdinand Maria, the eldest son of Duke Maximilian I. </p><p>  After some time, the Bavarian king was instructed to set up a park around the palace and build two new structures (pavilions). </p><p>  In 1825, the new king of Bavaria, Ludwig I, began to rule the state. He rebuilt the main palace building and the adjacent territory of the complex.  Then Nymphenburg became the official summer royal residence. </p><p>  Tourists can explore the palace itself and take a walk along the alleys of the royal park with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã205 hectares.  There are a variety of flower beds, broken around artificial lakes, ponds and grottoes.  On the park territory, small palace buildings were built.  The most beautiful and most visited by tourists is Amalienburg.  It was built in the 18th century. </p><p>  Favorite vacation spot for guests and <span>residents of Munich</span> is the coastal zone of the canal, in which several dozens of snow-white swans swim.  City guests can inspect other buildings that were erected as the park area expanded. </p><p>  Among them, visitors pay attention to the chapel of Magdalenenclause.  Translated, its name sounds like "Magdalene's cell."  The building was built by the German architect Joseph Effner in 1728 for the aging King Maximilian I, where he could relax and pray in silence.  The chapel has the appearance of a cave (grotto) surrounded by tall trees.  Its walls are decorated with carved figures of birds. </p><h2>  How much does it cost to visit Nymphenburg? </h2><p>  The palace complex is open to the public only in the summer months.  Entrance here is paid.  The estimated ticket price for an adult is 8‚Äì8.5 ‚Ç¨.  For children, admission is free, but accompanied by parents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nymphenburg palace" class="if uuid-2391860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2391860.jpg"></div><h2>  Other sights of Munich </h2><p>  What else to see in Munich?  Tourists can also see the interior of the current church of St. John of Nepomuk.  It was built in 1746 by the brothers Cosmas and Aegis Azam.  It is also worth a visit to the Museum of Early Archeology (Bavarian Archaeological Museum). </p><p>  What to see in Munich in winter car lovers?  You should definitely go to the BMW Museum.  His expositions tell the story of the world famous automobile factory since 1913.  <span>The English park,</span> located in the city center, is also worth visiting for those who are interested in the main attractions of Munich. </p><h2>  Fun for kids </h2><p>  What to see in Munich with children?  The city leadership, given that many tourists visit it with children, created objects for children of any age. </p><p>  In the central part of the capital, on the Teresa hill (the former fairground), there is a museum for the achievement of natural sciences and technology (German Museum).  His collection consists of 28 thousand exhibits from more than 50 branches of modern science.  The Children's Kingdom was created in the museum for children, which is 1,000 entertainments that help in the game form to learn the laws of mechanics, optics and acoustics. </p><p>  On the banks of the Isar River (the southern part of the city) is the Hellabrun Zoo (the largest in Europe - about 40 hectares).  Children can get acquainted with the life of 750 species of animals.  Admission is 12 ‚Ç¨ for an adult and 5 ‚Ç¨ for a child. </p><p>  In the building of the old town hall, which is located in the central square, there is a toy museum.  There, in four rooms, children can see a collection of toys collected from around the world. </p><h2>  Sea life </h2><p>  Sea Life is a network of aquariums created around the world.  One of them is located in Munich.  There on the territory of more than 2,000 square meters.  m there are 30 aquariums.
