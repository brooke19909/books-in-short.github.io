    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the name of the village is translated as "cape, going into the sea."  This phrase most plausibly describes what you can see when you come to these places.  However, the sea is not the only attraction that is located here.  Not far from the city center is the eastern slope of Mount Koldun.  The cape itself is located one kilometer from the village of Myskhako.  Rest here is simply magnificent, thanks to the close proximity of mountains and the sea.  About 8,000 people live here permanently, most of them Russians.  You can also meet other nationalities: Ukrainians, Georgians and others.  The village is located in the time zone UTC + 3.  There is no time difference with Moscow. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  What can Myskhako village offer tourists?  Rest on the seashore, a walk in the mountains and, of course, diving.  For diving enthusiasts, this place is a true paradise.  Here you can observe not only beautiful landscapes of the seabed, unique vegetation, but also sunken ships, which are located at a depth of more than 20 m. In order to enjoy scuba diving, you do not need to be a professional, experienced instructors work here who train and accompany underwater. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the infrastructure in the village is not very developed.  There are not so many hotels and other similar establishments.  Mostly tourists on vacation rent housing in the private sector.  Also in the center of the village are private holiday homes.  There are also not many beaches here.  The most popular is Central.  At first glance it may seem very small, but its length is about 350 m. Further along the coast you can find wild beaches, but there are a lot of stones on them.  The rest of the coast is rocky, which is why vacationers are advised to be extremely careful.  But this also has its own charm.  There are a lot of places untouched by civilization.  That is why tourists choose the village of Myskhako.  Rest here will give an unforgettable experience. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation centers myshako" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1390449.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Myskhako </h2><p>  The most popular mini-hotel in the village is Myskhako.  It is located on the Black Sea coast, the distance to it is 50 m. Tourists, even without leaving their rooms, can hear the sound of the surf, and from the windows observe endless expanses of water. </p><p>  The hotel has 15 equipped rooms: economy, standard, junior suite, suite.  TV, Internet, air conditioning, refrigerator - this is what awaits every tourist who settles in the hotel "Myskhako".  Holidays at sea can be diversified by a sauna with a pool.  The hotel has 2 tennis courts.  For tourists who travel by car, a parking lot is available.  For those who wish to fry barbecue on their own in the fresh air, a special barbecue area is equipped. </p><p>  Guest reviews are mostly only positive.  The only thing that most of them noted was the lack of an equipped road to the beach.  Unfortunately, the only way to get to the sea is a narrow iron staircase.  For example, going down with children or a stroller is quite problematic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest Myskhako Novorossiysk" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1390448.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Holiday Prices </h2><p>  A huge advantage of the local resort are the prices.  Housing in both the private sector and in hotels is relatively inexpensive.  Entertaining programs, excursions cost no more than 700 rubles.  per person.  The trip to the winery will be the most expensive (about 450 rubles if you visit the tasting room).  A real Russian bath, which is located in the village, will cost tourists 400 rubles.  There are no nightclubs and discos here.  It is the silence that distinguishes relaxation in these places.  Myskhako (Novorossiysk) has small restaurants.  The cost of lunch will be much lower than in a megalopolis, but the menu is not varied. </p>
