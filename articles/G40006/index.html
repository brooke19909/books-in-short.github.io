  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Israel - interesting places and hotels in Jerusalem.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The holy city of Jerusalem has a rich history and is revered by Jews, Muslims and Christians around the world.  It is divided into several parts.  In the Old Town, tourists can see almost all local attractions.  It also has Christian, Armenian, Muslim and Jewish quarters.  <span>East Jerusalem</span> is the center of Arab culture, and West Jerusalem is one of the fastest growing areas.  More than half a million people live in this city.  Holidays in Jerusalem are popular all over the world.  This is a great place for cultural and historical tourism.  In addition, millions of people make pilgrimages here every year.  In this city there are many churches, monasteries, ancient buildings, luxurious mansions, museums and art galleries.  Guests of Jerusalem can go to the theater, attend the international film festival, which takes place here and engage in exciting shopping. </p><p>  A variety of Jerusalem hotels will delight visitors with modern conveniences and the level of prices for any wallet.  Of course, if you are not constrained by the means, then problems with the placement will not arise in any case.  In this city there are a sufficient number of hotels of the highest category, striking the imagination with luxury and richness of decoration.  But what if you can‚Äôt afford such Jerusalem hotels?  What makes this city good - here you can find a place to stay at an affordable price and enjoy a decent level of service.  Reviews of Jerusalem hotels are very diverse.  However, as elsewhere, sometimes people complain about the untidiness of the rooms, exorbitantly expensive service, poor cuisine or unprofessional staff.  But this is still a rarity.  As a rule, even people with incomes below the average can find a decent place to stay and enjoy the magical atmosphere of this ancient city. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, where can you stay and find the lowest prices for quality service?  Hotel Alcazar is located very close to the Old Town.  It has 38 comfortable rooms and beautiful views of the holy places.  Here you will be offered fascinating excursions to the <span>Dead Sea,</span> to Bethlehem, Kurman, Jericho, Nazareth and other interesting places. </p><p>  There are also such hotels in Jerusalem where business people are good to stay.  Beit Ben Yehuda has a beautiful meeting room that is equipped with a video and spotlight.  You can also use the wonderfully equipped kitchen and the large library.  Nearby there is everything a tourist needs: <span>bus stops,</span> shops and restaurants. </p><p>  The family-run Mount of Olive Hotel is located near the holy sites mentioned in the Bible.  Guests will enjoy comfortable and clean rooms with a private bathroom.  Here, those who come as pilgrims often stop here. </p><p>  Hotel HaShimi is located in the heart of the Old Town.  It is located in an old building, which was built about 400 years ago.  You will enjoy the hotel‚Äôs modern interior with beautiful <span>marble staircases,</span> railings and floors.  And beige, white, burgundy and gold tones create an even more charming atmosphere.  It is almost the perfect place for your vacation. </p><p>  HaShimi Hotel offers interesting tours in Israel, Egypt and Jordan.  In addition, you can choose the option of leisure activities directly in Jerusalem.  Not far from the hotel is the pedestrian promenade of Nahalat Shiva, as well as the local market. </p><p>  All of these Jerusalem hotels offer you relaxation at an affordable price that does not exceed 70 euros per day.  They have a two-star category, but this does not affect the level and quality of service, the interior and the comfort of the rooms. </p><p>  No need to take the <span>capital of Israel</span> as a kind of shrine.  It is a modern city, filled with the breath of people and life.  Here you will plunge into the atmosphere of adventure and magic. </p>
