The most significant of them is the increased area.  But he is not without certain shortcomings.  For example - the need for earthworks and an increase in the cost of project implementation.  If there is a desire to create a basement with a basement, then this requires not only knowledge of a certain building technology, but also the acquisition of a greater number of building materials.  Let's figure out how it is created, regardless of whether such a structure is built on its own or someone decides to resort to the services of a contractor. </p><h2>  Introductory information </h2><div class="photo" data-original="moifundament.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="basement with basement" class="if uuid-2716640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2716640.jpg"></div><p>  Consider which base (tape or plate) is better to choose, as well as many other nuances.  In addition, houses with a basement require a certain deepening.  And while it is necessary to take into account the properties of the soil, the level of groundwater.  As a rule, such calculations are carried out by professional builders.  And only after this begins the construction of the house.  After all, calculating the basement foundation allows you to do in favor of a certain option.  If you try to do without it, you can be very disappointed with the result.  If we talk about popular solutions, the strip foundation with a basement has deserved fame.  This is due to the fact that it can be created from different prefabricated structures, building materials, and even in the form of a monolith.  But it is limited in the load that it can withstand.  Moreover, he distributes it unevenly.  What can be dangerous due to the specifics of the structural design of load-bearing walls or on certain types of soil. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If a large and heavy house is planned, then it is more likely to say that after all the necessary calculations, it will be necessary to make a reinforced tile base.  So, if there is a problem soil - then it is almost guaranteed that you will have to make such a decision.  The difference between these types of foundations lies in their price, materials used, and work technologies.  So, if you have to build on heaving, clay and peat soils, then you can not do without a tiled base.  Their danger is that they are unstable and have a high content of groundwater.  Because of this, natural shrinkage and periodic movement occur.  Otherwise, the construction will not last long and problems can arise even at the construction stages. </p><p>  If you plan to build a basement in a house with a strip foundation, you need to make sure that the conditions are the most common and will not bring any problems in the future.  This is important for simple designs.  And if the conversation is about a house with a basement, then this moment should be given special attention. </p><h2>  About the stages </h2><p>  Features of construction depend on the soil in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork and the selected project of the house.  But despite the presence of such differences, the stages always have a certain degree of similarity.  For example, if a tiled base is being built, then this is characteristic for: </p><ol><li>  Preparation and calculation of the cost of work, procurement of materials and ordering equipment. </li><li>  Digging a pit, removing soil. </li><li>  Creating under the base of a pillow of sand and gravel. </li><li>  Pouring cement screed. </li><li>  Arrangement of hydro and thermal insulation. </li><li>  The construction of the foundation itself. </li><li>  If necessary, create a drainage system. </li><li>  Hydro and thermal insulation of the basement. </li><li>  Finishing a year or two after the main work has been completed. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, creating a foundation for a house with a basement is not so difficult as it might seem at first glance, although not as easy as we would like. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Conducting training and the first stages of work </h2><div class="photo" data-original="andersonhomeswi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="basement for a house with a basement" class="if uuid-2716645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2716645.jpg"></div><p>  Construction is a sphere of human activity.  And here, just as everywhere, the old adage ‚Äúvictory loves preparation‚Äù acts.  In this case, it is needed to get a good result.  You should start with accurate calculations of the basis, budget estimates and the preparation of the plan.  The cost of creating a structure is taken into account taking into account the necessary building materials, ordering equipment, trucks and wages of wage workers.  Then the excavation work begins.  If a reinforced concrete base is selected, what is necessary for this material is taken into account.  Adjustments may be made to the original work plan.  In this case, it is very important to have time to fill the base in one day.  After all, any delay leads to a decrease in the strength of the created structure. </p><p>  Lorries and machinery are needed in the early stages.  And saving on this item is not recommended.  So, trucks are necessary in order to take out all the excess land.  An excavator will help to dig a pit faster.  So, without it, this business can drag on for several weeks (if the labor of workers is used) or even months (provided that only the owner of the house will work).  Although a lot depends on the soil, it is better not to neglect such a good opportunity to speed up the process.  But absolutely everything should not be taken out.  It is recommended to leave a certain part of the soil in order to fill the foundation.  Usually it is built below the level of freezing.  Initially, the contours of the building to be created should be outlined on the ground. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Then the excavator begins its work.  It is advisable that all excess soil not be stored nearby, but immediately immersed in cars.  Fortunately, the speed of the excavator will not allow them to stand idle.  The resulting bottom must be cleaned and tamped by hand.  Well, now everything is ready to create a design. </p><h2>  Foundation creation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.affordablewaterproofingllc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="basement basement waterproofing" class="if uuid-2716644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2716644.jpg"></div><p>  If there is no desire to do all this yourself, then you can always contact a special company that will create the foundation with a turnkey basement.  But this requires money.  So, after everything is ready, it is necessary to equip the lower part of the base.  For this, several layers of sand and gravel are filled up.  Each of them must be carefully rammed.  This is necessary in order to avoid the formation of air voids. </p><p>  Then the cement screed is poured.  It is extremely necessary because of the fulfillment of two important roles.  First of all, it is engaged in leveling the territory on which the foundation is located.  Secondly, it is needed for thermal and waterproofing, without which a foundation with a basement (if it is created for a long period of time, and not for a year or two) will not do.  When the screed hardens, it is necessary to lay an additional layer of insulation on it.  After that, you can already begin to fill the foundation slabs under the house with a basement.  This stage can be divided into several parts.  First of all, the formwork is being installed.  Without this extremely important element, the design of most of the bases with a basement can not do. </p><p>  What is he like?  This element looks like a forming base, due to which the desired form of concrete is created, which subsequently remains during its solidification.  For greater strength, reinforcement of the formwork is carried out.  To avoid problems, this should be done in accordance with available calculations.  For a strong connection, it is recommended to use valve outlets with a length of one meter. </p><h2>  We are approaching the completion of work </h2><p>  In cases where the weather is hot, drying concrete should be watered.  This allows you to compensate for the evaporating moisture, which is necessary for hydration of the material.  It usually takes two to three days to dry concrete.  With a close occurrence of groundwater, attention must also be paid to the creation of drainage.  How it's done.  For this, special pipes are laid below the level of the base of the house.  And at the last stage, a blind area (waterproof coating around the structure) is created.  This approach allows you to protect the foundation of the house with a basement from sedimentary water. </p><p>  For greater strength, the base should also be covered with a layer of hydro and thermal insulation.  After the foundation was completed for the house with a basement, you should wait a year or two, and you can carry out finishing work.  Then comes the time for facing and painting the base.  So, in general, the foundation is created with a basement with one's own hands (or with the involvement of hired workers).  This is not such a simple matter as we would like.  For successful work it is necessary to have a certain experience and knowledge.  Therefore, if there is no self-confidence, then it is better to turn to the services of a professional team.  Specialists will help determine what type of foundation is needed, make all the necessary calculations and deal with the most difficult stages. </p><h2>  About specific features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="forstconsultingllc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="basement in a house with a strip foundation" class="if uuid-2716650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2716650.jpg"></div><p>  The general scheme of how to build a foundation for a house with a basement with their own hands was considered.  But, as you know, the <span>devil is in the details.</span>  And if such an unusual design (with a basement) is of interest, then you can‚Äôt do without them.  First of all, you need to decide why you need to do all this. </p><p>  If it is planned to place a pantry in the basement, then this is one thing.  The installation of a heating boiler is another.  The placement of a utility room (or a place to relax) is the third.  Although the purpose of the cardinally does not affect the entire design, it can change individual nuances.  For example, you need a pantry.  In this case, it is necessary to ensure that the room is dry, cool and a certain proportion of natural ventilation can be allowed. </p><p>  For this, hydro and thermal insulation is carried out in accordance with all the rules, but one hole is left that connects with the environment.  At the same time, it can be blocked by various heat-resistant materials to maintain a certain temperature level (or without them, if the external conditions are quite satisfactory).  Whereas when planning a vacation room or study, a similar option may be unsatisfactory.  And the best solution would be to use artificial climate controls. </p><p>  The easiest option is to create ventilation, which will be connected to the interior of the house.  But this requires a good calculation of the basement basement, because such cavities can become a weak point.  In this case, you can pay attention to artificial systems, such as air filtration, ionization, regenerative devices. </p><h2>  Little tricks </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.beaniedana.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="basement with turnkey basement" class="if uuid-2716646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2716646.jpg"></div><p>  If there is a desire or need to do it yourself, it‚Äôs better to hand over some details to specialists.  For example, the development of a foundation project.  It is better if experienced professionals do this.  But here you can cheat.  And making the foundation for a house with a basement, take information from a project that is in the public domain.  Using such a small trick allows you to avoid errors during construction.  Indeed, if they are allowed, then in the future they will result in serious additional spending. </p><p>  It is unlikely that it will be a straightforward ideal project, suitable for existing conditions, but the knowledge of mathematics should help to adapt it to a specific construction.  You should also think about the height of the basement.  The fact is that many initially think about creating its height at the level of ordinary living rooms, that is, more than two meters.  But in practice, so much is not needed.  Yes, and this leads to additional costs. </p><p>  Therefore, it is recommended to be limited to the growth of the tallest person, that is, about 1.8 m. In some cases, even this value can be cut down (if you plan to create a pantry komorki, then you can do 1.5 m). </p><h2>  About waterproofing </h2><p>  A man cannot do without water.  But it can bring inconvenience.  So, if the waterproofing of the basement foundation is unsatisfactory, this leads to mold, dampness, damage to the contents (furniture, things, food).  Therefore, you need to take good care of this moment.  Best of all, if the basement basement is waterproofed bilaterally: that is, it is implemented both on its external part and in its internal part.  Although this approach is quite costly, it provides substantial protection against rainfall, groundwater, and flooding inside the house.  In this case, it is important what material is chosen to provide waterproofing, how high-quality it is. </p><p>  It is better not to save here, since the conditions of its use depend on this.  If you choose poor-quality waterproofing, encroaching on a low price, this will lead to the fact that money will literally be thrown into the wind.  But not everything that is expensive deserves attention.  So, for example, one should recognize the dominance of low-quality products, which are sold at exorbitant prices, which gives the impression that it is of high quality.  But this is a misleading impression. </p><p>  Therefore, it is better to prepare for the choice thoroughly.  For example, if it is determined that it is better to use roofing material for waterproofing, then you need to decide how the quality material looks in order not to choose a cheap fake. </p><h2>  Certain moments in independent work </h2><div class="photo" data-original="basementspecialist.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="foundation for a home with a basement do it yourself" class="if uuid-2716651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2716651.jpg"></div><p>  So, let's say that there is no money for hired builders, but we need to work.  In this case, it will not be superfluous to find out a couple of points.  Firstly, the depth of the foundation always refers to the height of the mounted reinforced concrete foundation.  Secondly, it is recommended to use wooden pegs and ropes for marking the ground.  The outline of the contour in this way allows you to get accurate and stable parameters. </p><p>  To do this, the stakes are driven into the ground, and twine is stretched between them.  This is effective in comparison with other approaches, such as drawing lines with a shovel, as it allows for evenness and accuracy.  But in the end, the size of the excavated pit (if a monolithic foundation is being built with a basement) or trenches (for tape structures) should be slightly larger than the structure being created.  This is necessary in order to install formwork and struts.  When digging, care must be taken to ensure that the walls are even and without protrusions.  If you do not, then the soil will put pressure on the structure and may bring it down. </p><p>  When working with formwork, so that they are stable, slopes and struts are used.  But that's not all.  As formwork, it is better to use boards with a thickness of two centimeters.  On the side that will come into contact with concrete, they should be planed and soaked in water.  In addition to the aforementioned reinforcement with meter rods for greater adhesion of various elements, one should also take care of increasing the strength of the structure itself. </p><p>  What does that require?  Rods with a thickness of 8-12 millimeters of round or square shape will allow you to create a reinforcing belt.  But this is not the only option.  As an alternative, reinforcing mesh can be used.  The size of its cells should be at least 15 centimeters.  And for such construction it is better to use concrete of the M500 brand or higher. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wcibasementrepair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="basement with basement" class="if uuid-2716654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/2716654.jpg"></div><p>  That‚Äôs how to make a foundation with a basement.  If there is no work experience, it is advisable, at least, to study very well the achievements of other people.  View photo reports, read recommendations, find out from those who have already done similar work.  All this will create a reliable and durable design. </p>
