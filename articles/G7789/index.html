No problem!  Sewing a rooster costume is not at all difficult.  A few practical tips on making patterns, choosing materials and the secrets of creating individual details of the outfit will help to create the perfect look that will be remembered for a long time by both the child and others.  But first things first. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rooster costume" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1114208.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Image Details </h2><p>  Perhaps you should start with the main one - a sketch of the costume.  You should consider all the details, from the boots on the legs and ending with a comb.  The costume of the rooster must be with a magnificent tail, with a silk beard, as in the well-known saying, with wings and a beautiful beak.  How to arrange all this and create not only a beautiful, but also a comfortable outfit?  This will be discussed further. </p><h2>  Costume Materials </h2><p>  <span>Christmas costumes for children</span> must be colorful, especially if it is such a motley character, like a rooster.  Here you should use bright saturated colors: red, orange, green, blue, yellow, lilac.  For contrast, you can add black, but very little so that the outfit does not turn out gloomy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This outfit can be quite budgetary, since the best solution for it regarding fabric is nylon.  Here, the assortment of colors is as it should, and the price is one of the lowest, and it‚Äôs quite ‚Äúflexible‚Äù in work, and in combination with accessories for tailoring it will keep its shape. </p><p>  The only thing for a hat is to take a supplex.  It stretches perfectly and is better than other fabrics for this purpose. </p><p>  You will also need about a meter of synthetic winterizer with a thickness of 2 cm for tail feathers, about 4 meters of plastic corset bone, a tape for the belt (best kipper width of at least 5 cm), a section of Velcro 5 cm wide and about 7-8 cm long, threads in fabric color . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas costumes for children" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1114211.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  If the rooster costume is not planned to be made on the basis of a regular shirt and trousers, then a piece of biflex or satin for overalls will be required.  In this case, the color can be chosen white or yellow, or you can tone one of the colored feathers in the tail. </p><h2>  Costume Options </h2><p>  It is more convenient to make New Year's suits for children from only accessories.  This will allow not to completely change the child‚Äôs clothes, but only add a few details to standard trousers and a shirt, and the image is ready.  In this case, it can be a hat with a scallop, beak and eyes, a drape with beard-like ties, wings with elastic bands, a tail on a belt and fabric boots with spurs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, a rooster costume for a boy can consist of a full-length jumpsuit fastened in front with a zipper with a tail sewn in, wings and beard and a properly designed hood. </p><p>  Here, one should proceed from the budget allocated to the image and, of course, expediency.  Indeed, in the first and second cases, the costume comes out quite spectacular and shocking. </p><h2>  Tail making </h2><p>  The tail of a rooster is his pride.  Therefore, it is necessary to work hard on its creation.  This is especially true of the form.  He should not be hanging.  First of all, you should make patterns for feathers.  No, these are not small details at all, these are rather long elements in the form of hooks of different sizes.  In total, 4 different sizes are needed, each such pen must be made in two or three colors.  Details should be cut out of fabric, duplicated with a synthetic winterizer and sew a corset bone from edge to edge along the outer edge of the bent hook. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rooster costume for boy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1114220.jpg" width="357"></div>

    <p>  In total, 12 feathers should be obtained, one size for each color selected for the outfit.  A beautiful combination will come out when using yellow, blue, green and red. </p><p>  Next, all these elements need to be laid out with the tail with the direction of the hooks in one direction and stitched in this order to the <span>keeper tape</span> or sewn into the middle back seam of the jumpsuit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Creating hats </h2><p>  A hat with a beautiful scallop and beak will complement the rooster costume in an original way.  The pattern of this image detail is built on the basis of the head circumference and is essentially a semicircle with a pointed edge at one seam (especially for the face) and a comb combed into the seam of the part connection, duplicated by synthetic winterizer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rooster tail" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1114224.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Beak and eyes can be made of felt and glued with hot glue or sewn by hand.  Slices of the hats from supplex can not be processed, this fabric will already look quite neat. </p><p>  Instead of a hat, you can make the most ordinary felt mask. </p><h2>  Creating Wings and Drape </h2><p>  What is a rooster costume without wings?  But how to wave your hands and crow?  This image detail is sewn even easier than a hat.  For it, it is necessary to cut out different sizes of circles from the 4 primary colors of the fabric, making them small waves along the contour.  Next, in the decreasing order, superimpose all the wing elements on top of each other and lay a line in the middle.  On one side, you should sew an elastic band the size of the wrist of the child, and on the other, a piece of tape equal to the width of the back.  The second wing is made similarly.  After the tape is attached to the pelerine.  This part of the costume also lies in the form of a circle with waves around the perimeter.  The part is cut to the center, a neckline is made and a red ribbon of the same nylon is sewn along the edge.  In the center from the back they grab a tape of wings.  Thus, a single piece with a goatee and wings comes out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baby rooster costume" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1114219.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  <span>How to sew a jumpsuit</span> for the base of the suit? </h2><p>  <span>Children's costume of a</span> rooster can be made in the form of overalls.  To create a pattern, you can go the easiest way.  Take pants and a child‚Äôs t-shirt, fold in half and transfer to the paper all the main seams of the product for the front and back halves of the thing.  In this case, panties and a t-shirt should be combined along the waistline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rooster costume pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1114267.jpg" width="301"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Next, the template needs to be increased in width so that the product does not hamper the movements and sit freely on the figure.  When cutting, you should get two shelves for the front and two halves of the back with one-piece pants.  In front, the seam should be grinded and processed, but in the incision on the back, zipper and tail should be sewn. </p><p>  Jumpsuit is best done in the same color as the hat.  But also a good option with a hood.  For him, you need to measure the child‚Äôs head: the volume and length from the forehead to the back of the head through the crown.  Next, draw a rectangle on a piece of paper with sides comprising ¬Ω of the head volume and ¬Ω of the length.  On the upper right side, you need to carefully round the corner, this will be the crown.  To the back of the head (lower left corner), the line should be shifted 3 cm inside the drawing. The right side of the rectangle should be lengthened 3 cm down and the sewing section cut with a curved line. </p><p>  You may need to slightly adjust the neck of the overalls so that it fits with the slice of the alignment of the hood.  It should be noted that in this embodiment, the zipper must be sewn into the incision of the front halves, and only the tail should be attached to the middle seam of the back.  However, this is not necessary, because if the accessory is on the belt, it will be more securely fixed in the correct position. </p><h2>  Paphos Above All: Spur Boots </h2><p>  How to sew a rooster costume spectacular so that it stands out from the rest of the images?  Naturally complement it with details.  Boots with spurs and claws or shoes in the shape of a cock's paw is the best option!  This element of the image will definitely not remain out of sight of the admiring others.  It can be executed in the form of golfs at the top on an elastic band and without a foot.  For spurs and nails it will be necessary to sew small and narrow caps from felt or satin fabric, fill them with padding polyester and insert them into the back seam of the golfs and three in the center in front of the legs.  Ideally, these claws should cover the child‚Äôs shoes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a rooster costume" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1114226.jpg" width="369"></div>

    <p>  Such a rooster costume will definitely not be left without attention.  Colorful wings, a beautiful beard in the form of a bow from a pelerine tied around the neck, a bright red scallop, and of course, red paws with yellow claws - this is ideal for a spectacular appearance of a baby on a New Year's party or in a production.  A little imagination, effort, minimal cost - and the costume is ready! </p>
