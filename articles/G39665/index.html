In addition to the beautiful seascapes, clean beaches, rich tropical nature, rich cultural program, Thailand also offers tourists an unimaginable mix of impressions from Thai spas, parties, Thai cuisine and street life.  Centuries-old Buddhist temples and the most famous centers of sex tourism, untouched paradises of nature and crowded bustling eastern metropolitan areas, expensive shopping centers and street markets.  Thailand has so many contrasts, so much life and experience that it leaves no one indifferent. </p><p>  Holidays in Thailand for Russian tourists are almost not overshadowed by any formalities.  Citizens of the Russian Federation and most CIS countries do not need a visa to travel to Thailand for less than 60 days, and customs rules are very loyal. </p><p>  The regionalization of Thai resorts is surprisingly specific.  The specialization of tourist areas in Thailand is not dictated even by climatic or natural features, but rather by their cultural difference. </p><p>  Capital Bangkok attracts pilgrims, business travelers, lovers of shopping and city breaks.  The islands of Samui and Phuket are distinguished by faultless beaches, clear sea, beautiful landscapes.  They attract lovers of classic relaxation, privacy and first-class relaxation.  The islands of Chang, Tao and Phi Phi are suitable for tourists who appreciate the natural beauty, pristine landscapes and pristine tropics.  And bright, Pattaya invites young, cheerful and noisy budget tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About the bustling resort of Pattaya </h2><p>  Pattaya is the most colorful and full-blooded <span>resort in Thailand.</span>  Tens of thousands of Russian and European young gambling travelers are eager to visit this already crowded corner in search of new experiences.  Thanks to regular and chartered flights, Pattaya is able to cope with these ongoing flows.  It is only an hour away from the main airport of the country of Suvarnabhumi, but Pattaya has its own air gate - U-Tapao Regional Airport, it accepts charter flights in high periods. </p>

    <p>  Another nuance of rest in Pattaya is that, with all its attractiveness and non-triviality, Pattaya is not very suitable for lovers of an unstressed holiday on the coast.  The sea on this site can hardly be called "clean as a tear," and the coast is filled with tourists "to the eyeballs."  But for lovers of adventure, parties, street festivals, courage, outdoor activities, shopping and new acquaintances, Pattaya is ideal. </p><h2>  How to choose a hotel in Pattaya? </h2><p>  When choosing a hotel in Pattaya, one should take into account the atmosphere and the nature of relaxation in the area.  <span>It is the domain of</span> nightlife, crowded streets and ubiquitous markets.  There are, nevertheless, several expensive high-ranking hotels, but their distribution contradicts the very essence of this ever-walking and forever young resort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, in Thailand there is practically no logic in assigning star status to hotels.  Accreditation of establishments, accommodation here is so bizarre that a five-star hotel can easily be inferior to the modest three in the selection and quality of services. </p>

    <h2>  Tsix5 Hotel 3 * Thailand Pattaya Naklua </h2><p>  The hotel was opened in 2009.  It consists of two seven-story buildings (TSX5 and TSX 5.25).  The hotel has a total of 189 rooms. </p><p>  The hotel belongs to the same network, along with the Zign, Garden Sea View hotels, so that the Tsix5 Hotel guests can use the infrastructure in the territory of all three hotels. </p><p>  Upon check-in, a deposit of 2 thousand baht is required for the entire stay.  Upon eviction, the deposit is returned. </p><p>  The hotel does not include pets. </p><p>  No smoking rooms. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Tsix5 Hotel 4 is located in the village of Naklua in the north of Pattaya.  Naklua is a 20-minute drive from the southern center of Pattaya, with its shopping malls, clubs and other amenities.  The town itself is inhabited mainly by fishermen, this place is known for the freshest seafood, they are served in most restaurants or cooked right at the exit of the largest fish market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Despite the small remoteness of Naklua from the noisy Pattaya beach, this place is not at all deaf and not dull.  For those tourists who do not want to travel 15-20 minutes by taxi or tuk-tuk to the south of the island, there are many shopping centers, cafes and attractions in Naklua itself. </p><p>  For example, Central Festival Pattaya Big C is just 2 km from Tsix5 Hotel Pattaya. </p><p>  Naklua Beach is 800 meters away.  Hotel Zign's beach is even closer, and it is also at the guests' disposal, but according to tourist reviews, this beach is more suitable for fishing than for a beach holiday. </p><p>  In walking distance from the hotel there is the main attraction of northern Pattaya - the Temple of Truth (Sanctuary of Truth), a completely wooden temple complex, built without a single nail.  The building of the cathedral, 105 meters high, is recognized as the most impressive wooden structure in Thailand.  Also near the hotel there is a dolphinarium, an equestrian club. </p>

    <p>  Bangkok's main airport, Suvarnabhumi, is 126 km from the hotel, while U-Tapao Air Port is 35 km away. </p><h2>  Hotel Orientation </h2><p>  Like most hotels in Pattaya, Tsix5 Hotel is most focused on young and active customers.  As such, there are no animations or show programs in the hotel itself.  For a variety of entertainment, you should rush to the very center of Pattaya on Walking Street.  The convenient location of the hotel, the comfort of the rooms and the quality of services make it quite suitable for business travelers and even families with children. </p><p>  Rest at this hotel does not oblige you to anything.  This is probably the most pleasant bonus for guests.  After all, even though the Tsix5 Hotel is located in Pattaya, the specific town of Naklua in the north of the district is a rather peaceful place, which at first glance resembles more a fishing village.  And all the amenities of nightlife and loud pastime can be experienced by driving only 15 minutes to the center of Pattaya.  Naturally, after stormy parties or gambling shopping, it is not very pleasant to go back to the hotel, especially in the very central center of Pattaya budget hotels are also "a dime a dozen."  But, a valuable nuance of any holiday, especially saturated with night festivities, is a complete dream, and the opportunity to sleep sweetly, alas, is not very accessible to tourists who settled in the epicenter of Pattaya resort. </p><p>  If you look at the ethnic composition of the guests, then the Tsix5 Hotel 3 * rests mainly Russians, less Europeans, there are Chinese, Belarusians, Ukrainians and residents of Central Asia.  The hotel staff knows English, there are several Russian-speaking staff. </p><h2>  Infrastructure at the hotel </h2><p>  <span>Hotel Tsix5 Hotel</span> 3 * has a small territory and a very modest infrastructure.  However, a big bonus for guests is that they are allowed to walk and use the territory of the neighboring Zign 5 * and Garden Sea View 5 * hotels, swim in their large pools, go to restaurants, take their children to playgrounds.  All these hotels belong to the same network and have a common management. </p>
