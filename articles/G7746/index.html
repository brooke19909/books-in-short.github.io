    <h2>  Fratricidal Battle of the Alta River </h2><p>  The story of the most famous battle that took place in 1019 dates back to the death of the <span>Prince of Kiev, Vladimir the</span> Great, who died four years before and left behind four sons.  Two of them, Yaroslav and Svyatopolk, at the head of their squads, converged on the banks of the Altai, striving with their sword to make their way to the power they desired.  The closest kinship with the holy baptist of Russia did not prevent them from staining their swords with fraternal blood. </p><p>  Four years earlier, at the hands of the murderers sent by Svyatopolk, who corrected all divine and human laws in order to gain power, their other two brothers, Boris and Gleb, were canonized then canonized in the guise of the holy martyrs.  For this atrocity, Svyatopolk received the nickname "Cursed" from his descendants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The bloody stages of the power struggle </h2><p>  <span>The battle on the Alta River</span> (year 1019) was not the first clash between the brothers.  Twice before, the enemy of the human race darkened their minds with a thirst for power, pushing them to bloodshed for the sake of worldly fame and fortune.  This happened for the first time in 1016.  After the blessed death of their equally apostolic parent, the power in Kiev passed to Svyatopolk, but the impudent Yaroslav got himself the reign of victory over his brother, won by him in the battle of Lyubich. </p><p>  The second time, their blood shed two years later on the banks of the <span>Western Bug,</span> when Svyatopolk, craving for revenge, called for help from his father-in-law, King of Poland Boleslav I, and took his brother‚Äôs squad to flight.  However, his triumph did not last long - having received the territorial concessions promised for their assistance and fearing popular discontent caused by their presence, the Poles left Svyatopolk to their fate.  Fearing to be hanged for his betrayal, the treacherous prince fled to the Pechenegs, thus losing the Kiev throne to his brother Yaroslav. </p>

    <h2>  Battle between siblings </h2><p>  And finally, the battle on the Alta River became the end of their confrontation.  History has kept very limited information about it.  But from the ancient annals of chronicle it is known that this time too, Svyatopolk used the help of foreigners to achieve his goal, bringing with him on the battlefield the Pechenegs, seducing them with generous promises. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Yaroslav, being no less power-hungry than his brother, nevertheless relied only on the support of his compatriots, without resorting to the help of foreigners and without selling Russian lands.  He managed to gather a significant army in Novgorod, armed and equipped at the expense of the townspeople themselves.  The point on their dispute was the battle on the Alta River. </p><p>  History has not preserved accurate information about exactly where Vladimirovichi met in a deadly battle.  It is only known that this happened on the very spot where in July 1015 the life of their third brother, Boris, was cut short.  Ancient chronicles report that the cruel slaughter lasted all day and turned into a complete victory for Yaroslav's squad. </p><p>  God's wrath that fell on Svyatopolk that day was a worthy retribution for his former treachery.  Saving his life, he tried to escape through Poland to the Czech Republic, but died on the way, struck by the disease.  The Kiev throne went to his brother, who went down in history under the name of <span>Yaroslav the Wise.</span> </p>

    <h2>  New heirs to princely power </h2><p>  Another battle on the Alta River is known, the date of which is 1068.  This event was a sad page in the history of Russia, but the memory of it has survived in the chronicle vaults that have survived.  By this time, the rulers of Russia were the sons of the late Kiev prince Yaroslav the Wise - Vsevolod, Svyatoslav and Izyaslav.  Having concentrated all power in their hands, they also managed to subjugate Smolensk and Volyn, which until then had maintained their independence. </p><p>  Their triumvirate tried to maintain peace with a strong and aggressive neighbor - the Polovtsian khan Sharukan.  In 1055, he even managed to conclude a semblance of a peace treaty with him.  However, after six years, having corrected his promises, the Polovtsy invaded Russia, passing along the left bank of the Dnieper. </p><h2>  Defeat of the princes on the shores of Alta </h2><p>  Up until 1068, nomad raids continued, as a result of which the prince brothers were forced to meet them at the head of a large squad.  The outcome of the campaign was the battle on the Alta River.  The history of the date of this event has not been preserved; the details of what happened on that sad day on the banks of the Altai are also hidden from us.  We only know about the brutal defeat suffered by the Russian squad from the troops of the Polovtsian khan Sharukan. </p>

    <p>  Encouraged by the victory, the nomads intensified their raids, robbing defenseless villagers and approaching close to Kiev.  The indignant citizens demanded from their rulers, who had so ingloriously returned from the campaign, to immediately distribute weapons to everyone and organize a militia, and when they were refused, they raised a rebellion that almost cost the scandalous princes of their supreme authority. </p>
