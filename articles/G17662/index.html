Before the revolution, this mansion belonged to Prince Lobanov-Rostovsky.  Facades, the main entrance, <span>sculptures of lions, the</span> vaults of the first and ground floors, as well as the main staircase in this building are historical objects protected by the state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gcprive.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Interiors" class="if uuid-2548733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2548733.jpg"></div><p>  This hotel is decorated in a luxurious Napoleonic Empire style.
