Numismatics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today we will discuss rare coins of the USSR of 1961-1991.  Collecting in all its manifestations, be it philately, collecting books, compiling collections of paintings, interior items, porcelain, is interesting and fascinating.  Collectors of various objects compile collections on the subject, authorship of objects, eras, etc., and replenishing them with new and valuable exhibits is the essence of collecting.  Numismatists, or coin collectors, can say the same about themselves.  But not always the decoration of the collection can serve as metallic money of the past. </p><p>  There are rare coins of the USSR of 1961-1991, which are no less interesting, expensive and of some value.  And their significance is not in the fact that they were minted in some century, but in some flaws in the production or errors in the dates.  If we consider the <span>old banknotes</span> , then their value is obvious.  The older the coin, the greater the price it has.  Indeed, in the old days the circulation of coins was extremely small.  In addition, over time, such banknotes become less and less, and this makes them unique. </p><h2>  What affects the value of a coin </h2>

It all depends on how many banknotes were issued.  The smaller the circulation, the more valuable and rarer the item.  Appearance: the better the coin is preserved, the more valuable it is.  If it was not used at all for its intended purpose, its cost will be an order of magnitude higher than similar counterparts.  Such banknotes are called bagged among collectors.  If a coin is important for replenishing a certain collection, complements it in spirit or in production time, then its value also increases.  The presence of a marriage or flaw in minting significantly increases the cost of the product.  Such specimens are very rare and are of interest to collectors.

For it, you can gain from 10 to 80 rubles.  It all depends on the appearance.  But, for example, connoisseurs can pay 2 thousand rubles for a banknote on the 150th anniversary of K. L. Timiryazev.

Other banknotes were also issued in honor of this date, but they are less known.  The history of creation is as follows.  In October 1917, the October Revolution took place, which predetermined the Bolsheviks' rise to power.  Half a century later, in 1967, it was decided to celebrate the event by minting a special commemorative coin.  So the ruble that interests us appeared.  However, he was not alone.  They created a whole series dedicated to this date.  Coins were issued in denominations of 10, 15, 20 and 50 kopecks.  The idea was that banknotes would be in the hands of all citizens of the country, and each person would remember that half a century was fulfilled by the system in force at that time.  This concludes the description of the rarest coins of the USSR of 1961-1991.
