It has not only a wonderful name, but also a beautiful legend.  Ancient legends say that near these places the dragon once abducted a beautiful girl.  Now she again seeks to return to the people and falls from the rocks with water, saving the local population from drought.  There is also a legend that there used to be a sea.  A metal ring was found on the topmost rock, which could serve to secure the ships.  However, this is not known for certain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wuchang-Su Waterfall" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/458016.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Uchan-Su waterfall is not only the largest waterfall in the territory of Crimea, but also one of the largest in the countries of the former CIS.  However, he attracts tourists not only in size, but also in his unusually beautiful nature.  Almost any guide traveling with a group to Yalta must at least mention this natural monument.  7 kilometers from the city of Yalta, the Uchan-Su waterfall lurks high in the mountains.  On the way to the <span>Swallow‚Äôs Nest</span> castle <span>,</span> you can see only the edge of the brownish gorge and a white point - a water intake house on the territory of the waterfall, which is almost invisible from such a distance.  However, in springtime, even from here you can see how two strands of water fall from the upper cliffs - this is Uchan-Su waterfall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wuchang-Su waterfall how to get" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/458023.jpg" width="479"></div>

But she is very dangerous.  When traveling by car, you must follow certain precautions.  Do not accelerate to a speed of more than 40 km per hour.  The track winds along the mountain slopes, it has many sharp turns, descents and ascents.  Low speed will help to cope well with the serpentine road, and passengers are not cradled during the journey.  The track was built in tsarist times.  Construction began in 1858.  Initially, only a section was made from Yalta to Uchan-Su (it was already ready in 1872).  The construction of the road was completed by 1888. </p><p>  You can also take a walk, starting from the A.P.  Chekhov in Yalta. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  A small but well-groomed path leads to the waterfall itself.  The car can be left at souvenir shops on the highway.  Entrance to the waterfall is paid.  However, strangely enough, in the spring cashiers are not always in place, so you can enter the protected area for free.  It should be said right away that in the spring the waterfall is much more beautiful and richer than in the summer.  The entire road to it is well designed and equipped. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo Wuchang-Su Waterfall" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/458029.jpg" width="220"></div>  There are stairs leading to the cascades of the waterfall, and observation platforms.  At one of the rapids, the Mogaba reservoir was built.  On the approaches to it is a small house.  On its roof is a <span>sculpture of an eagle, an</span> inhabitant of the Crimea.  Many tourists manage to climb to it to tie a ribbon not to one of the pines along the road to the waterfall, but to the neck of this magnificent bird.  From this place you can see how large portions of water break down from the rocks and collapse down.  No wonder the name of the waterfall from the <span>Crimean Tatar language is</span> translated as "flying water".  But the original name (Greek) Kremasto-Nero (which means "hanging water") is more suitable if you watch it from afar.

In the summer, tourists can come close to jets of water falling down.  But in the spring, the volume of water is much larger, which makes it difficult to approach the waterfall, but it looks more impressive.  One of the local historians noted that in June you can see only one fifth of all the power of Wuchang-Su.  Therefore, it is best to come here in March or April, when the river gained a lot of water from melting snow and rain.  Standing next to Wuchang-Su at such a time is simply impossible: clothes and shoes are getting wet, and the sound of falling water is deafening.  Its power and grandeur can be seen even in the photo. </p><p>  Wuchang-Su waterfall originates from the eponymous river with a length of 7 kilometers.  There are more than one waterfall on its way, there are three of them.  Wuchang-Su, the largest, is located at an altitude of 390 meters above sea level.  Above there are two more waterfalls, the height of one of which reaches 16 meters.  In especially cold winters, the water here freezes and tourists can observe the icefall, which in itself is very dangerous.  However, there were daredevils who not only admired the beauty of the ice waterfall, but also climbed it on the upper ledge.  So, in the 1980s, such a ‚Äúfeat‚Äù was made by climber Yuri Lishaev. </p>

    <h2>  Nature </h2><p>  The road to the waterfall passes through a beautiful park with tall, mighty pine trees - this is what Crimea is famous for.  Uchan-Su Waterfall is also an opportunity to see the so-called Yalta Amphitheater.  Tall pine trees sweep the city in a ring, creating an amazing sight.  Pines in Crimea differ from the north by their trunk, which has a grayish tint (they are also called Palassa pine).  The air here is crystal clear.  Firstly, due to the fact that cars cannot be reached, and secondly, because pine trees produce a large number of phytanicides that cleanse the air and make it truly healing.  Often trees are attached to the rocks themselves, preventing their destruction from rain and moisture.  Streams of water rushing from the tops of the mountains form streams and channels, washing away stones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea waterfall Uchan-Su" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/458024.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <h2>  Waterfall surroundings </h2><p>  You can continue walking in the surroundings of Yalta along the <span>Botkin Trail.</span>  It is named after the famous Russian doctor and scientist Peter Botkin.  The path is surrounded by a beech-oak forest.  Thanks to such plants, the air of these places has healing properties.  The trail leads through the most beautiful Crimean landscapes with a view of the mountains.  You can complete your walk in the Yalta Zoo.  Shuttles and buses back to the city also run from here. </p>
