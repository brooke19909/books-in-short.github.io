And it cannot but impress.  River walks along the Neva became one of the favorite and most entertaining entertainments of tourists, because where, if not on board a boat or motor ship, you can really feel the heartbeat of this beautiful city, in which streets breathe the past and majestic architectural monuments froze forever, and each the courtyard beckons with its secrets. </p><h2>  North Venice </h2><p>  St. Petersburg has long been considered one of the most beautiful cities in the world: famous palaces and museums, monuments and architectural ensembles.  But its splendor is impossible to imagine without bridges and canals, embankments and, of course, rivers.  The main waterway of the city is the majestic and wide Neva with its sleeves. </p>

They are all very different: quiet, stormy, winding.  Urban architecture and the surrounding water are inseparable, they make up an integral, single ensemble.  More than three hundred bridges stretch over the canals and rivers of St. Petersburg: stone and steel, movable and suspended.  Their splendor and diversity surrounds the city with special romantic beauty.  For this, St. Petersburg is called Venice of the North.

It was on it that more than three hundred years ago, a beautiful and majestic city was founded, now called St. Petersburg.  And this river is truly unique.  Despite its small length - about 74 kilometers - it carries the same amount of water as the Don and the Dnieper together.  Neva is the only river that flows from Lake Ladoga.  On its shores there are such cities: Kirovsk, Otradnoye, Shlisselburg and St. Petersburg. </p><p>  Its name is also interesting.  According to one version, it means “new river”.  In another, the name comes from the Finnish word meaning "deep swamp".  And there are as many attractions on its shores as perhaps not a single river in the world has seen.  Therefore, boat trips along the Neva have long been a favorite form of leisure for citizens and travelers. </p>

    <h2>  Night romance </h2><p>  Those who are in St. Petersburg for the first time should definitely take a night boat trip.  This city is delightfully beautiful in daylight, but in the dark it becomes special.  Mysterious sculptures, the magic of city lights, carved railings of bridges hiding in the darkness. </p><p>  Night walks on the Neva are truly unforgettable impressions.  Therefore, they always remain popular.  Especially among couples in love.  After all, what could be more romantic than an ardent confession or an offer of a hand and heart to the quiet rustle of the Neva in the twilight of the night city.  In addition, only at this time of day you can admire the bridges - one of the most exciting shows in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  And we must not forget about the real symbol of the city - the white nights.  They are repeatedly sung by writers, depicted on the immortal canvases of famous painters.  Only at the beginning of summer can one witness a unique phenomenon, when the skies glow with a soft light, and a soft pastel haze reigns over the endless water surface.  River walks at this time are especially beautiful. </p><h2>  Bridges </h2><p>  As mentioned above, in St. Petersburg there are about three hundred bridges.  Some of them are regularly bred.  This is due to the fact that they serve not only for car and pedestrian traffic, but also for shipping.  But modern ships cannot pass under the old bridge, so they have a lifting part, which opens when breeding to let the vessels pass. </p>

It is produced on a strict schedule.  Interestingly, bridges are always bred at night.  An exception is made only for public holidays - then this spectacle can be admired during the day.

    <p>  Most often, divorced bridges are observed in the central part of the city.  The most famous of them is the Palace.  Many travel companies offer customers special tours.  They can be sailed on a ship under seven magnificent bridges at the time of their breeding.  And all this with solemn live music. </p><p>  Such a night walk is the best you can think of for those who still believe in miracles.  However, once in St. Petersburg, everyone falls under the influence of this amazing city and becomes a little romantic. </p><h2>  The Gulf of Finland </h2><p>  No matter how beautiful Petersburg is, walking along the Neva River within the city limits is by no means the only thing that travel companies can offer guests.  The surrounding area is no less interesting. </p><p>  Some travel agencies offer customers river walks along the Neva with access to the Gulf of Finland.  This is a longer tour, it lasts about two hours.  During this time, you can admire the Northern Islands, the magnificent panorama of the Gulf of Finland and see the beauty of St. Petersburg in a new way.  And, of course, not a single trip to the Northern capital can do without visiting the royal royal residence - Peterhof. </p>

    <h2>  The beauty of Peterhof </h2><p>  One of the most popular places of not only the city, but also the country is rightfully considered Peterhof.  Therefore, his visit is one of the obligatory points of the cultural program of each guest of Northern Venice. </p><p>  The founder of this ceremonial residence was Peter I. Peterhof is located on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland, at a distance of 29 kilometers from the city.  Within it there are several palace and park ensembles, many priceless masterpieces of architecture, and numerous fountains brought real fame to him. </p><p>  You can get to Peterhof in different ways, but perhaps the most exciting will be a water trip along the Gulf of Finland.  In addition, it will be not only a boat trip, but also an opportunity to see the most beautiful sights of St. Petersburg from an unusual angle. </p><h2>  Cost of excursions </h2><p>  Perhaps the very first thing a tourist who came to St. Petersburg should do is a walk along the Neva.  Prices for this pleasure are quite affordable.  They fluctuate depending on the company, as well as the duration of the walk and additional services.  But in general, we can say that the cost of a river trip on a sightseeing boat starts at about five hundred rubles per person.  For preferential categories, it is reduced.  So, a family ticket can be bought for 1100 rubles.  Night walks on the Neva are somewhat more expensive - from 750 rubles per person.  Those who wish to organize an individual tour will have to fork out - their cost is much higher, depending on the range of services and the route. </p>

Of course, it is better not to be limited to one excursion, because each of them exposes only one facet of this extraordinary city.  To understand his soul, you need to spend a lot of time here: to feel the silent grandeur of old palaces and temples, to stand on the embankment, breathing in the unique river air, to feel the romance of St. Petersburg at night, passing through the dark waters under a divorced bridge.  And walks along the Neva will help to touch the secrets of Northern Venice.
