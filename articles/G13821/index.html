Sights of this region fascinate tourists at a glance at them.  The village is distinguished by a special color, which is provided to it by churches, churches and houses in the Neo-Gothic style.  They were erected at the end of the 20th century.  The emblem of the village was the Qingdao dam, which runs 440 meters in length.  The width of the object is nine meters.  This and many other attractions will give travelers a stunning explosion of emotions and sensations. </p><h2>  The symbol of the city </h2><p>  Some objects are considered Qingdao symbols.  These sights are worth seeing first.  Among such places, I would like to highlight the wooden octagonal pavilion Huilan, which stands out against the background of European modern structures with an extraordinary design, which is supported by lotus lamps. </p><p>  The pavilion is located on a semicircular breakwater in the southern part of Qingdao dam.  The gazebo is located at the end of this bridge.  Tourists and the Chinese themselves regularly come here.  They visit Huilan to enjoy the seascapes and gull flights.  In the middle of the gazebo, various exhibitions, such as art and photo exhibitions, are often arranged.  This item is depicted on Qingdao beer bottle labels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Qingdao Attractions" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1819959.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Qingdao Fleet Museum will cause no less interest than the previous facility.

The attraction was presented to a wide audience in October 1989. </p><p>  The institution consists of three sections: the Maritime Region, the Inner Hall and the hall where the marine weapons are presented.  The inner hall introduces visitors to the naval history of the Middle Kingdom.  And in the other two sections, expositions of weapons, ships of various sizes, missiles and other exhibits are displayed. </p><h2>  A place with fabulous beauty </h2><p>  Photos of Qingdao sights indicate that the city has truly beautiful places.  For example, the Laoshan mountain range.  It stretches 90 kilometers along the coastline.  This is such an amazingly beautiful place that the inhabitants of China would be considered big fanatics if they had not set up a park here.  Here, every tourist is greeted with simply amazing pictures of nature. </p><p>  The Chinese are convinced that Laoshan is populated by spirits.  Emperor Qin Shihuang really wanted to meet them.  To fulfill his dream, he climbed the peak of the mountain, but the rendezvous did not take place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="qingdao attractions reviews" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1819957.jpg" width="600"></div>
