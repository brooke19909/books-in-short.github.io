Sberbank: social card for senior citizens</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In recent years, the number of holders of social <span>cards of Sberbank of</span> Russia has increased significantly, as well as users of pension cards.  This was achieved thanks to the systematic work of a financial institution to reissue citizens' savings books and cooperation with the PF.  In addition to customer comfort, such changes led to an increase in direct bank income.  After all, reducing the queues at the box office has reduced the cost of additional employees, and the cost of printing savings book forms is decreasing every day. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Social Card" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/460342.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Who can get a social card? </h2><p>  In accordance with the pension program of Sberbank, one of two possible cards may be opened to a client, depending on the category of financial security: social or Maestro.  The first is issued to people who receive an old-age pension, loss of a bread-winner, or disability.  As for the conditions for issuing the second, citizens from the age of 14 who have permanent registration in the region of registration and are entitled to receive social security can receive it. </p><h2>  What do you need to open a card? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Social card of Sberbank of Russia" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/461051.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Naturally, in order to count on receiving a social plastic card, it is necessary to relate to the category of citizens receiving financial resources from the state.  In other words, initially you need to apply for pension or other <span>social payments</span> in the Pension Fund and only then contact the nearest bank branch.  It should be noted that in some cities of the Russian Federation, employees of the Pension Fund themselves submit documents of their wards to a financial institution, and they automatically draw up a Sberbank social card.  However, not everyone is so lucky, so those who are not included in the “lucky” category will need to work hard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After applying for pensions, a person must contact the bank and sign a cooperation agreement.  Further, within 10 working days, the financial institution must issue a personal client card and issue it.  But this should be only by law, but in fact this period is from 2 to 4 weeks.  Bank employees are obliged to notify the client about the possibility of receiving by phone, but some do not bother with this, so pensioners need to systematically call the bank and inquire about the readiness of their card. </p><h2>  Card expiry date </h2>

If, two months before the indicated deadline, the client did not notify the financial institution of the refusal to cooperate, the contract is extended.  Consequently, the bank will automatically reissue a new card, and the old one will need to be dealt.  For a comfortable use of funds, customers themselves must monitor the validity period and timely contact a financial institution for an exchange.

    <h2>  Additional Card Benefits </h2><p>  Saying that pensioners are elderly people whose living conditions require increased comfort is probably not worth it.  Everyone knows about it, and bank employees are no exception.  That is why those who already have a Sberbank social card are offered to get another additional one.  It can be used by family members of a pensioner or trustees to make purchases and pay for services.  The client must notify the financial institution of the decision to receive an additional card and write a written statement as a written confirmation.  In this document, the client must indicate not only his details, but also the data of the future holder. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Who can become the owner of an additional card </h2>

If a small client has official representatives (parents), they will need their permission to register a banking product.  However, after a person reaches the age of 14, such confirmation is not necessary.

    <p>  In order to control the funds, it was precisely the one who has the main social card of Sberbank, the program provides for certain conditions.  So, at the request of a pensioner, you can set monthly limits for any transactions.  To do this, you just need to contact the bank branch and write a statement stating the exact amounts.  As a result, the holder of the additional card will be able to use only a certain amount of money, regardless of whether it will be cash withdrawal or settlement transactions through the terminal. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of Sberbank social and supplementary cards </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Maestro social card" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/460363.jpg" width="335"></div></h2><p>  Before considering the so-called shortcomings that Sberbank's social bank card has, several other aspects need to be considered.  For example, everyone understands that most retirees prefer to use cash and do not really trust financial institutions.  It is still difficult for people at this age to switch to the modern type of calculations, not only because of stereotypes, but also because they are afraid to be deceived, and also do not understand the principle of the system.  Therefore, the absence of the CVV2 / CVC2 code, which is used to identify the card when buying goods on the Internet, many do not even notice. </p><p>  As for card servicing, in the territory of the Russian Federation it is carried out at all ATMs, cash points and branches of Sberbank of Russia.  When traveling abroad, customers can receive cash only at subsidiary banks and their ATMs; other financial institutions do not have permission for such operations. </p><p>  Another limitation that every Sberbank social card has is that it cannot be used to credit other income.  It is worth noting that pension card account transactions can be carried out only in national currency, but this is not a problem for most modern pensioners. </p><h2>  <span>Additional revenue</span> for customers </h2><p>  Participants in the bank's pension program can receive additional funds; for this, do not cash out available funds.  And at the end of the quarter to everyone who has a Sberbank social card, interest will be credited to the account.  In the current year 2014, each client of this program receives an income of 3.5% per annum on the balance of funds.  To some, this rate may seem too small, but this way the bank not only stimulates an increase in its working capital, but also allows pensioners to make a small profit. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank social card for seniors" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/460335.jpg" width="400"></div>  Service Rates </h2><p>  Everyone understands that the transition from savings books to card accounts is carried out not only for the comfort of citizens, but also to increase the profit of the bank itself.  After all, before people stood in huge lines, but received full pension.  Today, a person who has a Sberbank social card pays not only for additional services, but also hidden fees. </p><p>  There is no fee for servicing the main card for this pension program of the bank, but for an additional amount, an amount of 150 rubles will be charged annually.  A commission fee is not withdrawn both when replenishing an account and withdrawing cash.  Although there are subtleties here, such conditions of service will be unchanged if the client cashes out the amount up to 50,000 rubles, in other cases the commission will amount to 0.5% of the exceeded amount. </p><p>  Another paid service under the Sberbank social program is re-issuance of a card or change of personal data of a client.  Of course, we are not talking about the planned replacement of the product after the period of use, this applies only to situations that have developed through the fault of the holder.  A lost social card or making changes to the database will cost a pensioner 30 rubles, it would seem, a small amount.  However, given that due to age, many customers can forget the card just at the ATM or not remember the PIN code, then a fairly decent amount will accumulate over the year. </p><h2>  Benefits for Social Card Holders </h2><p>  In order to attract more customers, each regional branch of Sberbank enters into cooperation agreements with various outlets, which subsequently provide pensioners with a discount on goods.  As a rule, the social card of Sberbank of Russia allows the owner to purchase the necessary things 1-12% cheaper.  You can get acquainted with the list of such stores and pharmacies both on the website of a financial institution, and in any regional branch of the bank. </p>

    <p>  Of particular note is the fact that all participants in the social program can connect the Sberbank Online or Mobile Sberbank automated personal account management system.  A social card for pensioners who can use the Internet is becoming an indispensable tool in life.  After all, only auto payments for utilities will help to avoid tedious queues at the cash desk and waste of energy. </p>
