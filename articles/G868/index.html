    <h2>  Kit, design and ergonomics </h2><p>  From the standpoint of equipment, <span>this device</span> cannot boast of <span>anything</span> unusual.  More precisely, it is greatly reduced.  The composition of its boxed version includes such components and accessories: </p><ul><li>  Mobile phone itself. </li><li>  External battery with a capacity of 1000 mA / h. </li><li>  Interface cord with MicroUSB connector. </li><li>  Charger. </li></ul><p>  As you can see from all of the above, in the original configuration there is no stereo headset and external flash drive.  These accessories will have to be purchased separately at an additional cost.  Also, owners of the Samsung S 5610 phone need to take care of preserving the original appearance of the mobile phone.  Its body is made of ordinary plastic, and it is not difficult to damage it.  It will be difficult to protect it without a cover, so you cannot do without it either.  The dimensions of the device are modest enough at present: 118.9 x 49.7 mm with a thickness of 12.9 mm.  Its weight is 91 grams.  The keyboard is divided into several tiers, each of which is separated from those nearby with a ledge.  Such a constructive solution even allows you to "blindly" control the mobile phone.  The developers did not forget about the <span>keyboard backlight.</span>  The volume swing is located on the left side of the phone, and there is a camera control button on the right edge of the device.  Below is a characteristic microphone hole, and above are all wired interfaces: microUSB and a 3.5 mm jack for connecting a stereo headset or speakers.  Let's just say: the design of the mobile phone is well designed and managing it will not be difficult, including with one hand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Iron </h2><p>  There is not enough internal memory in the Samsung 5610 mobile phone.  The phone is equipped with only 108 MB, this is clearly not enough for comfortable work on it, so you just can not do without an external flash drive.  It will have to be bought separately.  The device is capable of working with microSD cards with a maximum size of 16 GB.  The diagonal of the display is only 2.4 inches, but for a push-button phone, this is a normal indicator.  <span>The screen resolution</span> is 240 x 320, it is able to display 262 thousand different color shades.  Its matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using outdated technology today - TFT.  Because of this, the viewing angles of this mobile phone can be said to be minimal.  With a deviation of 15-20 degrees from the perpendicular to the display surface, the image is greatly distorted.  The rest of the picture quality on it is not satisfactory.  The operating system for this device is proprietary, all applications on the Java platform are supported.  Among the other features of this model, one can single out an FM radio (it works only when headphones are connected, which are also an antenna) and an MP3 player.  The interface set for this gadget is pretty good: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Bluetooth - allows you to easily share information with other mobile devices. </li><li>  Full support for 2nd and 3rd generation cellular networks.  There is only one slot for installing a SIM card.  There is also a built-in browser with which you can view Internet resources. </li><li>  The standard microUSB port performs two functions simultaneously: it allows you to charge the battery and exchange data with a PC. </li><li>  A 3.5 mm jack is provided for connecting external speakers. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The nominal battery capacity is 1000 mA / h on the Samsung 5610 phone.  Characteristics, reviews indicate that this is enough for 3-4 days of intensive work in 2G networks.  When switching to 3G, this value will decrease and on average will already be 2-3 days.  But if you use this device as an MP3 player, then one charge is enough for 24 hours of continuous listening. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung 5610 price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/609767.jpg" width="246"></div>

    <p>  Do not forget that this is a regular mobile phone, with a display diagonal of only 2.4 inches, it does not have a central processor.  In general, with autonomy, everything is in order with this cell phone. </p><h2>  Camera and its features </h2><p>  The strong point is the camera on the Samsung 5610 mobile phone.  Characteristics, reviews - <strong> </strong>  everything indicates that the photos with its help are simply excellent for an apparatus of this class.  It is based on a 5 megapixel sensor.  Autofocus is implemented, there is a digital zoom and the LED backlight is displayed on the back of the device.  Image resolution is 2560 x 1920 at maximum settings.  There are also a number of modes, which allows in almost all cases to receive high-quality photos.  But with video, the situation is radically changing.  The image resolution in this case is only 320 x 240. It is clear that a video with such quality on a large screen will be blurry and with ‚Äúsquares‚Äù.  In general, there is an opportunity to record video, but then it is better not to watch it later on a device with a higher resolution. </p><h2>  Reviews and specifications </h2><p>  Now about the strengths and weaknesses of the Samsung 5610 phone.  He has a modest price and is about 5,000 rubles.  At such a cost and with similar functionality, it is difficult to find a similar phone.  Only entry-level smartphones can compete with him.  But their autonomy will be much worse, and the functioning of the software part in any case will cause complaints.  Ergonomics, sound quality, reception of a cellular network signal are all the <span>strengths of</span> this device, which are indicated in the user reviews about this device.  Now about the shortcomings of the Samsung 5610 phone.  Photos with him under sufficient lighting are quite good, but the videos in the resolution of 240 x 320 are, quite frankly, a real anachronism today.  This is the main disadvantage of this model of mobile phone, but it can not be fixed in any way, as indicated by the reviews of the owners.  But the meager gadget equipment is explained quite simply: <span>a budget-</span> class <span>phone</span> , so the manufacturer is trying to save on everything.  If necessary, buy all the necessary accessories is not difficult.  All the rest in most cases does not cause complaints. </p>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  As part of this short article, the Samsung 5610 mobile phone was examined in detail.  Specifications, reviews, <strong> </strong>  technical specifications and other important information about it was previously presented.  In the budget segment of conventional phones, it has virtually no competitors.  If not for the problems with the videos, then this would be an ideal entry-level device.  But still, this is a good option for those who are looking for an inexpensive, but quite functional and with a high degree of autonomy device. </p>
