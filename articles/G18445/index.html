The list of places is quite extensive.  And no wonder!  The capital of Austria has a two-thousand-year history of cooking.  Each of the many diasporas inhabiting the city has brought something new and authentic to the tradition of cooking.  Although the so-called "high cuisine" sets the gastronomic trends, it is the catering that has the responsibility to feed people in large portions at affordable prices.  What establishments do experienced gourmet travelers recommend visiting? </p><h2>  Wiener deewan </h2><p>  If you ask the first student in the Austrian capital to give advice on where to eat cheaply in Vienna, with a high degree of probability he will recommend the restaurant Wiener Deewan.  Why?  The answer is simple, like a boiled egg: here customers pay for food as much as they see fit!  Surprisingly, over the years of its existence, the catering facility not only did not go bankrupt, but also expanded its clientele at the expense of students, tourists, and Austrians who were not spoiled by strudels. </p><p>  The institution was founded by immigrants from Pakistan, respectively, Asian cuisine dominates the menu.  The choice of dishes is not very large, but the portion size is not limited - you come up and get as much food as you want.  The menu is dominated by: </p><ul><li>  stewed dishes; </li><li>  soups; </li><li>  bakery products; </li><li>  salads; </li><li>  and, of course, the famous Pakistani rice. </li></ul><p>  According to tourists, the food here is tasty and satisfying, tables are never empty.  An institution is not always open; there are periods of so-called ‚Äúholidays‚Äù for staff.  They are informed in advance on the official website.  There is a restaurant in the Rossau area, near the Danube embankment, next to the Votivkirche temple. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pbase.com" data-author=": Peter Kwok, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to eat in Vienna is tasty and inexpensive" class="if uuid-2551521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2551521.jpg"></div><h2>  Rozenberger </h2><p>  Let us listen to another piece of advice: places to eat cheap in Vienna are the Rosenberger self-service restaurants.  The system is built a little differently here.  The final cost of lunch depends on ... the size of the plate.  The larger it is, the more expensive food will cost.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter how many ingredients are on the dish.  Some regulars manage to fit a mountain of food on a small saucer. </p><p>  Unlike the family-run Wiener Deewan, Rosenberger is the counterpart to a modernly decorated dining room.  The buffet is pleasantly pleased with the variety and thereby creates problems for travelers - which dishes to prefer, because not all dishes will fit on a plate.  The average price tag is 15-20 euros (1000 - 1400 rubles), and for the money you can eat "from the belly."  The largest of the Rosenbergers is 10 steps from the Albertina Palace Museum.  The institution is large enough, with three floors.  Each of them has a toilet room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.likealocalguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to eat cheaply in the center of Vienna" class="if uuid-2551534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2551534.jpg"></div><h2>  Bier &amp; bierli </h2><p>  Where to eat cheaply in the center of Vienna?  Of course, in the beer restaurant Bier &amp; Bierli.  Why?  So he is opposite the Vienna Opera!  It serves incredibly cheap "rustic" dishes of traditional <span>Austrian cuisine.</span>  A friendly bonus is the friendly service and atmosphere of a historic place.  Shelves with a collection of beer cans are installed in the entire wall of the interior, where none is repeated.  The institution is also visited by local residents, which indicates good cooking.  A good option is to knock over a glass of cold hop drink and have a bite to eat while visiting local attractions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="jethroinvadesvienna.wordpress.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://jethroinvadesvienna.wordpress.com/2012/09/28/a-walkaround-day/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to eat cheap in Vienna: places, tips" class="if uuid-2551544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2551544.jpg"></div><h2>  Pickwicks </h2><p>  In domestic libraries, it is not customary to make noise, but in Austrian Pickwicks you can even dine.  Therefore, when asked friends where to eat in Vienna is tasty and inexpensive, you can safely answer: "Where, where, in the library!" </p><p>  In fact, this is an Irish pub with a ‚Äútelecom‚Äù all over the wall where football is broadcast.  But in the break between the World Cup and the Champions League, you can take any book from the bookcase (also into the entire wall, but the opposite) and plunge, for example, into the Harry Potter universe, or Yesenin's Silver Age.  The gastronomic card is typical: cocktails, beer, french fries, buns, atmosphere.  As waiters, they try to invite young people from the British Isles.  The pub is located on the street leading from the Wine Museum to the canal embankment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="erasmusu.com" data-author=": Sabrina B√ºbl, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where and what to eat in Vienna" class="if uuid-2551552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2551552.jpg"></div><h2>  Tunnel </h2><p>  Another option where to eat cheap in Vienna.  This time - youth.  The restaurant does not set a goal to feed the whole world.  But he will allow one hundred percent to skip a glass of drink or spend an evening in a pleasant conversation with friends. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The three-story institution is not for nothing called a student den.  A plate with breakfast costs 3 euros / 216 rubles, a set lunch - 5.5 euros / 396 rubles.  In the evenings in the basement, live concerts are organized by Viennese musicians gathering a large audience.  Thus, Tunnel can be an outlet for travelers who are fed up with opera performances and balls.  In general, local connoisseurs recommend. </p><h2>  Schikaneder </h2><p>  The Schikaneder Cinema Bar is an extreme option for those interested in where and what to eat in Vienna.  This is Mecca for hipsters (thanks to the atmosphere of decadence) and moviegoers who can‚Äôt imagine their life without a movie.  The latest program is regularly published at the office.  site.  By the way, in addition to showing films, rave parties and art exhibitions are held in a small cozy room. </p><p>  Get ready for a crowded evening bar.  Surprisingly, there are people praising local snacks.  But you have to be careful with alcohol - prices bite.  You can find this place in the back streets of Margaritenstrasse. </p><h2>  Schachtelwirt </h2><p>  Baked chicken, dumplings, fried pork balls and potato salad in cardboard boxes?  Why not!  Especially if it is ‚Äúseasoned‚Äù with excellent fresh beer and Austrian specialty cider.  The Schachtelwirt Restaurant is the place to eat cheaply in Vienna with no problems.  No wonder the institution is included by TripAdvisor service in the TOP 10 of the budget eateries of the city, where they feed tasty and satisfying.  For vegetarians prepare dishes of pumpkin, sauerkraut, spinach, mushrooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rebrn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to eat cheap in Vienna: tips" class="if uuid-2551557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2551557.jpg"></div><h2>  Centimeter </h2><p>  "Centimeter" - food XXL in Austrian.  This is one of the most famous chains of budget eateries, a paradise for students and budget travelers.  The prices here are divine, and the portions are large enough to forget about hunger for long hours.  The food is <span>delicious, satisfying,</span> from quality products.

No wonder Nashmarkt translates as ‚Äúa market for goodies.‚Äù  By the way, it is the most popular in the city.  At the malls you can buy fruits, vegetables, overseas delicacies, and for hot you can go to cafes and eateries, of which there are dozens. </p><p>  Naschmarkt symbolizes the multiculturalism of Vienna.  The inexpensive restaurants serve dishes from Vietnamese to Chinese, from Italian to Russian cuisines.  Of course, the national is also represented.  Near the market is the Karlsplatz metro station. </p><h2>  Eis-grei√üler </h2><p>  Where to eat ice cream cheap in Vienna, if not in Eis-Grei√üler!  According to reputable gourmets, one of the best "ice" delicacies in the city is prepared here.  The secret lies in the use of organic whole milk and cream.  That is, when growing cows, antibiotics, hormones, feed with GMOs are not used.  Cows are grazed on ecologically clean pastures. </p><p>  The hosts cook desserts with love, experimenting with tastes and toppings.  Do you often see ice cream with poppy seeds or bitter almonds?  The emphasis is not only on taste, but also on the usefulness of products.  For example, sugar is added to a minimum, and preservatives and artificial colors can be completely forgotten.  The only minus of the establishment is its advantages - long lines, especially on hot days. </p><h2>  Kr√§uterdrogerie </h2><p>  The institution will be interesting to vegetarians and experimental gourmets.  This is a unique restaurant, one of a kind.  It serves exclusively healthy products (including raw), grown according to the technology of organic farming.  Unlike specialized stores and supermarkets, the price here is not too high.  The portions are small, but they consist of a variety of foods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="room5.trivago.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="List of places to eat cheap and tasty in Vienna" class="if uuid-2551570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2551570.jpg"></div><h2>  Where else to eat cheaply in Vienna </h2><p>  In fact, there are many such places.  First of all, these are street vendors, alluring with the seductive aromas of fried sausages and boiled beef, carefully wrapped in soft buns.  German cuisine is famous for sausages, and Vienna is no exception. </p><p>  The second option is a network of international fast food brands.  There are a lot of them in the city, the competition is quite high.  Companies have to lure a gaping tourist with promotions and discounts.  It‚Äôs only for the hungry traveler.  A relatively inexpensive snack will come out in a mini-cafe in the subway crossings.  For a strudel, a hot dog and a drink, get ready to pay 20-30 euros (1400 - 2100 rubles). </p><p>  The third, most reliable option is to drive away as far as possible from the city center and iconic sights.  In any cafe on the periphery, prices will be affordable, and food quality.  As a rule, a hearty meal (no frills like alcohol and desserts) will cost around 10-20 euros (720 - 1400 rubles).  For comparison, a mini-cup of excellent Viennese "melange" coffee somewhere in the center will cost the same 10 euros / 720 rubles. </p>
