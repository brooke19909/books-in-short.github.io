Along with this, certain institutions are charged with certain duties.  For example, they cannot dispose of property without the consent of the owner, since it is in their operational management.  Entities entrusted to organizations may have different statuses.  In our article, we will talk about especially valuable property.  From what amount is the "special value" of an object considered?  What restrictions are provided for organizations using such property?  Read the answers to these and other questions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="par.com.pk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="especially valuable property" class="if uuid-2904164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2904164.jpg"></div><h2>  Normative base </h2><p>  Restrictions on the disposal of property by budget organizations is enshrined in part 2 of article  298 Civil Code.  It applies to operations with especially valuable movable property of an institution and real estate. </p><p>  The restrictions apply to objects transferred to the organization by the owner, and acquired by it at the expense of reserve funds.  At the same time, the institution has the right to use everything that is included in the list of especially valuable property for profit, if the proceeds go to the development of activities. </p><h2>  The concept </h2><p>  What is considered especially valuable movable property of a budgetary institution?  They are any objects, the use of which facilitates the main activity.  For example, securities are considered to be especially valuable property of a budget organization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The list of objects is fixed by Government Decision No. 538 of July 26, 2010. In accordance with this document, the following are included in the category of especially valuable property at the federal level: </p><ol><li>  Objects whose book value is higher than the amount established by the founder, i.e. more than 500 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Exhibits and collections of state museums, documentation of the Archival and Library Funds of the Russian Federation. </li></ol><p>  Of particular value in institutions subordinate to the Ministry of Emergencies are objects with a book value of more than 350 thousand rubles: </p><ol><li>  Automotive, armored vehicles. </li><li>  Power, lifting units, machine tools, technological equipment and other equipment used to carry out activities enshrined in the charter. </li><li>  Special equipment designed to conduct core business. </li><li>  Office, household appliances, computers. </li><li>  Production tools. </li></ol><h2>  Autonomous Institutions </h2><p>  Especially valuable property of these organizations is determined by slightly different criteria.  The cost for them is determined depending on its level.  So, the amount of especially valuable property of autonomous organizations created on the basis of objects that are regional property, as well as budgetary institutions subordinate to the subject of the Russian Federation, is 50-500 thousand rubles.  It is approved by the highest executive body of the subject. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.p2ptracker.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="especially valuable property of the institution" class="if uuid-2904170" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2904170.jpg"></div><p>  The value of the especially valuable property of these organizations may also be established by state regional bodies that are their founders. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for municipal institutions, the minimum limit of the amount here is also 50 thousand rubles.  But the maximum cost of especially valuable property of institutions cannot exceed 200 thousand rubles.  The relevant values ‚Äã‚Äãare approved by regulatory acts of the local administration or bodies of territorial self-government, if they are the founders of such organizations. </p><h2>  Specifics of accounting </h2><p>  The procedure for reporting information on especially valuable movable property of institutions, liabilities, financial / non-financial assets, including those acquired through income-generating activities, operations that change liabilities, incomes and expenses, is established by the Instructions for the application of the chart of accounts in municipal authorities and state power, government structures of state extra-budgetary funds, Academies of Sciences, municipal and state institutions.
