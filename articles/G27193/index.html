    <p>  Touch <span>capacitive screens</span> are increasingly replacing resistive technology in most mobile devices.  We can say about their obvious advantages: such a sensor is more durable and stronger due to the fact that it uses a grid of electrodes instead of a flexible resistive membrane.  The capacitive screen is able to withstand a significantly larger number of clicks at one point, it is much more transparent, and only for such sensors at the moment it was possible to implement the multi-touch technology, which is so popular today.  However, it is not always convenient to work with the interface with your fingers, and here they serve as the main element for manipulation.  This is especially noticeable when entering handwritten text or drawing on a tablet, as well as in winter, when you do not want to take off your gloves at all to answer an incoming call.  It is at such moments that the stylus for a <span>capacitive screen</span> does not hurt <span>.</span> </p><p>  Surely many people remember how convenient it is to use this manipulator if they once had a resistive sensor on a smartphone.  Thanks to him, significantly more accurate manipulation can be achieved.  However, the capacitive screen does not respond to the touch of a conventional stylus, because to work with it you need a certain capacity, which receives and conducts low-voltage electric current. </p><p>  At the moment, companies engaged in the production of mobile devices offer such a convenient device as a stylus for a capacitive screen.  It can be of different models and can be made of arbitrary materials that conduct current.  The stylus for a capacitive screen is very simple, so you can make it yourself if you wish.  If your device is dear to you, then it is better not to make some dubious devices, but to buy a turnkey solution. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are four types of styluses on the mobile accessories market: </p><p>  - in the form of a brush consisting of starting fibers conducting current; </p><p>  - on the sponge; </p><p>  - from soft rubber; </p><p>  - made of soft plastic. </p><p>  The stylus for the capacitive screen of Samsung, iPad, HTC, iPhone - the model ‚ÄúSPMP 1019‚Äù, belongs to the second category, it is relatively inexpensive, and the metal case makes it highly accurate.  The accessory is equipped with the same hook as ballpoint pens, which allows it to be conveniently fixed.  As a disadvantage of this stylus, its fragility is noted, which can be said about all devices similar in design.  If you do not plan to use it very often, then such an acquisition is quite justified.  This model does not lose tactile properties in low temperature conditions. </p><p>  We can say about the models SPMP 1039 and SPMP 1002, which are made of conductive plastic.  Greater accuracy and convenience are provided by a round flat platform at the end of the accessory, so the manipulations are clear and quick.  The most popular and convenient type of stylus at the moment is the model, the working end of which is made of hollow and soft conductive rubber.  Its design features give a complete sensation of the touch of a finger on the sensor.  These styluses provide the most accurate tactile feedback.  With their help, you can adjust the degree of depression. </p><p>  DIY stylus for capacitive screen </p><p>  As can be seen from the above, the market offers a lot of options for this accessory.  However, some may be concerned about the question of how to make a stylus for a capacitive screen?  You will need such a set of materials: a metal pen, a convex push pin, a nail file, self-adhesive, tin, a soldering iron, a copper wire, a battery, superglue.  You must solder the wire to the button, then this workpiece must be inserted into the tube from the handle, and then glued to the end.  Peel the paint off the button, stick on the self-adhesive, and cut off the excess.  The other end of the wire is attached to the battery, the handle housing closes - everything is ready. </p>
