Everything mysterious and little-known attracts in the first place, therefore it is not surprising that <noindex>  <span>resorts of India</span> </noindex>  Now most in demand.  Those who are just starting to get acquainted with this country need to choose a route in such a way as to catch all the significant sights in a short vacation time.  The tour called ‚ÄúGolden Triangle‚Äù is ideal for a review and helps to shape your opinion about the country. </p><p>  Historically, the most famous and significant architectural monuments of India were concentrated in three cities - Agra, Jaipur and Delhi.  Therefore, it is with them that one should begin their acquaintance with the fertile land, the homeland of fragrant tea and the best love films in the world.  The journey through the Golden Triangle begins with the capital, Delhi. </p><p>  The main attraction of the "old" city is the Red Fort.  It got its name thanks to the walls lined with red sandstone.  The fortress, built during the reign of the Mongol dynasty, looks like an octagon and is surrounded by a moat on the outside.  The main symbol of the imperial residence is the throne, made of pure gold and generously inlaid with precious stones. </p><p>  In the halls of the fort are museums of paintings, musical instruments of the 17th century and a variety of archeology items are exhibited.  Here, in the courtyard, there is a large covered market where you can buy souvenirs, spices and national jewelry.  Also noteworthy in Delhi are the Botanical Garden, Akshardham Temple, Lotus Temple and the Garden of Five Senses.  Sightseeing is good to alternate with shopping, especially since <noindex>  <span>reviews of tourists</span> </noindex>  about local shopping centers are very eloquent.  A wide selection of gift products, designer items, art objects and high-quality textiles will help you enjoy the ‚Äúrun‚Äù at the shops. </p><p>  The next city on the Golden Triangle list is Agra, located in Uttar Pradesh.  People come here to see the famous "pearl of the East" Taj Mahal.  Majestic and amazing in beauty, he is one of the wonders of the world.  Built of white marble, it serves as a kind of symbol of Shah Jahan's love and loyalty to his wife.  According to legend, a heartbroken ruler wanted to build the exact same palace for himself only from black marble.  But his plans were not destined to be fulfilled, and the shah was buried next to his wife. </p><p>  The tourist triangle closes the city of Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan.  It is also rich in ancient monuments, the main of which are the City Palace and Amber Fort.  The hearts of travelers will enjoy the unique nature of the resort, especially Lake Udaipur.  Popular excursions to safaris in the desert of Tar Jodhpur and its oases, as well as colorful festivals and other national holidays. </p></div></article>
