    <p>  Anapa is a fabulous island where you can easily spend a vacation with your family, have fun with friends, enjoy the splendor of the underwater world, diving.  It will not be an exaggeration to say that the interesting places of Anapa, its mild climate and magnificent nature will charm everyone who visits this region. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The resort city is located in the Krasnodar Territory, where the mountains of the Greater Caucasus are in contact with the Kuban-Priazov lowland.  Nearby begins the <span>Taman Peninsula.</span> </p><p>  <span>The climate of Anapa</span> combined foothill-steppe and Mediterranean characteristics.  Therefore, there is steady atmospheric pressure and many bright sunny days. </p><h2>  From the history of the city </h2><p>  Interesting places in Anapa and its environs are largely related to the history of the city, which has more than one millennium.  In ancient times, these territories were inhabited by Sinds.  They were artisans and traders.  These people had ships on which they exported their products (olive oil, various pottery, wine, jewelry) to other countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting places in Anapa for children" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/1398248.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the III century, the city was destroyed by barbarians, and in the X began the relocation of the ancestors of the current local population - the Circassians.  In 1828, Anapa became part of the Russian Empire.  The resort history of the city began in 1900, when scientists appreciated the unique features of the local nature and climate. </p><h2>  Anapa: interesting places and attractions </h2><p>  The famous Russian health resort today attracts many tourists.  Anapa is famous for its <span>sanatoriums, boarding houses</span> and rest houses.  Interesting places and attractions here can be found at every step.  For many, this is primarily the sea and well-groomed clean city beaches.  On a strip of 40 km, the sand is covered, and lovers of the pebble coast can relax on a territory of 10 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa interesting places and attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/1398243.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It should be noted that the sea in Anapa is recognized as the cleanest among the resorts of the Black Sea coast.  Most of the free and paid beaches are located in the central part of the city.  They are surrounded by unique sand dunes, which sometimes reach a height of 15 meters. </p><p>  Locals and vacationers who come to this resort for many years in a row distinguish beaches in the villages of Bimlyuk, Dzhemete, Vityazevo, on the Annunciation Spit.  Their main advantage is the lack of a railway track.  In the villages of Maly and Bolshoi Utrizh and in the beautiful Sukko Valley, pebble beaches. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  <span>Historical Monuments:</span> Russian Gate </h2><p>  Interesting places in Anapa worth seeing can be divided into several categories.  We begin our acquaintance with the city with its historical monuments.  The Russian Gate is the only part of the Ottoman fortress that has survived since the 18th century.  It was built by the Turks to strengthen its position off the Caucasus coast in 1783. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa interesting places and attractions" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/1398253.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Initially, it consisted of seven bastions and three gates.  The largest slave market was located here.  Until our time, the fortress has not been preserved.  Only the eastern gate remained, which looked rather unsightly for a long time.  But in 1996, their restoration was completed and a stele with an inscription was installed that says that the remains of Russian soldiers who laid their lives against the walls of the fortress in the period from 1788 to 1828 rest in this place. </p><h2>  Crypt Heroon </h2><p>  Interesting places near Anapa also attract tourists vacationing at the resort.  The famous archaeologist Veselovsky at the beginning of the 19th century near Anapa discovered a crypt.  Later it became known as the crypt of Heroon.  It was built in the shape of an arch made of white local stone.  Its ceiling and walls were decorated with frescoes characteristic of sanctuaries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting places in Anapa and its environs" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/1398258.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After many years, the crypt was transferred to the city garden.  Today it is located between the recreation center “Kurortny” and the sanatorium “Blue Wave”.  Visitors to the city and locals often came here.  It was possible to get into the crypt through a narrow corridor.  After the revolution, they forgot about him, and local tramps began to gather there.  During the war with fascist Germany, the crypt was used as a warehouse for weapons. </p><h2>  Natural Attractions: Succo Valley </h2><p>  We have considered far from all the interesting places of Anapa related to history.  Nevertheless, we want to invite you to look at natural monuments.  Sukko Valley is a famous and popular resort located in the mountainous part of Anapa.  It is surrounded on all sides by water.  On the one hand - Sukko Lake, on the other - the Black Sea.  Here you will not find solitude, there is no crystal clear water here, besides, tourists have to fight for a place in the sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most interesting places in anapa" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/1398245.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Nevertheless, they come to the valley, because there are stunning natural landscapes, sea air saturated with aromas of juniper forests, slopes covered with centuries-old oaks.  And one more advantage - here you can combine a beach holiday with a sightseeing trip by visiting the Knight's Castle “Lion's Head”. </p><h2>  Religious buildings: Temple of Onufry the Great </h2><p>  It is impossible to describe the interesting places of Anapa without mentioning its two temples.  One of them is located near the embankment, on Sobornaya street.  This is the temple of Onufrius the Great.  Turquoise and white shades, two different-sized domes, golden crosses - all this causes admiration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting places in Anapa worth seeing" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/1398255.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Inside the temple has a magnificent iconostasis and a skilful image of saints on the ceiling.  It was built in 1829.  This place used to be an Arab mosque.  In 1837 he was consecrated in the name of Onufrius the Great.  The ceremony was attended by Russian Emperor Nicholas I. </p><p>  In the middle of the XIX century, the temple was destroyed, but rather quickly restored.  But in 1964 it was closed.  Since 1995, services have been held here.  Today it is one of the oldest Orthodox buildings in the Kuban. </p><h2>  Temple of Seraphim of Sarov </h2><p>  What other interesting places are there in the city?  Anapa and its attractions are generally struck by the history of their origin.  After the closing of the Church of St. Onufry, parishioners began to collect donations, and a private house was bought on public funds in Grebenskaya Street, which was converted into a church.  From 1964 to 1993, this temple was the only one not only in the city, but also in the immediate vicinity.  It was a one-story building with a single room in which services were held.  A belfry was built in the courtyard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions in Anapa" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/1398249.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The old building of the church of St. Onufry was returned to the parishioners in 1991, and from that moment its reconstruction began.  Restoration work was completed in 1993.  Half of the parishioners returned to the renovated church, and half remained the same.  At first, they planned to leave him as a courtyard of the Nufrievsky temple, but, going towards the faithful, they did not do this.  The temple was consecrated in honor of Seraphim of Sarov. </p><h2>  Interesting places in Anapa for children </h2><p>  It is no secret that Anapa is a popular resort for families with children.  And this is not surprising - a magnificent mild climate, luxurious beaches with a smooth entry into the water, lots of fruits ... In addition, the resort administration makes a lot of efforts and means for organizing the relaxation of young guests.  Therefore, they will not be bored here. </p><h2>  Dolphinarium Nemo </h2><p>  It is part of the complex of the same name along with the zoo "Balu" and the aquarium.  The dolphinarium is located on Pioneer Avenue, two kilometers from the city center.  In summer they give up to five performances daily.  Fascinating shows are attended by fur seals and bottlenose dolphins, sea lion and walrus.  All viewers take great pleasure from the performance of unusual artists, well, and the children are simply delighted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting places near anapa" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/1398246.jpg" width="600"></div>
