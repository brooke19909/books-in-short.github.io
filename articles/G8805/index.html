But finally they did not die.  There are also those who appreciate the warm, tube-like, analog sound.  A vivid proof of this is the return to fashion of vinyl players, which now cost a lot of money.  But what about cassettes?  Of course, the sound on these media is not as high quality as on vinyl, but they also have their fans.  Along with the era of cassettes, multifunctional devices for their reproduction (tape recorders and decks) have sunk into oblivion.  However, there are some signs that cassettes will return soon.  Proof of this is the release of the Panasonic RX-D55 radio.  And this is in 2014!  Consider this universal device in more detail. </p><h2>  A little bit about the company </h2><p>  This company was founded back in 1919.  True, then it was called differently.  But this does not detract from her venerable age.  Over its history, the manufacturer has been engaged in the production of specialized production equipment, all kinds of electronics (including household), the production of mobile phones, cameras, players and the production of many other goods.  <span>Cassette recorders</span> made in Japan were especially valued.  Then the label of this company was considered synonymous with the highest quality products.  And now nothing has changed.  Proof of this is the Panasonuc RX-D55 magnetotole.  But more on that later. </p>

    <p>  Around the eighties of the last century, the company mastered the production of multi-functional sound "harvesters", which included a CD player, radio and cassette deck.  Such devices have become very popular among potential buyers.  Therefore, the company decided to expand its product line.  But many years have passed since then.  What made Panasonic release a cassette recorder these days?  Nobody knows that.  But the Panasonic RX-D55 EE K was a real hit.  Now consider it in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  So, the Panasonic RX-D55 comes in a color cardboard box.  Inside - all the necessary pieces of paper, the radio itself, a remote control (by the way, rather big), a wire for connecting to the electric network and batteries in order for the clock to work.  You should not expect more from such a product.  This is still not a high-tech gadget, but a kind of "greetings from the nineties."  Therefore, you will not find anything supernatural in the package.  But this is for the better.  Brevity is the soul of wit. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, the presence of batteries and a remote control is incredibly pleasing.  There is one more feature in the Panasonic RX-D55 delivery set - the instruction manual is completely in Russian.  Although in the case of TM "Panasonic" there is nothing surprising in this.  In addition to the instructions, there is also a warranty card.  The product warranty is one year.  This is quite enough for such a device. </p><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  The Panasonic RX-D55 looks like a regular tape recorder from the nineties.  The similarity is exacerbated by the presence of a cassette deck on the top panel.  There are several color options: black and silver.  Which one is better and more practical is for the buyer to choose.  But both options are made of durable high-quality plastic.  On the front panel there is an LCD display, a CD tray, control buttons and all the necessary ports.  This arrangement of the CD player is very convenient, as it eliminates the possibility of damage to the disk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  On the rear panel of the Panasonic RX-D55 is a battery compartment, a headphone jack and all kinds of ventilation grilles.  The power cord is also plugged in at the back.  The advantage of this radio is also its weight.  This immediately suggests that we have a high-quality and solid product.  However, the design is a bit archaic.  In any case, in 2017, he looks like a blatant anachronism.  But the main thing is not the appearance.  It is much more important that the <span>radio</span> sound <span>good</span> .  Let's move on to its functions. </p><h2>  Radio functions </h2><p>  So, what features can we please the Panasonic RX-D55?  We won‚Äôt touch the specifications yet.  The device includes a cassette player with the functions of auto-stop, fast-forward and search for the desired composition.  It provides playback of any magnetic cassette (even the most jammed one).  Also, the radio has a radio with memory for 16 stations, operating in the FM-AM bands.  Everything would be very nice if there was still support for RDS - text information sent by radio stations.  The radio also has an alarm function that can be set using the remote control. </p>

    <p>  Below the LCD is the CD player.  It is capable of reproducing MP3, WAV, WMA, CD-AUDIO formats.  Pretty good set for the radio, made in the style of the nineties.  But that is not all.  Panasonic RX-D55 is equipped with a USB port, which makes it possible to play music from a regular USB flash drive.  Song tags are also supported.  And the radio can also be used as an amplifier with speakers for a laptop, PC or mobile phone.  To do this, there is a special output on the front panel called Music Port. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the most interesting - the technical specifications of the Panasonic RX-D55.  The design of the speakers uses ceramic diffusers, which should provide the highest sound quality.  And this, judging by the reviews, is indeed so.  The total power of the audio system is 20 watts.  It turns out that about 10 watts per column.  As a magnetic ‚Äúhead‚Äù of a cassette player, a high-quality reader from Panasonic is used.  The laser CD player is also manufactured by this company. </p>

    <p>  Two-way speakers with a diameter of 80 millimeters are installed in the radio.  This provides a fairly high quality sound.  Which is very good, if you recall the cost of this tape recorder.  The Panasonic RX-D55 cassette player, reviews of which we will analyze a little later, supports CD-R and CD-RW standard discs.  DVD support is not provided.  And this is good, because otherwise the device would be much heavier and bigger.  So his absence is only a plus. </p><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  So, what is the sound of the Panasonic RX-D55?  According to the reviews of the owners, it is simply gorgeous.  Especially when playing high-quality, branded CDs.  However, in order for the radio to ‚Äúsound‚Äù, some manipulations must be made.  The radio has a built-in equalizer, which must be adjusted to ensure high quality sound.  There is also a virtual stereo extension button.  And it really works!  After pressing this key, the sound quality is noticeably equalized.  In addition, a volume appears. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to the high-quality speakers with ceramic diffusers, the sound was much better than you would imagine.  Even the playback of magnetic cassettes is very high quality.  Although such a sound is a visiting card of Panasonic products.  This has long been known to everyone, so their products are well-deserved.  Especially if it was assembled in Japan.  Then there is no price for these devices. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Studying the reviews left by the owners of these devices helps to understand how the gadget works in real conditions, find out its strengths and weaknesses, and decide whether to buy it at all.  As for our hero, many compose laudatory odes to this device.  They note high sound quality, convenient and clear settings, and a multifunctional remote control.  Fans of analog sound are delighted with the quality of cassette playback.  Also, many are pleased with the price of the device and the ability to receive Panasonic RX-D55 by mail.  This makes this device very attractive to many music lovers. </p>

    <p>  Many users note the highest workmanship of the Panasonic RX-D55 and the overall quality of the materials.  Everything is adjusted to the nearest millimeter.  Nowhere creaks, does not crack and does not fall off.  This is a sign of a quality product.  In general, there are more positive reviews about this device than negative ones.  And the ‚ÄúPanasonic‚Äù in a different way and does not happen.  However, let's now consider the reviews of the dissatisfied.  They are.  There cannot be them.  So... </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Those who leave dissatisfied comments want something more from a product such as a universal radio with a cassette deck.  Yes, there are many alternative options on the market now, but they are all much more expensive.  So let's not look into the teeth of an almost gifted horse.  From criticism, it should be noted that the cassette receiver does not open in the Panasonic RX-D55.  Sometimes.  Apparently, I got a factory marriage.  It's all about snaps.  You need to open it physically, clean the latches and try again.  Also, many lament that the batteries needed to operate on batteries are small in size, which negatively affects battery life.  But with other batteries, the device would become many times heavier.  Designers thought it would be better.  These are the main disadvantages of the radio.  Otherwise, everything is fine with her. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The universal Panasonic RX-D55 radio tape recorder has the ability to play music from magnetic <span>tapes, CDs</span> and a USB drive.  Also, the device has a radio.  Based on the ratio "price - quality", this model is the best in the modern market of universal music players.  A plus is the chic sound. </p>
