    <h2>  A brief background of the "European" </h2><p>  Evropeisky Bank began operations in Kaliningrad in 1991.  Initially, it was called “Baltkonversbank”.  After about four years, the financial institution was reorganized and became known as the “European” Bank. </p><p>  Its priority area was servicing legal entities, therefore, among the bank's clients were heads of large metallurgical, engineering, transport and construction enterprises, as well as corporate clients represented by influential people of the city and region. </p>

    <h2>  Evropeisky Bank (Kaliningrad): ATMs, branches and owners </h2><p>  Until a certain moment, the bank's clients were about 4,000 owners of various firms and large corporations.  Since its opening, the organization has improved its level of service and developed its own branch network, which included six branches and about 29 ATMs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First, the founders of the organization were the following companies: </p><ul><li>  Converse Bank; </li><li>  “CentroVEKS”; </li><li>  STC "Inform"; </li><li>  “City Development Fund”; </li><li>  VEF Kaliningrad-Itorg. </li></ul><p>  From December 2012 until the beginning of 2014, the main holder of shares of the credit institution was Iluzanion Consulting Limited, a company registered in Cyprus.  Also, part of the bank's shares belonged to the Regionfond non-state pension fund and several private individuals. </p><p>  Prior to the revocation of the license, Evropeisky occupied 245 place in the <span>ranking of banks</span> in terms of the size of its own assets.  The net profit of this organization was 124.6 million rubles.  At the same time, the share of equity amounted to 980 million rubles, and the size of assets - 9.84 billion rubles.  Such a stable and promising was the bank "European" (Kaliningrad).  The license of this financial organization was revoked in December 2014.  What is the reason for this?  And what are the consequences for the bank? </p>

    <h2>  Why was the license revoked from the bank? </h2><p>  There are several reasons for the withdrawal of a license from the European Bank.  One of them is the financial problems of Investbank, which, oddly enough, affected almost all organizations in the region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the same time, rumors spread that many financial organizations in Kaliningrad and the region were also in for an unenviable fate.  As a result, under the windows of most lending institutions, including Evropeisky Bank (Kaliningrad), crowds of excited depositors appeared. </p><p>  Due to such a great stir, the bank representatives were forced to set a daily limit of 10,000 rubles in order to reduce passions and minimize <span>capital outflows.</span>  However, even these emergency measures did not help: the influx of investors did their job and the material stability of the “European” was shaken. </p><p>  The second reason is called by the regulator himself, referring to the high-risk policy of the organization, violations of maintaining and submitting planned reports, regulatory acts, as well as the lack of the bank's ability to pay off creditors' accounts.  According to preliminary information, Evropeisky Bank (Kaliningrad) was on the verge of bankruptcy, as it had a negative balance sheet (about 1.3 billion rubles). </p><h2>  What are the consequences of revoking a license from a bank? </h2><p>  After the license was withdrawn from the “European”, the regulator created a provisional administration, the bank was put up for auction, and the “Deposit Insurance Agency” returned approximately 3.7 billion rubles to the depositors of the financial institution. </p><h2>  Who purchased the "European" at a bargain price? </h2><p>  In January last year, Evropeisky Bank (Kaliningrad) was acquired by Saint Petersburg Bank, one of the thirty most influential and largest financial institutions in Russia.  The purchase of a semi-bankrupt bank cost its buyer 625 million rubles. </p>

    <h2>  What happened to the customers of the "European"? </h2><p>  In January of this year, the buyer settled all the legal issues and finally became the full owner of the "European".  In particular, after the purchase, this bank took pride of place in the line of the branch network of Bank Saint Petersburg.  Its head was the former chairman of the board of the once prosperous, and now bankrupt credit organization <span>Dmitry Danilov.</span>  In turn, all the clients of the former “European” were very quickly transferred to the service of the bank “St. Petersburg”. </p><p>  Moreover, the website of Evropeisky Bank (Kaliningrad) has not changed its domain name and has not changed almost visually.  He remained the same as he was.  But on the site itself is already information about "St. Petersburg". </p>
