Who this is, clear from the narrative, is referring to Bonaparte Napoleon.  Moreover, in the context of the definition, it is clear that it has a condemning character, and the emperor of France himself would not want to wear such a nickname.  What does it mean? </p>

    <h2>  Democracy and Usurpation </h2><p>  Today, the state system is considered democratic if the power in it is divided into three branches, when it is three-headed, like a dragon or the Serpent Gorynych.  Legislative bodies in different countries called Dumas, Rada, Reichstag, Rigdsdag, Senates and other synonymous linguistic word formations, as is clear from their general definition, develop codes, amendments, constitutions or amendments to them.  So they fulfill the will of the voters.  The second branch is executive, because the best law is absolutely useless if at least part of the state‚Äôs population does not consider it mandatory.  And the third power is the judiciary, which deals with cases when regulatory acts are nevertheless violated by individual irresponsible citizens, for whom the majority opinion is not so important.  All these subtleties of state legal science are very important, but what does the usurper have to do with it?  The meaning of the Latin word "usurpatio" (possession of something) reflects the opposite of the nature of the action of a person worked out by humanity in the agony and mistakes of good democratic traditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Usurper.  Who is that? </h2><p>  In a legal state, regardless of its degree of democracy (it can be a republic, a kingdom, a kingdom, a sultanate, or a caliphate) during its existence, certain social relations take shape that are considered normal, that is, habitual.  People born under some orders, brought up on the traditions of their ancestors, know what they can and what cannot, even if they do not have a legal education, or some of them cannot even read.  And then suddenly the usurper seizes power.  ‚ÄúWho is this, and why does he tell us how to live?‚Äù  - ordinary citizens ask themselves a question, not hiding their irritation and indignation.  At this moment, the new ruler, having taken possession of the powers of all the mentioned <span>branches of power</span> and arrogated to himself the right to decide everything individually (a collegiality option is possible, if a group of conspirators came to power) will definitely use force to suppress dissatisfaction.  Terror is a compulsory companion of usurpation; without tyranny it is impossible. </p>

    <h2>  The most famous usurpers </h2><p>  The most famous of them - the already mentioned Bonaparte, who became the first French emperor, before him in Paris simply kings ruled.  The Roman dictator Julius Caesar also seized the sole <span>power, it</span> was half a century before Christ.  <span>Augustus Octavian</span> founded the great Roman Empire, having seized the throne by not quite correct methods.  The English king Henry the Seventh also sinned.  As a result of a <span>military-palace coup</span> , Empress Catherine II became empress, removing her husband from power. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the twentieth century, many countries also had their own usurper.  Who it was in Russia - Kerensky, who occupied the royal chambers, Lenin, who arrested the <span>Provisional Government</span> or Stalin, who gradually cracked down on the Leninist Politburo, is up to historians to decide, but to some extent, each of them falls into this definition.  Mussolini, Hitler, and even General De Gaulle, who took over the reins of power and leveled the action of democratic institutions, also have the dubious honor of being called that.  This is not to mention other dictators, sometimes tyrants (like the Haitian Duvalier), or fiery revolutionaries from Latin American countries.  Usurpation is sometimes a useful and even necessary measure, especially when a country is close to complete collapse.  But the consequences of such actions have to be judged by the results. </p>

    <h2>  Computer usurper </h2><p>  The hero of the computer game is a ghostly usurper.  He has his own virtual attributes, namely: armor, knives, belts, boots, gloves, and even such exotic items of equipment as bracers.  As often happens, players do not think about the ethical side of their hobby, it is important for them to achieve the treasured level and capture as much as possible.
