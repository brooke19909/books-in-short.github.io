    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Pitsunda sanatoriums receive many kind words addressed primarily to attentive and experienced staff.  This is especially true of the Boxwood Grove sanatorium.  Many note that their health status after the course of treatment has improved.  And in the sanatorium "Litfonda" visitors are unhappy with the monotonous food. </p><p>  As for boarding houses, the impressions of staying in them are different.  For example, in the boarding house “Iren” - full compliance of price and quality against the background of good service and the friendliness of the staff.  And in the boarding house "Riviera" a very attractive landscape design, but the condition of the rooms, according to reviews, leaves much to be desired.  At the same time, the overwhelming majority of tourists have remained quite rest in the sanatoriums and boarding houses of Pitsunda. </p>
