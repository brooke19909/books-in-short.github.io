It still has ancient buildings with low roofs and cramped streets, which can be called the heritage of Simbirsk (this city was called in the old days).  The areas of Ulyanovsk - Leninsky, Zasviyazhsky, Zavolzhsky, Zheleznodorozhny - will be covered in this article. </p><h2>  Ulyanovsk: general information </h2><p>  Ulyanovsk - the city in which Vladimir Ilyich Lenin was born, is located on the banks of the Volga.  Parts of the city, located on the right and left banks of the great Russian river, are connected by a railway and two road bridges.  Ulyanovsk is surrounded on all sides by forests and many bodies of water formed by floods.  Until 1924 it was called Simbirsk and was the center of the province of the same name. </p>

    <p>  The city is divided into 4 districts, almost identical in terms of occupied territory.  Lenin and Zasviyazhsky districts are separated by <span>the Sviyaga river.</span>  Zavolzhsky district of Ulyanovsk is located on the left bank of the Volga.  The railway district was named after the railway station operating on its territory. </p><h2>  Leninsky district </h2><p>  The most elite district of Ulyanovsk and its historical center has always been the Leninsky district.  During the reign of the kings, noble nobles and wealthy merchants lived in it.  To date, a large number of their houses have been preserved, giving the city center unique features.  In this urban area there are many architectural and historical monuments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Leninsky district has zones: Center and North.  The center is the most prestigious and expensive territory of Ulyanovsk.  There are a large number of offices, banks, business centers and other institutions.  New houses, apartments in which have a large area, are being built according to atypical projects.  True, only sufficiently wealthy people can afford to own them.  The complex of road structures in this part of Ulyanovsk meets all the necessary requirements. </p><p>  The North is a zone in which the main inhabitants of the city live.  Khrushchev and the private sector prevail here.  Currently, it is built up with modern residential complexes. </p>

    <h2>  Zasviyazhsky district </h2><p>  This area of ‚Äã‚ÄãUlyanovsk gives the impression of an industrial zone.  Its development dates back to the commissioning in 1941 of the Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant.  For the needs of the plant, a concrete and brick factory, a thermal power station were also built in this territory.  In 1944, an engine repair plant was commissioned.  These large industrial enterprises, only under other names, operate today. </p><p>  The territory of the Zasviyazhsky district of Ulyanovsk is divided into the Near and Far Zasviyazhie.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Near Zasviyazhie there are many five-story Khrushchevs that fall into the housing renovation program.  In the Far Zasviyazhie, construction is underway, new microdistricts appear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Zavolzhsky District (Ulyanovsk) </h2><p>  Zavolzhsky district is the most remote from the city center, a separate district of Ulyanovsk.  It connects to the right-bank areas by rail and road bridges. </p><p>  The area, which includes three neighborhoods (New Town, Lower and Upper Terrace), dates back to 1916.  In this time period, the Simbirsk cartridge plant began to function, in which they began to build a village for workers.  In 1952, when a decision was made at the state level to flood this territory with the waters of the Kuibyshev reservoir, the village and the plant itself were preserved.  Work began on the construction of a unique dam of grandiose sizes. </p><p>  Zavolzhsky district developed rapidly.  New houses were built in it, various enterprises were opened.  The Ulyanovsk Aviation-Industrial Complex was built on its territory. </p><p>  The new city is considered to be the place of residence of aircraft manufacturers.  It was erected, focusing on the aviation complex.  It has wide avenues, spacious sidewalks and a sweeping construction site. </p>

    <h2>  Zheleznodorozhny District </h2><p>  At the end of the 19th century, a railway ran in the territory of this region of Ulyanovsk, and the station building was built.  The lands around the train station began to be populated by people working on the railway. </p><p>  During the war with the fascist invaders, the engine factory was evacuated here.  In record time, it launched production for the front. </p><p>  The railway district of Ulyanovsk is divided into two zones: Kindyakovka and the 4th microdistrict.  Kindyakovka got its name from the village of the landowner with the same name, located in the old days on this territory. </p>
