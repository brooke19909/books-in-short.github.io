    <p>  If we say that Kaliningrad is the administrative center of the Russian enclave and the capital of the westernmost region of our state, it is like saying nothing.  The city is called the window to Europe, but that's not all.  The authoritative magazine Kommersant, compiling annual ratings of the best cities in Russia, awarded Kaliningrad the first place for the last three years.  According to Forbes, the best conditions in the country for doing business are created here.  RBC also called Kaliningrad the most beautiful city in Russia.  What is so attractive for tourists?  I will not be mistaken if I say that a mixture of cultures - Western European and Slavic - gives the city a special charm.  This article is a brief overview of what to see in Kaliningrad and the region in a few days. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Many people who want to see the Amber Region are scared that the region is an enclave.  That is, it does not have a land border with Russia.  From the north and east it borders with Lithuania, and from the south - with Poland.  Therefore, the question arises of whether a tourist has a foreign passport, and even with a visa.  But this applies only to those cases when you travel by train, bus or own car.  Naturally, an international passport is not required for air travel: you travel within your own country.  And do not forget that from the west, Kaliningrad, the photo of which you probably saw on the posters, washes the Baltic Sea.  This makes it possible to get to the Amber Region by water.  You can take a fascinating journey on the cruise ship "Georg Ots" from St. Petersburg, or sail on a simple passenger ferry.  In the <span>Kaliningrad region,</span> many Russians do not go sightseeing, but to buy cars.  Such shopping tours paved the way to the Lithuanian Embassy.  Get a transit visa to travel to the Russian enclave will not be a problem. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  At the crossroads </h2><p>  This city had many names: Tuvangste, K√∂nigsberg, Krulevets, Kunenngsgarbs, Knigsberg, Karaliautsius and, finally, Kaliningrad.  The history of the city is rooted in the Middle Ages.  Once upon a time in this lowland, along the banks of the river Pregolya, there were three Prussian settlements.  Residents were mainly engaged in fishing and salting of fish.  In 1255, the Knights of the Teutonic Order built a powerful fortress near one village - Tuvangste.  The citadel was named K√∂nigsberg in honor of the King of Bohemia, Ottokar Przemysl II.  Later this name spread to all the merged fishing villages.  People who know the German language are surprised: after all, K√∂nigsberg literally translates as ‚Äúroyal mountain‚Äù, and the language does not turn to name the low bank.  But we must remember that the name of the fortress was given by Prussians of Gothic origin.  Many researchers associate the etymology of the toponym with the name ‚Äúroyal coast‚Äù.  Since the city under the Teutonic Knights came to economic prosperity, it was known not only by its immediate neighbors.  They translated the name K√∂nigsberg into their languages.  On the old Russian maps of the times of Peter the Great, he appears as the King.  During World War II, Koenigsberg was almost completely destroyed by Soviet troops.  Liberators, in order to better gain a foothold on this shore, and the city came up with a different name.  Since July 4, 1946, Konigsberg was renamed the city of Kaliningrad.  This was done to honor the memory of the Soviet politician.  Namely, Mikhail Kalinin.  Since then, the city has been living under a new name. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to see in Kaliningrad in a few hours </h2><p>  The ancient K√∂nigsberg can be examined endlessly.  Local residents say that they themselves have not yet studied all the sights of the city.  But if you arrived for a day, and you have at your disposal only a couple of hours - it does not matter.  A city tour will allow you to see the main attractions and learn interesting facts from the history of the Konigsberg fortress and the Amber Coast.  And then you can walk around the places you like, take spectacular pictures, take a leisurely stroll around Altstadt - the old city.  In it you will find many pubs and cozy cafes, shops and souvenir shops.  To enjoy the soothing spirit of Europe, do not deny yourself the pleasure of having a cup of coffee with delicious local pastries in an old pastry shop.  And you absolutely must have lunch at Koenigsberg bugs - unless, of course, you are a vegetarian.  Then you should go to the <span>island of Kant</span> along the bridge of lovers, completely hung with locks.  And to take with you as a souvenir you need a box of marzipan.  These sweet almond products are peculiar sights of the city of Kaliningrad. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monuments of Kaliningrad" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/401058.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Museum Night, or When to Come </h2><p>  There are many museums in this city, and some of them, such as the Amber Museum, the World Ocean or the B-413 submarine, are truly unique.  In 2006, a project was launched to hold Museum Night in Kaliningrad.  Since then every year on certain weekends all the temples of the city's culture hospitably open their doors to visitors and work around the clock.  The event is accompanied by street concerts, exhibitions, theatrical performances and performances by historical reenactors.  In 2014, such a Museum Night passed on May 16-17.  So plan for the future.  Since at this time there is an influx of tourists, you need to book a hotel ahead of time or rent an apartment for rent.  Well, except for the Kaliningrad night of museums, it is better to come to the city in late spring and summer.  The weather pleases with good days, it is getting dark late.  In Kaliningrad, there are other, no less interesting events.  For example, the International Jazz Festival.  Summer is a great time to explore the sights of Kaliningrad and the region.  Believe me, the northern nature of the Curonian Spit is charming, and the abundance of fortresses in the district simply dazzles. </p><h2>  Castle history </h2>

    <p>  <span>What to see in Kaliningrad</span> first?  Of course, the fortress.  This citadel simply cannot be missed, although only one place remains from it - Central Square.  This focus, one might say, is the heart of the city.  If not for it, maybe there would have been no Kaliningrad, but there would still have been three fishing villages.  What did the monk knights on this north coast need?  The fact is that at the beginning of the 13th century pagans still lived here.  The Pope proclaimed a crusade in these lands in order to convert the Prussians to the Catholic faith.  The local aborigines were Christianized by the Knights Templar monks, and the money for military purposes was sponsored by the King of Bohemia, Ottokar II Przemysl.  In honor of him, the fortress, which was built in 1255, and was named K√∂nigsberg.  At first it was wooden.  But she was constantly being rebuilt to maintain her ability to defend herself.  After all, weapons were being improved more and more.  As a result of numerous reconstructions, a powerful citadel appeared.  In addition, forts were erected near the city in order to block the advance of K√∂nigsberg to a possible adversary.  It kept a collection of paintings by European artists, a collection of porcelain and silver products, the archaeological museum operated.  Here, for the last time, people could see the famous Amber Room, which mysteriously disappeared during the war.  When the city was liberated, the castle was badly damaged, and in 1969 the ruins were blown up and demolished.  Now there are archaeological excavations, and a special observation deck is equipped for tourists. </p><h2>  Castle and city </h2>

Under the shadow of the Templar Order, all three villages began to flourish.  Gradually, they were granted city rights (in 1286, 1300, and 1327). By the end of the 14th century, Altstadt, Neustadt, and Kneiphof merged together, and K√∂nigsberg joined the Hanseatic League (an analogue of the current Free Trade Zone).  In the 15th century, economic prosperity reached such a level that the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order transfers his residence here.  In the 16th century, Albrecht Hohenzollern turned the theocratic state into a secular duchy.  Until 1675, it was in vassal dependence on Poland.  With its division in the XVIII century, an independent Prussian kingdom is formed here.  How did this western gothic got to our state?  Until 1945, Konigsberg and its environs were part of Germany as the province of <span>East Prussia.</span>  After the war, according to the decision of the <span>Potsdam Conference,</span> all this territory was transferred to the Soviet Union, and a year later the city was renamed Kaliningrad.

    <p>  As you can see, the city and the castle were inextricably linked by cultural and economic ties.  The symbol of the triumph of the Roman Catholic faith was the cathedral, which even now adorns Kaliningrad.  Photos of this magnificent building you see here.  The foundation of the cathedral was laid by Bishop Johannes Clare in 1333.  The temple dedicated to the Virgin Mary and St. Adalbert, was built on the island of Kneiphof (now Kant) for about half a century.  Northern Gothic prevails in the architectural design of the building, although at first it was conceived as part of the defensive fortifications.  This is evidenced by the powerful masonry of the eastern wall with a thickness of three meters.  The cathedral was previously adjoined by the episcopal palace and an orphanage.  The complex was rebuilt under the Masters Luther von Braunschweig and Wienrich von Kniprode, as well as during the Duchy, when the building acquired the features of the Northern Renaissance.  When the University of Albertina was founded in K√∂nigsberg (1544), all professors began to have the right to be buried within the walls of the Cathedral.  The famous philosopher <span>Immanuel Kant</span> was the last one whose remains rest in 1804 in a sarcophagus of black granite surrounded by twelve columns.  Also here is the tomb of Duke Albrecht and his family.  The restoration of the temple destroyed by the war began only in 1990 and continues to this day.  Now in the building of the cathedral Orthodox services and Protestants conduct. </p><h2>  Fish village </h2><p>  What to see interesting in Kaliningrad yet?  Once you are on the island of Kant, take a walk along the promenade, admiring the building of the old university, and cross the drawbridge across the river.  You will be taken to the Fish Village, built in 2006 on the site of the old German village.  Half-timbered houses and tiled roofs give this complex the look of Little Europe.  There are shops, fish taverns, the observation tower "Lighthouse" and even the hotel "Skipper".  The streets of the village are decorated with romantic lanterns, comfortable benches, interesting sculptures.  Not a single wedding in the city is complete without a photo shoot in this cozy corner.  In summer, cutters go for a walk along the Pregol from the pier of the River Station.  Having left the Fish Village, we set off to explore other architectural monuments.  Kaliningrad is a modern city, but it boasts that the ancient gate has been preserved in it.  In fact, there are several such fortified entrances to the old K√∂nigsberg.  But the most recognizable, original hallmark of the city are the Brandenburg Gate.  Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they still continue to fulfill their function.  The gates are decorated with sculptural portraits of famous reformers and military figures.  They are named so because they previously stood on the path leading to the castle of the same name. </p>

    <h2>  Museums </h2><p>  What other sights are there in ancient K√∂nigsberg (now the city of Kaliningrad)?  The Amber Museum is well known to everyone.  It is located on the shores of Lake Superior, in the city center.  Having visited his exposition, you can learn not only about the largest amber deposit in the world, but also see a lot of beautiful gizmos made of ‚Äúsun stone‚Äù.  For centuries, craftsmen have mastered the art of processing this frozen resin of prehistoric trees, and this can be seen by looking at any jewelry store or even a souvenir shop.  The Museum of the World Ocean in Kaliningrad is also unique.  This is the only exposition in Russia devoted entirely to marine painting.  The museum was opened in 1990, and since then its collection of marine fauna and flora has been constantly expanded. </p><p>  The Kaliningrad Art Gallery has collected in its halls more than ten thousand works of sculpture, painting and decorative art.  Konigsberg Zoo is considered the oldest in Russia.  It was opened in 1896 by a German philanthropist German Klaas.  At that time, the collection consisted of 900 animals and birds of 260 species.  For more than a century of the zoo's existence, the exposition has been steadily expanding.  The Submarine Museum in Kaliningrad has information on the development of the navy in our country.  Submarine B-413 in 1997 was officially withdrawn from service and converted into a museum.  K√∂nigsberg has always been called a walled city.  Its powerful fortifications of different eras have now turned into museums.  You can travel around the suburbs of Kaliningrad and see the forts that once blocked the enemy‚Äôs path into the city.  There are seventeen of them, but to make an impression it‚Äôs enough to visit at least one.  K√∂nigsberg became the scene of fierce fighting during World War II.  About those events are narrated by the expositions of the museums ‚ÄúDugout‚Äù, ‚ÄúCommand Post No. 43‚Äù, History of the BBB, ‚ÄúFort No. 5‚Äù. </p><h2>  Curonian Spit </h2><p>  If you have already decided what to see interesting in Kaliningrad, it's time to go outside the city.  There are many medieval castles in the area, left to us by the warlike Teutons.  The wonderful nature of the Curonian Spit with its unique dancing forest cannot be ignored.  At some moment, the trees begin to bend.  None of the scientists can still unravel the reason for this behavior of the forest.  This sandy peninsula of dunes is even included in the UNESCO List.  On the territory of the spit, a national natural park has been opened. </p>
