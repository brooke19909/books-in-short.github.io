In general, the territory occupies two quarters.  His neighbors are a site named after Gagarin and the New World.  But these zones, the administration says, do not have such a developed infrastructure as this complex.  Information about this territory can be found in the material. </p><h2>  Military zone </h2><p>  The developer was Morton Group of Companies.  This company has earned a good name for itself, thanks to the ability to hand over almost completely objects in a short time. </p><p>  Construction work has been intensively carried out here since 2000.  Earlier in this territory was an army unit.  At first, the authorities planned that Russian soldiers and their families would live on this land.  All housing has been privatized. </p>

Therefore, part of the apartments was sold.  Other owners rent rooms.  Therefore, there is the opportunity to move to the prestigious 30 microdistrict (Aviators).  Balashikha is located on the border of Moscow, and apartments here are much cheaper.  In addition, many people enjoy the benefits that the military provides.

    <h2>  Design and execution </h2><p>  At first, about 24 thousand people were planned to settle in this part.  However, the favorable location and attractiveness of commercial institutions in this area contributed to the fact that the number of residential buildings increased.  The new figure reached the mark of 50 thousand.  The first apartments were settled back in 2011.  It should be noted that even today, construction continues on this territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Decorated in accordance with all modern standards of the new building.  Balashikha is a fairly large city.  Potoemu thoughtful building design plays a key role here.  Parents are most pleased that in each yard there are playgrounds and sports grounds.  While they are new, they are therefore absolutely safe. </p><p>  Many residents claim that this site, like the city itself, is poor in terms of attractions.  There are few good restaurants and cafes.  People do not like shopping centers and entertainment complexes.  For this you need to go to the capital. </p><p>  As in any other point, the first floors were occupied by commercial structures.  Shops and pharmacies open here.  Enough of beauty salons, financial structures and points selling equipment.  Therefore, in order to buy everything you need, you can not leave the area, according to residents. </p><p>  Another positive point is the apartments.  Microdistrict Aviators built by modern standards. </p>

    <h2>  All for convenience </h2><p>  According to the project, 24 houses were built on this site.  Their height reaches 14-24 floors.  Apartments for one, two and three rooms.  Subsequently, they began to build houses in 4-5 halls.  Residents of the district like the fact that the houses are equipped with passenger and freight elevators.  This greatly facilitates relocation and repair. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Young mothers and people with disabilities are satisfied that ramps are installed everywhere.  Moreover, for people who cannot leave on their own, lifts work. </p><p>  Equipped with a security room for new buildings.  Balashikha is one of the cities where there are many robberies.  The staff monitors the cleanliness and order of the entrances.  Due to constant monitoring, the crime rate has become lower.  This moment is especially pleasing to residents due to the fact that the city does not differ in a calm environment.  Residents claim that there are both lone scammers and large criminal groups. </p>

    <h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  Location is one of the factors that attracts people.  The territory is located just 5 kilometers from the border of Moscow.  Schelkovo highway passes nearby.  From this road by car to the capital - 6 km.  No less important transport links are Balashikha road and ul.  Starry.  It is they who connect this point with Moscow and the region. </p><p>  The city of Balashikha has a fairly developed infrastructure.  The Aviator microdistrict has its own transport.  There are many buses that run along the territory.  It should be noted that there are also minibuses for domestic use that go only on this site. </p><p>  There are practically no traffic jams on intra-district routes.  The accumulation of cars begins closer to the exit of the quarter. </p>

    <h2>  Typical situation </h2><p>  The nearest metro station Shchelkovskaya is at a distance of 9 km.  However, the Balashikha railway stop is 5 km away, and trains from it run to the capital's Kursk Station.  40-50 minutes is the time spent on the road. </p><p>  But more and more people are concerned about the problem of the route to the capital.  People who work in Moscow dream of leaving 30 housing estates (Aviators).  Balashikha is not far from the big city, but the road takes a lot of time.  The flow of cars is so large, according to residents, that even the metro needs to be reached by public transport for more than an hour.  With the construction of new complexes, the situation is only getting worse.  But citizens say the problems with congestion on the roads are the same in all major cities. </p><p>  If you work directly in Balashikha, then there will be no problems.  Public transport moves fast and arrives on time.  The Aviator neighborhood index is branch dependent.  But the total is 143900. </p>

    <h2>  Nature problem </h2><p>  This quarter‚Äôs ad is another plus.  The ecology is very good, according to real estate sellers.  Nearby there are no factories and giant plants polluting the air.  Therefore, breathing here is easy and pleasant.  Not far from here, at 500 meters, Pekhorka flows.  This is a wonderful, picturesque river.  100 meters from forest stands.  However, residents of the district believe that not everything is so perfect, and note that recently trees have been actively cut down.  Also not so far located is the company that manufactures varnishes and paints.  Negatively affects the environment and the highway, which does not stop the movement of cars even at night.  In addition, the winds that blow from Moscow bring polluted air. </p><p>  Surrounded by forest and river 30 microdistrict (Aviators).  Balashikha is not such a big city, so the choice of where to relax, the residents are small.  And the townspeople say that these places are very polluted.  Everywhere trash.  There is an unpleasant odor from the water.  Also often there is a lot of smoke in the air, so even on cool summer evenings it is impossible to open the windows. </p><h2>  The future of the quarter </h2><p>  Two schools and four kindergartens work.  Local residents say that enrolling in a nursery is very difficult.  Those who moved with the guys from other cities and did not stand in line will absolutely not be able to get into the group.  Consequently, corruption is rampant in these institutions - parents complain.  You can only develop your little one in the capital, since there are no large and good additional sports and creative institutions here. </p>

Balashikha is a fairly large city that requires appropriate institutions.  The draft authorities to draw a light metro line on this territory.  Also, in the near future, the construction of a hospital will begin here, and then a large medical center.  The next step will be the construction of a sports and entertainment complex.  In addition, the administration plans to open several cultural institutions.
