This man made the first space flight in world history.  The Vostok launch vehicle with the Vostok spacecraft, in which Yuri Gagarin was stationed, was launched from the <span>Baikonur Cosmodrome</span> .  His journey into outer space lasted 108 minutes, but very few people know where Gagarin landed after the first flight into space. </p><h2>  Brief biography of the pilot </h2><p>  Yuri Gagarin - the man who made the world's first space flight.  It is worth noting that for this journey into outer space he received the honorary title of Hero of the Soviet Union.  Yuri was born on March 9, 1934 in the village of Klushino.  In 1941, Gagarin went to school, but already in October it was occupied by German troops.  Soon they drove the family of Yuri into the street, because of which they had to live in a dugout.  Gagarin witnessed the most terrible events when his father was severely beaten and forced to work, and his mother chased after the cars that took their children away.  After that, Yuri never mentioned the events of the Second World War.  After a year and a half of occupation, school studies resumed. </p><p>  Yuri Gagarin entered the Lyubertsy vocational school and evening school for working youth. </p><p>  In 1951, he entered the Saratov Industrial College.  In 1954, the pilot first visited the Saratov flying club.  The next year he managed to finish his studies with honors, he achieved great success, after which he made the first flight.  It is worth noting that in the flying club Yuri Gagarin made 196 flights. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Everyone knows and remembers Gagarin.  Because he made the first flight into space.  But it is worth noting that very few know where Gagarin landed. </p>

    <h2>  The first space flight made by Yuri Gagarin </h2><p>  <span>April 12,</span> 1961 there was a great event in history - the first flight into space.  Yuri Gagarin made a flight into outer space while aboard the Vostok spacecraft launched with a launch vehicle. </p><p>  Statistics show that both adults and children know about the first space flight, but few have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhere Yu. A. Gagarin landed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The ship made one revolution around the planet, after which it landed safely. </p><p>  It is worth saying that the launch of the rocket was successful.  After separation from the last stage of the launch vehicle, the ship safely began its journey in orbit around the planet. </p><p>  It should be noted that in 81.1 minutes the Vostok ship made a revolution around the Earth.  A connection was established with Yuri Gagarin, which was maintained throughout the flight. </p><p>  The first space flight, made by Yuri Gagarin, aroused interest from the whole world, and talk about the pilot did not take long to wait.  He turned into a world-class celebrity, after which foreign countries began to invite Gagarin.  Yuri conducted social and political work, and also visited 30 countries. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting facts about the first space flight.  Farewell letter from Yuri Gagarin </h2><p>  Everyone knows who made the first flight into space, but it is worth saying that many do not even know where Yuri Gagarin landed. </p><p>  Very recently, very interesting facts have become known that have never been announced before.  One of them was Gagarin's farewell letter.  2 days before the flight, he wrote his wife a farewell letter, which she should have been given in the event of a disaster.  Fortunately, sad events did not happen then. </p>

    <h2>  "I burn, goodbye, comrades!" </h2><p>  Only a few also know where Yuri Gagarin landed, despite the fact that everyone knows about the first space flight. </p><p>  During the flight into space, made by Yuri Gagarin, another event occurred, which few people still know about.  At the final stage of his flight, the pilot said: ‚ÄúI am burning, goodbye, comrades!‚Äù  It's hard to believe, but in his porthole the pilot really saw the flame, but he did not know its origin.  Gagarin suggested that his ship was on fire, because no one knew before how the passage of dense <span>layers of the atmosphere by a</span> ship would look like during descent.  However, fortunately, the flame turned out to be a normal working moment.  It was formed as a result of friction of heat-resistant casing against the atmosphere. </p><p>  Surprisingly, few people know not only this fact, but also where Gagarin landed. </p>

    <h2>  Two stunt doubles </h2><p>  Yuri Gagarin to the ship was escorted by two understudies.  One of them is German Titov, which everyone knew about.  However, the second understudy of Gagarin was Grigory Nelyubov.  Despite the fact that he was not dressed in a spacesuit, Nelyubov was ready at any moment to fly instead of Gagarin. </p><h2>  TASS appeals to the public </h2><p>  Before the first flight into space, 3 options for addressing the people were prepared.  The first of them was about a successful flight, the second - about the missed spacecraft <span>orbiting the Earth,</span> and the third - about the death of a pilot on board the Vostok spacecraft. </p><h2>  Where did Gagarin land? </h2><p>  Every student knows who made the first flight into space.  In honor of this event, <span>Cosmonautics Day</span> is celebrated every year on April 12th <span>.</span>  Surprisingly, many do not know about the place where Gagarin landed. </p><p>  On April 12, 1961, residents of the Smelovka village of the Saratov Region heard an explosion in the sky, after which two parachutes descended to the ground.  The villagers who witnessed this event did not even suspect that they were the first to see Yuri Gagarin after flying into space. </p><p>  The village of Smelovka near the city of Engels is the place where Gagarin landed.  It is worth noting that six years earlier the pilot graduated from the Saratov Industrial Institute, so the place of his landing became more than symbolic. </p><p>  After 4 years, an obelisk was installed there in the form of a rocket soaring up.  In 1981, right in front of the obelisk, a monument was erected to the first man in space - Yuri Gagarin.  Currently, there is also a leisure park. </p><p>  The first space flight is an event that will never be forgotten and will always cause admiration.  Yuri Gagarin not only made a huge contribution to history, science, etc., but also made a courageous act, which not everyone can decide.  One should be proud of such a person.  His memory will never fade, because the courageous act committed by Gagarin is worthy of respect.  The place where the great pilot landed is memorable not only for residents of the Saratov region, but also for citizens of the entire Russian Federation and guests of the country. </p>
