    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Rest in this hotel does not bring disappointment to anyone.  As for the rooms, it is necessary to choose between spacious apartments with 2 rooms or small triple rooms, but with a picturesque view of the sea.  If necessary, reserved seats can be replaced.  Everything for the convenience of customers has been done at the Paradise Beach 4 * hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Location Reviews </h2><p>  The most successful buildings for settlement are 3 and 4. In the first building, the view is not very picturesque, the 5 building overlooks the sea and the pool, so in the evenings it can be noisy.  Day and night near the pool entertainers are entertainers, music plays loudly. </p><p>  The hotel is not new.  But both the territory and the rooms are clean and comfortable.  The beds in the apartments are not very <span>high, the mattresses are</span> new and comfortable.  Sleeping is very comfortable.  There are extra pillows in the closet.  It is convenient that there are bedside tables, a small wardrobe.  Each room has a safe, but its use is paid.  The TV is on the table with two spacious niches.  It is old and catches only a few channels.  But on vacation this is not the main thing. </p><p>  It is disappointing that the rooms do not have refrigerators.  On the balconies there is plastic furniture and a clothes dryer.  Air conditioning works fine.  Insects in the rooms are not observed. </p><p>  The bathroom is not large.  It contains a sink, a bathtub and a bathroom.  Toiletries are available.  You can also use shower caps, cotton pads and chopsticks.  For each guest, 4 small and large towels are provided.  There is a hairdryer, but of an old model.  Better bring your own. </p><p>  If there are problems with water or sewage, you must contact the reception.  Specialists will quickly fix it. </p><p>  Internet is available for free only at the reception and in the lobby bar.  The hotel itself has an exchange office and a minimarket on the second floor. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The food at the Paradise Beach <span>4 *</span> hotel <span>(Bulgaria, Sveti Vlas) is</span> very tasty.  The food is varied and nutritious.  But almost all tourists recommend not ordering food on an all-inclusive basis.  After a while, the food may get bored, but since everything has already been paid for, you will have to go to the dining room.  It is best to order breakfast only, and during the day have a snack in restaurants and cafes.  The hotel's restaurant serves meat and fish dishes every day.  Sometimes you can enjoy seafood.  Huge selection of salads, vegetable dishes, side dishes, appetizers and sauces.  Very tasty breakfasts (scrambled eggs, pancakes with sweet sauces, cheeses and sausages, and even pies).  Dairy products and coffee are poor.  Of the fruits, watermelons, oranges, cherries and grapefruits are especially tasty. </p>

    <p>  The restaurant itself is in a very interesting place.  Seagulls are constantly circling around, trying to steal something from the table.  The staff drives them, as there are special places for birds where they are fed. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  A panoramic elevator delivers tourists to the beach.  This is a real miracle.  Not only does the hotel offer spectacular views of the mountains and the sea, it also looks very advantageous from the bottom due to the elevator.  Four huge elevators deliver guests to the beach and back without any problems.  There are practically no queues.  There are many sun loungers on the beach, you can not borrow in advance.  <span>Beach towels are</span> changed several times a day.  Sunset at sea gentle. </p><p>  On the beach there are all kinds of water activities. </p><h2>  Where to go on excursions? </h2><p>  For walks, you can choose the neighboring resort of Elenite.  There are many streets with shops, cozy cafes, exchangers, attractions and tour desks.  You can also visit the water park located within the Royal Castle. </p><p>  On the way to Elenite there are several eateries with seafood delicacies.  You can also go on an excursion to the town of Nessebar on a ship that leaves from the pier three times a day. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is a bus stop with buses to Elenite and Nessebar.  The schedule hangs at a stop.  You can go to the resort Sunny Beach for sightseeing.  St. Vlas can also surprise you with interesting places to visit.  Not too curious tourists may not even leave its borders in search of new adventures. </p><p>  From a stop near the hotel, a bus leaves every 15 minutes to the water park in Sunny Beach.  You can also visit the cheaper water park in Nessebar. </p>
