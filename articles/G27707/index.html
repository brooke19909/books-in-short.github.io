Finland became the owner of this territory around the middle of the 19th century, and earlier on this site was a Russian fortress called Rochensalm.  Translated from <span>Finnish,</span> Kotka means ‚Äúeagle‚Äù, and the name is given in honor of all the qualities that this bird possesses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cat finland" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/293163.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Those who live in the western part of our country can get to the city of Kotka very easily and quickly.  Finland begins abroad in the village of Torfyanovka, which can be reached by car, minibus or bus.  It should be noted that, moving along the E-18 highway, you will bypass this southern town and get to Helsinki. </p><p>  The most frequent emperor on these lands was <span>Alexander III.</span>  He came here with his family, went hunting, fished.  The king possessed real estate - in the Langinkoski area he had a hut.  Today it is one of the most visited museums in the city of Kotka.  Finland is a country in which both Scandinavian traditions and Russians are intertwined, so there are so many of our compatriots among tourists, and among the monuments of architecture and art there are many legacies of the Russian Empire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Kotka Finland" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/293115.jpg" width="600"></div>

Furniture, household items, books, and even any trifle that was left here by the emperor, are in their places.  When looking at all this economy, it becomes clear that the sovereign himself controlled the house - chopped firewood, fixed the problems, and his wife cleaned and cooked.  The house itself is surrounded by a lush garden, which is incredibly beautiful at any time of the year.  In the spring everything blooms here, like a rainbow, in the summer fruit trees and shrubs bear fruit, in the autumn everything hides in a yellow shroud of leaves, and in the winter a real white tale begins here. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that museums are the main <span>attractions.</span>  <span>Kotka</span> (Finland) <strong>&nbsp;</strong>  - a place where many wars were fought over the past century, so the aeronautics museum is held in high esteem here.  All kinds of aircraft models are presented here, starting from the rarest bombers that never saw the white light, ending with the real ‚Äúheroes‚Äù of past battles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tours to finland cat" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/293112.jpg" width="600"></div>
