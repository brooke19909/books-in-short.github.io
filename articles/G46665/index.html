Photo Description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Vendome column in the capital of France, Paris, was opened in August 1810.  Designed as Austerlitz.  It was later called the "Victory Column."  The story goes: Napoleon I Bonaparte originally intended to immortalize his Italian Victoria.  He threatened to transport from Rome a structure symbolizing the victory of Trajan over the Dacians.  What was the fate of the sights of a country where revolutions have always been a familiar thing? </p>

    <h2>  In place of the palace of the Duke of Vendome </h2><p>  When assessing the cost of transportation, the emperor apparently came to the conclusion: the game is not worth the candle - and went the other way.  January 1, 1806 saw the light of the decree on the beginning of the construction of a new memorial sign (architects JB Leper and J. Honduen) 44 meters high and 3.67 meters wide at the base. </p><p>  The Vendome column has an interesting history.  It is placed on the square, founded where the palace of the Duke of Vendome once stood (C√©sar de Vendome - the illegitimate son of Henry IV the Great).  One of the five Parisian spaces dedicated to Louis XIV was previously decorated with a statue of the Sun King on a dashing horse, which was destroyed in the heat of the revolutionary battles of the 18th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Other times came, brought other symbols.  Recall that a rectangular and then an octagonal architectural ensemble of the Classicist era changed its name more than once: the Conquest Square, Louis the Great, the Peak (where Robespierre exhibited his trophies), International.  Now it's <span>Place Vendome.</span> </p><h2>  Only liquidation! </h2><p>  During the years of fierce proclamation of international unity, the revolutionary workers' government decided to put an end to the glorification of the tyrant and war-raiser Napoleon.  The Vendome column (photo above) survived the last hours.  It was solemnly destroyed on May 16 (shortly before this, May 5, it was 50 years since the death of Napoleon).  They made it clear to the people: the Paris Commune does not intend to return to the old society. </p>

    <p>  A decisive demolition step required a certain political courage: a third of the country was occupied by a hostile army, the cult of Bonapartism (especially among the peasants) remained powerful, the bourgeoisie considered Napoleon‚Äôs wars to be the key to the power of France. </p><p>  The author of the tough decree was the commissioner for culture, painter <span>Gustav Courbet.</span>  Initially, he suggested moving the statue to a deserted place, but he was not supported.  The press approved and widely covered the act of public overthrow.  Everything went to the fact that the symbol of "brute force and false glory" comes to an end.  And he came. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Should everything be carried to the ground? </h2><p>  Soon the revolutionary regime fell.  Courbet was accused of destroying the national shrine, which was the Vendome column.  The commissioner escaped execution, but the court ordered the cultural figure to make up for the costs (pay for vandalism).  Gustav fled to Switzerland.  His property was arrested and sold.  In 1875, the monument again rushed to the sky.  It is known that the painter paid the debt.  He died in poverty. </p><p>  It should be noted that many people regard cases of destruction of monuments depicting past events as negative.  They believe that the milestones of the development of countries and continents should not be destroyed.  This approach allows different generations of earthlings to more accurately compose a picture of the development of the world.  Perhaps they are right. </p><p>  Yes, the Vendome column has a dramatic story.  It makes sense to study it in more detail.  So, the pillar (bronze barrel) was cast from 1200 Austrian and Russian cannons captured during the battle of Austerlitz (known as the ‚ÄúBattle of the Three Emperors‚Äù - French Napoleon, Austrian Franz II, Russian Alexander I). </p>

    <h2>  Drop the figure!  Power has changed! </h2><p>  The triumphal trunk was installed on a pedestal remaining from the monument to the King of the Sun.  The idea was based on the Roman <span>column of Trajan.</span>  76 bas-reliefs went spiral into the sky.  Slightly protruding from the surface of the image on the plane displayed Austerlitz victories. </p><p>  An internal staircase led up to the platform where a statue of Napoleon stood out.  Bonaparte was portrayed in the toga of the Roman emperor.  His head was decorated with a <span>laurel wreath</span> (by sculptors - Antoine Chode).  Four years later (1814), the Allies captured Paris. </p><p>  The returning Bourbons sent the image to the smelter, hoisting the <span>symbol of victory</span> - a white flag with lilies.  In the process of remelting, the bronze king Henry IV ‚Äúappeared‚Äù.  In 1818, the statue was installed on the New Bridge. </p><h2>  The human race will rise </h2><p>  In <span>July</span> 1830, the <span>July Revolution</span> arrived <span>.</span>  The Vendome column in Paris was once again transformed.  By order of King <span>Louis Philippe</span> I, Napoleon was again installed on a site in the skies.  But already without a wreath and toga, and in a familiar triangular hat and officer uniform (sculptor Georges-Pierre Sure). </p><p>  The next ‚Äúsomersault‚Äù occurred in 1863.  By order of Napoleon III, the original was transferred to the territory of the complex built under Louis XIV for honored army veterans to stay there (House of Disabled People).  On an unforgettable "peak" they brought a copy. </p>

    <p>  As they would say in Russia, the descendant of Bonaparte looked as if into the water.  That same year 1871 came, and under the Marseillaise the bronze tyrant was given the last and decisive battle.  Sawed at the base and displaced column of Place Vend√¥me crashed down. </p><p>  The symbol of tyranny did not give in for a long time.  Ropes burst, winches broke.  Finally, the trunk leaned over and fell.  People rushed to disassemble the miracle for souvenirs.  The fate of the Victory figurine is sad.  She was next to the statue of Napoleon I, survived the overthrow of 1814.  Then disappeared. </p><h2>  Jokingly and seriously </h2><p>  After 4 years, the Vendome column was reborn again in its place.  There it stands to this day, surrounded by bright and austere buildings.  The house of the Duke of Vendome is also safe.  Monuments of architecture make the image of the district rich in historical events in the French capital even more expressive. </p>

    <p>  Napoleon I again appears to the world in the form of the Roman emperor, as was originally planned.  Some travelers joke: once the column is cast from Prussian and Russian cannons, countries have the right to demand their share of bronze.  Already seriously tourists note: the rapid course of revolutionary events did not overshadow the active citizenship of the French. </p><p>  Each time after the overthrow of the memorial sign, the commander who died in 1821 again found himself in his "rightful place."  The Vendome column in Paris is like a Phoenix reborn from the ashes.  Perhaps it would be worthwhile to apply this practice in Russia?  It makes no sense to erase the past every time. </p>
