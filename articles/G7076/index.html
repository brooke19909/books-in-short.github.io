    <h2>  Grecotel Kos Imperial Thalasso 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Among the reviews about the rest in this hotel it is difficult to find negative comments.  Although he is deservedly considered the best on the island.  Therefore, at the beginning of the summer season, all tickets to it are sold out completely.  This is facilitated by a high level of service, invariably mentioned by our compatriots, and a magnificent beach with clear water.  It is worth noting that the beach at the hotel has a blue flag, which indicates its cleanliness. </p><p>  The guests greatly praise the children's animation and food in the main restaurant.  Many note that upon arrival at the hotel you should definitely take the all-inclusive system.  Otherwise, you will have to spend a lot of money on food. </p><p>  In conclusion, I would like to say that this hotel complex is fully consistent with its stardom and value.  It will be good for everyone who is ready for new discoveries and adventures, which you will always find in abundance on the Greek island of Kos. </p>
