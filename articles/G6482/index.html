    <h2>  General description of the hotel </h2><p>  Kamelya Fulya Hotel many tourists describe as a real oriental tale.  And this is not surprising, because it has a huge territory of its own, beautifully decorated and highlighted.  At dusk, the hotel complex turns into just an incredibly beautiful sight, which creates a special holiday atmosphere for all guests of the Kamelya World Fulya Hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel complex was built in the nineties of the last century, but the last reconstruction was carried out nine years ago.  Therefore, almost all guests note that the hotel simply shines with cleanliness, while delighting with good appliances and new furniture. </p><p>  Keep in mind that the hotel is part of the famous Kamelya Collection.  Fulya Hotel is one of three hotel complexes located on a vast territory of two hundred and forty thousand square meters.  Guests of the described hotel can visit absolutely all infrastructure facilities related to the entire complex. </p><p>  The Kamelya Fulya Hotel itself has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãsixty square meters and represents one seven-story building (for the convenience of guests, several high-speed elevators are provided in the building).  In it, guests are accommodated in two hundred forty-four rooms of various categories.  Among them are those apartments in which people with disabilities will feel comfortable.  Interestingly, about forty-five percent of the rooms have a sea view so beloved by tourists.  This is one of the advantages of Kamelya Fulya Hotel over other hotels in the complex. </p><p>  The hotel complex is located on the second coastline, which, however, is characteristic of all Kamelya Collection hotels.  Fulya Hotel (reviews confirm this) is very often chosen by our compatriots who prefer a vacation with a large selection of entertainment and do not tend to spend time on the beach often. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Kamelya Fulya Hotel 5 * is located in a very beautiful resort in Turkey - Side.  Our compatriots did not immediately open it, but now it is included in the list of the most popular tourist zones of the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel is located on the Mediterranean coast in the village of Cholakli.  To get to it from the international airport of Antalya, travelers will have to travel a little more than fifty-five kilometers.  Usually, those who have acquired a group tour overcome this distance on comfortable buses with other Russians.  But independent travelers often book a transfer from the hotel.  It is paid extra, but it allows you to get to Kamelya Fulya Hotel 5 * quickly and comfortably. </p><p>  If you want to get acquainted with the sights of Cholakli, then its center is easily accessible on foot in just five minutes. </p>
