The fashionable Palma de Mallorca is full of ancient sights, the amazing beauty of which will make visitors freeze with delight. </p><p>  The main religious building of the city is <span>the cathedral,</span> built on the Mediterranean coast.  The majestic La Seu (as it was popularly called) rises above the ancient city, making an indelible impression on tourists. </p><h2>  Construction history </h2><p>  Work on the construction of the building in the Gothic style dragged on for four hundred years.  Locals tell all tourists the legend about how King Jaime I, who went to conquer a Muslim island, overtook a terrible storm.  Saying goodbye to life, the great warrior turned to the Virgin Mary for help.  The king prayed earnestly and asked him to save his life.  He vowed that he would build a temple on the island in honor of the savior in case of a successful outcome. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palm cathedral" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1332839.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The storm subsided, and a few months later the king celebrated his victory over the Moors.  In 1230, the construction of the promised structure began. </p><h2>  Long work on the design of the temple </h2><p>  The Palm Cathedral, which dominates the general panorama of the bay, opened its doors in 1601, although work on the design of the temple took many years, until the beginning of the 20th century.  In the decoration of the temple, the architectural style of which belongs to the Spanish Gothic, you can find the influence of other European traditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="la seu" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1332858.jpg" width="333"></div>

In 1851, it was badly damaged after a major earthquake.  The workers not only restored the wall, but added a arch on each side of the facade and erected pointed pedestals in the neoclassical style. </p><h2>  Gaudi's work </h2><p>  Palm Cathedral was restored several times after the collapse of the vaults.  In 1904, the well-known Antonio Gaudi, invited at the request of the bishops, worked on the appearance of La Seu.  <span>The Spanish architect,</span> whose work was often criticized, carried electricity into the Gothic structure.  The dismantling of the original corridor, decorated with candelabra and candles on the walls, caused public discontent. </p><p>  Gaudi created long windows with openings and added beautiful stained glass windows.  Ten years later, the work was completed. </p><h2>  Kingdom of light </h2><p>  The Palm Cathedral, made of limestone sandstone, is surprisingly huge.  The temple, containing about 18 thousand believers, also serves as the royal tomb: the remains of two rulers of the island lie here. </p><p>  Once inside the building, you can understand why its locals call the "temple of light."  The sun's rays passing through the colored stained-glass windows illuminate the spacious halls, decorated with highlights of various shades.  In this realm of light, everything is aimed at creating a special, pacifying atmosphere that gives parishioners inner strength and transforms the spiritual world. </p><h2>  Socket Windows </h2><p>  Palm Cathedral delights with high openwork windows, which seem to look at each other.  Made in the form of roses, they are inlaid with colored glass.  These are the world's largest Gothic windows with a diameter of 12 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palma de Mallorca" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1332840.jpg" width="600"></div>

A sunbeam passing through a socket in the altar creates an unusual projection under the main entrance window for a short time.  In front of the eyes of the amazed guests, a figure eight shimmers in different colors - a symbol of eternity. </p><p>  In these two days, the Cathedral of Santa Maria is extremely full of people who came to enjoy the delightful picture that makes you think about the greatness of man.  You never cease to be amazed by the knowledge of the exact sciences of the ancient masters who created this work of art, and the windows were completed in 1320 and glazed almost three hundred years later. </p><h2>  Contemporary mural </h2><p>  In 2001, the city of Palma de Mallorca invited the famous artist M. Barcelo, considered a real genius, to work on the right chapel.  For six years, the master created a large-scale clay panel telling about how Jesus fed five thousand people with seafood and bread, and the central part of the work is dedicated to the Resurrection of the Son of God. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cathedral santa maria" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1332841.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Symbol of spiritual heritage </h2><p>  Tourists from all over the world come to the stone masterpiece towering above the city walls, which is a symbol of spiritual heritage.  Believers, admired by the wonderful work of art, attend services that are accompanied by the sounds of a giant organ reflected from walls and ceilings.  Music that affects the emotional state, and the general atmosphere of the ancient temple will remain in memory for many years. </p>
