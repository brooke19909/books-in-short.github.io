To be honest, in Russia this model has just begun to appear.  And then not in all stores.  After all, the official release in our country has not yet been as such.  Therefore, many consumers try to learn as much as possible about this model.  Smartphone HTC One M9 promises to make a splash among its counterparts.  Moreover, the Internet already has numerous reviews and reviews of this model.  And now we have to analyze the available data.  This will help you understand whether or not to pay attention to the HTC One M9 Plus.  Let‚Äôs start exploring our current issue as soon as possible.  After all, time does not stand still - very soon the smartphone will be released.  Maybe he really deserves attention.  Then you can quickly get it for yourself.  For example, on pre-order. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  So, the first thing you should pay attention to is the device‚Äôs operating system.  The thing is that now even a schoolboy pays special attention to this indicator.  <span>The HTC One M9,</span> which we are <span>reviewing</span> , fortunately, is equipped with a fairly new, one might say, the latest operating system model for the phone. </p><p>  Of course, the base here is ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  But the version is completely non-standard - 5.0.2 Lolipop.  To be honest, now such a system is not in all smartphones.  For example, at least two worthy options with this update are known so far.  This is HTC One M9, Samsung S6. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one m9 review" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951788.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Naturally, since this model has such a good version of Android, it is generally considered to be good by default.  But in practice, for now, this is not entirely acceptable.  The fact is that for this system there are still very few games and programs.  You can install applications for older versions, but they will not allow you to feel the true quality and advantage of the 5.0.2 Lolipop build.  In principle, for the first time this is enough.  Very soon, for <span>HTC One M9, the review of</span> which is presented to our attention, quite a lot of different applications and games will be released.  And then it will be possible to enjoy all the advantages of this model to the fullest. </p><h2>  Sim cards </h2><p>  Support for SIM cards now also requires special attention.  About 10-15 years ago, when mobile phones began to appear at all buyers, there were no problems with this issue.  After all, all SIM cards were originally of the same format and size.  This made it possible, if necessary, to quickly replace the gadget without any change of number.  But progress does not stand still.  Over time, slots for SIM cards in the micro format began to appear on the phones.  More recently - "nano".  And this has become a huge problem for many buyers.  Indeed, not all "cards" can be cut or replaced.  And changing the phone number after buying a gadget is far from the best solution. </p><p>  Fortunately, our model today has no problem at this point.  After all, there are such varieties as the HTC One M9 Dual Sim.  You can use several numbers at the same time.  Just worth considering one point - the slots are exclusively for Nano Sim.  In principle, now you can go and replace your "card" in advance with a small version.  Or completely cut off the existing SIM card.  Better to use direct replacement. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that the HTC One M9 smartphone works simultaneously with 2 SIM cards without interruption.  Even if you have different mobile operators.  On many analogues, conflicts of numbers often appear, as well as various malfunctions while turning on or during a conversation on one SIM card and a call in standby mode on another.  Fortunately, our current phone model allows its users not to think about this problem.  You simply will not have any failures or malfunctions.  Just insert SIM cards into slots - you can use them at any time.  HTC One M9 plus with 2 SIM cards is an excellent solution for a modern businessman or employee - you can use both your home number and work one.  And all this at the same time. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Memory is one of the most important indicators of modern gadgets.  And this applies not only to phones.  Therefore, if the model has good indicators, but there is not enough space, then it quickly loses its popularity.  And such a gadget will eventually get the brand ‚Äúnot worth buying‚Äù.  HTC One M9, the review of which we are currently studying, to be honest, will never encounter this problem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one m9 plus" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951789.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To begin with, our current model is equipped with a fairly large RAM - 3 GB.  Sometimes not all modern smartphones have it in such quantity.  On average, there are models with 2 GB of RAM.  This means that the HTC One M9 in Russia will surpass many of its counterparts in power.  And with all this, you can run many applications and programs on it at the same time, without worrying about memory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Free space on the phone is also crucial.  So to speak, <span>data warehousing.</span>  Now in modern models of smartphones you can find options with 16 GB.  But in our case it is still more good.  After all, the <span>HTC One M9 has</span> extremely high <span>specifications</span> in many cases.  And the memory on the phone is no exception.  Storage is 32 GB.  This is often enough for the coolest and most versatile smartphone.  But that is not all.  Indeed, in addition to the built-in memory, there is such an indicator as an additional memory card.  To be honest, now in many phones there is the possibility of using additional MicroSD up to 64 GB.  But with HTC One M9, the review of which is presented to our attention, there is much more space.  As much as two times - 128 GB of additional space on the memory card is available for connection.  And even if you completely ‚Äúhammer‚Äù this space with data, you will not have any system failures or malfunctions. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Modern smartphones are now available with the fact that they can carry out many additional functions.  For example, watch movies in high quality, read books, browse virtual pages, as well as play a variety of games and use numerous applications.  For all this, of course, you need a good display.  More precisely, spacious. </p><p>  HTC One M9 Dual Sim (or any other "version"), in truth, is not very different in screen size.  The fact is that, having bought this model, you will get a modern and powerful smartphone with a 5-inch screen.  For current phones, this is quite normal.  In truth, if you compare the same Samsung with HTC One M9, you can find that the Samsung S6 has a slightly larger diagonal - 5.5 inches.  But this is not so critical.  The difference is almost imperceptible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone htc one m9" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951790.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In principle, we can say that our today's smartphone has quite normal parameters.  Standard for modern technology of this plan.  It is also worth noting that the HTC One M9 phone (32GB and above) has a very good resolution.  1080 by 1920 pixels.  This allows you to watch movies and videos in Full-HD format, and also does not harm your eyesight.  You can easily flip through e-books and virtual sites with excellent convenience for your eyes. </p><h2>  Means of communication </h2><p>  An extremely important point for any cell phone is communication.  After all, it is for this undertaking that our today's gadget is needed.  In the modern world, manufacturers offer their customers a lot of diverse options in this regard. </p><p>  The HTC One M9 has pretty good specifications in this regard.  There is also GPS navigation, and GPRS, and a 3G connection.  In addition, this model has the ability to connect to a 4G network.  It provides an extremely fast and high-quality signal.  But unfortunately, this feature is not available on all smartphones.  Perhaps you can find it only on the latest models.  Updating the HTC One M9 via an Internet connection can now be fast, reliable and seamless. </p><p>  Plus, for any modern smartphone, additional communication is important.  These include: USB-sockets for synchronization with a computer, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  In our current model, all this is available.  Moreover, the "Bluetooth" of the latest version - 4.1.  This means that the data transfer speed through this connection will be as fast and high-quality as possible.  In principle, at the moment, few people use the Bluetooth.  But the absence of this type of connection makes a poor-quality and even outdated product from the phone. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  In any modern smartphone, there must be a camera.  And the better it is, the more popular this or that gadget will get.  To be honest, now it is customary to use phones as a camera and a camera.  And this is a perfectly normal decision.  After all, the price of some smartphone models is sometimes so high that I want to think about buying a camera and a camera separately. </p><p>  HTC One M9 Gold - this is just the device that can give you great quality pictures at a reasonable price.  After all, the camera in this model is 20 megapixels.  Sometimes not all modern amateur cameras have such capabilities.  And for a regular smartphone, this is quite a good result.  Previously, there were models with 13 megapixels.  So with this phone you can be sure that your photos will be high-quality, bright and good.  Sometimes even better than those made by the camera.  Also in this model there is autofocus and flash.  These two tools will help to achieve excellent quality photos without streaks in any conditions.  Even in the middle of the night.  Plus, the HTC One M9 has the ability to shoot video in Full-HD format.  Just this quality is "chased" by many consumers.  After all, so far there is no better format. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one m9 dual sim" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951791.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Another feature of our smartphone is the front camera.  Such are now available on many phones of the new generation.  Only here there are certain differences.  Of course, for the better.  After all, the <span>front camera of the</span> HTC One M9 shoots with excellent quality - 4 megapixels.  Frankly, the "front" cameras now do not have such an opportunity.  The maximum that you can choose for yourself is 2 megapixels on the front camera.  If you think about it, the quality offered to us is much better than some webcams can play.  And it pleases.  After all, with HTC One M9 in Russia you will be one of the luckiest people - you will have a great opportunity to take extremely high-quality selfies, as well as conduct conversations through a video call.  This is very useful if you have your own business or need to communicate with people using a video call.  A small but still an advantage. </p><h2>  Design and Sizes </h2><p>  Important for many buyers is the design of the phone.  Sometimes consumers are ready to abandon a high-quality, but terribly ugly smartphone in favor of a pretty mobile with less functionality and often a higher price.  Fortunately, in our smartphone today, in this regard, everything is in order. </p><p>  Initially, the HTC One M9 can be gold, white or black.  True, such a gamut often does not suit users.  For this reason, you can easily and simply buy special removable panels for your smartphone.  But to do this, you have to look at foreign sites.  In Russia, finding a socket for a cell phone of this model is extremely difficult.  And the choice itself is not very great.  It‚Äôs better to wait for a bit of delivery from afar than to buy anything. </p><p>  But in principle, with the design as a whole, everything is in order.  No frills and tasteful.  Plus, you should pay attention to the weight and parameters of the device.  The smartphone is 144.6 millimeters long, 69.7 millimeters wide, and 9.6 millimeters thick.  Quite normal dimensions for a 5-inch phone with high resolution.  What about the weight of the device?  In truth, it's pretty heavy.  In any case, for the children‚Äôs and women‚Äôs pens, for sure.  The weight of the smartphone HTC One M9 is 157 grams.  Many believe that this is the average for modern technology.  And indeed it is.  True, far from everyone fits such a bulky and heavy device.  Occasionally, buyers look for small and lightweight counterparts. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  As you can see, HTC One M9 colors and design may be different.  But for any smartphone, the battery performance is also important.  It is this moment that often makes customers think about buying.  It is generally accepted that a good phone should work for a long time without recharging.  And it is right.  After all, smartphones are designed specifically to constantly stay in touch.  This means that the battery that is discharged at the wrong time will leave an indelible mark on the reputation of the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one m9 specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951792.jpg"></div>

    <p>  How are things going with the HTC One M9?  The fact is that with respect to the battery, we can only say that it works extremely well.  And of course, for a long time.  The phone‚Äôs system has a special feature of protection against overheating - it can save a certain percentage of charge.  In addition, in standby mode, as practice shows, HTC One M9 runs for about 1.5 months.  If you plan to use your smartphone exclusively for conversations, then you can count on 3 weeks of quality work.  Sometimes even the life of the phone without recharging can last a month.  But in cases of active and daily use (games, reading books, the Internet, calls, many simultaneously running applications) HTC One M9 will live for about a week without a charger.  And this is also a very worthy indicator.  The same Samsung S6, for example, with such use will only work 3 days.  The difference is visible to the naked eye. </p><h2>  Quality </h2><p>  Of course, before buying any new items, you should pay attention to such a moment as customer reviews about a particular technique.  This includes many evaluation criteria.  And among them, special attention is paid to the overall quality of the device, as well as its price tag.  They must match each other.  Otherwise, the manufacturer risks receiving negative assessments of potential buyers. </p><p>  Presented to your attention the phone HTC One M9.  The price of it, frankly, is quite high.  And sometimes even too much.  In some regions, it reaches 70,000 rubles.  And all this provided that now this model is not yet very common.  That is, in fact, we risk buying a pig in a poke.  If you order this smartphone from the Internet, then you can find on it a price tag of approximately 59,000 rubles.  Not as much as 70, but still pretty much. </p><p>  True, the quality of the smartphone only pleases.  Many buyers outside Russia have already seen that this phone is worth the money requested by the manufacturer.  We can say that our current model is equipped with extremely good protection.  HTC One M9 does not crash when dropped from a fairly high altitude (about the 5th floor), and also does not "sink" in the water.  That is, if you accidentally wet the device, then you can not panic and not worry about the phone‚Äôs performance.  Just wipe the moisture from the panel and touchscreen, and then continue to use your smartphone further. </p><p>  Also worth noting is the fact that scratching the HTC One M9 is extremely difficult.  Perhaps, if not for the plastic case, then we could call this smartphone model perfectly protected.  For better protection, it is recommended to put on a special protective film on the phone, as well as wear it in a case.  This will protect the device from unnecessary and unwanted damage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one m9 phone Price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951793.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If we talk about the colors that are transmitted to us by you on the phone, we can only say that they turn out to be saturated, bright and very diverse.  The HTC One M9 has support for over 16 million colors.  Just what you need to transmit a magnificent and vivid image.  Watching movies and videos, as well as reading books and surfing the Internet have never before been as high-quality as using our today's smartphone.  For the sake of this, according to many buyers, it is really worth buying the HTC One M9. </p><p>  The sound in this smartphone model is very loud, high-quality and without unnecessary noise.  Even at the highest volume, you can be sure that no wheezing or other irregularities will be detected.  An alarm clock, a call and the sound of an incoming SMS message - all this will give you the bright sound of HTC One M9. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Well, now it's time to take stock of our talk today.  We discussed the HTC One M9 with you.  The release date of this device in Russia is still vague.  But, as the manufacturer promises, it will be released around the end of 2015.  Most likely, for the New Year.  And it will be a great gift for lovers of gadgets. </p><p>  Only now, modern customers now have a completely logical question: is it worth paying attention to the HTC One M9.  In truth, everyone decides for himself purely individually.  No one has the right to force to buy this or that gadget.  Especially considering that our current model is quite expensive. </p><p>  So far, it‚Äôs only clear that the HTC One M9 is a really good smartphone.  And if quality of pictures, videos and music is important to you, and also you dream of a multifunctional and <span>‚Äúindestructible‚Äù phone,</span> then it is really worth paying attention to this model.  In the case of a small budget, you will have to find a cheaper analogue for the purchase.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nothing like this can be found. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Is that Samsung S6. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of characteristics, this model is somewhat similar to HTC One M9, but still inferior to it in many respects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at the price of Samsung a little cheaper - about 39,000 rubles.</font></font></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one m9 32gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951794.jpg"></div>

    <p> In general, if you are afraid to buy the initially expensive HTC One M9, then you can just buy a Chinese counterpart.  In other words, a fake.  It will cost you a mere penny, but to demonstrate all the capabilities of the device, this is ideal.  Take a look and take advantage.  If you like it, you can completely buy the normal original HTC One M9.  Just be careful - a variety of malfunctions and failures often arise in Chinese-made fakes.  They are not in the original.  The operating system of the phone is so well-composed that there are no problems or bugs even with prolonged use. </p>
