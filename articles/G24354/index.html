What is interesting, like the famous Roksolana-Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska, he had not Turkish roots at all, but was a native of Europe.

    <p>  The future state adviser was born in 1493 in a small town on the territory of modern Greece.  Most likely, he had Italian roots.  Ibrahim Pasha, whose biography will later be filled with brilliant victories at the highest level, spent his childhood in the family of a metallurgist.  Like another famous future European woman at the Ottoman court, the young man was abducted by pirates at an early age, and then sold into slavery at the Manissa Palace.  It should be noted that the city of Manissa according to the traditions of the <span>Ottoman dynasty was</span> actually a nursery for the education of future sultans.  Here the future heirs were brought up, here they became fatherly governors, undergoing a kind of practice in management.  It was in this palace that the young slave met his peer Shehzadeh Suleiman - the Turkish prince.  The two young people were very soon connected by friendship, which, coupled with the flexible mind of Europe </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vizier Ibrahim Pasha biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/263244.jpg" width="333"></div>  Yetsa (and the wisdom of the Turk, if he managed to push forward conventions and at least in two slaves - Ibrahim and Roksolana - to consider high qualities) led one and the other to brilliant state successes.  In 1520, Suleiman becomes a sultan, and Ibrahim Pasha, whose biography is taking a sharp turn, is awarded the post of army commander of the emperor.  Since by this time the European received a very decent education, he often participated in diplomatic negotiations on the side of his sultan and often achieved success in them.  He showed undoubted talent as an army leader.  Continuous success allowed Ibrahim to rise higher and higher through the ranks.  And soon the sultan makes him his immediate adviser.

A similar thing happened with Ibrahim.  The successes of the former slave did not give rest to other high-ranking officials of the state, who themselves expected to take those posts that were given to him.  He became the favorite of the Sultan Suleiman, at the same time turning into an object of hatred from the rest of the retinue.  Ibrahim Pasha, whose biography had many deadly dangers, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ibrahim Pasha Vizier Suleiman biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/263246.jpg" width="433"></div>  even intended in 1520 to leave Constantinople, fearing for the lives of their children.  However, he remained, succumbing to the persuasion of Suleiman.  After that, the Sultan issued an official decree that Ibrahim cannot be executed or killed while he is in power.  And after that the useful European was awarded with more and more titles, becoming the second most important person in the state and gaining tremendous power.  In 1524, Ibrahim the Magnificent (as he was nicknamed by analogy with the Sultan himself) married the princess, the sister of the emperor Hatice.  In the last years of his life, he achieved several more incredibly brilliant successes.  For example, in 1533 he achieved the surrender of Hungary without a single battle.  Such loud victories in all areas completely turned the head of the magnificent vizier, and in 1536, having become confused by reason, proclaims himself the Seraskir sultan.  This was a direct insult to Suleiman (who took his oath back) and led to the quick demise of such a brilliant politician.
