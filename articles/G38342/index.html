They differ in the presence or absence of tapes, spikes on the ears, the clarity of the various details, and so on.  Today we‚Äôll try to understand all these nuances, describe in detail the monetary units, and also talk about the cost of various copies.  We must say right away that the price of coins can vary depending on their safety and type. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.raritetus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="3 kopeks 1981" class="if uuid-3176838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3176838.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The average price of 3 kopecks in 1981 - no more than two hundred rubles.  However, there are more expensive specimens.  The moments were minted using a standard stamp.  Included in the set of the State Bank of the USSR.  They were made at the Leningrad Mint.  They have no magnetic characteristics and features.  For the production, an alloy of copper and zinc, also called manganese brass, was used.  The exact number of coins produced is unknown.  Approximate weight - 3 g (discrepancies + - 0.5 g are allowed).  Yellow color.  There is a clear two-sided edging. </p><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  The entire part of the coin disk on top of coin 3 kopeks in 1981 is occupied by the number "3".  She stretched along the radius of the coin in the upper half.  The letter value is indicated below.  Under the word "penny" is the year of coinage.  Under the numbers 1981 there is a decorative shell, from which there are three oak leaves on both sides.  The leaves, in turn, give rise to wheat ears.  One spike comes out of each leaf, having thin and long spines. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.collectors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Three pennies 1981" class="if uuid-3176836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3176836.jpg"></div><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  On the front side of the coin, there are two types of images.  This is the emblem of the Soviet Union and the abbreviation of the state is "USSR".  The letters are located at the very bottom of the coin disk in one line.  Most of it is a coat of arms.  In its center is the planet Earth, on top of which is the engraving of the sickle and hammer.  On the sides of the ground are sheaves of wheat tied with a ribbon. </p><p>  In total, you can count seven tape turns on each side.  The last, fifteenth turn connects the wheat ears from below.  It is somewhat reminiscent of a small shell.  Above it is an image of a sun with long rays.  In the central part, the rays touch the planets, as if warming it with their heat.  On the image of the earth you can clearly see the meridians and parallels.  Each ribbon on an ear symbolizes a union republic.  Above, where the spikelets almost touch each other, there is a five-pointed star. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  There are 3 kopeks 1981 for the production of which stamp 3.1 was used.  If you look closely and recount the spines of the ear nearest to Earth, there will be five of them.  There is a short and thin spine from the second ear in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe bandage of the tape.  The size of the coat of arms is normal. </p><p>  The variant that was minted using the stamp 3.2 differs in the number of awns (there will be three, not five).  On the coin there will be no clear boundaries of the Gulf of Guinea.  The image of the coat of arms of the Union is reduced. </p><p>  Monetary units with a face value of 3 kopecks (1981), for the production of which stamp 3.3 was used, are distinguished by an increased emblem size.  In addition, there is a clearly defined contour of the Gulf of Guinea.  The total number of awns on the inside is three. </p><p>  There are varieties of coins where the Gulf of Guinea is not visible.  There is a large distance between the ears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coberu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="3 kopeks 1981 price" class="if uuid-3177627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3177627.jpg"></div><h2>  "Crossroads" </h2><p>  This is the fifth and special kind of coin 3 kopeks 1981.  The color is silver.  For production, two-maneuve blanks were used.  The reverse is standard. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Coins minted with standard stamps will cost from 3 to 650 rubles.  More expensive coins are those that have no awns.  The price varies from 5000 to 75000 rubles. </p>
