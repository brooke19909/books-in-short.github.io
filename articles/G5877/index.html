At one time, they were the only way to listen to music, so they treated them very carefully.  But progress does not stand still.  Soon, vinyl was replaced with cassettes and CDs.  The records turned out to be unnecessary.  Some threw them away, while others they gather dust in the attics and chests.  But you can find other uses for old records, for example, to make amazingly beautiful things out of them.  Crafts from vinyl records will become an original decoration of a bedroom, kitchen or living room.  You just need to turn on your imagination and make an effort. </p>

    <h2>  General recommendations </h2><p>  Before you start manufacturing, you need to place a vinyl plate on a pallet and put in the oven.  The temperature is set at 150-180 degrees.  Leaving the future craft for a long time is not worth it, because vinyl will acquire the necessary softness in a short time. </p><p>  Once the plate is warm, you can get it and start creating your own masterpiece.  There are no restrictions what to do, the main thing is a creative approach.  It should be noted that the described option for preparing the plates is not the only one.  Some craftsmen cut or drill vinyl to create a new original item.  Others glue the plates with beads, wood, cardboard or fur.  Still others use painting to create an original birdhouse, bracelet, vase or lamp.  But most often the plates are turned into watches.  The options for their design are very different - from classic dials with numbers in a circle and arrows in the center, to unusual animal figures or abstract shapes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Clock decor </h2><p>  There are many ideas for creating a watch from vinyl records, and everyone decides which one to choose.

    <h2>  Step-by-step algorithm of work </h2><p>  It is necessary to preheat the oven to 130 degrees, put the plate on the pan and put in the oven.  It is important to remember that the material will become soft in a short amount of time.  The main thing is to prevent the melting of vinyl. </p><p>  Using tacks, remove the pan and form a vase from the plate.  For symmetry, bowls are used where the workpiece is placed.  While the plate is soft, its edges bend in an arbitrary direction, making waves out of them.  To solidify the material, you need to wait a few minutes. </p><p>  A little trick in doing such a craft from vinyl records: if the vase turned out to be unsuccessful and you want to make it more beautiful, you need to place it in the oven again, wait for straightening and start work again. </p><p>  The door handle should have a flat surface, it will play the role of the legs for the vase.  With the help of screws and nuts, the handle is fixed on the plate, for this you can use the central hole. </p>

    <p>  Glue is useful for creating an abstract picture.  It is applied at the edges in random order.  It is necessary to wait for the spreading of the material and its drying. </p><p>  At the last stage, black acrylic paint is used as a primer.  It is applied in several layers.  Everything, the next hack of vinyl records is ready. </p><h2>  Handbag </h2><p>  What to make from vinyl records, except for vases and watches?  Fashionistas who love to surprise others with non-standard solutions can be offered the option of an unusual handbag.  For its manufacture, the plate is cut into two parts of equal size.  The bottom and sides of the future handbag are made of any material, both soft (fabric) and hard, the main thing is that it can be attached to vinyl.  With the help of a red-hot wire, holes are made in the halves of the plate, where you will need to thread a strong thread or cord to sew all parts of the bag.  At the top you can attach an original clasp, and on the sides a handle of the required length. </p>

    <h2>  Vinyl paintings </h2><p>  Craftsmen make real masterpieces from old records.  To do this, you need to have a set for burning on wood surfaces.  With it, you can create a whole picture with an openwork frame, instead of which the edges of the plate are used. </p><p>  Some use an electric jigsaw and cut out any image they like.  And if you combine several records, you can create several collages, but you will need to be patient. </p><p>  There are dozens of other options and ideas that you can make from vinyl records with your own hands.  For example, you can make an original collage that will decorate the wall in your apartment, you can make organizers, stands, covers for boxes.  For those who like to create original things from improvised materials, there are no limits for creativity. </p>
