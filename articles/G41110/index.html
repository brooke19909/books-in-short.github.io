According to our compatriots, there is no other such hotel in Egypt.  As for the hotel rooms, in general, the guests liked them.  So, tourists note that all apartments, regardless of category, are spacious and very stylishly decorated.  In addition, they are furnished with new furniture and modern appliances.  However, some hotel guests note a couple of minuses.  So, a number of guests complained that the room was too dark, and it would not hurt the administration to think about adding at least one bright lamp to the apartments.  In addition, some of our compatriots were surprised by the fact that there was no telephone in their rooms.  As for cleaning, the guests were generally satisfied with her.  According to them, sometimes maids forgot to leave shampoo, shower gel or change bedding.  However, the appeal to the reception allowed to instantly fix the situation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="caves beach resort 5 tours" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1002073.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As for the restaurant in Caves Beach Resort 5 * (Hurghada), the reviews of our compatriots indicate the fact that the guests were quite satisfied with this item.  So, according to tourists, the food here is organized at a very high level.  The guests were satisfied with the quality of the offered dishes and the variety of their choice.  So, the menu always had several types of meat, fish, seafood, salads, snacks, great sweets, ice cream, fresh fruits.  According to travelers, the "choice" here is the choice of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  In general, the majority of guests were satisfied with the beach holiday at the hotel.  However, some guests have complaints.  They are connected with the fact that Caves Beach Resort 5 * (Hurghada), the reviews of tourists about which we are currently studying, is a new hotel.  Therefore, not all infrastructure facilities are still completed.  So, for example, a pier has not yet been built on the hotel‚Äôs own beach.  Therefore, guests have to go into the sea from the coast.  But this is not very convenient, since it is necessary to go several hundred meters to a depth, and this can only be done with specialized shoes, as there are a lot of corals at the bottom that can hurt your feet.  Many vacationers also used the pier of a nearby hotel.  So, in principle, this did not become a serious problem.  However, tourists express the hope that in a few months this defect will be eliminated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="caves beach resort 5 price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1002072.jpg" width="332"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Many tourists in their comments mention an excellent pool located on the territory of Caves Beach Resort (Hurghada) 5 *.  So, according to the guests, you can swim in it around the clock, which is not so common in hotels in Egypt and other countries.  In addition, the pool here is equipped with hydromassage, which makes finding it even more pleasant. </p><p>  In addition to water activities, tourists enthusiastically recall a great team of animators.  According to them, the guys do their job well and constantly come up with new fun for hotel guests.  So, in the afternoon they entertain guests with aerobics, gymnastics, team games, competitions.  In the evenings, animators offer to sing karaoke, dance at a disco.  There are no entertainment shows at the hotel yet, as the amphitheater is not yet completed.  But, as our compatriots note, this will not have to wait long. </p>
