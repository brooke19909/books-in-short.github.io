    <h2>  Negative feedback from guests </h2><p>  Many do not recommend coming to this hotel, believing that it does not correspond to five stars.  As arguments, tourists indicate the following serious drawbacks: </p><ul><li>  the hotel often smells bad sewer; </li><li>  The rooms are equipped with old beds with uncomfortable mattresses, which are impossible to sleep on; </li><li>  the restaurant does not have enough tables for all guests, so you often have to stand and wait until the place becomes available; </li><li>  rather monotonous menu, sometimes baked pastries are found; </li><li>  not all air conditioners work. </li></ul><p>  Thus, we can say that Pemar Beach Hotel will be a good option for family and beach holidays.  However, it does not reach other five-star resort complexes, which affects its price.  It is much lower here, therefore, despite all the shortcomings, tourists still choose this hotel for relaxation. </p>
