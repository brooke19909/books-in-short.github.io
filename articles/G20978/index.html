  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A preliminary calculation of the childcare allowance can be done by yourself.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The appearance in the family of the baby is always a long-awaited event.  Undoubtedly, <span>caring for a child is</span> directly related to material costs, which are partially compensated by the state through the payment of child allowance.  That is why, on the part of parents, it will not be superfluous to pre-calculate the childcare allowance in order to at least have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits size. </p><p>  According to the current legislation in the field of state benefits to citizens, a parent who has applied for a <span>leave to care</span> for him has the right to receive child benefit up to 1.5 years. </p><p>  Since the beginning of last year, the calculation of childcare benefits has undergone some changes.  In particular, accrual is carried out, taking into account the <span>average income of the</span> parent for the previous 730 days.  Moreover, the <span>average earnings</span> include all payments and benefits that are burdened by insurance premiums.  So, for the person taking a vacation in the current year, the calculation of the <span>monthly childcare benefit</span> is based on the amount of accruals for the period from the beginning of 2010 to the end of 2011.  At the same time, annual earnings are accepted that do not exceed the established limits, namely: in 2010 - 415 thousand, in 2011 - 463 thousand rubles.  The indicators obtained during the calculation must be summarized and divided into 730 days.  Thus, we get the average daily income, calculated by a simple formula: (average income (DM) in 2010 + average income (DM) in 2011): 730 days = average daily income (SDD). </p><p>  In order to make it most clear, consider a specific example of how the calculation of childcare benefits is made.  So, the insured person went <span>on maternity leave</span> in January of the current 2012.  The total income in 2010 amounted to 267 thousand, and in 2011 - 500 thousand rubles.  Summing up these indicators, we obtain the total income for the previous 2 years, taking into account the limit values.  Thus, we have: 267 thousand + 463 thousand (the maximum amount last year is 463 thousand) = 730 thousand. We divide this amount by 730 days and get 1 thousand rubles.  or average daily earnings.  In order to get a monthly average income you need to multiply the average daily income by 30.4.  Thus, to multiply SDZ by 30.4 is the average monthly income or 1 thousand * 30.4 = 30 thousand 400 rubles.  In order to receive the <span>size of the benefit,</span> it is necessary to multiply the average monthly income received by 40%.  So, the average monthly earnings multiplied by 40% or 30 thousand 400 rubles.  * 0.4 = 12 thousand 160 rubles.  The calculation of the childcare allowance is ready.  It will be 12 thousand 160 rubles. </p><p>  Last year, for non-working people, the <span>monthly child allowance</span> was 2 thousand 194 rubles.  33 kopecks  (first child) and 4 thousand 388 rubles.  67 kopecks  (second and subsequent children).  From the beginning of 2011 to the end of 2012, the parent has the right to independently choose the algorithm according to which the calculation of the childcare allowance will be made, in particular, according to the ‚Äúold‚Äù or ‚Äúnew‚Äù rules. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that it is necessary to apply for the payment of benefits no later than 6 months from the moment the child turns 1.5 years old, i.e.  before the execution of 2 years.  In the event that the corresponding appeal has not been received, the allowance is not paid.  In addition, the parent has the right to interrupt the vacation, but then the payment of benefits also stops.  If the vacation is renewed, then, accordingly, the remaining part of the allowance is renewed.  Also, a woman may be given the opportunity to work on a reduced schedule.  In this case, the payment of benefits is saved.  If the insured person works simultaneously with several employers, then the ‚Äúchildren‚Äù are paid by one of them, at the discretion of the recipient.  In this case, you must submit a document from the second employer, confirming that he does not pay benefits.  As a rule, the allowance is paid monthly on the day of wages in a particular organization. </p>
