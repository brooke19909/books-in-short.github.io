  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Space symmetry</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Symmetry in space is a beautiful, harmonious and balanced proportional ratio of parts or elements of various forms of objects, organisms or objects.  In the space around us, one can observe a lot of inanimate objects of a symmetrical shape.  Living organisms, both simple and complex highly organized, also have symmetry elements in their structure. </p><p>  <strong>The pursuit of excellence</strong> </p><p>  The symmetrical form can be identified with perfection and harmony.  No wonder words such as "symmetry" and "perfection" are synonyms in the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof many peoples. </p><p>  Symmetry in space is everywhere.  The variety of plant forms and living organisms is striking in the proportionality, consistency and ergonomics of the form.  Everything is thought out to the smallest detail: amazing beauty, graceful proportions and nothing more.  Everything is provided for the best functionality of life. </p><p>  <strong>Central symmetry</strong> </p><p>  <span>The central symmetry</span> in the space of the world of inanimate nature surrounding us is clearly visible in the arrangement of crystals.  This type of symmetry is clearly seen in the structure of snowflakes, which are ice crystals.  Their forms are striking in variety.  But they are all centrally symmetrical. </p><p>  An example of central or radial symmetry are the flowers of plants: sunflower, chamomile, iris, aster.  This type of symmetry is also called rotary.  If the petals of the flower or the rays of the snowflake are rotated relative to the center, then they overlap each other. </p><p>  <strong>Mirror symmetry</strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mirror symmetry in the space of the natural world surrounding us is observed in plants and animals.  <span>A leaf of maple,</span> oak or fern, beetle or butterfly, spider or caterpillar, mouse or hare - these are just some examples where bilateral organisms or mirror symmetry can be seen in living organisms.  Symmetrical <span>facial features of a</span> person, as well as parts of the body: arms, legs.  In these forms, we observe, as it were, a mirror reflection of one half of the object from the other.  If you place the object in the plane, then its image can be mentally bent in the middle, and one half overlaps the other. </p><p>  <strong>The symmetry hypothesis</strong> </p><p>  In the scientific world, there are several hypotheses with the help of which they try to explain how symmetry arose in the space of our world.  According to one of them, everything that grows up or down is subject to the law of <span>radial beam symmetry.</span>  And that which is formed parallel to the earth's surface or at an angle to it takes a mirror-symmetrical shape.  They are trying to explain these properties by the Earth's gravity from the center of the planet and the varying degree of illumination of objects with sunlight, depending on their location. </p><p>  <strong>Symmetry in science and art</strong> </p><p>  Symmetry in space was appreciated by artists, sculptors and architects in ancient times.  We see elements of symmetry in ancient cave paintings, in ornamental decorations of ancient objects and weapons.  Egyptian Mayan pyramids and pyramids, domes of Slavic cathedrals, Greek temples and palaces, antique arches and amphitheaters, the facade of the White House and the Moscow Kremlin are just some examples of the desire for exalted beauty and genuine perfection. </p><p>  The concepts of symmetry were seriously developed by mathematicians.  Conducted mathematical research allowed us to identify the main laws of symmetry on the plane and in space.  Physics and chemistry also did not bypass this interesting natural regularity.  Academician V.I. Vernadsky believed that "symmetry ... covers the properties of all fields with which a physicist and a chemist deal."  Due to the symmetrical structure of the atoms, the molecules of <span>inorganic substances</span> enter into various reactions and determine the physical properties of crystal formation.  Even if the laws of physics that establish physical quantities are unchanged under various transformations, it can be said that these laws have invariance or symmetry with respect to these transformations. </p>
