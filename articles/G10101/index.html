To get here from Moscow, you must overcome more than two thousand kilometers.  Tyumen appeared first among the cities of this harsh region of the state and since then has not stopped steadily increasing in terms of population.  To meet the needs of citizens in housing, developers are building ever new complexes, one of which is the European district in Tyumen. </p>

    <h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  <span>The residential complex</span> is located almost in the center of Tyumen.  Next to it are the largest highways of the city: Shcherbakova, Alebashevskaya streets.  In general, most developers prefer to build real estate in Tyumen closer to the city center.  Or at least within the city limits.  This is due to the developed urban infrastructure. </p>

    <p>  Getting to the complex is not difficult.  The European microdistrict in Tyumen is being erected on U.-R.G.  Ervier, which is a stopping place for numerous public transport (shuttles, buses).  By your own car, it is enough to turn off the above streets onto Gazovikov street.  Thus, the city center is within ten minutes drive from the residential complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

It is designed as a residential quarter consisting of twenty-six residential buildings of the same number of storeys.  On 17 floors each house.  Such a large-scale project cannot be built at the same time.  Therefore, the developer provided for the construction of houses in turn.  Residential quarters of the European district of Tyumen were named in accordance with the Greek alphabet: "Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma", "Delta", "Omega". </p><p>  The builder also took care of the owners of bicycles and residents with young children who ride them in prams.  In order not to raise the indicated means of transportation into apartments every time after a walk, special rooms for their storage are provided on the first floors of residential buildings in the complex. </p><h2>  The cost of apartments </h2><p>  What else will prices in the European district of Tyumen depend on?  From a number of advantages that the developer provides its tenants.  The apartments are horizontal wiring of the heating system, the walls are laid with mineral wool for their sound insulation.  Therefore, the loggias will be insulated as much as possible, which will allow residents to use them, for example, as cabinets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the cost of one square meter of living space, it will start from 65 thousand rubles.  The most expensive, traditionally, will be one-bedroom apartments, which are approximately 44 square meters.  In them, one meter will have to pay a little more than 70 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  By building the European microdistrict planned in Tyumen, the developer offers its property buyers a fully developed infrastructure.  As for the external, it is represented by various social objects necessary for a full daily life.  These are kindergartens, educational schools, shops and supermarkets, sports centers and beauty salons.  All that the city is rich in. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  Inside the complex will also be able to boast the most comfortable life.

For owners of their own cars, and there are currently many of them, an underground parking is provided. </p><p>  Walls and ceilings are laid with additional soundproofing material.  Facades of buildings are equipped with special baskets for air conditioners.  This is quite important and will affect the onset of summer heat.  All houses and all entrances will be equipped with video surveillance cameras to ensure even greater security for residents of the complex. </p><h2>  Management Company </h2><p>  If residents have any problems or questions related to home improvement, the Comfort Life management company of the European district of Tyumen will quickly and efficiently solve them.

    <h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  Not all residential property in Tyumen can boast that it offers its residents a comfortable life in the most favorable environmental conditions.  However, this does not apply to the European.  The builder was able to arrange this residential complex so that its residents were not affected by the polluted air from the industrial enterprises of the city, and the huge lake Alebashevo made it possible to enjoy walks and swimming. </p><p>  The green area around the complex additionally provides those who bought apartments in the European district with an influx of fresh air and the ability to constantly fill their lungs with it.  The complex is ‚Äúwashed‚Äù on the one side by the Tura River and ‚Äúrefreshed‚Äù, on the other hand there is a park of the 65th anniversary of the Victory. </p>
