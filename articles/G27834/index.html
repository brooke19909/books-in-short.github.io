    <h2>  Claims to the hotel </h2><p>  The Ramada Resort Side 5 * hotel has some shortcomings in its work, namely: </p><ul><li>  tourists often come across extortion tips from hotel staff; </li><li>  hotel rooms require redecoration (and in some cases - overhaul); </li><li>  poor quality of cleaning; </li><li>  there are no natural juices on the menu - tourists are offered powder drinks with a large number of dyes; </li><li>  a big drawback is the lack of Ayran traditional for Turkish cuisine (with the exception of a bagged one); </li><li>  close territory on the second coastline; </li><li>  the entrance to the water on the beach is strewn with large pebbles; </li><li>  too shallow sea; </li><li>  worn bedding and leaky towels; </li><li>  the hotel does not fully justify five-star accreditation; </li><li>  lack of disposable cosmetics in the bathroom.  All detergents are poured directly into the dispensers. </li></ul><h2>  Useful information and hotel policies </h2><p>  The Ramada Resort Side (5 stars) has developed certain rules that govern the stay of tourists.  The following main points can be distinguished, which should be familiarized with before going on vacation: </p><ul><li>  Check-in at 14:00, but subject to availability, you may be registered earlier.  If all rooms are occupied, guests are sent to eat in the hotel restaurant. </li><li>  Keys and bracelets must be handed over to the reception on the day of departure no later than noon. </li><li>  Children under 12 years stay free in the room if an extra bed is not required. </li><li>  A baby cot is available free of charge for children up to 2 years old. </li><li>  For the resettlement of children in additional places will be charged half the cost of living in an adult room.  The price of an extra bed for an adult is 70%. </li><li>  Each room, regardless of size or category, has a maximum of one extra bed. </li><li>  Pets are not allowed in the hotel. </li><li>  The hotel has the opportunity to use bank transfer. </li><li>  When booking a tour, a certain amount of funds is blocked on your card account until arrival at the hotel. </li></ul>

    <h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel leaves an ambiguous impression on its guests.  By and large, tourists are accustomed to large areas of decorated areas with green grass and fountains in hotels in Turkey.  In this case, the space is quite small. </p><p>  Turning to the living conditions, we can say that the hotel does not quite live up to expectations.  The originality of the interior of the Ramada Resort Side 5 * deserves special attention.  Photos of tourists captured bright colors and innovative design solutions.  Nevertheless, the impression is spoiled due to old furniture, as well as the general deterioration of the decoration of the rooms.  True, reconstruction is planned at the hotel, which gives hope for an improvement in the situation. </p><p>  Perhaps the only thing that does not cause special complaints among the guests is food.  The assortment and quality of cooking almost completely justifies the five-star status of the hotel. </p>
