Mazepa were gathered in Bender, who announced the new ‚Äúgovernment in exile‚Äù.  After the death of Mazepa, the emigrants were led by Philip Orlik. </p><h2>  short biography </h2><p>  The future politician came from the well-known Orlik family, who had long held a strong political position in the Czech Kingdom.  After the <span>Hussite Wars, which</span> traveled through Eastern Europe in a heavy skating rink in the 14th century, the younger branch of the barons emigrated, settled in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and then in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  In sec.  Ksuti, located near Vilnius, was born Philip Orlik.  Date of birth - October 11, 1672 - indicates a rather turbulent period in the history of eastern Europe: the Cossacks defended the country's borders and repelled the attacks of the Poles and Turks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Philip Orlik" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1270685.jpg" width="200"></div>  A year after the birth of his son, his father died from a Janissary saber in the battle of Khotyn.  The noble Czech baron was of Catholic faith, but Philippe's mother, Irina, was born Orthodox.  As often happens, Philip adopted the religion of his mother and began to profess Orthodoxy.  It is not surprising that soon in one of the most prestigious theological universities of that time a new name appeared on the list of students - Philip Orlik.  Photos of his school and can now be found in various sources. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Philip Orlik short biography" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1270697.jpg" width="581"></div>

His industriousness, perseverance, talent and ability to conduct discussions were highly appreciated by the famous theologian and rhetorician <span>Stefan Yavorsky.</span>  At the end of the academy, Philip Orlik remains in Kiev and occupies one of the places at the Kiev Metropolitanate.  Then he met the daughter of Pavel Gertsyk, a colonel from Poltava, and in 698 he married his chosen one, strengthening his position among the Cossack seniority. </p><h2>  First steps in politics </h2><p>  Good background, excellent education and personal qualities helped young Orlik make a dizzying career.  He could become a <span>confidant of the</span> hetman I. <span>Mazepa.</span>  <span>Ivan</span> Stepanovich became the godfather of the firstborn Orlik.  In a short time, Philip Orlik became one of the most affluent people in Ukraine - he owned a farm and village in the Poltava and Chernihiv regions.  And the position of the trustee of I. S. Mazepa allowed F. Orlik to be aware of all historical decisions.  It was then that long conversations with his friend and ally prompted I. S. Mazepa to use the enmity of Sweden and the Russian Empire in order to free themselves from both of them and create the Ukrainian state. </p><h2>  <span>Battle of Poltava</span> and the role of I. Mazepa </h2><p>  Around I. Mazepa, a part of the Cossack foreman rallied, who did not want to recognize the supremacy of the Russian autocrat.  The desire to break the hundred-year treaty was strengthened by the rude and unceremonious intervention of imperial Russia in the internal affairs of Ukraine.  And the Cossacks, and the clergy, and philistinism were not satisfied with the existing state of things and wished for a change for the better.  It was with their money that plans for the formation of Ukrainian statehood were collected and worked out.  Relying on Sweden, Mazepa's supporters tried to create an independent state in which Philip Orlik could occupy a prominent position.  The biography of a credible supporter seemed a big plus in becoming Orlik as a hetman of Ukraine.  Good prospects were confirmed by Mazepa's advanced age, and it was clear to everyone that a faithful companion of the hetman and a supporter of the independence of Ukraine should take its rightful place in the new, independent state. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hetmanism </h2><p>  History and a series of accidents prevented Mazepa's plans from coming true.  After the defeat in the Battle of Poltava, Charles XII with his supporters retreated to the Moldavian city of Bender. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Philip Orlik photo" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1270690.jpg" width="295"></div>  It was there that after the death of Ivan Stepanovich, Philip Orlik received hetmanism.  As the hetman of all Ukraine, he was recognized by both the Swedish king and the Turkish sultan.  The ceremony was held according to old Cossack customs, in contrast to the appointment of hetman as king in right-bank Ukraine.  East of the Dnieper, Ivan Skoropadsky became the leader of the Cossacks. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Philip Orlik biography" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1270689.jpg" width="467"></div>

    <h2>  Adoption of the constitution </h2><p>  But the main historical event in 1710 was the adoption of the world's first written constitution.  Having collected all the traditions and norms of Cossack law, taking into account the traditions of the modern European political system, a constitution was adopted in Ukraine, its author was Philip Orlik.  A short biography of this politician in any reference book of the world is designated as the life story of a person who tried to legally implement the laws of democracy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Philip Orlik and his constitution" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1270688.jpg" width="359"></div>

    <h2>  Philip Orlik and his constitution </h2><p>  The main law of the country was written in Latin and in Old Ukrainian, contained 16 parts and a preamble.  It began with the declaration of independence, the rejection of any domination under any conditions - both on the left and on the right side of the Dnieper.  The power of the hetman was called upon to limit the main council, which would consist of elected deputies from the Cossack regiments.  Elders and colonels would lead the meeting.  The hetman must make decisions, taking into account the recommendations of his council.  In addition, it was envisaged to collect a large Diet three times a year.  It would include ambassadors from the Zaporizhzhya army, deputies from the clergy, representatives of all cities of Ukraine. </p><p>  The constitution guaranteed the rights and freedoms of all residents of the state, regardless of property and class distinctions.  In addition, it was planned to carry out land reform, to check all land plots illegally seized or transferred to private ownership - this is how the situation of the poorest segments of the population was aligned.  Ukrainian statehood was to spread throughout Ukraine, and the borders of the new country were required to respect all neighboring countries. </p><h2>  Constitution Summary </h2><p>  The fact of the appearance of such an important document testifies to the level of enlightenment and statehood of the Cossack foreman of the early 18th century.  The general level of education of that time made it possible to count on the fact that all innovations would be accepted and approved by the people.  But, unfortunately, this document was never destined to become the first democratic constitution of a real state.  Repeated attempts to turn the tide of events could not succeed.  The first Ukrainian state arose only two hundred years later. </p><p>  Throughout his life, Philip Orlik lived in many European countries.  His children scattered throughout Europe, and the eldest son Gregory was able to get rich in France and became the owner of vast lands near Paris.  Many years later, his descendants sold the land to the French government, and an airport was built at this place, named after the first owner, Orly. </p><p>  The very first creator of the constitution ended his life in the Moldavian city of Iasi.  Until the last days letters came to him from all over Europe, he tried to keep abreast of all political events.  But the power of the tsarist autocracy grew stronger, and the hopes of freeing themselves from the grip of a neighboring power became less and less. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Philip Orlik date of birth" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1270704.jpg" width="600"></div>
