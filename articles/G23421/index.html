For convenience, we note that macro photography is photographing small objects in an enlarged plan.  In the end, the subject to be shot in the photo is shown much more than it is in reality.  The most favorite subjects of attention of macro photographers are insects, flowers, grass and coins. </p>

    <h2>  Photographic equipment for macro photography </h2><p>  To conduct macro photography, the question immediately arises as to which photo equipment is best for the session?  In reality, very good macro photos have the ability to take pictures with the simplest camera, because they also have the necessary mode and the lens capability is very high, but SLR cameras are more convenient. </p><p>  Their application allows the selection of the required lens and makes it possible to keep all add-ons under control, while achieving the best result.  If we talk about mirror technology, then for a specialist, as well as for beginning masters, such a model of a camera as Canon ED or similar ones is suitable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Macro Lens </h2><p>  If we talk about a compact device, then the choice is small, because the objective part cannot be replaced.  Although, if it is possible to purchase a specialized macro lens for the reflex camera, it is recommended to do just that.  The most popular is the Canon EF-S 60mm f / 2.8 Macro USM. </p>

    <p>  Macro photography is the process of photographing using glass designed for ‚Äúcropped‚Äù (small) matrices in cameras.  They are considered matrices mainly for non-professional cameras.  If we take into account a small matrix, the magnitude of the focus distance is equal to one hundred millimeters. </p><p>  A macro camera allows you to shoot macro photographs that have a 1: 1 scale, that is, the image can be projected onto a matrix that has a 1: 1 scale, resulting in an effect of their size.  Not every camera can do this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Specialist can apply Canon EOS 5D.  The lens of this camera is used for its thirty-five millimeter matrix Canon EF 100mm f / 2.8 Macro USM. </p><p>  In addition, it is possible to use cheap zoom lenses with the macro function of the type SIGMA AF 70-300mm f / 4-5.6 APO.  The macro mode of this type functions at a focal length within 200-300 mm and makes it possible to focus at a distance of 95 cm to the subject.  The scale in this case is 1: 2.9-1: 2. </p><h2>  Macro zoom lens </h2><p>  Also a macro option for macro photography with a SLR camera is a macro ring.  As a result of its use, even in the presence of a conventional lens, it is possible to make the approach to the subject to be taken very close.  However, as a result of using the macro ring, the automatic part of the camera does not work.  And this significantly complicates the process.  For this reason, you need a complete set for macro photography. </p>

    <h2>  Macro ring </h2><p>  It is also possible to get a macro lens almost for nothing if you turn the camera for macro photography and attach a tripod to it.  But such an action is not simple and, unfortunately, leads to disabling automatic control of the lens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Macro exposure </h2><p>  Macro photography is not recommended in automatic exposure.  This is considered incorrect.  It is recommended to set the <span>aperture priority.</span>  It should be remembered that as a result of a photo shoot at a short distance, it should be as small as possible so that the depth of field can be at least a little significant!  For example, F / 11 or even F / 22 will be very handy. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the aperture is closed and there is not enough light coming into the matrix, the shutter speed needs to be increased and the tripod during macro photography will be very useful to maintain the shooting scale. </p><p>  Macro photography has a little caution, because closing the aperture increases the risk of losing a fraction of the sharpness due to diffraction.  This can become noticeable on the f / 9 aperture. </p><h2>  Macro Lighting </h2><p>  To reduce exposure, you need to increase the illumination of the room.  On a sunny day, you can do without a flash, but in a dark room or at night with a lack of light when shooting any bugs or at the moment when macro photography of insects is carried out, a flash is very necessary. </p>

    <h2>  Macro flash </h2><p>  Macro cameras Canon and Nikon, as well as other brands, contain specially designed macroflashes, but some of them are very expensive.  For this reason, homemade macroflashes are most often used, which are improved for indoor or outdoor use. </p><p>  There are so many possible constructs to describe.  Examples of such cameras are shown in the photographs below.  And the photos look pretty good.  The main task of such transformations is considered to be very soft light as a result of its application. </p><h2>  Macro Focusing Principles </h2><p>  At the <span>depth of field</span> ‚ÄúDOF‚Äù of approximately 1 mm, focusing the subject becomes simply a very important task.  You can suffer for a long time with focusing, even if a good tripod with an excellent head is available.  For example, the type of photography and photo in which only the antennae and the head of the beetle were in the center of focus. </p>

    <p>  For this reason, amateurs and specialists prefer focusing rails.  An example is the Adorama Macro Focusing Rail.  But this concerns more specialists than enthusiasts and macro enthusiasts. </p><h2>  Macro background </h2><p>  The most simple method in the fight against inaccuracies in focusing is considered to be a small camera movement and a huge number of frames, one of which will be in focus anyway.  In the case when the subject is still, it is possible to move it in front of the camera.  The type of photography will change. </p>

    <p>  The background part of such photos always turns out blurry, for this reason it is necessary to concentrate your attention only on the general tonality.  At home, such a background turns out to be almost white, and in order to change it, it will be necessary to make some efforts, because on the street all the colors and shades seem natural.  The beauty of the background, which was mentioned above, is directly dependent on the lens, in particular, on the aperture device. </p><p>  Naturally, the nuances of macro photography are uncountable.  You can write about them endlessly. </p><h2>  How to hold the camera during macro photography </h2><p>  The camera must be kept with you during macro photography.  The probability of catching a good shot is often given when this moment is least expected.  Because of this, you must try not to leave the camera at home.  There is no need to purposefully photograph, hoping to get a good photo frame. </p><p>  During a walk, a trip to some unusual place or meeting friends, you need to have a camera with you.  Maybe at that moment it will be possible to capture a good shot.  In this case, a small, roomy, unprofessional camera is best. </p><p>  During macro photography, you need to pay attention to objects or scenes that are fascinating for a photo shoot.  It is necessary to notice objects, think about the possibility of capturing them so that a successful shot is released.  You can take pictures on the way to work or school.  You can also take photos on the way to the store.  If you liked some object, but there is no possibility or time to photograph it, then in a notebook or notepad make a note to yourself that this object will need to be photographed in the future.  This may not happen on the same day, or even a couple of months later, when free time appears.  It will be necessary to return to this place and make a successful shot. </p><p>  You need to look at the world through the eyes of a photographer.  That is, pay attention to everything that surrounds.  It can also be a flower on the window, a surrounding view from it, a vase with the fruits in it on the kitchen table.  It is necessary to train the thinking of the photographer.  Trying to notice the most ordinary things on the other hand is not as always. </p><p>  There is an expression ‚Äúpreliminary visualization‚Äù.  A wonderful photo is taken before the camera is taken in hand.  A huge number of shots are located directly in front of the eyes, perhaps even in the place where the future master is currently located.  One must learn to see what other people do not notice.  Perhaps it will turn out to create a masterpiece right at home. </p><p>  The process of photographing must be enjoyed.  For a huge number of photographers, this is considered not a job, but a hobby.  And hobby, as you know, should bring joy, and not just be the end result.  Satisfaction should be from the whole process of photo-grafting, namely: </p><ul><li>  from studying and viewing photo materials; </li><li>  from viewing not their work; </li><li>  from the desire to create something of their own. </li></ul><p>  After reviewing the basis of photography, there is the opportunity to greatly improve the uniqueness of your own photos, however, in order to create a real masterpiece, you will need to be interested in and try a lot of things, take nerves for bad luck and try to figure out what was done wrong and how to do it .  In this case, it will be possible to achieve a level of true mastery. </p><h2>  Reasons for Poor Macrophotography </h2><p>  For beginners, macro photography is the sharpness in the frame at the time of shooting, which is considered one of the most important indicators of a benign photograph.  Not sharp blurry photos have four main reasons: </p><ol><li>  "Shake".  It occurs when the camera shakes as a result of enormous exposure.  It also turns out when shooting takes place in low light conditions.  At the same time, camera shake can affect the camera delay by 10 seconds. </li><li>  The mobility of the removed object, since not every one of them will be static all the time working with it.  And even a small movement can ‚Äúblur‚Äù the photo if you shoot at a long delay. </li><li>  Auto focus miss.  Due to the fact that autofocus systems are not perfect and tend to miss and focus on another object. </li><li>  Wrong choice of depth of field. </li></ol>
