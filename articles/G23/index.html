In many cities of Russia this type of transport does not exist.  Indigenous Muscovites joke that all visitors are immediately visible in the crowd in the subway.

Multi-colored branches, many stations, a complex system of exits and transitions.  But do not panic.  In practice, to begin to navigate well in the underground kingdom of the capital, it is enough to regularly descend into it for at least one to two weeks.  Be sure to get a personal scheme.  This is much more convenient than looking for a poster with a map at the station or in the car.

    <p>  If you still find yourself in the subway without a personal scheme, look for an information kiosk.  This is a modern electronic device that will tell you how to use the metro in Moscow and help you plan the best route for your trip. </p><p>  If you use modern gadgets, you can download a special program on your phone or tablet.  Interactive metro schemes automatically route from point ‚ÄúA‚Äù to end point ‚ÄúB‚Äù and suggest the choice of the best option.  A popular question among those who are in the capital for the first time is how to find the entrance to the metro.  <span>Moscow metro station</span> addresses are on any map.  On the street you can find signs and signs with the traditional designation "M", but the easiest way is to ask any passerby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Get directions </h2>

    <p>  An important point: each station has several exits to the city, located at a considerable distance from each other.  Try to remember or even write down the name of the street you need to get onto. </p><p>  How to use the metro in Moscow and not get lost?  Everything is not as complicated as it seems at first glance: do not be lazy to study the tablets.  At every step in the subway are brief tips and instructions for passengers.  Very often, newcomers to the subway confuse the direction.  In order not to be mistaken in this way, remember the name of the terminal station or the one where you need to make a transfer. </p><p>  On the platform, directly opposite the train waiting area, you can see the train movement pattern.  What to do if you still left in the wrong direction or drove your station?  The main thing is not to panic.  Get off at the next station, go to the opposite side of the platform and wait for the arrival of the train that will take you back. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fare </h2>

Today, metal and plastic rounds are found only in collections.  So, to take the subway, you need to go down to the lobby.  Today, special cards are used to pay for travel.  There are several varieties with tariffing by validity period or number of trips.  The principle of all such cards is the same: the more one-time tickets you purchase, the cheaper each of them will cost. 
      <br>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Pay attention to the validity period.  If you do not use all trips for the specified period, there will be no compensation.  You can purchase cards for paying for the metro at the ticket offices at the entrance or at special terminals installed here.  Having chosen and paid the necessary number of trips, you can safely go to the turnstiles. </p><p>  Modern cards operate by contactless technology.  Bring your ticket to the target of the validator, at the time of the card you can see the number of remaining trips.  Turnstiles are equipped with panels with indicators that display the status of the equipment - the passage is open or closed.  The basic <span>rules for using the subway have</span> not changed since its opening.  Over time, only the type of payment instruments changes, once there were tickets, then metro tokens, today these are cards. </p><h2>  Rules for passengers </h2><p>  When you first get into the subway, it seems that you get at least in a huge <span>underground city.</span>  But in fact, before you is only a large enterprise, occupying a vast territory, the main task of which is the transportation of passengers.  The rules of conduct here are not much different from other types of public transport. </p><p>  In the subway, passengers must be attentive and mutually polite.  On the territory of the subway you can not litter, smoke, drink alcohol.  Formally banned in the subway, photo and video.  The official list of rules about how to use the metro in Moscow also includes some rather strange points.  One of them prohibits being barefoot at the station, and the other does not allow foreign objects to be placed on the way. </p><h2>  Carriage of passengers, personal items and baggage </h2>

Most regular metro passengers are annoyed by newcomers standing near the doors and not planning to go out.  Useful advice - go deep into the car if you are not going to leave the car at the next station.  In the subway, it is not customary to stand facing the doors in case you are not going to leave.  Formally, moving on a moving escalator is prohibited.  But the eternally rushing residents of the capital regularly run along its left side.  Compliant passengers are advised to occupy the right side of the escalator.
