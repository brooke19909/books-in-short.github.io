The “pillars” brought him world fame. </p><h2>  Central city of Eastern Siberia </h2><p>  Krasnoyarsk is not only the capital of the region of the same name, but also the center of the East Siberian Economic Region, the second largest subject of the Russian Federation.  It was founded in 1628 and became the largest of the ancient <span>Siberian cities.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnoyarsk pillars" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/461933.jpg" width="600"></div>  It can be called the city of students.  More than 150 thousand young people study at local universities.  The city has many other advantages.  But the main thing Krasnoyarsk is proud of is “Pillars”, which are a miracle of nature, which the native of these places admired, artist V. I. Surikov: “I saw the Swiss and Italian Alps, but I never saw such beauty like this ...”

    <h2>  The essence of the reserve </h2><p>  About a hundred rocks that are remnants (separate massifs consisting of elevated elements of the relief) from 60 to 600 meters high are located southwest of the city.  These are very ancient rocks - they are millions of years old (according to some sources - 450, according to others - 600).  They relate to the period when active volcanic activity took place on Earth.  In certain places, magma lifted the upper layers of the land cover (soil, limestone, etc.) and crystallized there.  Then, for an infinitely long time, this loose surface was blown out, washed out, simply destroyed under the influence of the atmosphere, and magma actually remained frozen, which for the same reasons (the effect of water, wind, etc.) took quite bizarre forms.  At a large Siberian scientific center, a branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, there is a reserve under constant observation and study, the location of which is Krasnoyarsk.  “Pillars” glorified the city far beyond the borders of Russia due to its uniqueness and pristine charms.  They consist of pink syenite, which is an igneous rock.  It differs from granite in a lower silica content.  “The tops of syenites are solid, sons of the winds,” as the poet wrote.  “Pillars” are called so because some of them really resemble columns.  And, say, a mountain outlier in the Crimea under the name Tepe-Kermen, located near Bakhchisarai, has the shape of a regular truncated cone.  Nature has an inexhaustible fantasy, an example of which is an elephant remnant 7 meters high, who meets visitors and “columnists” at the entrance to this bizarre natural zone belonging to the zone of responsibility of the city of Krasnoyarsk.  “Pillars” is a State Nature Reserve, which has recently been in dire need of systematic protective measures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Geographical position </h2>

From the southeast to the northwest the reserve crosses a mountain divide, consisting of a chain of ridges.  Kaydinsky (stretches for almost 11 km, height more than 700 m), Takmakovsky, Listvyazhniy, near which the Stolbin Highland is located, serve as a continuation of each other and all together represent a winding arc.  The Otkliknoy ridge departs from the highlands, near which there is a reserve, which has a cave 200 meters deep in the northwestern part with an underground lake and an extensive system of tunnels.  All this mountain range belongs to the foothills of the Eastern Sayan Mountains.

    <h2>  Exception to the rule </h2><p>  Usually, security zones are closed to visitors, but the exception to the rule is the Stolby Nature Reserve (Krasnoyarsk).  A photo of numerous tourists is evidence of this.  True, the part that is open to visitors makes up only 3% of the reserve’s territory, the rest of the area is occupied by Wild Pillars, access to which is limited.  These 3% can be conditionally divided into three sections: the Takmak rock complex, the chairlift along the ski run and the Bobrovy Log fanpark. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Columnism - A Local Invention </h2>

And although the local outlier rocks for the most part do not at all resemble lighting and <span>poles for a fence,</span> Krasnoyarsk and its inhabitants began to call the reserve that way - “Pillars”.  And the movement, respectively, received the name "columnism".  Over time, it acquired its own subculture, but has an absolutely amateur status.  Obviously, the locals climbed the rocks in antiquity, but they consider the official date for the emergence of “colibism” to be 1851, in which the teacher of the Vladimir shelter Kapin conquered the “First Pillar”, and then consolidated what was achieved together with brave pupils.  The movement has its own story.  Columnists believe that climbing, including professional climbing, began here.  The world-famous climbers, the Abalakov brothers, who invented a <span>tourist backpack,</span> began their journey in the "Pillars".  The rock-climber was Nastya Kachalova, who, in bast shoes, climbed onto the Elephant, the conquest of which is considered a necessary school for any columnist.

Their most favorite place is the “Chinese Wall”, located at the foot of the “Takmak” in the valley of the Bazaikha River.  Here is the rock "Ermak" and several smaller outliers under the general name "Sparrows", among which there are "Tsypa" and "Toad".  “Central pillars” consist of unique rocks, each of which has its own name: “Lion Gate”, pillars numbered from first to fourth, “Grandfather”, “Feathers”, “Minsk Baba”, etc. They all occupy the territory 5 x 10 km and are located 7 km from the border of the reserve. </p><h2>  Local zoo </h2>

In the 30s of the XIX century, Siberia was swept by a gold rush.  One of the places where they “dug” and mined precious metal were “Pillars”.  And even without gold it was the richest region of Siberia - according to the data for 1833, only sables here produced 67 pieces, and even 43 foxes.  In the immediate vicinity of the city border, in the valley of the Bazaikhi river, there are two ski slopes with the names “Beaver Log” and “Kashtak”.

    <h2>  Sung in verses and songs </h2><p>  To realize the love of the townspeople for their main attraction, you need to see how many people visit the Stolby Reserve (Krasnoyarsk) on Sundays.  Photo attached.  Love is confirmed by poems, songs and <span>prose,</span> which can not be counted.  “Of all the milestones I have passed, the Pillars are one second.  I distinguish them from all the beauties of my native land, ”the Krasnoyarsk poet F. Yavorsky was so enthusiastic about them, who dedicated several cycles to them.  Galina Rukosueva described in verse an old local legend about the mighty Tsar Yenisey.  V. Gavryushkin equates his love of the “Pillars” with the feelings he himself has for friends, a woman and children.  There are a lot of legends dedicated to these statues.  Each rock, every corner of the reserve has its own mythical story: “A world where miracles quietly snooze secret tales.” </p><h2>  Tourist mecca </h2>

Everyone knows how to get there.  From the city bus station to the reserve there is a popular bus number 50, the final stop of which is called “Chalet”.  Then begins a 7 km long walking route (first asphalt, then a dirt road).  This is the road to the First Pillar in the Central Zone, where there are signs everywhere, following which it is difficult to get lost, but possible.  Bus route No. 50 is known to Krasnoyarsk residents, who from childhood know about local attractions, and as schoolchildren, they make excursions there.
