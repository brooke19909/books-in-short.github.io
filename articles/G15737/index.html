  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kyoto Protocol - another attempt to save humanity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among the global problems that threaten human civilization, <span>climate change</span> should come first <span>.</span>  Due to natural disasters, humanity suffers huge losses.  Forest fires, floods, droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes - these are just the most obvious of the consequences of climate change. </p><p>  Understanding the potential threats of further global warming, the <span>world community has</span> taken a number of measures.  In 1992, the UN Conference on Climate Change was signed at the UN Conference on Environmental Issues.  In 1997, the Kyoto <span>Protocol</span> was signed <span>.</span>  <span>This</span> document contains country commitments to reduce or limit harmful <span>greenhouse gas emissions.</span>  By 2012, it is planned to reduce emissions by 5.2% compared to 1990 levels.  Each state has specific emission limits.  If the country does not fully spend the limits, it has the opportunity to sell them as unused quotas.  According to UN experts, such a mechanism will facilitate the flow of resources to developing countries.  These resources will be used to combat the negative effects of climate change. </p><p>  The Kyoto treaty regulates that Eastern Europe, as well as the <span>Baltic countries</span> should reduce emissions by 8%, the European Union - 8%, Canada and Japan - 6%, and Ukraine and Russia need to keep emissions at the 1990 level.  Developing countries, including China, India, are not burdened with obligations, but can take voluntary obligations, as well as receive financing for their implementation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h3>  <strong>Critique of the science of the Kyoto Protocol</strong> </h3><p>  Firstly, many experts doubt even the fact of global warming.  An increase in average annual temperature may be a random fluctuation.  Following her, the climate will return to normal again. </p><p>  Secondly, even if a steady increase in the average annual temperature is really observed, it is not at all so obvious that a person plays a decisive role in this.  It is believed that the increase in <span>carbon dioxide</span> is not the cause, but the result of warming. </p><p>  Thirdly, global warming may not be catastrophic for humanity.  Some countries, for example, Holland, may be flooded, but warming will make it possible to actively develop territories that are now practically not used, for example, Siberia, Canada, and the polar seas. </p><p>  These doubts do not refute the importance of creating a mechanism for controlling the level of pollution.  Although the Kyoto Protocol itself is not at all so necessary </p><h3>  <strong>Russia</strong> </h3><p>  Russia signed the treaty in 1999, and ratified it at the end of 2004.  For Russia, the Kyoto Protocol entered into force only in 2005, 90 days after ratification.  According to experts, the volume of quotas accumulated by the Russian Federation during the term of the agreement will exceed 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. </p><p>  Opponents of the agreement believe that it will be difficult for the country to simultaneously increase production and improve its structure, while refusing to specialize in <span>gas</span> and oil production.  Thus, the fulfillment of the conditions that the Kyoto Protocol contains will slow down the country's economic development and may even lead to a decline in production and a reduction in economic potential. </p><p>  Supporters of the agreement note that the implementation of the Kyoto agreement will be an incentive to modernize the economy by attracting foreign investment, as well as the development of "clean" industries.  In addition, this will provide additional financial resources through the trading of quotas. </p><p>  The Kyoto Agreement is ending this year.  Three years later, he will be replaced by a new document, which was discussed in December 2009 at the negotiations held in Copenhagen. </p>
