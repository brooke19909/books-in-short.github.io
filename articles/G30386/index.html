The choice of the hotel is of paramount importance, and the level of comfort in the place of residence will have a huge impact on the quality of rest.  Hotel "Laguna" in Lipetsk belongs to the category of premium accommodation. </p><h2>  Overview Information </h2><p>  "Laguna" in the city of Lipetsk is a premium hotel, rooms of various levels of comfort (from economy to VIP) are provided here, high-quality service, qualified staff perfectly cope with their duties.  Guests are impressed by the excellent location of the hotel, comfortable rooms, friendly staff and amazing food in restaurants.  Banquets are often organized here, wedding wedding registrations, conferences are held, business negotiations are held. </p><p>  The nine-story building was built and commissioned in 2009.  Since then, the reputation of the hotel has never been thoroughly criticized by the guests.  The administration reacts very insignificantly to the comments very quickly, eliminating trifles that can negatively affect the quality of rest of the guests. </p><h2>  Location </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="52.5903394" data-lng="39.61478650000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/2/0/8/5208.png"></div><p>  Hotel "Laguna" in Lipetsk is located on the banks of the Voronezh River, there is also a sandy beach.  The road to the business center of the city will not be long, within walking distance is the Lower Park, and in the evening, hotel guests can go to the Tolstoy Theater. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can get from Chertovitskoe Airport in 1.5 hours by taxi or book a transfer.  Tourists traveling on their own by car go to the Hotel Laguna at the address: Lipetsk, pl.  Mira, 1d.

The difference between them is in area, degree of comfort, view from the room and, of course, in price. </p><p>  All 115 rooms have a modern interior, more reminiscent of the style of classical minimalism, when there is everything you need without unnecessary pretentiousness.  The rooms are equipped with air conditioning systems, comfortable bathrooms with a hairdryer and toiletries, towels.  The room is divided into a sleeping and working area.  The first one has a comfortable bed with bedside tables, a flat-screen TV hangs on the wall, and the second one has a desk, a chair (there are sofas and armchairs in the suites and VIP categories), and a telephone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pogostite.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="honeymoon room" class="if uuid-2599027" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2599027.jpg"></div><p>  At the Hotel Laguna (Lipetsk), newlyweds often stay on their wedding night.

The first is made in a traditional design and is called "Lagoon", it offers European and traditional cuisine.  But the most favorite place for hotel guests is the second restaurant, it is called Sky (in the lane with English - "sky").  Almost every enthusiastic review writes about its good location on the ninth floor, where large, panoramic windows offer a unique view of the river and the city. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://www.nova-tours.ru/oteli/rossiya/lipetsk/premium-otel-laguna/" data-original="www.nova-tours.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="panoramic windows in the restaurant" class="if uuid-2599023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2599023.jpg"></div><p>  The hall is divided into zones, so fans of club music and dancing will not interfere with those who prefer a romantic candlelit dinner at ChillOut.

For example, some guests who reached the hotel by car noted a very uncomfortable crossing over the bridge and the roundabout near the Laguna.  Others got into the hotel at the moment when there were interruptions in water due to an accident.  The guests complained about the poor soundproofing in the rooms (however, the administration received a proposal to move to a more peaceful place of the hotel).  Another unpleasant moment indicated in the reviews, which affected the quality of rest, was an alarm that worked several times.  The guests were not evacuated, but no one explained the reason for the night commotion. </p><p>  There are much more positive reviews, and the hotel has earned a rating of 8.5 out of 10. Guests describe the comfortable and sound furniture, comfortable beds with snow-white linen, on which they got enough sleep.  The cleanliness of the rooms and the quality of the food did not cause any complaints.  The guests are very pleased with the restaurant on the top floor of the hotel, with club parties that are held once a week.  Vacationers staying in superior rooms (studio) appreciated the spacious bathroom with a bidet, a full set of personal hygiene items. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pogostite.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bathroom" class="if uuid-2599039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2599039.jpg"></div><p>  Many found the hotel pricing very democratic.  Room rates start from 3000 rubles per day.
