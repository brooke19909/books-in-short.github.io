The area where this unique park lies belongs to the Navajo Indians, so entrance to the territory is paid.  The fee will need to be paid to the local population, and it, in turn, will allow you to hire a guide. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazingplacesonearth.com" data-author=": Lucas L√∂ffler, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Antelope Canyon" class="if uuid-2253020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65189/2253020.jpg"></div><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  Antelope Canyon in the United States is a unique phenomenon, but for some reason still little known.  This is for the best, because thanks to the unknown tourists are not so many.  It is an offshoot of another canyon - Glen.  A stream flows into the Colorado River in spring, and in the warm season it dries up.  Antelope Canyon is not a national park, unlike neighboring canyons.  Around the territory stretch the lands belonging, as already mentioned, to the Navajo Indians.  That is why not everyone can get here, but for the right of passage you will have to pay a small fee.  Despite the fact that on the territory tourists will not see either toilets, or stalls with water (this is in the desert), or a map plan, the indicated place is worth a visit.  The beauty of the gorges is beyond description.  It is amazing how such a miracle could create nature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.visittheusa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="US Antelope Canyon" class="if uuid-2253023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65189/2253023.jpg"></div><h2>  Canyon history </h2><p>  This unique natural area was discovered relatively recently - only in the twentieth century.  Local Indians laid down the legend that the place was discovered quite by accident by a little girl.  She went to look for the missing goat in the mountains and accidentally came across the stunning beauty of the gorge.  Admission of outsiders to them was allowed only at the end of the twentieth century - in 1997.  Prior to this, only the local Indians were allowed to do this. </p><h2>  What territory includes </h2><p>  On this plateau lies the upper (Upper) and lower (respectively Lower) canyon of Antelope.  Photos and reviews of visitors indicate that the first is more beautiful.  Its depth reaches six meters, and the bottom is sandy, smooth, and it is pleasant to walk along it.  The Upper Canyon is also more passable and even tourists can visit it on crutches and with restrictions on movement.  But at the same time, both gorges are very similar and extremely good.  The Lower Canyon also has its advantages.  It is picturesque, unusual.  You need to go down the beautiful stairs.  In addition, in the Lower Canyon there is a longer time period when you can take successful photographs, because it is less deep. </p><div class="photo" data-original="w-dog.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arizona Antelope Canyon" class="if uuid-2253026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65189/2253026.jpg"></div><h2>  When is it better to go down to the gorges </h2><p>  The best time of the year for a trip to the canyons is autumn and spring, or rather, from October to early December, as well as in March and April.  It is then that the sun's rays, penetrating the gorges, reach the very bottom.  Thus, the canyons look absolutely fabulous, as if the light is on in some kind of marvelous palace of the underground king. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It‚Äôs too hot in the summer, so the trip can become unbearable.  In addition, during the hot season, thunderstorms and showers are frequent - then visits are forbidden even with a guide. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yallabook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Antelope Canyon in Arizona, USA" class="if uuid-2253029" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65189/2253029.jpg"></div><p>  Winter in the gorges is rather gloomy and therefore not the best photos can be obtained.  But in winter you can see interesting deep shadows on the walls.  Whatever time of year you go there, Antelope Canyon (Arizona) will amaze you in the heart and will be remembered forever.  This is a unique nature reserve. </p><p>  Photos - and most tourists go for it - are most successful in the afternoon.  It is then that the sun is at its zenith.  In the Lower Canyon, this is a time period from 10 to 14 hours, and in the Upper Canyon - noon (11.00‚Äì13.00).  However, it is worth bearing in mind one nuance.  In the Upper Canyon, at exactly noon, the Sun shines so brightly that it floods the entire gorge.  Then it‚Äôs better to postpone taking pictures and put it off at least for an hour, otherwise all the charm and magic of the place disappears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yallabook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Antelope Canyon - photo" class="if uuid-2253030" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65189/2253030.jpg"></div><h2>  Antelope Canyon: how to get there </h2><p>  It is very difficult to get there by public transport, so it‚Äôs good if you drive your own car.  Antelope Canyon is located in Arizona (USA).  Photos and maps show that the nearest town here is Page (in English Page), which is closer to the border of Utah.  The territory lies four miles east of the city.  You need to move along highway 98 towards a large coal-fired power station.  So, the Upper Canyon will be on the right side of the road, and the Lower, respectively, on the left.  It is worth noting that the signs are quite inconspicuous, because they are made by hand, and are not official road signs.  There is only a small bulletin board by the road towards the Upper Antelope Canyon.  The reference point may be the aforementioned coal station.  If you drove past her, this is a sign that you need to turn around. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you drive from the major city of San Diego, the journey will take about 10 hours (700 miles).  Take the i-15 highway toward Barstow, and take the i-40 exit east.  Further, the path lies to the city of Flagstaff - about 200 miles, and from there there is already a direct road to Page along highway 89 (north direction). </p><h2>  How to get to the territory </h2><p>  There are two ways to enter the Antelope Canyon (Arizona).  The USA is a country of market economy; therefore, it has many diverse companies.  Each town has tour operators.  In the village nearest to the canyon - Page - there are four travel agencies involved in displaying this natural miracle.  The easiest way to get into the canyon is to book an excursion through these companies. </p><p>  The second way to get into the territory is more economical.  You just need to drive on your own to the hut, which is located on the bend from highway 98. Local Indians are usually on duty there, who collect groups of tourists.  By paying a fee of 3 euros, you can get inside.  However, you still have to pay for the services of a guide.  They are hourly, but in principle, an hour is enough.  In any case, it will turn out cheaper than ordering an excursion to travel agencies, and the guide will submit the information personally to you.  The only disadvantage of this method is that when you approach the territory in the on-duty hut there may not be anyone.  Then you have to wait a bit. </p><p>  In any case, they will not be allowed to enter the gorges without a guide.  This rule is very strict.  This is especially carefully monitored during the rainy season.  Then at any moment the canyon can fill with water.  In addition, during a thunderstorm, visiting the territory is completely prohibited. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.annualadventure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Antelope Canyon" class="if uuid-2253034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65189/2253034.jpg"></div><h2>  How much does a canyon trip cost </h2><p>  The cost of the tour is from 25 euros to 50. Any of the excursions includes the road from the town to the place, fees and duties.  On average, travel agencies spend several visits per day.  Usually the canyon tour itself lasts an hour, and the journey takes half an hour in each direction.  Photographers are advised to tour for three hours.  It is very difficult to configure the equipment in an hour, and the differences in shadows and light inside the caves are quite strong.  It will be difficult for ordinary people to walk so much time between the crevices, and for some it may seem simply boring to wander in the desert territories for so long.  The canyon is quite cold, if you take a tour for three hours, then you need to take care of warmer clothes. </p><p>  One of the most profitable tour operators in the city of Page: Antelope Canyon Adventures at Seyfey Plaza - Safeway Plaza.  The office is located at the intersection of the main artery of the city - Lake Powell Boulevard and the small Elmstreet street. </p><h2>  Which of the tours is better to choose </h2><p>  It is best to book the first of three day excursions.  It starts around 10 in the morning, and by half-past ten the group is already in the canyon.  Thus, no matter which gorge tourists go to, they will be fascinated by the magic of light and shadows here, and friends and relatives after a while will be fascinated by their pictures.  If you take a tour for 12 hours, then in the Upper Antelope Canyon you will not get the most successful shots.  Unless to book at this time a three-hour journey.  Then it will be possible to wait out the sun at its zenith. </p><p>  After two hours (just then the time for the third excursion comes) there is no longer such a bright light, more shadows and in both places not the most successful light.  An alternative would be to take a three-hour tour.  Then, even if the departure is at 12 o‚Äôclock, it will be possible to admire all the options for the play of light and shadows on the walls of crevices. </p><p>  But the best way to enjoy the canyons in full is to book a three-hour and the earliest excursion.  You can see how the sun sets in the crevices, and then leaves them.  In addition, you can visit both canyons, but not run "at a gallop across Europe", but enjoy the unique natural spectacle in full.  Yes, a three-hour tour is 1.5 times more expensive, but when will you come here again? </p><div class="photo" data-original="rootsrated.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo from Antelope Canyon, Arizona, USA" class="if uuid-2253038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65189/2253038.jpg"></div><h2>  What to visit near the canyon </h2><p>  From Antelope Canyon to the larger park - Grand Canyon - about 150 miles.  It can be reached in a few hours if you drive a car.  Therefore, if you have several days in Arizona, then you can drive from here and enjoy the Great Canyon.  At the same time, it will be possible to compare these two beautiful natural objects: a well-developed national park and a rather closed territory, but equally attractive and beautiful. </p>
