We create new devices, get unique materials that we have not thought about before.  The use of nanotechnology in everyday life allowed us to change the shape of objects familiar to us.  As a result of this, we got completely different, but useful properties of the substance.  The reality surrounding us is becoming less dangerous and most favorable for a comfortable life.  A good example: reducing the usual dimensions of used electrical devices to the size of nanoparticles, invisible to the human eye.  Computers are getting smaller, but much more productive.  Nanotechnology in everyday life and in industry has made it possible to significantly change everything around us. </p><p>  Is it possible to create a form of artificial intelligence that could satisfy any of our needs?  The answer lies in the rational use of the latest developments.  Nanotechnology is the way to the future, as it affects all aspects of our lives.  The use of nanotechnology provides many opportunities, but also raises a number of concerns. </p><h2>  Window to the nanoworld </h2><p>  An electron microscope allows you to look into the microworld.  Without special equipment, nanotechnology in everyday life is very difficult to immediately notice, since they are so small that they are indistinguishable to the naked eye.  It is on such a scale that substances exhibit the most unusual and unexpected properties.  The use of such properties promises a unique technological revolution.  They provide radically new opportunities, such as controlling the human body and the environment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nanotechnology in everyday life" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/989027.jpg" width="600"></div>

He is one of the first people in the world to have the opportunity to study matter at the level of incredibly small quantities, millionths of a millimeter.  These microscopes allow you to examine the surface just like the blind read <span>Braille.</span>  Then no one could suspect how useful nanotechnology is in everyday life and industry. </p><h2>  The principle of work with nanoparticles </h2><p>  The scanning microscope uses a probe, which is a needle with a thickness of 1 atom.  When it approaches only a few nanometers to the sample, an exchange of electrons occurs with the nearest nanoparticle.  This phenomenon is called the tunnel effect.  The control system records a change in the magnitude of the tunneling current, and based on this information, a more accurate construction of the surface topography of the test sample is already underway.  The software allows you to convert the data into an image that gives scientists the key to a new world, using nanotechnology in everyday life and other industries. </p><p>  According to James Jimzevsky, thanks to a scanning electron microscope, scientists first obtained images of atoms and molecules and were able to study their shape.  This was a real revolution in science, because scientists began to look at many things in a completely different way, paying attention to the properties of individual atoms, and not millions and billions of particles, as it was in the past. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nanotechnology examples in everyday life" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/989038.jpg" width="600"></div>

When the device approached the atom at a distance of 1 nanometer, a bond appeared between it and the atom.  This feature made it possible to find a way to move individual microparticles.  Thanks to this discovery, it became possible to use nanotechnology for a comfortable life. </p><p>  As explained by James Jimzevsky, a professor at the University of California, a tunneling scanning microscope made it possible to practically touch molecules and atoms.  For the first time, scientists were able to manipulate atoms on the surface of matter and create structures that were previously impossible to imagine. <br><br>  This newfound discovery (the ability to observe and manipulate the smallest particles that make up matter) made it possible to use nanotechnology in all industries without exception. </p><h2>  Nanotechnology development </h2><p>  The physicist and philosopher Etin Klin believes that the possibility of a technological breakthrough due to nanotechnology is quite real, but this is largely based on the enthusiasm of the scientist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the use of nanotechnology in everyday life" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/989040.jpg" width="600"></div>  According to the physicist and philosopher Etin Klin, less than 100 years have passed from the moment of experimental confirmation of the existence of atoms to the moment they have the opportunity to manipulate them.  Scientists are opening up opportunities that they could not even think of before.  Only because of this, the government of all developed countries began to show interest in the relevant sciences.  It all started with the American initiative in 2002, which was made by the physicists of Rock and Benbridge.  These scientists came up with the crazy idea that thanks to nanotechnology, humanity will be able to solve all the problems it faces.

    <p>  This statement was the impetus for the beginning of numerous studies that allowed the implementation of such advanced areas of science and technology as microelectronics, computer science, nuclear energy research, microbiology, laser technology, medicine and much more. </p><h2>  Nanotechnology: Examples </h2><p>  In everyday life there are so many inconspicuous, but very important substances, the presence of which we do not even suspect!  Let's look at the most striking examples: </p><ul><li>  <em>Modern phones.</em>  Thanks to the use of nanotechnology, it became possible to equip smartphones, iPhones and other devices with special sensors that act as protection.  Even with broken glass, microchips do not stop working. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nanotechnology for a comfortable life" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/989052.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><ul><li>  <em>Toothpaste.</em>  No one has ever thought about why a dentifrice is different.  This is all due to the presence of certain nanoparticles.  For example, calcium hydroxyapatite, which is invisible to the naked eye, helps restore damaged enamel and protects teeth from tooth decay. </li></ul><ul><li>  <em>Adhesive plaster.</em>  Nanotechnologies in everyday life are found in the most unexpected subjects.  For example, a regular band-aid.  It has a silver nanolayer, which promotes rapid healing and has antibacterial properties. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nanotechnology in everyday life and in industry" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/989053.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><ul><li>  <em>Paint for cars.</em>  Thanks to nanoparticles, modern car paints are able to cover shallow scratches and other cavities formed on the body.  They include microscopic balls, which provide such an effect. </li></ul>
