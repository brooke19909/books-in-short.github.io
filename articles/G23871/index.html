Very often there are such problems that the printer does not want to print documents, prints them slowly, or performs some other actions that the user did not specify.  There are a huge number of reasons why the device refuses to work.  The worst situation is when the device simply ignores the actions of the host.  Do not immediately lose heart when such a problem arises, because you can solve it on your own without resorting to the help of a specialist or even buying a new device.  This article will cover the main reasons and ways to resolve the issue of why the printer does not print a Word document. </p><h2>  First steps </h2><p>  First of all, you should check if the problem is really in the printer?  Maybe the user sets the commands incorrectly or the corresponding drivers are not installed on the computer, without which the printing device cannot interact with it.  First you need to try restarting the computer and the printer itself, and then print another document.  If it is obvious that the catch is in the printing device, then we proceed to the following measures. </p><h2>  Restart print service </h2><p>  Most often, the problem is solved in this way.  You must restart the service called Print Manager.  To do this, simultaneously press the Windows and R keys. Next, enter the command: services.msc.  The window that opens is the state of all services that are running or installed on the computer.  In their list you need to find a service called "Print Manager" and restart it by right-clicking and selecting the "Restart" action.  This way we clear the print queue, which could just clog up and block all incoming commands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Print manager" class="if uuid-3155627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3155627.jpg"></div><p>  After the manipulations, the problem should be solved, if this is not a more difficult case.  This method is definitely worth a try, if only to determine the root of the problem. </p><h2>  USB cable issues </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cablewholesale.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="usb for printer" class="if uuid-3155632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3155632.jpg"></div><p>  If the previous method turned out to be useless, it is worth following the following points: </p><ol><li>  Check the cable for mechanical damage (cracks, kinks, etc.).  If you detect the slightest defects, you need to check the wire on another device to determine if it is a problem. </li><li>  Try plugging the cable into another USB slot on the computer.  It may turn out that the port simply turned out to be inoperative. </li><li>  Do not use wires that are too long (over 200 cm).  This can lead to frequent interruptions between devices. </li><li>  You can try using a different USB cable to connect the printer and computer. </li><li>  You can try to connect a wireless printer using a wire if it refuses to act. </li></ol><p>  These manipulations can also help solve a situation where the printer does not print Word documents.  We pass to another type of reason. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Work with drivers </h2><p>  A driver is a program that controls a device and connects it to others.  Therefore, the presence of an updated and working program is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the equipment. </p><h2>  How to install the driver? </h2><p>  If there is no CD with the appropriate utilities for the printer, then you can find them on the network, they are freely available for download.  You need to go to the manufacturer‚Äôs official website and select your device model.  You should find the driver of the desired version and download them to your computer.  You need to read the license agreement and follow the installation instructions.  After all operations, you must run the program and make sure that there is a connection with the printer, which must be connected to the computer. </p><p>  It happens that the user does not know the model of his printer and what kind of manufacturer he has.  In this case, you need to look at it on the computer: in the control panel, find the ‚ÄúDevice Manager‚Äù tab, in the list of devices should be the line ‚ÄúPrinters‚Äù or ‚ÄúEquipment‚Äù, where you can find the model of your printer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="printer name" class="if uuid-3155639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3155639.jpg"></div><p>  It is possible to install the driver according to its description.  You can determine it by right-clicking on the shortcut of your printer in the device manager (how to do this is described above) and open the "Properties".  At the top you need to click the "Details" button.  In the "Properties" field, select "Driver Description" and copy it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="driver description" class="if uuid-3155647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3155647.jpg"></div><p>  Next, you need to find the driver search service on the Internet and paste the copied value into the line.  It remains only to download the program and follow the installation instructions. </p><p>  If the utility is already installed, but the printer does not print documents from the computer, you should update the program. </p><h2>  How to update the driver? </h2><p>  You can use the easiest way - reinstall the utility.  To do this, find the "Devices and Printers" button in the control panel.  Next, select your printer that is connected to the computer and click on its icon with the right mouse button.  Then you need to remove the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Delete device" class="if uuid-3155658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3155658.jpg"></div><p>  Now, when reconnecting the printer to the computer, the system will require the installation of a driver and will begin searching for the required version. </p><h2>  Other reasons </h2><p>  The printer does not print the document - what if all the previous steps did not help?  Check out the most obvious things.  Namely: is there paper in the printer, is there enough ink for printing, or maybe the cartridge is completely disconnected? </p><h2>  Verify default device </h2><p>  It may happen that the priority is transferred from the main device to the virtual one, and because of this it happens that the printer does not want to print a Word document.  It is checked as follows: go to the ‚ÄúControl Panel‚Äù, then to ‚ÄúDevices and Printers‚Äù.  In the list of devices that opens, you need to select the one you are going to use and, right-clicking, select "Use by default." </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Use by default" class="if uuid-3155664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3155664.jpg"></div><p>  After that, the computer will use this particular device to print documents.  In the same window, it will not be superfluous to diagnose problems by selecting the appropriate button when you right-click on the printer. </p><p>  Another way to check why the HP printer does not print Word documents is to display a test page.  To do this, go to the control panel and click on the ‚ÄúDevices and Printers‚Äù tab.  Double-click the left mouse button on the icon of your printer.  The setup window opens if a driver is installed on the printer.  In this window you need to go into the settings and click "Test Print". </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Test print" class="if uuid-3155676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3155676.jpg"></div><p>  After that, the device should print a test page, which will show what the problem is: if the paint is not evenly applied, then the cartridge may have deteriorated;  if the sheet turned out to be empty, then the problem is either in the paint or in the printer itself. </p><h2>  Select document printing options </h2><p>  It also happens that the machine seems to display the text, but it is placed incorrectly or some of its fragments are simply not visible.  In this case, you should choose the right size and print quality.  You need to find the file you want to print and right-click on it, selecting "Print".  In the window that opens, you will see all the settings that you can change for yourself, thereby choosing the optimal position, quality and size of the text or image. </p><p>  All the above steps are basic and directly related to the problem of why the printer does not print a Word document.  Now consider the secondary factors that also happen and can affect the operation of the device, but are not directly related to the main difficulty. </p><h2>  What to do when paper jams? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="resources.lasertekservices.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper jam" class="if uuid-3155685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3155685.jpg"></div><p>  This situation periodically happens with each user when the device wrinkles paper.  Prerequisites for this may be when the HP printer slowly prints a Word document.  The problem can be solved by your own efforts without the help of masters.  First you need to understand the causes of paper jams: </p><ol><li>  The paper is not loading correctly in the tray.  For example, if the sheets are of a non-standard size (for example, 10 x 15 photo paper), then it should be placed in a specific place in the tray, which is usually allocated and marked by manufacturers.  A4 sheets can also be glued together, which can cause jams. </li><li>  Poor quality paper.  A printer is a rather expensive machine, so you need to pick up good paper for it.  Bad sheets can leave small particles inside the device that accumulate over time and can cause problems with operation. </li><li>  Damaged paper grab mechanism.  A video may lose its function over time.  For example, it may dry out and simply not act on the loaded sheets or wrinkle them.  To remedy the situation, experts recommend lubricating the rollers with alcohol.  To do this, wet the cloth with alcohol and use your hand to pick up these very mechanisms, which are located at the bottom of the tray where the paper is placed.  Wipe them well to restore the ability to grab sheets. </li><li>  Poor or non-original paint.  It is very important to use cartridges of the correct manufacturer to eliminate the risk of problems with the device, including paper jams. </li></ol><p>  To solve this problem, do the following: </p><ol><li>  Turn off the printer so that it does not hold jammed paper.  When repairing the included equipment, you can get your hands dirty with paint or even get a burn if the printer is laser. </li><li>  The sheet should be pulled out exactly along the path along which it should pass.  If you act differently, you can damage the parts of the machine or leave pieces of paper inside the printer, which will complicate the problem. </li><li>  Before removing the sheet, remove the cartridge from the carriage so that ink does not get into unnecessary places.  After all the procedures, you need to install the cartridge back and make sure that the carriage is able to move. </li></ol><p>  To avoid a paper jam again, you must follow these guidelines: </p><ul><li>  Do not load too many sheets in the tray at a time.  Due to the large amount of paper, the printer wheels may simply not cope and deteriorate. </li><li>  Insert the sheets individually to make sure that there are no glued sheets in the stack. </li><li>  Choose only paper that is designed for printing or recommended by the manufacturer. </li><li>  Specify the type of paper used for printing in the device settings. </li><li>  Regularly conducts cartridge cleaning.  This feature is present on some models. </li></ul><h2>  How to clean the printer at home? </h2><p>  One of the reasons why the printer does not print the document in the queue may be the contamination of the cartridges or dried ink.  Such problems usually occur when the device is not used for a long time and the paint becomes unusable.  Of course, you should not immediately resort to the help of specialists or bring the printer to the service, as it costs quite a lot, and you can solve this problem yourself.  It is worth noting that in offices, drying of paint is almost not observed, since documents are constantly printed there - the device is always in operation.  Therefore, to prevent drying out, you should at least once a week display a page with some text or image. </p><p>  First of all, you need to prepare all the tools that will be used: wipes, alcohol, water, containers for liquids.  Step-by-step instruction for cleaning the carriage: </p><ol><li>  Open the device cover and remove all available cartridges, as well as the carriage for them. </li><li>  Wipe off all parts and elements inside the printer from dust and paint. </li><li>  It is necessary to mix alcohol with water in equal proportions and put the carriage there so that the paint and accumulated dirt get wet. </li><li>  After 2 minutes, wipe the part with napkins to remove excess moisture, as well as remove soaked paint. </li><li>  Replace all items in place. </li></ol><h2>  Cartridge cleaning </h2><p>  There are two ways: </p><ol><li>  Steaming.  To do this, hold the part of the cartridge from which the ink comes out for 4-5 seconds under steam. </li><li>  Soaking.  You will need washing liquid for windows.  This liquid must be placed in a container and the working part of the cartridge lowered there.  Soaking is carried out for 24 hours. </li></ol><h2>  How to clean the printer head? </h2><p>  This item is cleaned only using a computer.  In the printer settings displayed on the monitor screen, you need to find the cartridge cleaning function and start the process.  If you could not find it in the settings, then you can start the operation by holding down the cancel button on the printer (often shown as a cross) for some time.  After cleaning, it is best to print a test page to verify that the cartridge is working.  Most likely, if it was a cartridge, then the problem when the printer does not want to print a Word document will be solved. </p><h2>  How to clean the drum of the laser printer? </h2><p>  First of all, you need to turn off the printer.  Next, open the lid and remove the drum (how to do this, see the instructions; this is quite simple).  Then wipe the contaminated area with a damp cloth (it is forbidden to use alcohols and other flammable substances as a humidifier).  After cleaning, put the drum in place and check the printer. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  All the above reasons and actions will certainly help you solve the problem when the printer does not print Word documents.  However, if all the same the attempts were in vain, then most likely the situation is beyond the control of ordinary users, and it is best to give the printer to the service, where it will be repaired or indicated for further actions. </p>
