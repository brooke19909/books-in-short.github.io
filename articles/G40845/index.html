So, it was considered cool to acquire and use <span>thin smartphones.</span>  By 2014, a peak of a similar trend was observed, after which it began to decline.  However, this fact does not mean at all that thin smartphones are no longer in fashion.  There is a certain (and considerable) demand for them at the present time, and mobile phone manufacturers are competing with each other in the art of making their works as subtle as possible.  The British company, which released a smartphone under the name Fly IQ 4516 Octa Tornado Slim, is not far behind.  Actually, this device will be discussed today.  Well, for starters, we will find out how he can please buyers. </p><h2>  Fly Tornado Slim IQ4516 Octa: specifications </h2>

    <p>  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù version 4.4.2 is installed as the operating system on board the device.  This is the so-called KitKat.  As a processor, an aggregate from Mediatek is installed.  A fairly powerful model containing eight cores that can accelerate to a clock frequency of 1.7 gigahertz.  If we talk about the name of the chipset, then this is MT6592.  Of course, it will be worse than ‚ÄúSnapdragon‚Äù, but anyway, at the output we get good performance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The amount of internal RAM is one gigabyte.  Flash memory - 16 GB, but not all is available, due to the fact that some of the operating system itself occupies.  By the way, here we can note the first drawback of the device: it does not support external drives.  The role of the source of battery life is played by a lithium-polymer battery with a capacity of just over two thousand milliamps per hour (2050).  According to the manufacturer, such a capacity allows you to play videos for up to five hours (the same amount of time to surf the Internet), listen to music for up to 50 hours, and also spend eight hours of uninterrupted conversations. </p><p>  The main camera module has a resolution of 8 megapixels.  It is equipped with an auto focus function on the subject.  To create photos in low light conditions, an LED flash is provided.  The front camera is worse, has a resolution of 5 megapixels.  Among the wireless interfaces, one can note the MicroUSB 2.0 port, a Wi-Fi module operating in the b, g, n bands, as well as ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù version 4.0.  Recall that in the fourth-generation cellular networks, the Fly IQ4516 Tornado Slim Octa phone does not work. </p><p>  The screen size is 4.8 inches.  The display matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using Super AMOLED technology.  The picture is displayed on the screen in HD quality (1280 by 720 pixels).  The density of dots is 306 pieces per inch.  Additional screen protection is present, this is Corning <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3. The model provides for the installation of only one SIM card, which must first be processed according to the MicroSIM standard.  If we talk about dimensions and dimensions, then they are: in height - 139.8 millimeters, in width - 67.5, and in thickness - 5.15 mm.  The mass is 95.5 grams.  The dimensions are certainly impressive.  Well, now let's see what features of appearance have the subject of our review today. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  And now a few words about color solutions.  According to official data, the Fly Tornado Slim IQ4516 Octa black smartphone turned out to be the best-selling model.  Well, there is every reason for this.  In general, it is considered that the most sold-out models are those of classic colors - black and white.  However, in a whole series of cases, the first place is occupied by black color.  Why so?  The fact is that sooner or later the device will be covered with fingerprints or even scratches.  But it will be less noticeable on black plastic or metal than on white.  So buyers make their choice in favor of practicality.  By the way, the English name of this model is Fly IQ4516 Tornado Slim Octa Black.  Nevertheless, both color schemes look both nice and worthy. </p><h2>  Convenience </h2>

    <p>  No rejection or discomfort occurs when using the device.  Already at the first tactile contact, you can feel how convenient the device is in your hand, and predict how comfortable it will be to use it in the future.  Specifically, the small thickness of the smartphone can suggest that it looks very, very interesting.  In general, for a hand, the sizes are chosen almost with jewelry accuracy.  And the thickness, by the way, plays an important role here.  Although to call the device miniature is unlikely to succeed.  It is not miniature, namely subtle, do not confuse these two concepts.  Designers decided to paint the metal frame in golden color.  It has recently become quite fashionable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Right side </h2>

    <p>  Here is the Fly IQ4516 Octa Tornado Slim <strong> </strong>  There is, of course, a front camera with a resolution of five megapixels.  Nearby was <span>a proximity sensor,</span> and next to it was a light sensor.  These two components play at first glance invisible, but in fact important roles.  They are responsible for turning off the backlight when the device approaches the ear during a voice call, as well as for automatically changing the screen brightness and backlight level. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  On the opposite side of the Fly IQ4516 Octa Tornado Slim <strong> </strong>  is the main camera module with a resolution of eight megapixels.  Not far from the module is an LED flash, which is useful for shooting in low or low light conditions.  And if there is no lighting at all, it will make it possible to take photographs even in such cases.  By the way, the flash can also be used as a flashlight.  Only for this it will be necessary to install the appropriate software.  Both the back and front panels are covered with third-generation Corning Gorilla Glass protective glass.  Fingerprints are almost invisible, and you can erase them at any time without much difficulty. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The package includes the smartphone itself, a charger for it (comes with a removable USB cable), an instruction manual, and a wired stereo headset.  Here, perhaps, is the entire delivery package of the Fly IQ4516 Tornado Slim Octa, a review of which you can read in this article. </p><h2>  How to create a model? </h2><p>  A lot of time has passed since the first deliveries of the British company to the Russian mobile phone market.  However, only now the company ‚ÄúFly‚Äù decided that it should focus on not just the budget segment, but also on the instant release of individual models that have a twist.  Probably, the company will adhere to a similar concept in the future, but we cannot say for sure.  You can only notice one thing for sure: the manufacturer has already taken the first steps in releasing the Fly Tornado Slim IQ4516 Octa smartphones on the Russian market, reviews of which the reader can find at the end of the article. </p><h2>  Tornado Slim as salvation </h2><p>  In recent years, according to official figures, sales of British devices on the Russian market have plummeted.  Until the end, the reasons for this have not been determined, since there may be at least several dozen factors, but still enough to create a general mess.  Nevertheless, the British company decided to react to such results exclusively in cold blood, operating with sober calculation and ordinary logic.  And as a salvation, the model ‚Äú4516 Tornado Slim‚Äù was created.  By definition, the smartphone was supposed to show that the company adheres to the tactics of the optimal ratio of ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù.  This seems to have happened.  It was previously said that the model was supposed to increase sales due to the presence of a highlight, which was the subtlety of the device.  At that time, the device was the thinnest in the world.  But after a couple of months, the OPPO R5 smartphone was released.  His thickness was 4.85 mm.  Nevertheless, this did not affect the level of sales. </p><h2>  Device Reviews </h2><p>  Fly IQ4516 Octa Tornado Slim does not need to improve the quality of communication.  It works on the device perfectly.  Immediately, so to speak, without departing from the cash register, we distinguish a weak vibration alert.  This is an important drawback.  Although it is observed not only in this model, but also in many other creations of the British manufacturer.  Engineers managed to increase the ringer volume, which is good.  At the same time, she does not cross that thin line, beyond which a moderate bell turns into a chirp.  In general, the golden mean.  From the pockets of outerwear, the device is generally well audible, so nothing bad can be said about this. </p><p>  We will not see anything supernova in terms of technical characteristics.  But at a similar cost (about thirteen thousand rubles), expecting something more is at least illogical.  The bet was clearly made not on technical specifications, but on the features of appearance.  It was foolish to rely on the fact that they completely covered the technical flaws, so the engineers tried to work out as much as possible in order to prevent serious shortcomings.  Nevertheless, competitors even in design can find more than a dozen for this model.  Therefore, decide for yourself whether you need this device. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In general, it turns out that it was the external catchiness that became the basis of the model‚Äôs popularity, since the technical characteristics, although not bad, still cannot stand out from the crowd of competitors with something special.  At the same time, many design features are impossible to find.  A significant role is played only by the small thickness of the case.  But is it worth it to overpay for this device?  It is unlikely, although the question remains open, since each user has an individual opinion. </p>
