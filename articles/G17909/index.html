However, it is with this place that a large number of puzzles are connected, which have no explanation to this day.  Scientists and ordinary people are surprised how one person could build a multi-ton structure without using any technology. </p><p>  The secrets of the Coral Castle in Florida, considered a modern wonder of the world, excite and excite the minds of specialists who tried after the death of the owner of the original structure to repeat his experience, but even the most powerful bulldozers could not budge the limestone slabs.  The grand palace, twice the weight of the famous <span>Cheops pyramid</span> , is not just an architectural monument, but also a unique structure, which the author dedicated to his love. </p><h2>  Who is the author of the masterpiece? </h2><p>  Who is the very talented builder of Coral castle, who admitted that he learned the secrets of the construction of the pyramids using the most primitive tools?  The coral castle in Florida was built by the Latvian Edward Lidskalnin, born in 1887.  He was described as a very thin and ugly person who graduated from all four classes of the school.  The young man weighed no more than 45 kg decided to become a bricklayer and mastered this profession to perfection. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coral castle in florida construction riddles" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1367938.jpg" width="600"></div>

The 16-year-old girl considered that her boyfriend was too old for her, poor and not very pretty.  The heart of the unfortunate mason was smashed to smithereens, and the young man who lost his love left his native land, so that in America he would not be reminded of the one that had caused mental trauma. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coral castle in florida and its secret" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1367941.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The immigrant with poor health had a hard time: for more than ten years he wandered around the cities of the United States, earning a living by hard work.  Lidskalnin, a tuberculosis patient, studies the <span>exact sciences</span> and history of ancient Egypt. </p><h2>  Construction start </h2><p>  Having accumulated on a house in sunny Florida, in the city of Homestead, he begins a large-scale construction project.  A closed man who avoids the eyes of others works only after sunset, erecting a grandiose structure for the sake of his beloved.  The coral castle in Florida, whose history of construction dates back to about twenty years, appeared in the hope that the dear sweetheart would someday come to Edward, and the couple would begin a new period in life. </p><h2>  Riddles of the construction </h2><p>  What is one of the most mysterious buildings on our planet?  The huge blocks of limestone surrounding the courtyard from all sides are perfectly fitted to each other without any mortar and laid exactly like the Egyptian pyramids.  Interestingly, a gigantic door weighing several tons opens very easily - with the help of a finger push.  A block mounted on one rusty pin left from the truck can be opened even by a baby.  Experts do not understand how a self-taught builder who completed several classes was able to find the center of gravity of a powerful slab. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="usa coral castle" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1367939.jpg" width="600"></div>

Inside the castle is a 30-ton Islamic crescent that looks exactly at the North Star. </p><h2>  The real miracle of architecture </h2><p>  Tourists freeze dead at the sight of an architectural miracle, consisting of stone blocks, giants.  The coral castle in Florida resembles a powerful fortress in which real giants live, and giant rocking chairs and tables the size of a car are made for them.  It is not surprising that the neighbors did not see the construction, because the complex of blocks is protected on all sides by two-meter thick walls. </p><p>  Inside the fortress, a two-story tower weighing 243 tons surprises all visitors.  The square building housed Edward's workshop and his living room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coral castle in florida photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1367943.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  Next to the tower is the most accurate telescope in America and a sundial showing time.  Behind the inconspicuous spiral staircase lies an underground pool, causing a real delight for all tourists. </p><h2>  Coral Castle in Florida: the mysteries of construction </h2><p>  Edward himself carried heavy plates from the coast and squeezed blocks out of coral limestone, which severely wounded the craftsman's hands.  He did not even have <span>a jackhammer,</span> and the man made all the tools from automobile parts. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that with the help of a homemade bit he drilled holes and inserted red-hot shock absorbers into them, after which he poured ice water.  Iron increased several times in volume and split the plate into several parts.  But not a single scientist in the world has yet answered the question of interest to everyone about how the master was able to raise stones to a height that exceeded five tons. </p><p>  Surrounding did not see any special devices in the form of tractors.  Neighbors interested in unusual construction asked for a visit, but the man stopped all their attempts to get inside. </p><h2>  Construction in a new place </h2><p>  When an American bought land next to a Latvian to build a multi-storey building, Edward hurriedly leaves his site and moves heavy slabs to another place where construction continues with a vengeance. </p><p>  The neighbors remembered the timid confessions of the sullen Ed that he had unraveled the secrets of the construction of the pyramids in Egypt, but did not attach any importance to this.  The silent hermit did not bother anyone, and the strange eccentric was left alone. </p><h2>  Contemporary Museum for Tourists </h2><p>  The builder himself lived in a small stone cell, which later turned into a museum.  All the working tools of Edward are laid out here, and tourists are surprised at the simple tools with which the Coral Castle (Florida) saw the light.  The photo of the huge complex causes mixed feelings among visitors: someone admires the original architectural work, and most want to know the secret of the construction of an amazing monument. </p><p>  In the museum you can get acquainted with the records of the nugget made during work, but they do not hide any clues.  Experts have found that the Latvian made the main emphasis on magnetic poles and flows of cosmic energy, and many are confident in the application of the theory of <span>torsion fields</span> in practice <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coral castle florida photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1367942.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Is the secret to gravity revealed? </h2><p>  According to one of the authors of the book about Leedskalnin, who built the Coral Castle in Florida (USA), the creator of the architectural masterpiece learned the secret of gravity control.  For many centuries, a version has been circulating that our planet is covered with a huge grid of electromagnetic lines.  Zones of increased and decreased intensity of energy flows affect all living organisms. </p><p>  This proves that our Earth lives by its own rules, and a person only adapts to biorhythms, because where the lines of force cross, the strongest energy of our planet is concentrated.  Based on this version, scientists believe that it is at such an intersection that the Coral Castle in Florida is located. </p><h2>  Hypotheses </h2><p>  There are many hypotheses trying to explain the Coral castle phenomenon.  As a rule, all of them are based on the stories of neighbors who unwittingly witnessed an unusual construction site.  An elderly lady claimed that the silent eccentric sang songs to his plates, making lingering sounds.  Others said they watched through a night vision device as gigantic boulders floated through the air. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ul><li>  Ed who built the Coral Castle in Florida for all the time did not get a family and did not make friends with neighbors.  In 1951, a seriously ill man lay in a cold stone bed and died. </li><li>  Tourists freeze in amazement at the sight of a giant table made in the shape of a heart, in the center of which a rose is carved.  Such a "Valentine" makes you think about the great power of love.  It was she who forced to move forward and constantly work the rejected beloved Edward. </li><li>  After the owner‚Äôs death, a strange device was discovered in the fortress with an incredible amount of metal parts and a David star in the middle.  The device, in which more than 200 magnets were built, resembled a direct current generator. </li><li>  The only photograph where the master is captured with a winch sheds light on the secrets of the construction site.  At the top of the unusual block is a box, the wires from which stretch to the stone.  Most likely, the Latvian acted on coral blocks with the help of electricity, as a result of which heavy plates lost weight. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="secrets of a coral castle in florida" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1367940.jpg" width="391"></div></li><li>  Visitors who have arrived on an excursion to the Coral Castle in Florida, whose photo admires the skill of a brilliant Latvian, often complain of a headache when passing through the vaulted arch of the gate.  This may be another confirmation that the mysterious attraction is located on the site of the source of the strongest magnetic field. </li></ul><h2>  The woman who rejected her lover and his creation </h2><p>  Thirty years after the death of Edward, the love of the life of a Latvian, who turned 83 years old, came to America at the invitation.  Upon learning of the castle, an elderly woman who married a rich man and gave birth to three children, flatly refused to visit the brainchild of a former lover.  Stating that she did not want to hear anything about Edward, the old woman went home. </p>

    <p>  A coral castle in Florida and its secret are of interest to many scientists who conduct various experiments on the territory.  So far, no experiment has given an answer to the question of concern to everyone about how a person was able to build a huge complex of stone slabs. </p><p>  What technologies unknown to the world helped Edward build a home for the giants?  Or maybe love gave him strength? </p>
