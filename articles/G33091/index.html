    <p>  Kamensk-Shakhtinsky is a city in the Rostov Region, located 142 kilometers from Rostov-on-Don and 932 kilometers from Moscow. </p><p>  It got its name from the river flowing nearby (Malaya Kamenka) and the main specialization of the settlement - coal mining in mines.  The population is about 89.5 thousand people. </p><p>  It is interesting that the city has at its base two streets perpendicular to each other (Karl Marx Avenue and Lenin Street), which are located in the directions of the world. </p><p>  Kamensk-Shakhtinsky began his history as a village of Kamenskaya, the first mention of which dates back to 1671.  In the late 1920s, the village was finally renamed first to the city, and then to Kamensk-Shakhtinsky. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the village was occupied, now many sights of the Kamensk-Shakhtinsky Rostov Region are dedicated to its liberators. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Architectural features of the city </h2>

    <p>  The Church of the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary is a small and cozy building with distinctive features: an onion dome, a combination of colors, a bell tower.  The construction began in 1991, and the opening took place 12 years later, in 2003.  Address: 85, Bashkevich Lane. Next to this place in 1914 they wanted to build a church, but in connection with the revolution it was not completed and dismantled.  At the moment, that place is marked by a memorial cross, which is also a landmark of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky. </p><p>  The school building on Karl Marx Avenue, 26 is famous for its rich history, which has more than 130 years.  It housed not only a school, but also a gymnasium, liaison offices, a telegraph.  At one time, important military, cultural and political figures of the country studied there, including M. Grekov, I. Kosonogov, K. Trenev, and a memorial plaque was erected on the building in honor of the latter. </p><h2>  Memorable sights of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky </h2>

They monitored where the enemy‚Äôs battle points and weapons depots were located.  When the Red Army entered Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, the boys told the information about the enemies that they managed to collect, however, due to the fact that there were few Soviet soldiers, they were quickly thrown back out of town, and the Nazis grabbed schoolchildren and shot them in the basement of the building gymnasium number 12 (previously there was a school).  In their honor, in 1967, a monument-stella ‚ÄúHeroes-Pioneers‚Äù was erected, an important attraction of Kamensk-Shakhtinsk.  Address: Arsenalnaya street 2. </p><p>  An unusual monument was the stella dedicated to the dead motorcycle racers, located at the Bike Hotel on 91 Heroes of Pioneers Street. The monument is a 10-meter statue consisting of motorcycles aimed at the sky.  The location of the stella allows it to be seen from the M-4 ‚ÄúDon‚Äù highway, where accidents with motorcycle drivers often occur, it is an unspoken reminder that life is more important than speed. </p><h2>  Where can I go for a walk, learn something interesting or relax? </h2>
