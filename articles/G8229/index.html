Experienced tourists often choose ecologically clean areas where you can not only admire the local attractions, but also relax away from the noisy and gassed city.  If you are also interested in holidays in ecologically clean areas, then you should pay attention to the Lower Tavda, located in the Tyumen region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="t-l.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lower Tavda Fountain" class="if uuid-2684029" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2684029.jpg"></div><h2>  Location and climatic features </h2><p>  Lower Tavda is a small village with a population of just over 7000 people, located near Tyumen.  The climate in this area is moderately cold with high rainfall.  Temperatures range from -25 in winter to +30 in summer.  The most favorable time for a vacation in this region is considered to be summer, although some tourists claim that even in the cold season you can have a great rest. </p><h2>  Sights of Lower Tavda </h2><p>  Despite the small size of the village, there is something to pay attention to.  This is a village with a very rich history, and therefore, it is rich in historical monuments and ancient architecture.  Before arriving in the Lower Tavda of the Tyumen region, you need to prepare in advance a list of attractions that you plan to visit, this will not only save time on their searches, but also carefully plan your route.  Locals believe that coming here and not admiring the following attractions will be a big omission: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Church of the Holy Trinity, erected in 2006.  The style of the church is somewhat reminiscent of a tent building of the 16th century. </li><li>  Monument to the heroes of the Second World War in the form of a memorial stone. </li><li>  Monument to V.I. Lenin, there are a great many of them. </li><li>  Fountain. </li><li>  The local museum of local lore, where you can see not only a large number of ancient household items of the peoples of the North, but also the interior decoration of the courtyard.  This museum is also significant in that its exhibits are located not only in its building, but also in its courtyard. </li><li>  Local registry office with an unusual monument in the form of wedding rings. </li><li>  Foul lake.

But for the vacation to be successful, you need to take care not only of the cultural program, but also of your living.  Of course, you can pitch a tent in some picturesque area, but it is best to rent a house or a hotel room with the same name "Tavda". </p><div class="photo" data-original="han.gorod.tomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Tavda" class="if uuid-2684023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2684023.jpg"></div><p>  Rest on the river bank or a walk around the area is far from the only entertainment in Lower Tavda, as this village has its own indoor pool, dolphinarium, oceanarium and even an aqua park.
