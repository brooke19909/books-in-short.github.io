  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Abolition of serfdom</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Russia, by the mid-19th century, the agrarian-peasant question had become an acute socio-political problem.  Of all the states of Europe, <span>serfdom</span> remained only in it, which created obstacles to social, political, and economic development.  The maintenance of serfdom was associated with the characteristics of the autocracy.  Since the formation of the country and absolutism in it, the government relied solely on the nobles, and therefore had to take all its interests into account. </p><p>  Most public and state figures agreed that serfdom in Russia dishonored the state, classifying it as a backward state.  The topic of peasant liberation was constantly discussed by the public in the late 18th - mid-19th centuries.  The abolition of serfdom occupied the minds of the Slavophiles, Westerners, and Decembrists.  <span>The issue of peasant</span> liberation was raised by some deputies of the Stated Commission - Chuprov, Maslov, Polezhaev.  The abolition of serfdom worried both enlighteners and other radical <span>public figures.</span> </p><p>  By the middle of the 19th century, the factors that caused the destruction of the feudal system were strengthened.  It should be noted that this system has outlived itself mainly from an economic point of view.  Based on the work of serfs, the economy of the landowners fell into decay.  The government was worried about this state, as huge funds were spent on supporting the landlords. </p><p>  The abolition of serfdom was necessary for the country.  In the conditions of peasant dependence, the industrial modernization of the state was difficult.  Serfdom was an obstacle to the accumulation of capital that was invested in production.  In addition, it was very difficult to form a free labor market and increase the <span>purchasing power of</span> the population. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The abolition of serfdom meant giving the peasants personal freedom and general civil rights.  The manifesto was adopted in 1861, February 19th.  According to the new reform, the peasant could enter into transactions, own real estate and movable property, act as a legal entity.  From that moment, people were freed from the care of the landowner, they could marry without his permission.  Peasants were allowed to serve and study, in other classes (bourgeois and merchants). </p><p>  Serfdom was abolished, however, the personal freedom of the peasant was limited.  Mainly, this concerned the preservation of the community.  Bourgeois development in the countryside was hampered by communal ownership of land, <span>mutual responsibility, and</span> allotment boundaries.  The peasants at that time were the only social stratum that paid the <span>poll tax,</span> carried recruiting duties and could be beaten as a punishment. </p><p>  The provisions of the manifesto on the liberation of the peasants regulated their allotment of land.  However, in the process of resolving this issue, the allotments for those released were significantly reduced.  In addition, the farmer had to pay a ransom for the allotment.  Of course, he had no money.  For a one-time landlords to obtain a ransom, the state granted a loan to peasants for 49 years, which amounted to 80% of the value of allotments.  However, in 1906, the peasants achieved the abolition of these redemption payments.  It should be noted that by that time they had given about 2 million rubles, which almost four times exceeds the real market value of land in 1861.  Along with this, peasant payments to the landowner became long-term and gave rise to the so-called temporary-obligated state, which was canceled only in 1881. </p><p>  According to contemporaries, <span>peasant reform</span> was a great event.  The manifesto released more than 30 million people, created the conditions for the economic development of the country at that time.  However, the abolition of serfdom has become a difficult compromise between society and the state. </p>
