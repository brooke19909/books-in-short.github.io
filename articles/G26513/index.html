  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to use Apple Watch: instruction manual</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Smart gadgets have flooded the market long ago.  They have become an integral part of the life of almost every person.  And if at first it seemed that users were paying tribute to fashion, now it is clear that such devices have become assistants for many.  Of course, smart phones are most actively used now, but the clock is not far behind.  How to use Apple Watch? </p><h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  <span>Apple Watch</span> is a smart watch that was developed by Apple.  They are designed to synchronize with the smartphones of the company, so often the owners of the iPhone are available. </p><p>  Of course, the device was originally designed as a watch.  But later it began to acquire a huge number of useful and useless functions.  During its existence, the watch has become so versatile that many do not understand how to use the Apple Watch. </p><h2>  Versions </h2><p>  The first Apple Watch appeared in 2014.  Then it was a simplified version of what we have now.  Although even then they looked solid and stylish.  Since 2016, the company produced annually one modification.  Therefore, by the beginning of 2019, we have Apple Watch 4 - the most advanced model. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  It turned out that it was not easy to understand how to use the Apple Watch.  There are no instructions in Russian as such.  Of course, the kit comes with a booklet that briefly describes how to connect the watch to a smartphone.  On the official website you can find more detailed gadget settings.  But how exactly to use the device: where to click, what to choose and so on - there is nothing like that. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Watch Apple Watch" class="if uuid-3175252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3175252.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, to begin with, you need to figure out what functions the accessory generally offers, in order to later understand what opportunities open up for Apple Watch users. </p><p>  The first feature is watch activity.  Until you look at them, they will be in the off state.  As soon as you look at the display and turn your hand, the screen will light up.  As soon as you expand your hand, the device will immediately turn off the display.  If you need to do this quickly, just cover the screen with your palm. </p><p>  You can type messages from the device.  It is not difficult to do this: since the screen is very small, you need to enter text by voice input.  There is a built-in fitness tracker inside the device.  It takes into account a huge number of parameters and monitors your health. </p><p>  You can also use Siri's virtual assistant.  There is an email client, but it shows letters in a compact form.  There is no web browser in the device, as well as dialing.  In general, the clock is not designed for games, although a couple of puzzles can be installed. </p><h2>  Start </h2><p>  So, you have become the proud owner of any version of the watch.  You need to configure the gadget.  To do this, you must turn on Bluetooth on your smartphone.  Next, connect the watch to recharge.  Now turn them on, holding the wheel on the side.  Next, the gadget will prompt you to select the language to use. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now you need to create a pair between devices.  What do I need to do?  First, open the Apple Watch software on your smartphone.  It will be able to connect to the watch.  The smartphone opens the camera and asks you to point the lens at the Apple Watch display.  It is necessary that the device falls into the yellow square. </p><div class="photo" data-original="time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Work with Apple Watch" class="if uuid-3175254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3175254.jpg"></div><p>  This will synchronize.  You will need to do a simple device setup. </p><h2>  Customization </h2><p>  So, you need to decide which hand you put on your watch.  After that, you need to accept the terms of iTunes, and then use your Apple ID.  Next, you will need to confirm the nearest service centers, agree with Siri, and use diagnostics. </p><p>  How to use Apple Watch?  To do this, you need to set a password for the gadget, and then configure the unlock.  You can choose to simultaneously activate the watch and smartphone. </p><p>  Next, you need to configure the software installation.  For example, you can automatically download versions of applications that are installed on the iPhone to the watch, but at the same time have an analogue for the Apple Watch.  You can also decide for yourself which applications will be loaded into the watch‚Äôs memory. </p><p>  Then the synchronization takes place, and you can start using the devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Device management </h2><p>  How to use Apple Watch?  To do this, just use the side wheel (Digital Crown) and the screen sensor.  Also in management can help the virtual assistant Siri. </p><p>  The button is responsible for the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù option, but it can be configured for different functions.  In the fourth version of the watch, it was redone.  The main innovation was the appearance of a tactile response. </p><p>  Digital Crown is suitable for turning the device on and off.  Thanks to him, you can also call up the Friends menu.  If you press the wheel once, you will return to the main screen, twice to the previously launched application.  Rotate the wheel to zoom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.forbes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Watch Features" class="if uuid-3175255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3175255.jpg"></div><p>  How to use Apple Watch?  You can use the touch screen.  But in this device it is peculiar - it has a technology that allows the screen to understand not only the movement of the fingers, but also the force of their pressing. </p><p>  Finally, Siri performs almost all the familiar options: it calls a specific contact, sends messages, adds an event, etc. </p><p>  By the way, you can control the device settings using the program that is installed on the smartphone. </p><h2>  What is Siri? </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, Siri is a virtual assistant developed by Apple.  It works on almost all devices of the company.  Smart watches were no exception.  How to use Siri on Apple Watch? </p><p>  To start, the virtual assistant must be called.  There are two ways to do this: using the button and voice.  In the first case, just hold the wheel.  In the second, you will need to say the command: "Hello, Siri."  Thus, the virtual assistant will become active, and it can be used. </p><p>  In this case, working with Siri is no different, as if you called it on a laptop or smartphone.  You can ask her for anything that interests you.  The assistant can find the required address, process the contact‚Äôs call, type a message or open the program.  The only thing is that in crowded places you have to put your hand closer to your mouth so that the watch correctly picks up the teams and works with them. </p><h2>  Main screen </h2><p>  How to use Apple Watch 3?  Regardless of the version of the watch, the user starts working with it from the main screen.  From here you can start any application: just click on the icon.  If you scroll the wheel clockwise, you can zoom out and, accordingly, see all the icons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Office Apple Watch" class="if uuid-3175258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3175258.jpg"></div><p>  If, while zooming in, one application remains on the screen, the watch will start it.  You can also move the application icon from the main screen.  To do this, hold it and hold until the rest begin to twitch.  After that, you can move the application anywhere. </p><p>  If it‚Äôs not very convenient for you to configure the location of the icons on your desktop, you can use ‚ÄúMy Clock‚Äù, and then select ‚ÄúLayout on iPhone‚Äù.  Delete programs as well as move them.  Only after activating all the icons you will need to click on the cross that appears, and then confirm the action. </p><h2>  Fast access </h2><p>  How to use Apple Watch 4 fast?  To do this, you can use the option "Preview".  This menu contains all the programs that you most often use.  You can create this list specifically for you.  And there may be several of them at once. </p><p>  What can be added to the Preview?  For example, the most necessary options are often added here: viewing the battery charge, adjusting the sound, controlling the player, etc. </p><p>  Such a menu is very convenient in that you do not need to scroll through the screen, look for necessary applications on it.  All frequently used will be in quick access.  To start the ‚ÄúPreview‚Äù, you need to drag your finger across the screen from bottom to top.  If you need a second list, you will need to continue from left to right or vice versa. </p><h2>  Notifications </h2><p>  How to use notifications in Apple Watch?  The main "chip" of the device, according to many users, can be considered instant notification.  In order to see the message from social networks, now you do not need to go into your pocket or bag behind your smartphone.  The same goes for calls: you immediately see who is calling you, and you can decide whether or not to receive a call without picking up the phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fortune.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Watch Dial" class="if uuid-3175260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3175260.jpg"></div><p>  A red dot will appear at the bottom of the watch screen if you receive a notification or several.  You can click on it to display all the messages.  If you are not interested in notifications, you can delete them by holding the list and then selecting the ‚ÄúClear all‚Äù function. </p><p>  To reject a notification, you can choose one of three ways: click on the wheel, swipe down on the display, or select ‚ÄúClose‚Äù.  If the message you received does not fit the screen in a readable format, you can turn the wheel to zoom out. </p><h2>  Apple Pay Feature </h2><p>  We should also talk about this option.  What it is?  Apple Pay - contactless payment of something.  For example, you can pay for hours or smartphone in a supermarket or restaurant if you have the equipment for all this. </p><p>  How to use Apple Pay on Apple Watch?  The watch should be on hand and tied to your iPhone.  The smartphone must have the appropriate program with the details of your bank card.  Next, you need to attach the clock to the terminal, after which the operation will be successful, and funds will be debited from your bank account. </p><p>  To use the option, you need to run it: double-click on the button on the right, but not on the wheel. </p><h2>  Useful features </h2><p>  Knowing in general terms how to use the Apple Watch 4, you will still find all the new features.  For example, you can take a screenshot on the watch.  To do this, hold the button and simultaneously click on the wheel.  You will hear a distinctive sound, and a flash will appear on the screen for a moment.  Screenshots are stored in the Camera Roll app. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Activity on Apple Watch" class="if uuid-3175261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3175261.jpg"></div><p>  There are quite unusual functions on the device.  How to use the Walkie-Talkie on the Apple Watch?  To do this, your interlocutor should also have a smart watch from Apple.  The option works due to the FaceTime program, and therefore it will have to be configured. </p><p>  It is also worth knowing that the "Walkie Talkie" does not work in every country.  In Ukraine and Russia it can be used, but for Belarus it is not available. </p><p>  In order to start this function, you must select a friend in the Walkie-Talkie and send him an invitation.  After he accepts the invitation, his profile will be active and will turn yellow.  After that, you can begin to communicate. </p><h2>  Features of Apple Watch </h2><p>  As already mentioned, previously ‚Äúsmart‚Äù watches were conceived as a fitness tracker and a regular dial.  Therefore, developers still adhere to a similar strategy, despite the fact that the device has acquired a huge number of additional options. </p><p>  For example, the ECG option appeared in the fourth series of Apple Watch.  How does she work?  It‚Äôs worth saying right away that so far it is available only in the USA, although the developers have promised to distribute it to other countries. </p><p>  The device has a special sensor that reads an electrocardiogram.  Moreover, the results of such diagnostics can immediately notify the user that he should consult a doctor. </p><h2>  Activity </h2><p>  In general, developers are doing everything in their power to save the lives of people in the future, but so far there are no special advancements in this area, although those users who have health problems will use the Apple Watch with pleasure and curiosity.  No less important is the device for athletes. </p><p>  How to use Activity on Apple Watch?  This option allows you to track the amount of time you spend on movement, and also collects statistics for a long period, allowing you to track your physical activity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="updatesviralnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Achievements at Apple Watch" class="if uuid-3175262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3175262.jpg"></div><p>  Before use, you must enter data about yourself.  Later, the watch will notify you of achievements, attaching encouraging and encouraging messages to this. </p><p>  In ‚ÄúActivity‚Äù you can track the ‚ÄúMobility‚Äù ring (calories spent), ‚ÄúExercise‚Äù (time of intense activity), ‚ÄúWarm up‚Äù (the number of hours when you get up from the couch and move for at least a minute). </p><p>  By the way, if you suddenly started a workout, but forgot to indicate it in the watch, the device will determine what exactly you are doing and offer to record activity.  At the same time, the start time of the training will practically coincide with the real one, with a small error. </p><p>  In the evening you can analyze your activity.  A detailed report will appear on the smartphone, which indicates: lost calories, number of steps, distance traveled, exercise time and training.  A pulse in a calm state will also be indicated. </p><h2>  Using Apple Watch </h2><p>  Can I use the Apple Watch without a phone?  Yes, but with one but.  Some users buy this accessory as a standalone device without using an iPhone.  But a smartphone is still needed for initial setup and getting updates.  If you do not want to buy a phone, you can ask for help from friends or relatives who use an Apple smartphone. </p><p>  What can I use without an iPhone?  Without synchronization with a smartphone, the watch copes with showing the time: that is, they perform their direct function.  You can also measure time intervals or set an alarm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wccftech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Watch Menu" class="if uuid-3175264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3175264.jpg"></div><p>  The fitness tracker also works seamlessly, tracking your activity.  You can also set the required load so that the device captures all indicators and signals when this or that goal is achieved. </p><p>  Without the iPhone, the heart rate monitor works, the option "Breathing and relaxation".  Despite the fact that the memory in the watch is only 2 GB, and you can download your favorite music and listen to this volume without a smartphone.  You can use Apple Pay, control Apple TV and Siri. </p>
