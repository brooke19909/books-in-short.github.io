  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who discovered America?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We are taught from school that <span>Christopher Columbus</span> discovered America <span>,</span> and we are used to believing this information.  However, now there are more and more theories, and most importantly - evidence that Europeans visited the New World many centuries earlier.  So, based on the myths and legends of the South American Indians, which feature white-skinned and bearded gods, who sailed in wonderful boats, some scholars conclude that the Romans or Greeks were the first to visit these places.  In favor of the same theory speak tobacco leaves found in the graves of Greece and Egypt.  However, this evidence is clearly not enough. </p><p>  And yet, the question of who discovered America excites and excites the brightest minds of modern scientists.  Increasingly, Phoenician and Celtic writings are found in both Americas.  In the <span>cave paintings they</span> see the trends of various European tribes, and mythology sometimes brings surprises of the same kind.  However, nothing concrete, no dates or names.  In any case, this applies to South America, with North things are somewhat different. </p><p>  Who discovered <span>North America?</span>  Now we can say with confidence that five centuries before the Spaniard, the Vikings landed and even lived for some time on the lands of North America.  Of course, we are not talking about specific dates either, however, with confidence we can say that this happened at the beginning of the second millennium. </p><p>  But things are much better with the identity of the traveler, his name and some facts of his biography are known.  His name was Leif Ayrikson.  His male ancestors, father (Eirik Red) and grandfather, were researchers, and Leif continued the family business.  Eirik the Red is considered the discoverer of Greenland.  He even founded two settlements on its shores, which later became empty, after a sharp <span>change in climate.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Eirikson was born in Iceland, presumably in 970.  As an adult, Leif moved to live in Norway, as he had a desire to serve the king there.  It was a time of the rapid spread of the Christian religion in a northerly direction, and many Norwegians, including Leif Erikson himself, converted to Christianity. </p><p>  However, he did not stay long in Norway, the blood of his ancestors and the spirit of the traveler were invited on the road, and he went after his father to Greenland.  There, he meets another explorer, Bjarni Heriolfson, who was known for his travels to the west.  Leif buys a ship from him and sets off on its route, but for some unknown reason, he takes it a little to the north and, passing several islands, lands on a large land, which struck with its abundance?  Full-flowing rivers were teeming with fish, there was fertile land with a mild climate around, even in winter grass grew here. </p><p>  This winter the Vikings lived on the land they discovered and even founded a small settlement there, and then returned to their homeland and told their compatriots about the country that they named Winland.  Nobody swam more of the Vikings in that direction, as the climate changed dramatically, it became much colder and it became impossible to swim to Winland.  However, a small settlement on the ocean in North America remained in memory of them.  And this also leaves the question of who discovered America open. </p><p>  It is believed that Columbus was going to swim to Asia, and specifically to India.  However, there is evidence that his discovery of America was not at all accidental, and that he knew where he was sailing.  So, when his sailors began to complain about an unnecessarily long journey, he declared that the land would appear after 1000 miles and was right.  In addition, he carried with him a large number of glass beads, which he subsequently successfully exchanged for valuable items. </p><p>  How could the Spanish navigator know where he was sailing?  It is known that before his famous expedition, Columbus sailed to the north and, perhaps, traveled to Iceland.  There he could hear about the voyages of the famous Viking.  Could the Spaniard decide to repeat this journey?  Quite possible.  However, this does not change the essence of the matter. </p><p>  So who was the first to discover America?  The question is really complicated.  It is reasonable to assume that different people from different eras and civilizations have discovered it many times.  They discovered and left their mark in the history of the New World.  And the Old World, oddly enough, changed, albeit not much, under the influence of each such discovery. </p><p>  However, for some scientists, the answer to the question of who discovered America is unequivocal: Columbus.  They cite their arguments and evidence.  However, one peculiarity is worth noting: in favor of the early contacts of Europeans with the new land, traveling scientists who study the situation on the spot, or, like <span>Tour Heyerdahl, who</span> model possible travels across the Atlantic, appear.  As a rule, cabinet theorists speak in favor of the absence of such contacts.  This aspect in no way pleads with the opinion of one or the other, but still makes you think. </p><p>  To ask the question - who discovered America, you can as many as you want, one thing will remain undeniable, it was Columbus who discovered it for Europeans.  It was his expeditions that laid the foundation for the active development of the New World, and in this sense he was the discoverer. </p>
