    <h2>  Beach Reviews </h2><p>  Apk Resort &amp; Spa 3 * does not have its own beach.  Closest to Patong.  This is a place of urban relaxation, and therefore it is always crowded.  The sea is dirty and does not cause much sympathy among many tourists.  You can swim and even need to, but there are other options in the area. </p><p>  So, guests from Thailand from Russia note that they often went to Paradise beach.  It can be reached by transport, the road will take about 10 minutes. But it is much cleaner, while for some reason there are much less Russians there. </p><p>  Very beautiful beaches on the islands.  If you want to see the country and its rich nature, feel free to go on a trip.  By the way, the hotel offers guide services, but they all do not speak Russian.  Tourists are advised not to buy tours from locals, but rather order online through those who understand your language. </p><h2>  Objective opinion </h2><p>  When you read reviews about the hotel Apk Resort &amp; Spa 3 * (Thailand), there are both positive and negative opinions.  Someone was very lucky, and everything went perfectly, someone counted on more, but his expectations were far from reality, someone objectively perceived a three-star service.  In general, the opinions of people were divided.  In this regard, it is worth creating your own objective impression, which can be created only by visiting the hotel personally. </p><p>  But while you save money and pack your bags, we will help you. </p><p>  So.  Why do people go to Thailand?  First of all, for new exotic experiences.  If you are going to spend your vacation lying on a sun lounger near the pool, and animators should dance around you around the clock, then you are not here.  Your path is Egypt or Turkey. </p><p>  Thailand needs to be felt.  Everyone who wants to come here must definitely get acquainted with an extraordinary culture and bewitching tropical forests.  You can‚Äôt spend the whole day in a hotel, on the contrary, you need to come there only to spend the night. </p><p>  So for the overnight stay and hearty breakfast of tourists visiting <span>Thailand, the</span> Apk Resort &amp; Spa 3 * <span>hotel</span> is the best suited.  Comfortable rooms, comfortable clean bed, TV, evening dinner on the balcony with a beautiful view of the hills - what else does a tired <span>tourist</span> need for a <span>day?</span> </p><p>  If you want to get an impression of the country, see as much as possible, choose this three-star hotel.  This is the ideal ratio of quality service and low cost. </p>
