    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, not everything is as smooth in resort hotels as guests would like.  Given the huge flow of tourists, the flaws that may arise in the Kimeros Park Holiday Village 5 * hotel look quite natural.  Reviews in 2016, in addition to positive ones, also have negative ones.  They are as follows: </p><ul><li>  due to a poor-quality mixer, it is quite difficult to regulate not only the temperature, but also the pressure of the water; </li><li>  bed linens are rarely changed; </li><li>  if you live in a room on the ground floor, then be prepared for the fact that your windows will be at the level of human growth, which constantly makes the impression that someone is spying on you; </li><li>  the hotel hosts a disco almost all night, and the sound of loud music makes it difficult to sleep even if your windows are closed; </li><li>  gardeners constantly spray lawns and green spaces with poison from insects, which is why many guests have allergic reactions; </li><li>  in the rooms you can often find ants; </li><li>  pebbles are very large on the beach, and the entry into the sea is too steep; </li><li>  if you arrived at the hotel in the morning, then you most likely will not be able to take advantage of the opportunity of early registration, because all rooms are busy at this time; </li><li>  surely hide all your valuables, money, documents and expensive equipment in a safe, as there are cases of theft in the hotel (even if you complain to the administrator, then most likely this business will not be solved); </li><li>  the maids either deliberately or deliberately bring linen, towels and cosmetics to the room only for the main guests, and you have to constantly remind about the additional guest; </li><li>  the restaurant has a lot of people, besides there are not enough tables; </li><li>  very bad smell in the sauna; </li><li>  You can normally use wireless Internet only at night, when most of the guests are sleeping (or you need to look for less crowded places); </li><li>  there is not enough food for children in the restaurant, because everything is very fatty and spicy; </li><li>  often in the restaurant for dinner they serve those products that guests did not eat at dinner. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  This hotel can be called quite worthy, and the cost of the services provided is consistent with their quality.  Perhaps the most pleasant moment can be considered friendly service.  Russian-speaking administrators are very polite with guests and try to solve all problems that arise as soon as possible.  Nevertheless, if we are talking about such uncomfortable moments as, for example, theft in rooms, then they will all let go of the brakes. </p><p>  The hotel has recently undergone a complete renovation, and therefore everything is new and very beautiful in the rooms and on the territory.  The garden and the pine grove deserve special attention.  Perhaps the only disappointment is the beach.  It is strewn with large pebbles, and the entrance to the sea is too steep, which makes it difficult for children, as well as those guests who do not swim very well. </p>
