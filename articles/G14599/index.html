Several three-story buildings accommodate 912 standard double rooms.  Each building has a cozy patio, in which it is so nice to relax after a hearty dinner. </p><p>  Hotel Dessert Rose Hurghada provides <span>all-inclusive</span> meals <span>,</span> which means "all inclusive."  Indeed, everything - in addition to a variety of dishes from the buffet, you can enjoy a wide selection of soft drinks, tea, coffee and, of course, alcohol.  As elsewhere, only locally made drinks are free, you will have to pay for your favorite Jack Daniel's.  You can try all the drinks offered only with meals or in the hotel bars, they are served exclusively in glasses.  Bottled drinks are charged separately.  The breakfast and lunch menu is quite ordinary, but the dinner is different each time - the hotel holds themed evenings with European, Asian, Mediterranean, <span>Arabic cuisine,</span> you can taste the whole world. </p><p>  The rooms in the hotel are large, well-equipped, have air conditioning, refrigerator, <span>TV, minibar,</span> safe.  Young, smiling maids (mostly males) clean their rooms daily and change bed sheets.  Of course, it would be necessary to leave them a couple of coins for tea, but this will not hit the vacation budget much. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Desert Rose Hurghada Hotel is famous for its huge fenced area.  There is a lot of greenery around the buildings, during the day it‚Äôs just palm trees and bushes trimmed in the shape of animal figures, and in the evening, when the backlight turns on, everything around takes on a mysterious, almost fabulous look.  Paths are laid along the lawns, along which you can wander for a long time, feeding your appetite. </p>

    <p>  Do not be afraid to spoil the figure during a leisurely <span>beach holiday.</span>  Energetic animators are always ready to offer a lot of active classes.  In the morning, pool lessons are held in gymnastics, water aerobics, dance classes, and in the evening those who are not tired will find an exotic show. </p><p>  The ideal location of the Dessert Rose Hotel in Hurghada for a beach holiday - the sea begins just a few meters from the hotel complex.  The hotel even has a special category of club suite rooms with sea views.  The hotel's beach is very large - about 1 km long with an artificial lagoon.  If you went on a winter vacation and the warm <span>southern sea</span> turned out to be cold, don‚Äôt worry, there is a large heated pool in the complex.  In total, the hotel has three swimming pools.  Both on the beach and near the pools there are free sunbeds and umbrellas. </p><p>  The Desert Rose Hurghada Hotel is perfect for families with children.  There is a children's playground with animators, a children's pool and, most importantly, an entrance to the sea with a smooth lowering of the bottom.  Here, little tourists can easily learn to swim, and their parents will be calm for their children. </p><p>  In the sea, very close to the hotel, corals grow.  You can simply snorkel and snorkel, or you can spend some time training, become a real diver and see the famous corals of the Red Sea in all its glory.  Tired of flopping in the water?  Perfectly!  A wide selection of excursions with Russian-speaking guides at your service.  This is not your first time in Egypt and have you already seen everything?  Then do not deny yourself the pleasure of walking through the local shops - souvenir shops and shops are located directly opposite the hotel.  In any case, a vacation at the Desert Rose Hotel is what you need after a hard day at work or when you just want to relax and radically change your environment. </p>
