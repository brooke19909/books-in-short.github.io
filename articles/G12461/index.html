    <h2>  About location </h2><p>  Sochi is a very popular resort for lovers of beauty and nature, and Lazarevskoye is peace and quiet, if necessary, and all the conditions for unrestrained fun, if vacationers want it.  It is close to the mountains and the endless sea, boxwood of evergreen forests, <span>alpine meadows,</span> healing mineral water in the springs, clean beaches, dolmens and water parks - all this attracts tens and even hundreds of thousands of tourists from year to year to the Lazarevsky Sea age and with different preferences.  And no one left here without enthusiastic impressions that remain for a long time, sometimes for life. </p><p>  Hotel "Atlanta" Lazarevskoye recommends vacationers not constrained in funds.  In principle, any vacation can be ruined by the conditions that the hotel or guest house offers.  In this case, the Atlanta Hotel is a good choice, where guests meet almost all of their requirements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is the difference? </h2><p>  Suitable housing, even for a short period of time, must be selected carefully and with full responsibility.  What opportunities do visitors have in Sochi and what is the difference between the proposed options for hotels and guest houses?  In the private sector of the village of Lazarevskoye, ‚ÄúAtlanta‚Äù, for example, is a full-fledged hotel, and its ‚Äúalmost namesake‚Äù - guest house ‚ÄúAtalanta‚Äù (Lazarevskoye as well) is more affordable.  Here you can choose according to your capabilities - comfort or economy. </p><p>  This region is therefore valued for having a variety of options in offering accommodation for visitors on vacation.  Judging by the reviews, it seems to tourists that the Atalanta is an intermediate option, not too expensive, but with its own, rather strict rules.  The service there, of course, is not so good compared to what the Atlanta Hotel has to offer.  In any case, Lazarevskoye is happy with the guests and everyone has the opportunity to offer a feasible housing option, taking into account all preferences.  Everyone is waiting here! </p>

    <h2>  Atlanta (Lazarevskoye) </h2><p>  The location of this hotel is very attractive: a quiet private sector, about half a kilometer to the central beach, near the Nautilus water park, a large market, a beautiful park, and the Center for National Cultures.  This hotel is especially loved by couples with children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The Atlanta Hotel</span> has a completely enclosed inland area, thereby guaranteeing security for residents.  This means that parents can rest peacefully, enjoying the vacation that they have been waiting for so long.  Despite the peace and quiet, the epicenter of the most striking resort events is just around the corner - a few minutes walk, and tourists are already at the carnival of life, without even losing sight of the hotel sign - Atlanta.  Lazarevskoye is not such a big village. </p>

For children, too, there is room and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpleasures - both board and sports games, there are darts and much more.  The entire territory and the hotel itself in Lazarevskoye are carefully guarded, video surveillance is installed, access by outsiders is naturally limited.

    <h2>  Fix health </h2><p>  Once in Lazarevskoye, almost all tourists, even the youngest and not complaining of health, visit mineral springs, whose healing power truly works wonders.  The waters of Chvizhepse, Matsesta, Kudespty literally work miracles with the human body.  In the picturesque Matsesta, people suffering from varicose veins, all kinds of rheumatism and other joint diseases are treated, even diabetes mellitus recedes, albeit temporarily. </p><p>  And the Kudepsta water is truly magical.  It has a high content of iodine and bromine, it is very good to use for people suffering from heart failure.  Even Kudepsty, who are very nervous with water intake, calm down, and not very nervous ones - they simply relax.  Silt mud Sochi is highly recommended for people with diseases of the musculoskeletal system, as well as treat the nervous system.  All the necessary information is provided to guests at the Atlanta Hotel <span>(Lazarevskoye).</span>  <span>Reviews</span> about the excellent results of treatment are very numerous.  In addition, the hotel has a lot of other, very diverse information. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  In this section, you can consider the reviews of tourists who spent their holidays in Lazarevsky, and specifically - in the Atlanta hotel.  The overwhelming majority of positive reviews.  There are also negative ones, apparently, from those living with high demands on the quality of service.  But judging by the rest of the letters left on various sites devoted to vacation by the sea, Atlanta fell in love with tourists. </p><p>  The reason for this is, first of all, the high professional qualities of the staff, their literacy, courtesy and willingness to help in any difficulties.  The administration also always meets the wishes of its customers.  The impeccably correct layout of the hotel itself, its convenient location, and increased safety for vacationers and their children play a huge role.  In addition, a separate convenience is the possibility of booking via the Internet and paying with an electronic card (both making a prepayment and paying off all the amounts required for living).  And the most interesting thing is that the most wonderful entertainment is within walking distance of the hotel! </p>

    <h2>  Guest House </h2><p>  "Atlanta" (Lazarevskoye) is a hotel; at the guest house the name has acquired another letter - "Atalanta".  This is not the name of the US state, but the name of the ancient Greek heroine of various myths associated with Artemis.  Atalanta has a different address: Sochi highway (Lazarevskoye), 2/5.  This guest house is sheltered on the territory of the Chayka camp site, or rather, its branch. </p><p>  The location is also very advantageous.  Nearby are the same water park, many shops, canteens and cafes and a huge shopping complex.  The beach is literally nearby, it is perfectly landscaped, the infrastructure is well developed and every year it is getting better.  On the territory of Atalanta Guesthouse you can visit the cafe with complex meals, swim in the pool and work out in the gym. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Here, of course, it‚Äôs not as chic as in five-star hotels, but there are also many advantages compared to Atlanta.  The most important thing is catering.  If in ‚ÄúAtlanta‚Äù you can cook something unroasted on your own (there is a barbecue corner in the garden, though), and for the most part you can eat where you have to, then ‚ÄúAtalanta‚Äù has its own cafe with three meals a day, where you can order any diet for yourself. </p><p>  In the rooms - in absolutely all - air conditioners, televisions, refrigerators, bathrooms, tables and chairs, cabinets and cabinets.  And all rooms have a balcony in order to view the magnificent surroundings.  There is a transfer from the railway and airport.  There is a laundry room where you can use a washing machine and then an iron.  There is wired and wireless internet.  The reviews about this guest house are the warmest. </p><h2>  Postcryptum </h2><p>  Neither the Atlanta Hotel nor the Atalanta Guest House are among the top ten Lazarevsky hotels.  And even at thirty.  Nevertheless, such a two- or three-star vacation, judging by the description, is not so bad, right?  And all because there is an opportunity to develop the resort business in this region. </p><p>  Today Lazarevskoye is the most famous microdistrict, the largest resort and recreational center of the Black Sea region.  Climate and landscapes contribute to this popularity as nowhere else: humid subtropics with characteristic lush vegetation, smooth pebble beaches, a sea without breakwaters, with constantly exchanging water ... Paradise, and more.  Welcome to Lazarevskoye, dear northerners and residents of central Russia!  Here your longing for the sun will be completely and completely satisfied!  And it is not so important where you settle: Victory Street will it be or Sochi highway, Lazarevskoye will remain in your memory forever! </p>
