For example, Apple is unlikely to succeed in creating a good and inexpensive washing machine, but Samsung or LG can easily do this.  But today we are not talking about these manufacturers, but about Electrolux.  She is from Sweden and produces high-quality and relatively inexpensive household appliances.  Elektrolux has reliable refrigerators, stoves, hoods.  But their washing machines are most interesting, in particular the Electrolux EWT1066EDW washing machine.  We will analyze reviews about it (as well as technical specifications) a little later.  In the meantime, a little talk about the company Electrolux and the history of its formation. </p><h2>  A little bit about the company </h2><p>  The company "Electrolux" was established in Sweden in 1908.  But then it was also called Elektomechanika and was engaged in the production of vacuum cleaners.  During the ubiquitous distribution of electricity, the company cooperated with another Swedish manufacturer, called Lux, who was engaged in the production of gas lamps.  But at the beginning of the 20th century, nobody needed such products.  As a result, the companies launched the first compact vacuum cleaner in tandem.  This baby weighed only 14 kilograms. </p><p>  The full merger took place in 1919.  Since then, the manufacturer began to call himself "Electrolux".  The company launches its first refrigerator in 1928.  And at that time, the unit made a real revolution.  The first washing machine was created in 1959.  It was a real breakthrough.  Since then, Electrolux has become the first company in terms of the production of household appliances.  To this day, the products of the manufacturer are in quite large and steady demand.  A striking example is the Electrolux EWT1066EDW washing machine.  We will begin a review of it right now.  And the first in line will be the design and appearance of the machine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to wash sneakers" class="if uuid-2978792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2978792.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  This washing machine has a vertical load.  Therefore, her design is specific.  Above is a door for loading laundry into the car.  It is devoid of a window and has an integral structure.  Near the door is the control panel of the machine.  There is nothing unusual in it: a round selector for choosing washing modes, an information display for displaying information about work and several buttons.  Concise design. </p><p>  On the front wall (closer to the bottom) there is a hole for removing garbage.  Very convenient location: no need to crawl on the floor to clean the machine if necessary.  The Electrolux EWT1066EDW washing machine itself, reviews of which we will analyze a little later, is made of high quality thick metal and painted white.  The weight of the car is pretty decent.  You cannot bear it alone.  And now let's move on to the more interesting - technical specifications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="slonrekomenduet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine electrolux ewt1066edw instruction" class="if uuid-2978803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2978803.jpg"></div><h2>  Main technical characteristics of the washing machine </h2><p>  So, the characteristics of the Electrolux EWT1066EDW washing machine.  As mentioned above, this machine has a vertical load.  The maximum weight of laundry that can be put in the car is 6 kilograms.  Not so much.  But now few washing machines can boast a much greater ‚Äúpayload‚Äù.  For many, other characteristics are much more important.  For example, the speed of rotation of the drum during the spin cycle.  And here she is not particularly impressive.  Only 1200 rpm.  This spin speed is uncharacteristic for machines of this class.  But, apparently, the company decided to add something budgetary.  Nevertheless, the washing machine boasts a water leakage protection system.  But only the casing is protected from this.  There is also an option to control the level of foam, which is quite somehow exotic.  You can also control the imbalance and the number of revolutions during the spin cycle.  In general, this washing machine has a pretty good set of options.  But about them a little later. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sw19.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine electrolux ewt1066edw price" class="if uuid-2978804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2978804.jpg"></div><h2>  Wash Modes and Advanced Options </h2><p>  And now the most interesting (for housewives).  Washing machine (vertical) Electrolux EWT1066EDW has a large set of washing modes and an intelligent process control system.  So, there is a washing mode for delicate items, a special mode to prevent creasing, a mode for bedding, wool, jeans, sportswear (including shoes), down jackets, jackets and more.  That is, the question of how to wash sneakers in this washing machine will not arise.  There is also the option of prewash, super rinse, quick and economical washing.  And there is also a timer for delaying the start of washing, special modes for shirts, lingerie and curtains, the option of automatically positioning the drum, the ability to select the temperature and the function of smoothly opening the flaps of the drum.  In general, with the set of modes in this washing machine, everything is in order.  What about vibration, power consumption and noise?  About this in the next chapter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine electrolux ewt1066edw manufacturer" class="if uuid-2978807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2978807.jpg"></div><h2>  Power Consumption, Vibration and Noise </h2><p>  The washing machine complies with the energy class A ++.  This means that she "eats" not so much electricity.  Moreover, her power is pretty impressive.  However, the company "Electrolux" cares about efficiency, and therefore their machines with similar power consume much less electricity than competitors.  And this is a proven fact.  And what about the noise level? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is worth noting that in normal operation, the machine erases quite quietly: only 57 dB.  Many competitors are noticeably louder.  The volume of this device increases only if it is gaining momentum for spin.  Then the noise level rises to 73 dB.  Also an acceptable result.  Probably, this result is directly related to the fact that this washing machine has a vertical load.  Such units, as a rule, are less noisy than their "colleagues" with a porthole.  But the vibration of the car is pretty strong.  Although it is not particularly noticeable due to the unique design of the legs.  They dampen all vibrations. </p><p>  So, we continue to consider the Electrolux EWT1066EDW washing machine.  We will analyze reviews about it a little later, but for now we will introduce the closest competitors to this washing machine. </p><h2>  Competitor No. 1. Zanussi ZWY 180 </h2><p>  Good car.  Even supposedly from an Italian brand.  But few people know that in the current realities Zanussi is a subsidiary of Electrolux.  The brand has long redeemed the company.  But this does not prevent her from creating pretty good washing machines.  This Zanussi model also has a vertical load.  The maximum weight of the laundry is the same - 6 kilograms.  But there is no intellectual control.  Also there is no protection against leaks and automatic drum positioning.  What else sets it apart from the Electrolux EWT1066EDW washing machine?  Price.  It costs much less than the original product from the Swedes.  But comparing these two machines is somehow wrong.  Still, one concern. </p><h2>  Competitor No. 2. Ariston ARTF 1047 </h2><p>  Another top-loading machine from a fairly well-known manufacturer.  The maximum mass of linen is 6 kilograms.  There is an intelligent control of washing modes, protection against leaks, automatic drum positioning and the option to delay the start of washing.  But there is no special regime for sportswear and shoes.  Therefore, the question of how to wash sneakers with this washing machine remains open.  In general, ‚ÄúAriston‚Äù and ‚ÄúElectrolux‚Äù have very few differences.  If you do not take into account the price.  Yes, Ariston is an order of magnitude more expensive.  Although it is not clear why.  Apparently, the whole thing is in the brand.  The guys from Ariston clearly value their work more than the engineers of Electrolux. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.avito.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Electrolux washing machine ewt1066edw review" class="if uuid-2978811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2978811.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive user reviews about the washing machine </h2><p>  We continue to consider the Electrolux EWT1066EDW washing machine.  Reviews of the happy owners of this miracle of technology are mostly positive.  For example, users claim that such a machine is capable of wiping anything.  And so it is.  It even has a mode for complex pollution.  Owners also like the fact that the machine neatly handles underwear and bedding.  There is no damage to the delicate tissues and cannot be.  Owners also note the ease of operation of the machine.  Even a child can handle it.  A convenient mode selector allows you to quickly select the desired option.  And the launch of a certain mode is carried out with just one button. </p><p>  Also, users praise the anti-vibration design of the legs of the machine.  Even at maximum speeds in the spin cycle, the vibration is almost imperceptible.  And the car is working very quietly.  Even those who leave negative comments agree with this.  These are the main positive reviews about the Electrolux EWT1066EDW washing machine.  The manufacturer clearly tried to make a quality product.  And he did it very well. </p><div class="photo" data-original="." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Specifications washing machine electrolux ewt1066edw" class="if uuid-2978813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2978813.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative user reviews about the washing machine </h2><p>  Now consider the comments of those who, for some reason, were unsatisfied with this washing machine.  The first thing that users in the Electrolux EWT1066EDW washing machine did not like - the instruction.  She's done pretty clumsy.  Firstly, the Russian language is some kind of curve.  One gets the impression that the text was translated using a translator from Yandex.  Secondly, the process of installing the machine and its use is described in such a way that nothing is understood at all.  In general, for the instructions of the company "Electrolux" fat minus.  Also, many owners complain that the car lacks a built-in voltage rectifier.  The slightest leap - and it turns off.  This is a serious flaw for our latitudes.  Everyone knows how things are going with power surges.  And users are annoyed by the unpleasant odor in the washing machine.  How to get rid of it?  Most likely, this smell is due to the fact that the car is new.  Over time, he himself will disappear.  As soon as the car passes "run-in".  In general, if there are any shortcomings in this washing machine, then they do not deserve special attention, since they are rather small.  The advantage is still much greater. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  So, is it worth recommending this washing machine for purchase?  Definitely worth it.  This is a high-quality, reliable and multi-functional washing machine with a very low energy consumption.  A convenient control panel will help you quickly select the desired washing mode, and the built-in intelligence will prevent the fabric from deteriorating during washing.  Of course, this product has certain disadvantages, but there are still more advantages.  And the disadvantages are not serious enough to pay any attention to them.  By the way, another advantage is the price of the device.  She is quite adequate.  This car can afford a person even with a very modest income.  In general, if it is possible to purchase this high-quality washing machine from Electrolux, then do not miss it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businesswire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine electrolux ewt1066edw reviews" class="if uuid-2978790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2978790.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we presented the information on the Electrolux EWT1066EDW washing machine.  The reviews of those who have already purchased this unit make it clear that the product is of high quality.  At the moment, it is the most reliable and affordable top-loading washing machine in the modern home appliance market.  Competitors have similar models, but they are either not functional enough or have a much higher price.  Therefore, it is the washing machine from Electrolux that has the best price-quality ratio.  Do not miss the chance to purchase a quality and reliable product at an attractive price.  Then you will bite your elbows. </p>
