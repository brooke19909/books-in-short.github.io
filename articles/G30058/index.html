    <h2>  Useful information about the hotel complex </h2><p>  First of all, I want to say that the reviews about Golden Age Bodrum 4 * left by our compatriots contain an abundance of admiring comments about the time spent here.  And this is quite natural, given that the hotel has four stars and is fully consistent with its high status. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel complex is represented by the main building and a group of cottages.  Bungalows were erected in the second half of the nineties of the last century.  The main building belongs to newer buildings; it was built only fourteen years ago.  Despite the fact that the hotel was always proud of the excellent condition of its number of rooms, it was renovated five years ago.  As a result, guests are accommodated in magnificent rooms and can enjoy a pleasant and unobtrusive design. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is approximately ten square meters.  This is enough to accommodate several pools, restaurants and other infrastructure.  Many tourists recommend Golden Age Bodrum 4 * to their friends, largely due to the developed infrastructure that pleases guests with its diversity. </p><h2>  A few words about the location of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Hotel Golden Age Bodrum 4 * refers to the suburban complexes.  However, it is located in close proximity to tourist centers and large villages.  Advertising directories indicate that the location of Golden Age Bodrum 4 * is Bodrum.  However, in reality, there is a distance of twenty kilometers between the hotel and the resort center. </p><p>  The closest to the hotel complex is the village of Yalikavak.  It is necessary to get to it about two kilometers. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the first coastline.  The rooms offer magnificent views of the picturesque Tilkigik Bay.  The water on its beaches is considered the cleanest.  This is confirmed by numerous reviews of Golden Age Bodrum 4 * (Bodrum). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Description of the beach area </h2><p>  The hotel complex has its own beach with a small yellowish sand.  It stretches for almost three hundred meters, which allows you to stay on the beach for a large number of vacationers at the same time. </p><p>  There are cabanas and showers on the coast.  In addition, there are sun loungers on the beach, you can use them for free.

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Photo Golden Age Bodrum Hotel 4 *, posted on the Internet, can not convey the beauty that will surround vacationers throughout the holiday.  On the territory of the hotel complex there are two outdoor pools, near which there are many sun loungers.  Beach towels are available here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the off-season, when the weather does not allow swimming in the fresh air, the indoor pool begins its work.

For those who still prefer to move around the resort independently and freely, free parking is equipped.  There is enough space here even if all the guests will have their own transport. </p><p>  In Golden Age Bodrum 4 * there is an excellent beauty salon where you can quickly put yourself in order and return home noticeably refreshed.  It has several halls that provide spa treatments.  Here you can radically change your image. </p><p>  If you do not want to spend the whole day searching for souvenirs for friends in Bodrum, then keep in mind that you can buy everything you need in a store located directly in the hotel complex. </p><h2>  Free services </h2><p>  Service at Golden Age Bodrum Hotel 4 * is at a high level, so guests have the opportunity to use a large number of free services.  For example, throughout the territory it catches Wi-Fi perfectly.  This is confirmed by many guests who freely communicate with their home via the Internet at any time convenient for them. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned daily, and guests say that the maids do their job well and without a tip.  The linen in the rooms is changed three times a week. </p><p>  Guests have the opportunity to use the safe in the room and at the reception for free.  This greatly facilitates the solution of the problem with the preservation of valuables and money. </p><h2>  Paid services </h2><p>  Laundry and dry cleaning services are available for a small surcharge.

After all, the hotel is located forty kilometers from the main air gate of Turkey. </p><p>  Paid services include massage and water sports.

As shortcomings, tourists called noisy discos, a not-so-convenient location for lovers of constant movements, and not always high-quality plumbing in bathrooms. </p><p>  In general, tourists recommend the Golden Age Bodrum Hotel 4 * (Bodrum) to people who prefer a relaxing holiday.  It will be very good for families with young children, as well as those who are used to entertaining themselves on their own. </p>
