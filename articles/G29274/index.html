  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A sample in a case study. Types, types, features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many sciences that study various processes in society, people's attitudes to certain phenomena and problems, interpersonal and group relationships, use not only the theoretical knowledge accumulated and systematized over the years, but also empirical studies, which are unusually important and significant for more deep study and understanding of many social processes and phenomena.  <span>Empirical sociological</span> research is the fixing, registration of specific social characteristic facts, necessary for understanding and studying certain relations, phenomena and events occurring in society.  It differs from theoretical knowledge in that it does not operate on relative general scientific theories, concepts and categories, but analyzes the ‚Äúliving, real‚Äù behavior of people, their judgments and views, the result of activity.  Such a study is necessary in order to obtain more complete, truthful, reliable and reliable information about the process under study.  Moreover, empirical research is a well-organized scientific procedure, which is built on a specially developed scheme that uses certain technologies, including the organization of a sample for research. </p><p>  In sociology, three main types of information are known: general, local and selective research.  The latter is used most often, since to make it easier, less time and other resources are required.  It is very important to organize the correct selection, since the accuracy and objectivity of the information received will depend on this.  A sample in a sociological study is carried out in such a way that it reflects the trends inherent in the entire population (the population of the city, country, company employees, etc.).  So, the necessary information obtained during a sociological survey of 300-500 people can be extrapolated to the entire population of the city or to all employees of the enterprise, which will allow a different look at the studied social and economic processes in a particular region or society as a whole. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A sample in a sociological study is constructed according to a certain scheme, which should prepare its representativeness, i.e.  the scientific viability, completeness and veracity of the data obtained during the survey, and the possibility of extrapolating them to the general population of people.  The problems of ensuring representativeness are quite complex and are considered by statistics.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the sample in a sociological study provides not only a quantitative representation of the general population (i.e. there should be so many people in the sample that the data obtained from their survey can be disseminated to society as a whole), but also a qualitative representation (i.e., all existing groups whose opinion is important for this study should be represented in it).  Thus, the concept of "sampling" in sociology is considered in two aspects.  Firstly, this is the part of the general population to be studied, and secondly, it is part of the population, the formation of which must satisfy the condition for its representativeness. </p><p>  Distinguish various types of samples.  This may be a spontaneous sample, when people are selected into the group on the principle of voluntariness and accessibility.  Most often, such a survey takes place using postal items and publications in <span>the media.</span>  This is the most economical type of sample, but also the most unreliable, because it least meets the condition of representativeness.  The most commonly used type is random sampling.  In this case, any member of the public may participate in the survey.  Random sampling is made using tables of random numbers, lottery or mechanical selection.  Finally, there is stratified or quota selection.  It is created in stages.  First, a general sample is formed taking into account all the parameters necessary in the study.  Then there is a selection in a sample taking into account these parameters. </p><p>  A sample in a sociological study is also subdivided into a simple one-stage, serial, when the family, social or professional group, etc. are taken as the unit of selection, as well as multi-stage, when the selection of respondents takes place in several stages, for example, industry enterprise - workshop - team, etc. </p><p>  A properly organized sampling, taking into account all the parameters of representativeness, plays a huge role in sociological research.  Indeed, based on the empirical data obtained during the survey, only 10% of respondents can understand the essence of complex processes taking place in society as a whole. </p>
