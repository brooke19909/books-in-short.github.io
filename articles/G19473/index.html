    <h2>  early years </h2><p>  Natalya Ivanovna Sedova was born on April 5, 1882 in the small town of Romny, in Ukraine.  Her parents were wealthy merchants.  Thanks to this, the girl grew in abundance and was able to get a good education.  She even entered the Kharkov <span>Institute of Noble Maidens.</span> </p><p>  However, Natalya Sedova did not study there for long.  The strong-willed temper of the girl often led to the fact that she began to argue with teachers.  She was later convicted of revolutionary beliefs.  Note that the charge was fair.  Natalya Ivanovna repeatedly gave provocative speeches to students.  Moreover, she organized an underground circle, where together with like-minded people she read forbidden literature. </p><p>  Such self-will could not go unpunished.  Soon, all revolutionaries were expelled from the institute - the Russian Empire did not need self-will.  Fortunately, the parents were able to hush up the incident, Natalia was not brought to justice.  However, just in case, the girl was sent to study in France. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Fateful meeting </h2><p>  In Paris, Natalia Sedova studied art history.  She had a craving for beauty since childhood.  Therefore, her parents were not surprised by this choice of her daughter.  Moreover, they were more concerned about her safety than the direction of education. </p><p>  True, Natalya Ivanovna herself did not give up her revolutionary convictions.  Acquainted with the Russian diaspora in France, she meets with Vladimir Ilyich Lenin himself.  Together with him, the girl begins to work on the Iskra newspaper, which later became the real voice of communism. </p><p>  At one of the meetings, she hears fiery speech from the lips of a young man who fascinates everyone around.  It was <span>Trotsky Lev</span> Davidovich.  Then she did not yet know that a series of dizzying changes had come to her life. </p><h2>  New union </h2><p>  Natalia Ivanovna and Lev Davidovich had much in common: they both lived on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcommunism, loved art and spared no energy to achieve their goals.  All this brought them together.  Soon, the girl realized: her heart found its soul mate.  On the same day, she informed her husband that she was leaving him for another. </p><p>  Trotsky immediately accepted Natalia.  It should be noted that officially this couple never married.  <span>Lev Danilovich</span> was a married man, and although he had not lived with his wife for a long time, he did not dare to divorce her.  The reason for this was deep respect.  Still, Alexander Sokolov (Trotsky's first wife) went with him all the circles of hell of political repression. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But Natalya Sedova did not attach any importance to this.  For her, the stamp in the passport was not something important.  The main thing is that the beloved man was always there.  Moreover, they were united by a common idea.  Therefore, without hesitation, she followed him into the fire and into the water. </p>

    <h2>  Saving Cultural Property </h2><p>  Natalya Sedova was a true connoisseur of art.  Therefore, after the October Revolution, she headed one of the departments of the People's Commissariat of Education.  Here she defended the rights of museums and art monuments, preventing the Bolshevik detachments from plundering them. </p><p>  In 1918, Natalya Ivanovna was able to protect Galakhova‚Äôs estate from the vandalism of Denikin‚Äôs army.  Naturally, her main trump card were strong ties.  But the girl‚Äôs mind and determination also played an important role.  For example, she saved the above building only because she attributed the title of museum to it.  Later there really was opened a museum-reading room to them.  Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev. </p>

    <h2>  The fall of the Trotsky family </h2><p>  After the victory of Stalin, Trotsky fell out of favor.  All that was left for him was to leave the country.  However, the new leader of the Soviet Union did not allow him to leave so easily.  He understood that Lev Danilovich was a serious threat to his rule. </p><p>  In 1937, Stalin shoots the youngest son of Natalia Sergey.  The reason for this mundane is treason to the motherland.  In 1938, his older brother Leo perishes.  According to official figures, the reason for this was an unsuccessful operation to remove appendicitis.  But Trotsky himself understood that this was most likely a contract murder. </p><p>  In 1940, the NKVD removed Lev Danilovich himself.  That day, Natalia Sedova was saved by a miracle.  However, in fear, she had to flee to Mexico.  Here she continued the underground struggle against the power of Stalin, but, as you know, this did not lead to anything. </p><p>  In 1960, Sedova returned to France.  Two years later, on December 23, Natalya Ivanovna‚Äôs heart stopped forever.  Close friends took the woman‚Äôs body from Paris and transported it to Mexico City in order to bury with her husband. </p>
