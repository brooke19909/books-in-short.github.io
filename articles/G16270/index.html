Her science, board style, etiquette and architecture were admired far beyond the borders of the state.  No wonder the princes were held in high esteem, and each of the rulers had the honor of friendship and intermarry with them. </p><h2>  The ghostly founder of the city </h2><p>  All words are messages.  The message that ancestors left for future generations.  And the history of ancient Kiev is hidden in its name. </p>

According to legend, it was this family at the end of the 5th century that laid the first stones for the future city.  In honor of the elder brother and named the settlement.  But the opinion of scientists is divided by the veracity of this theory.  The first consider that only Kiy was a real historical figure, and his brothers - the imagination of the people.  The second cast doubt on the existence of even an older brother.  In general, ancient Kiev is not the only city that three brothers built.  Also, more than a hundred other ancient towns with a similar root are scattered in Europe.  Therefore, researchers criticize this concept.

    <h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  Rejecting the myth of Kie, scientists found other explanations.  So, in the Turkic language there is the word “kov”, which translates as “river bank”.  “Kiwi” in Sarmatian dialect means mountains.  There is a very distant version.  According to it, the city took its name from Prakrit <span>(Old Indian language),</span> where the word "koyava" is translated as "place of the throne."  Given that Kiev, the <span>capital of ancient Russia,</span> is located in a mountainous area on the banks of the Dnieper and has been the center of the political elite since its foundation, each of the explanations has a right to exist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most native is the Slavic interpretation.  She leads the name of the city from the word "cue" - that is, a stick, a staff.  Magi and princes owned this item, and each city in which these people were called Kiev was called.  This explains dozens of namesake cities across Europe. </p>

    <h2>  Heart of Russia </h2><p>  In fact, Kievan Rus as a state did not exist.  The term was coined by scientists in order not to get confused between Russia, which formed in the 9th century and the Moscow kingdom, which is five centuries older. </p><p>  At that time, one of the largest states of medieval Europe, whose center was ancient Kiev, was simply called Russia.  The territory was inhabited by Eastern Slavs, who subsequently gave rise to Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians.  Trade has done a lot on the path to establishing statehood.  The country arose on the transport route from Scandinavia along the Dnieper down through the Black Sea to Byzantium.  This road is called "the path from the Varangians to the Greeks." </p><p>  In the middle of the IX century, the Varangian Rurik was called to reign in Novgorod.  This was done for a specific purpose.  The foreigner had to put things in order.  But there are no other reliable sources confirming the words from the "Tale of Bygone Years" (these events are mentioned in the annals).  The representative of the new government came with his people, which was called Russ.  It was from the Varangian that the word "Rus" came from. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  First princes </h2><p>  In 862, those who arrived with Rurik <span>Askold and Deer</span> subjugated ancient Kiev.  According to other sources, these men were descendants of the famous Kiy, who founded the city. </p>

Prince Oleg came to Kiev.  He was from the Rurikovich clan.  After the death of the latter, he became regent with his son Igor and began to reign on Novgorod land.  During his campaigns, he approached Kiev and found out who ruled there.  Then he hid his army and summoned the rulers to him, calling himself a merchant.  Askold and Dir led to the bait and were subsequently executed by Oleg's army.  The regent of Igor noted that they are not of a princely kind, therefore they do not have the right to sit on the throne.

    <p>  Since then, ancient Kiev has become the new capital, thereby combining the two centers of the Slavs.  It is Prince Oleg that scientists consider the ancestor of Kievan Rus. </p><h2>  Pagan culture </h2><p>  Long before the advent of Christian rulers, the lands of Kiev were inhabited by pagans who had their own culture and architecture. </p><p>  Eastern Slavs believed in the forces of nature, idolized them.  The places of worship became energy points where strong mystical energies were felt.  As a rule, these were hills.  Our ancestors arranged temples on them.  This was the first architecture of ancient Kiev.  Usually in the center stood a figure of a wooden or stone idol.  There was an altar to which believers offered gifts.  Such temples were found on Annunciation Mountain, which was a holy place for the god of lightning Perun. </p>

In the hills, they prayed and made sacrifices.  Until now, places of worship have been preserved in Kiev.  Usually this is a stone circle with protrusions on the four cardinal points.  At the same time, the temples were political centers where important issues were resolved.  The general geographical map of ancient Kiev reveals all places of worship of the Old Believers.  Each mountain was the center of the ritual of sacrifice.

    <p>  There are allegations that the Gentiles built temples several years before the adoption of Christianity. </p><h2>  The pearl of Christianity </h2><p>  With the advent of the princes, Christianity became popular.

    <h2>  Modern Kiev architecture </h2><p>  The history of ancient Kiev has been preserved in architecture to this day.  The most striking example is St. Sophia Cathedral.  The first stones were laid in 1037.  Constantinople and Slavic architects worked on it.  In the XVII-XVIII centuries, the cathedral was rebuilt in the style of Ukrainian Baroque.  In 1934 it became a museum - Sofia Reserve. </p><p>  Scientists are still arguing about who was the initiator of the idea of ​​building a temple - Vladimir or his son Yaroslav. </p>
