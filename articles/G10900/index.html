Decoration for the Christmas tree and not only</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The wonderful creation of heaven - an angel, a mythological creature, especially touching and good - is one of the main symbols of Christmas.  But not only the Christmas holidays, we owe the presence of this image in our lives.  Extraordinary purity, childish naivety and mischief, as well as a bright divine principle, are always associated with a winged sweet creature.  This image was created by painters, sculptors and puppeteers.  This is one of the most popular and sought after mythological characters in art. </p><p>  On the Christmas tree, the angel is the place.  An angel made of beads, made with the children, will be a wonderful decoration for the Christmas holiday.  It can be done in different ways.  An angel made of beads can be voluminous, woven from beads, beads and wire.  Perfect for making toys with beadwork.  Angels embroidered on a plastic canvas decorate not only Christmas tree branches, but also the front door or window glass.  There are many tricks and methods for weaving toys.  We will describe one, quite simple, but spectacular. </p><p>  How to make an angel from beads </p><p>  The average height of each angel is 5-6 cm, but you can make it bigger and higher.  The main thing is to master the weaving technique, and then you can safely experiment, add some details and increase the size. </p><p>  To work, you need one large pearl bead with a diameter of at least 1 cm, white, pale pink, pale blue and gold beads, very thin wire and a silk twisted cord for making hair. </p><p>  An angel dress is woven in a parallel connection of rows of beads.  18 beads are collected on a wire 150 cm long, distributed in the center, and rows of beads are knitted sequentially, passing both ends of the wire through them.  In each subsequent row, the amount of beads is reduced by 1 pc.  After two things remain on the wire, they begin to increase by 1 beads in each row, bringing it to 18 pcs.  Then, on the sides of the finished dress, connect the wire and straighten it, giving the shape of a cone. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The silk cord is cut into pieces of 10 cm. Unwind the threads and comb with a thick needle.  A bundle of prepared threads is perpendicularly laid in the center of a length of 70 cm wire. The wire is twisted, bent in half.  The threads are thus fixed in the form of a brush.  Both ends of the wire are inserted into a large pearl bead, and then the bead is attached to the top of the dress cone.  The hair is straightened and distributed over the head.  The long ends of the wire are passed near the neck of the dress and weave the angel‚Äôs hands, stringing several rows of beads. </p><p>  The wings of the angel also perform parallel weaving of gold beads in the form of two large petals.  They begin to weave with two beads, increasing the number of beads in each row.  When the wire has a row of 15-16 beads, knitting starts in the opposite direction, gradually reducing the number of beads in a row.  The ends of the wire wings are attached on the back of the angel to the dress. </p><p>  An embroidered bead angel is also a wonderful Christmas decoration.  For work, you will need to take a plastic canvas (it can be found in online stores for needlework) and any pattern for cross-stitch depicting an angel.  Embroider the pattern with beads along the canvas, glue a piece of silk or satin fabric on the opposite side with PVA glue, and then carefully cut the canvas with the embroidered pattern along the <span>contours of the pattern,</span> but so that the extreme beads do not crumble.  An bead angel embroidered on a plastic canvas will decorate the Christmas tree or the front door if a small eyelet is sewn to it. </p><p>  Making decorations for the Christmas tree with the children is the beginning of pleasant festive efforts, giving joyful, ‚Äúmagical‚Äù moments.  Each handmade <span>Christmas decoration</span> is also an occasion for warm memories associated with this amazing holiday. </p>
