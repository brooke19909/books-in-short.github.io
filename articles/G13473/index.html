  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY toilet paper holder: some interesting options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As calculated by scientists, a person spends a lot of his life in the toilet.  Therefore, many try to decorate this part of the living space in a special way.  Some do in the toilet shelves for magazines and books, so as not to waste time in vain, install wall or floor figurines of your favorite characters, indoor flowers.  One of the important accessories of the toilet room is a paper holder. </p><p>  There are not many options for such products on sale.  This is either cheap plastic products, or more expensive stainless steel items.  Very banal and boring.  But a person who has imagination and loves to create coziness in an apartment can easily make a unique toilet paper holder with his own hands, especially since it is absolutely not difficult.  You do not need to have special skills in order to assemble such an craft from improvised means.  Any material at hand can be used. </p><p>  In the article, we will look at how you can make a toilet paper holder with your own hands from shreds of fabric left after sewing a dress, from plastic or metal pipes lying in a closet, an ordinary rope or wood.  Samples of such products, presented in the photographs in the article, will help to do the craft on their own at home.  All the crafts are quite simple, so both the young housewife and the man will cope with the work.  The main thing is the desire to make the toilet paper holder unique and to create a cozy atmosphere with your own hands even in the toilet. </p><h2>  Fabric option </h2><p>  If you have a sewing machine at home, it‚Äôs very easy to sew such a cute owl.  It is enough to take a small strip of fabric and shreds of different colors for the application of an owl.  You do not need to be an artist to draw a pattern with elongated "ears" and to connect different fabrics together with internal seams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.cl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Toilet tissue holder" class="if uuid-3132573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3132573.jpg"></div><p>  Eyes need to be cut from felt sheets of three different colors.  The bow is folded from a strip of fabric and pulled in the center by a small segment.  The toilet paper holder should fit the roll freely.  A fabric loop is sewn on top of the craft so that it can be hung on a hook.  This option is the most hygienic of those presented, since the fabric covers the entire surface of the paper, and dust does not sit on it.  In addition, such an owl will surely appeal to children. </p><h2>  Crafts from pipes </h2><p>  You can make an DIY toilet paper holder in an industrial style.  For this purpose, you can use both metal pipes with swivel fittings, as well as modern plastic plumbing products.  To carry out such a holder, it is enough to take three pieces of an even pipe, two elbows and a tee for attaching to the wall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crafts from pipes" class="if uuid-3132575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3132575.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs much easier to work with plastic, but the metal looks more solid.  It can be painted in any color, which can not be done with plastic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The holder for giving </h2><p>  An original holder made of an ordinary branched branch fits perfectly into the interior of a wooden toilet in a summer cottage.  Choose a suitable trunk of the old tree and saw off a piece of wood with a strong branch sticking out to the side.  Treat the opposite side with a planer or cut with a jigsaw.  You can not remove the bark, but be sure to process all the saw cuts with sandpaper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Branch holder" class="if uuid-3132585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3132585.jpg"></div><p>  Coat the surface with acrylic varnish at least twice and nail or screw to the wall paneling.  You can draw a shelf from the top of a tree saw cut, for example, for a decorative candle. </p><h2>  Marine Theme </h2><p>  It is easy to make a rope holder, but you will need a fairly thick twine for the main part, two thin ropes for tying along the edges of the trimmed ends and attaching to carabiners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper rope holder" class="if uuid-3132587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3132587.jpg"></div><p>  An ordinary metal hook is attached to the wall and two carabiners are fastened on it, holding the rope.  Usually such a rope is used in the fleet, so if a sailor lives in your family, you can arrange an original surprise for him by making a toilet paper holder from a thick ship rope.  This will cause nostalgia and pleasant memories of working on a ship. </p><h2>  DIY wooden toilet paper holder </h2><p>  To make an interior item, as in the photo below, it is enough to purchase one small board of pine or spruce.  This is cheap wood that is easy to work with.  Use the electric jigsaw to give the structural parts the necessary shape.  When the shelf for magazines and toilet paper is twisted with screws, you need to process it with sandpaper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wooden shelf with paper holder" class="if uuid-3132593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3132593.jpg"></div><p>  The shelf can be painted in any color with acrylics or opened with varnish, aged with a metal brush or rubbed with wax.  The cylindrical stick for the paper roll is made removable.  To place it on opposite walls of the product, arcuate recesses are attached.  Now you know how to make a DIY toilet paper holder.  A step-by-step description of the work will help you create an original craft quickly and easily. </p>
