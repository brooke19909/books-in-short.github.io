Every tourist can find here a wide variety of activities and entertainment.  Rest on crystal clear lakes, rafting on fleeting rivers, a peaceful and relaxing holiday in sanatoriums, conquering mountain peaks - which Bashkiria will not offer you!  Inzer, Belaya, Sim, Yuryuzan are unique rivers through which you can take unforgettable walks and enjoy the delightful virgin nature of the region.  No wonder this republic is called the pearl of the Urals and is often compared with Switzerland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bashkiria Inzer" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/482233.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Natural resources of Bashkiria </h2><p>  This region is characterized by amazing natural landscapes, historical monuments, a multinational population and rich cultural traditions.  The natural resources of Bashkiria are impressive: approximately 600 rivers, 300 ancient karst caves, 800 lakes, a myriad of mountain ranges, a national park and 3 state reserves.  Of course, compared with the highly developed Switzerland, the tourist infrastructure has not yet reached impeccable comfort and service, but this industry is now actively developing: there are more and more new hotels, recreation centers, hotels, tourist campsites.  In addition, the old complexes for vacationers also begin to be restored and reopened.  In short, tourism is gaining a second life here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Inzer River in Bashkiria </h2><p>  Perhaps the most famous mountain river in the republic is Inzer.  However, an easily accessible reservoir pays a high price for popularity.  Hundreds of travelers annually rest on its shores, but not all leave the clearing in their pure and pristine state.  Throughout the Inzer, you can see hundreds of parking lots littered with heaps of garbage and dirt. </p><p>  But how attractive Bashkiria is!  Inzer is one of the many rivers in the region.  On a warm summer day, it is so pleasant to dive with spinning along the Inzersky rifts and reaches, listen to the rustle of waves, inhale the smells of forest and water ... </p><p>  The sources of the Small and Big Inzer are shared by the highest mountain ranges of the Southern Urals: the Kumardak, Mashak ridges and its main peak - Mount Yamantau.  To meet each other, each of the rivers goes through a rather winding and difficult path.  The Big Inzer originates on the southeastern slopes of the Kumardak ridge and flows southwest along the deserted wastelands of the South Ural Reserve.  Small Inzer descends from the eastern slope of the Nara massif, and then briskly runs in the same direction, but on the other side of the giant Yamantau.  Having passed a difficult route of a couple of hundred kilometers, both rivers merge into one beautiful stormy stream, which the whole of Bashkiria is so proud of - Inzer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lakes of Bashkiria for rest" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/482234.jpg" width="600"></div>

This route is also convenient because it runs along the railway tracks, and if desired, it can be completed at any point.  The Bolshoi Inzer River does not differ in full flow, so you can swim only at a sufficiently high water level.  The same can be said of the Small Inzer - rafting is possible here only during the spring flood. </p><p>  It is better to start rafting along the Inzer from the Kurmanai railway station to the Saryshta riffle (40 km long).  This can be said the wildest part of the journey.  The valley of the Big Inzer River is quite narrow, and the course is surprisingly fast.  There are many pitfalls and surface boulders.  In addition, steep cliffs block the path from time to time.  In such areas, it seems that the kayak is about to crash ... True, 20-25 meters from the cliffs the river flow makes a significant turn, which sometimes reaches 180¬∫.  Then the vessel rushes on, barely touching the bend of granite rocks.  Sometimes the mountains are a couple of tens of kilometers away from the water, and magnificent views are opened to the eye.  There are endless meadows with tall (up to 2 meters!) Grass.  There is simply no one to mow it: settlements in this region are simply absent. </p>

    <h2>  Second phase </h2><p>  Further, an exciting water trip can be continued through the village of Zapan.  After about 25 km, the village of Suran will be.  5 km from the Saryshta pass there is a non-residential Seregin farm, where there is a water meter post.  After the farm, the Inzer Valley narrows even further.  From the north, Mount Karatash comes close to the river, and from the south - the peak of Yurmatau.  On this site, the longest roll of Saryshta begins, with a length of approximately 6 km. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the junction quite awkward to tourists Inzer.  Holidays in these places are chosen by many lovers of extreme relaxation, but if you decide to join the fight against a dangerous roll, we want to immediately warn that it will be very difficult.  Many trials await you: waves, foamy breakers, a large number of stones.  And in general, in the Saryshty region, the Inzer flow is much faster.  Overcoming the tumult, of course, will take you a lot of energy, however, without a doubt, reward with unprecedented feelings and emotions.  At the same time, it is worth noting that in summer this area usually becomes shallow and becomes almost impassable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Inzer River in Bashkiria" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/482244.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Last section </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, many Russian citizens and even foreigners are attracted to Bashkiria.  Inzer is a real natural heritage of the region.  After the rolling of Sarysht, the neighborhood slowly changes its scenery.  Majestic cliffs rise above the water, riffles rustle, and the current becomes faster.  Narrow paths and endless forests can be seen along the coast. </p><p>  The nearest village from here is the village of Enaul, which is 65 km away.  Not far from it is an amazing cave.  The entrance to it is so narrow and low that you can only get inside by crawling.  After 10 meters, the course expands, and guests of the cave fall into a large hall with <span>stalagmites and stalactites.</span>  At the end of the cave is a surprisingly beautiful lake.  In the cave, by the way, there are many unexplored corridors. </p><h2>  Difficult threshold </h2><p>  15 km lower is the village of Ramyshta, next to which stands a majestic steep cliff.  In the river on this segment there are many stones.  Aigir threshold is a significant obstacle for rafting, which is classified by the third category of difficulty, so only well-trained athletes will be able to overcome this section, for beginners it is better not to plan a trip on this segment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Inzer recreation center" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/482245.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Other rivers </h2><p>  Reservoirs of the republic are hundreds of water bodies.  Travelers have the opportunity to make rafting on the rivers of Bashkiria, and at the same time strengthen their health.  Many, for example, prefer boat trips along the picturesque Belaya River.  Such tours are performed on rafts (inflatable boats), which are reliable and stable.  The vessel can accommodate from 6 to 12 people.  At each parking lot you can relax, eat and go on an excursion. </p><p>  Local guides can show you places of amazing beauty, tell fascinating legends and familiarize themselves with the customs of the local people.  Often rafting along the rivers of Bashkiria is carried out in warm time (May-October).  For safety reasons, alloys are conducted by experienced instructors. </p><p>  Tourists can choose boat trips along the rivers Lemese, Sakmara, Yuryuzani and others.  All of these rivers are mountainous, therefore, they are distinguished by an impressive flow rate.  You can choose a calmer river Ay, where there are almost no difficult rapids.  To retire to nature, choose a rafting on <span>the Zilim River,</span> on its banks there are almost no settlements. </p><h2>  Lakes of Bashkiria for rest </h2>

    <p>  In Ufa there is a picturesque lake Kashkadan, which has a natural origin.  In the summer, townspeople and guests of the <span>capital of Bashkiria</span> like to spend time here <span>.</span> </p><p>  In the Karmaskalinsky area, near the village of Old Kieshki (40 km from Ufa), there is Lake Aksakovskoye.  This body of water is the old woman <span>of the Agidel River.</span>  In spring, the lake overflows and connects to the canal. </p><p>  The landscapes of <span>Lake Arakul are</span> magnificent <span>.</span>  It is in the frame of the forest and mountains, and its water sparkles like an emerald.  Back in 1969, Arakul was declared a natural monument. </p><p>  We continue to talk about the lakes of Bashkiria for recreation.  The largest lake of the republic is Asyl-Kul.  It lurks 30 km from the town of Davlekanovo.  In addition, it is also the deepest lake in the region.  Salt predominates in the lake, because of this, the water here is slightly brackish.  On Asyl-Kul you can see snow-white swans.  To preserve the unique fauna and flora, any water-motor sports in the pond are prohibited. </p><p>  In the arms of the majestic mountains lies Lake Bannoe.  The most favorable conditions for rest and treatment have been created here: magnificent sanatoriums, aromas of healing herbs and needles floating in the air, many mushrooms and berries. </p><p>  In addition, travelers can visit the following lakes of the republic: Barskoe, Beloe, Bolshoi Uchaly, Vorozheich, Kandry-Kul, Kulyashka, Sarva, Melnichnoe, Talkas, Muldak-Kul (Solenoye), Urgun, Shulgan and many others. </p><h2>  Waterfalls </h2><p>  The natural wealth of Bashkiria simply can not be counted.  In addition to mountains, rivers, caves and lakes, in the region you can find many waterfalls.  True, they are not as tall as in the North Caucasus, but they are unrivaled in their beauty. </p><p>  The largest waterfall in the republic is Gadelsha Falls (about 15 meters high), not far from Sibay.  One of the most popular with tourists is <span>the Atysh waterfall</span> (4 meters).  Near it is the Bear Cave.  Near the <span>Nugush reservoir</span> there is <span>Kuperlya</span> <span>waterfall</span> (15 meters), which completely dries out in the summer. </p><p>  There are also small waterfalls.  For example, Inzer Falls is considered very picturesque.  True, it is difficult to call it a waterfall in the classical sense, since in reality it is a spring descending from a cliff. </p><p>  Near Lake Aslukul you can meet the Sharlama waterfall, whose height is 12 meters.  Around it are only mountains, small hills and a vast steppe. </p><h2>  Regional tourism </h2>

If you wish, you can improve your health in the sanatoriums of the republic.  Many travelers prefer to stop by the Inzer River.  A recreation center, private sector or tent - whatever you prefer, a trip to these places promises to be fascinating.  You can strengthen your health, for example, in the sanatoriums "Assy" or "Yakty-Kul."  For a comfortable stay, tourists prefer to choose the Arsky Stone, Zaryanka, Spruce, Sosnovy Bor and others.

    <h2>  Treasures of pristine nature </h2><p>  How magnificent Bashkiria is!  Inzer, other rivers and lakes, magnificent mountain ranges, clean air - all this, of course, attracts a large flow of tourists.  You can do almost any sport here: water, hiking, skiing, cycling, etc. Many experts say that tourism in the republic has very good prospects.  If this region develops in the same vein, in a couple of years many Russians will prefer Bashkiria rather than European resorts.  And while there is still no big influx of tourists in the republic, rather look for Inzer on the map and go on an exciting journey. </p>
