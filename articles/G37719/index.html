Trips to the Northern capital are always in demand at travel agencies, especially this interest increases with the start of summer vacations.  Naturally, almost all tourists want to book a hotel in the center so that they can easily reach the historical part of the city and be able to even visit its sights on foot.  Therefore, hotels in the center of St. Petersburg are always in great demand.  However, despite the fact that their choice is diverse, it is very difficult to find the right one.  Indeed, some vacationers need apartments with a kitchen, others prefer the most popular hotel complexes, and still others seek to book a room in the cheapest hotel possible.  It is almost impossible for an ordinary tourist to figure this out on their own.  Therefore, we prepared a review of hotels in the center of St. Petersburg, which will help readers to navigate in their diversity. </p><h2>  A few words about the advantages of hotel complexes in the center </h2><p>  If you are planning a vacation in St. Petersburg, hotels in the city center will give you ample opportunities to explore the sights.  Usually the rest is limited to a few days, so I do not want to waste time traveling around the city by public transport in order to get to one place or another.  In addition, in the center of the Northern capital there are many cafes and restaurants.  Therefore, tourists will not have problems finding a suitable place.  Many catering establishments in the historical part of the city have a unique atmosphere, which plunges into the past of the cultural capital and gives the vacation an unforgettable flavor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many tourists note that the hotels in the center of St. Petersburg are very close to the railway station and airport.  On average, the distance between these points on public transport can be covered in one hour.  Using a taxi, the trip time will be significantly reduced. </p><p>  The indisputable advantage of hotels in the center of St. Petersburg is their great variety.  If desired, tourists can pick up inexpensive complexes, hotels with rooms with a dedicated kitchen area, hotels for honeymooners and so on.  Therefore, if you spend a little time searching for a suitable option, then you will remember the time spent in St. Petersburg for a long time. </p><p>  In our review, we tried to consider the most popular types of hotels in the city center (St. Petersburg): </p><ul><li>  Hotels belonging to the category of "mini". </li><li>  Apartments. </li><li>  Hourly hotels in the center of St. Petersburg. </li><li>  Complexes for the newlyweds. </li><li>  Cheap hotels in the city center (St. Petersburg). </li></ul><p>  For each item on the list, we selected several options for hotel complexes, so that our readers had a wider choice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.buro247.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel complexes of St.  Petersburg" class="if uuid-2563475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2563475.jpg"></div><h2>  Mini-hotels in the center of St. Petersburg </h2><p>  A similar option for accommodating guests appeared relatively recently, but has already managed to gain immense popularity among tourists.

Often these hotels are located in large business centers in order to increase their accessibility and attractiveness for guests. </p><p>  The most convenient places, according to tourists, for the location of a mini-hotel in the center of St. Petersburg are Nevsky Prospekt, the Sennaya Ploshchad and Vladimirskaya metro stations, as well as the Moskovsky Station area. </p><p>  Those who first stay in such hotels always note with surprise how well they combine a high level of service with almost home coziness and comfort.  And this is quite natural, because hotels of this type have a gradation not only in the number of rooms in them, but also in terms of service.
