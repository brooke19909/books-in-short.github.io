    <p>  A special delight of the guests is caused by a large beautiful balcony (approximately 20-25 sq. M.).  According to reviews, you can have a wonderful time at the table with a glass of your favorite drink on the balcony.  Some guests dine there. </p><p>  Residents note that some of the things and appliances in the rooms are quite old and work intermittently.  The minuses include the presence of cockroaches in some rooms (huge, about 2-2.5 cm long and 1 cm wide).  There are also ants. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Guests have no complaints about food.  I like everything very much.  Usually, a large selection of dishes is provided to vacationers, no one leaves hungry. </p><p>  Breakfast usually includes: oatmeal porridge (very tasty, according to reviews), boiled eggs, fried eggs, talkers, sausages, bacon, fried zucchini / eggplant, rustic potatoes or french beans in tomato sauce, yogurt (2 types), salad of fresh cucumbers, carrots and other vegetables, cereal (2 types), milk, bread for toast, spread, jam (4 types), fruits (mainly grapefruits and oranges) jelly, cheese. </p><p>  For dinner: meat (lamb, chicken, pork), fish, potatoes, vegetables in different preparations (fried zucchini / eggplant, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, corn, carrots), rice / pasta, fresh vegetable salads, salad a- Russian, yogurt, cottage cheese with mar.  cucumbers.  Several types of <span>fruits (guava,</span> oranges, bananas, grapes, grapefruits) for dessert (puff pastries with custard, biscuits). </p><h2>  About location </h2><p>  The hotel is very well located in relation to the beaches, vacationers share.  To go to one beach for about 3-5 minutes in an unhurried step, to another - 25 minutes.  Some tourists consider the minus (albeit insignificant) of the beach closest to the hotel that it is located in a bay in which keys are beaten, which cool the water during the night.  By lunchtime, the water temperature in the bay is compared to sea temperature.  The distant <span>beach (Konos Beach)</span> has many advantages, vacationers say that it is evenly warm azure water, white sand, facilities and comfort (locker rooms, toilets).  There is also a cafe where you can eat.  The minus guests consider the relative distance of the beach (inconvenient for parents with small children or older people). </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Guests consider the service good: the staff responds to complaints very quickly, quickly resolves any issues.  Employees will always give advice on where to go, how best to go somewhere, where to buy something, etc. They clean the rooms here every day, except Sunday and Thursday.  The bed is changed every 10 days.  Towels are changed 2-3 times for the entire tour.  Workers do not allow themselves to take anything without demand in the room.  The hotel never disappears. </p>

    <h2>  Contingent </h2><p>  Many reviewers are outraged by the behavior of some Russian tourists.  During dinner, vacationers take the dining room by storm, in the first place they lay mountains of fruits and sweets on the plates, without worrying that someone will not get these products. </p><p>  Hotel guests say that by seven or eight in the dining room there are no longer any queues and you can freely treat yourself to whatever you want. </p><h2>  Animation </h2><p>  According to reviews, there is no animation at the Paramount Hotel.  Twice a week (Mondays and Thursdays), singers perform.  For those who are inclined to be bored without entertainment, tourists are advised not to sit in one place, and so that time passes quickly, to go for a walk after dinner in Ayia Napa or the center of Protaras. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Tourists call vacation in Protaras wonderful, admire the warm transparent sea, good weather (during the day: + 28-29 degrees, and at night: + 18-20 degrees), which allows you to refuse to use the air conditioner at night.  Vacationers call the many advantages of the Paramount hotel: friendly, helpful Russian-speaking staff, good food, convenient location, quality cleaning of rooms.  Among the minuses are indicated: the presence of insects, old appliances and furniture, the high cost of the Internet, the lack of animation. </p><p>  Guests believe that the Paramount Hotel Apts 3 * Superior <span>(Cyprus, Protaras) has</span> all the conditions for a great pastime of tourists, and recommend it as a good option for a vacation. </p>
