Turkey, hotels "5 stars" - photos, prices and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Why among our compatriots it became popular to spend holidays in Turkey?  Probably because this country is washed by several seas at once, and excellent resort towns are located on their coast, with many attractions and attractions, as well as a well-developed infrastructure.  The shores of the sea themselves are picturesque mountains covered with eternal greenery of pines and cedars.  And besides, there you can not find the amazing beauty of the bays with long beaches - both with sand and pebbles.  It is good to go here to families with children, young people who like to hang out at nightclubs and discos, as well as lovers of ancient history.  After all, Turkey is simply "stuffed" with antique ruins and architectural monuments.  And along the coast, hotels were built without an account - huge and very small, chic and modest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mirage suite hotel 3" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/601730.jpg" width="302"></div>

    <h2>  Turkey, 5 Star Hotels </h2><p>  Photos of these luxury holiday complexes will be offered to you at any travel agency if you come there to buy a ticket.  Indeed, it‚Äôs hard to resist when you see such a fabulous palace in white or pink colors in the middle of a luxurious garden with bright colors.  Immediately I recall the "Thousand and One Nights" and other Arabian tales.  Yes, and once inside, you feel like a sultan or a padishah.  Thousands of entertainment and shows, water parks with dozens of slides, gourmet restaurants and bars with a variety of cocktails - all this you can try, just not getting out of the pool, or even from the sea. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  True, the prices of all these charms are very ‚Äúbite‚Äù, especially in season.  Such hotels offer tours starting from 25 000 rubles per person in the winter, and in summer the cost of rest can be 30, and 40 thousand, and higher.  Which ones are better to choose?  Bodrum, Belek, Marmaris, Antalya - they all have their own hotel rating.  Alanya (Turkey), for example, can offer you such hotels as Justiniano Deluxe, Aventura Park, Porto Azurro Delta, Utopia World, and others.  They occupy the highest places in the TOP according to reviews of guests.  Tourists write about such hotels exclusively in enthusiastic tones, praising the excellent accommodation conditions, marvelous gardens, sophisticated food and drinks, as well as staff guessing your every desire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey hotels 5 stars photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/602885.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Is it worth it to overpay - the service is in three rubles </h2><p>  But what if you can‚Äôt just take and put out a huge amount out of your pocket to feel like an oriental king from an Arabian fairy tale and spend your vacation in the Sultan‚Äôs palace?  No problem!  After all, Turkey is able to provide a wonderful holiday to every guest, no matter how much money he has.  Every resort in this country will find a three-star hotel for a modest tourist that meets its needs.  It is unlikely that such a hotel will have a huge park with tropical flowers or its own coast with helpful beach fights.  Nevertheless, basic amenities and good service are provided to you. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As a rule, these are city hotels where you can relax not only cheaply, but also to the maximum fun.  The sea is not so far, the rooms are often large and comfortable, and most have a pool.  In addition, you do not have to spend money on trips "to civilization."  Luxury "fives" are most often located away from cities, and in order to get to cafes, restaurants and discos, you have to either use a transfer or taxi, or sit on dolmush.  All this takes on even more specific meaning when it comes to a resort such as Alanya.  The Mirage Suite Hotel, which we will tell you about, is a good example of such an urban treshka.  It is located near the sea, close to all entertainment and attractions, and its staff is great for tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mirage suite hotel turkey" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/601800.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  There is a public city beach within a five-minute walk of Mirage Suite Hotel 3.  Locals gave it the popular name "Miami Beach."  It is located near the port, there is quite shallow and crowded.  Although very beautiful views.  But many vacationers prefer to go to the shore of Cleopatra.  It is a little further (on foot it is a quarter of an hour, maybe a little more), but there is sand, a convenient entrance to the water, and a good swim.  Beautiful clear water of <span>azure color.</span>  There are grottos where you can wander.  You can see the cliff with the fortress of Alanya.  It is also good to watch the sunset on this beach.  But, as a rule, there are waves, so families with children are better off choosing a city coast.  You can get there by city bus - its stop is not far from the hotel.  The pool on the territory is clean, very good.  Chlorine does not smell, you can swim.  The pool is not very large, but there is a children's section.  In addition, there are never too many people at this hotel, and therefore there are always enough places near it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mirage suite alanya" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/601929.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  Mirage Suite Hotel: reviews </h2><p>  This is a nice apartment with nice, smiling staff.  All problems are fixed at the first request, you do not even have to wait.  There are Russian-speaking workers.  Attractive in this hotel is not only service, but also the price.  This is a very decent hotel - for minimal money you actually rent an apartment.  But at the same time, people with disabilities can settle here (there are special numbers), you can give clothes for washing.  Visitors to this hotel who know a lot about travel assure that they will be happy to stay there again.  You can choose the beach to taste, the location is one of the best.  Once a week, the show Turkish Night is held.  Many have a pleasant experience about this hotel.  Here the Russians, the Turks themselves, and the Germans rest - little by little.  There are no drunken scenes and brawls, and if someone is trying to arrange something similar, then the hotel administration can simply evict them. </p>
