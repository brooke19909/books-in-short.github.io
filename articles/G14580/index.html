  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY pearl bracelet: ideas with photos, master class</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Once bracelets were a sacred element of clothing that protected their owners from the effects of evil spirits and evil spirits.  Later, but still long before Christian times, bracelets began to show the status of their owners.  She preferred to wear jewelry made of gold and silver, and people simply wore bracelets made of leather, wood, animal teeth, mineral stones and other materials that were at hand.  Wearing pearl bracelets in the old days was also considered a sign of nobility.  Pearls were expensive, they were mined in a hard way, and only the most noble persons could afford it.  Now any woman can wear a pearl jewelry.  And, moreover, it can be made exclusive.  Consider several options for how and what kind of pearl bracelet you can create for yourself a loved one or someone as a gift. </p><h2>  Bracelet with jewelry insert </h2><p>  One of the simplest bracelets in its own performance will be a bracelet made of one pearl string with a jewelry insert in the middle.  It is advisable to make such a bracelet right next to the wrist so that it does not turn over on the back of the hand, and the jewelry insert is always in sight as the crown of the item. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.whitesilkboutique.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bracelet with jewelry insert" class="if uuid-2808686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2808686.jpg"></div><p>  The thread, wire, fishing line or string on which the beads will be strung should be chosen so long that 1 finger fits between the wrist and bracelet.  If the bracelet is solid, without a clasp, then the insert can be selected with eyelets at the edges into which we will extend the ends of the wire or thread.  To keep the whole structure firmly held, the thread must be firmly tied, and bend the ends of the wire with round-nose pliers.  It is even easier to use a jewelry insert with a through hole.  It just needs to be strung along with the rest of the beads.  Then it‚Äôs better to make a pearl bracelet with your own hands with a clasp, which can be purchased at a sewing accessories store or disconnected from some old product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Voluminous pearl bracelet </h2><p>  A voluminous bracelet with pearls is more complicated in execution.  In addition to imagination, special schemes must also be used here.  One of the easiest ways to make a volume bracelet is as follows: </p><ul><li>  We take pearls of two different sizes (large and medium). </li><li>  Each pearl is strung on a pin.  It is advisable to take the same pins so that the bracelet does not look ridiculous. </li><li>  Further, pins with pearl beads strung on them must be fairly tightly attached to a thin chain using round-nose pliers in order to bend the tip of the pin. </li><li>  Beads are attached to the chain in a checkerboard pattern. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="andrew-thornton.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Voluminous bracelet" class="if uuid-2808704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2808704.jpg"></div><p>  Such a bracelet may well sit on your wrist freely.  And he looks gorgeous and on the wrists of miniature women, and ladies in the body. </p><p>  But there are more complex patterns of weaving volumetric bracelets.  Fortunately, there are quite a lot of workshops on weaving pearl bracelets with our own hands, several of which are presented in the article. </p><h2>  Memorial Wire Bracelet </h2><p>  The memory bracelet looks elegant, complemented by several pearls.  To make such a bracelet you will need: </p><ul><li>  A piece of memorial wire with the desired number of turns. </li><li>  Rubber cord cut by side cutters into tubes of the desired length or metal / plastic tubes of the required length. </li><li>  A few pearls. </li><li>  Caps for beads. </li><li>  Round pliers. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.jahroc.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wire bracelet" class="if uuid-2808712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2808712.jpg"></div><p>  At one end of the wire we make a loop with the help of round-nose pliers, and then we alternately string a hat for a bead, a pearl, a hat for a bead, a tube until the pancake of the wire ends.  If desired, you can somewhere in the middle to string some kind of pendant that does not contradict the style of the rest of the bracelet.  At the end, we bend the memorial wire with pliers so that the components do not fly off.  DIY handmade pearl bracelet based <span>on memory wire is</span> ready. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pearl embroidered bracelet </h2><p>  It is also easy to make a fabric bracelet using pearl embroidery.  For such a bracelet you will need a piece of dense fabric that does not crumble at the edges.  For example, felt.  We measure the width and length based on the parameters of the hand on which the bracelet will show off.  Next, we sew on the narrow edges of the special button fasteners (2-3 pieces, depending on the width of the bracelet), on which we will fasten the finished product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trendvisionforecasting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pearl embroidery" class="if uuid-2808723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2808723.jpg"></div><p>  For a change, you can glue or sew one or more rhinestones to the surface, or you can get by with pearls of one or more colors that combine.  From them you can fold a pattern or sew them in random order, alternating beads of different sizes.  In any case, the bracelet will look rich.  The master class of a do-it-yourself pearl bracelet based on fabric is quite simple. </p><h2>  Leather cord bracelet </h2><p>  A bracelet made of leather cord decorated with pearls can be made for both women and men.  Such a bracelet can be very delicate, brutal, and in folk style.  A bracelet made of 3-4 leather cords of a slightly different length looks beautiful.  To make such a pearl bracelet with your own hands you will need: </p><ul><li>  Leather cords of the same or different, harmonizing in color cords of slightly different lengths. </li><li>  Thread. </li><li>  Clasp. </li><li>  Pins. </li><li>  Beads. </li><li>  Dividing rings. </li><li>  Glue. </li><li>  Round pliers. </li></ul><p>  One end of the leather cords must be tightly tied with a thread into one, greased with glue and inserted into the lock slot.  Glue residue should be carefully removed.  We do not touch other ends yet.  Beads (or bales) are strung on the pins, bend the end of the pin with pliers and attach to the dividing rings.  Thus, we get pendants.  We pass the rings into the free ends of the cords (it is enough to string one suspension on one cord).  We fix the remaining ends of the leather cords in the same way as for the first time.  For gluing to the lock, you can use superglue or special glue, which will be advised in a needlework store. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crusadernews.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leather cord bracelet" class="if uuid-2808735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2808735.jpg"></div><p>  Options for such bracelets can be varied.  Cords can be taken in pastel colors, and dark, use glass and pearls as pendants, delicate jewelry elements or skulls and pearls of dark shades.  It all depends on the tastes of the person to whom the bracelet is intended and on the imagination of the craftswoman. </p><h2>  DIY pearl and bead bracelets </h2><p>  Pearls can also be combined with beads.  From beads and pearls, you can embroider various patterns on a fabric bracelet, replace with many beads tubes on a bracelet made of wire, add beads to pendants, and much more.  In addition, beads can be used as a substitute for small beads in volume bracelets and decorate them with pendants on bracelets made of leather cord. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blissalamode.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pearl and bead bracelet" class="if uuid-2808742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2808742.jpg"></div><p>  In any case, when making a pearl bracelet with your own hands, the main thing is to give free rein to imagination and do the work from the heart. </p>
