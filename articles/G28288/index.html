The script was simple.  The gifted artist-raider seeks to build a new culture and thereby elevate the homeland, and in return receives insults, poverty, poverty and abandonment. </p><h2>  A family </h2><p>  In K√∂nigsberg, a lawyer Ludwig Hoffmann and his cousin, a son, Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann, are born in 1776 on a cold January day.  Two years later, with a little parents divorce due to the unbearably difficult nature of the mother.  The three-year-old Theodor Hoffmann, whose biography begins with kinks, falls into the respectable burgher family of his uncle-lawyer.  But his teacher is not alien to art, science fiction and mysticism. </p>

    <p>  From the age of six, the boy begins his studies at the reformatory school.  At the age of seven, he will gain a true friend Gottlieb Hippel, who will help Theodore in difficult periods and will remain faithful to him until his death.  Hoffmann's musical and pictorial data appear early, and he is given to study for organist-composer Podbelsky and artist Zeman. </p><h2>  University </h2><p>  Under the influence of Uncle Ernst enters the legal department of the University of Koenigsberg.  At this time, <span>Immanuel Kant</span> teaches there <span>,</span> but his lectures do not attract the attention of such a person as Hoffmann.  Biography says that all his aspirations are art (piano, painting, theater) and love. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The seventeen-year-old boy is deeply passionate about a married woman who is nine years older than him.  However, he graduated with honors from an educational institution.  His love and relationship with a married woman is revealed, and in order to avoid scandal, the young man is sent to his uncle in Glogau in 1796. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  For some time he serves in Glogau.  But all the time he is busy about transferring to Berlin, to which he ends up in 1798.  The young man passes the next exam and receives the rank of assessor.  But in law, when necessary, Hoffmann, whose biography shows a deep passion for music, studies at the same time the principles of musical composition.  At this time, he will write a play and will try to put it on stage.  He is being poisoned to serve in Poznan.  There he will write another musical-drama performance, which will be staged in this small Polish town.  But gray everyday life does not satisfy the soul of the artist.  As an outlet, he uses cartoons of local society.  Another scandal occurs, after which Hoffmann is exiled to the provincial Plock. </p>

    <p>  After a while, however, Hoffmann finds his happiness.  His biography changes due to the marriage to the quiet, benevolent, but far from the turbulent aspirations of her husband, girl Michalina, or Misha for short.  She will patiently endure all the tricks and hobbies of her husband, and the daughter born in marriage will die at the age of two.  In 1804, Hoffmann was transferred to Warsaw. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  In the Polish capital </h2><p>  He serves, but gives all his free time and thoughts to music.  Here he writes another musical performance and changes his third name.  So Ernst Theodore Amadeus Hoffmann appears.  Biography speaks of admiration for the work of Mozart.  Thoughts are busy with music and painting.  He paints the Mniszek palace for the Musical Society and does not notice that Napoleon‚Äôs troops entered Warsaw.  The service ends, there is nowhere to take money from.  He sends his wife to Poznan, and he tries to get out to Vienna or Berlin. </p><h2>  Need and lack of money </h2><p>  But in the end, life leads Hoffmann to the town of Bamberg, where he receives the post of bandmaster.  He also carries his wife there.  This is where the intention of the first story, Cavalier Gluck, arises.  This period does not last long, but it is truly terrible.  No money.  The maestro even sells an old frock coat to eat.  Hoffman is simply interrupted by music lessons in private homes.  He dreamed of devoting his life to art, and as a result, deeply despaired, which apparently affected his health and too early death. </p>

    <p>  In 1809, the irrational novel ‚ÄúCavalier Gluck‚Äù was published, in which the free personality of the artist was opposed to a musty society.  So in the life of the creator includes literature.  Always striving for music, Hoffmann, whose biography is full and multifaceted, will leave an indelible mark on another art form. </p><h2>  Berlin </h2><p>  After long and inconsistent, like any great artist, throwing on the advice of a school friend Hippel, Hoffmann moved to Berlin and again ‚Äúharnessed‚Äù to work in the field of the judicial department.  He, in his own words, is again ‚Äúin prison‚Äù, which does not prevent him from being an excellent expert in law.  By 1814, his works ‚ÄúThe Golden Pot‚Äù and ‚ÄúFantasy in the Callo Style‚Äù were published. </p><p>  Theodore Hoffmann (biography shows) is recognized as a writer.  He visits literary salons, where he is given signs of attention.  But until the end of his life, he will retain an enthusiastic love of music and painting.  By 1815, poverty was leaving his home.  But he curses his own fate, as the fate of a lonely, small, crushed and weak man. </p><h2>  Prose of life and art </h2><p>  Ernst Hoffmann, whose biography continues in a very prosaic way, still serves as a lawyer and compares his hateful work with the meaningless, endless and joyless work of Sisyphus.  The outlet is not only music and literature, but also a glass of wine.  When he forgets about a bottle in a zucchini and then returns home, he has frightening fantasies that fall on paper. </p>

    <p>  But perfection is the ‚ÄúWorldly Views of Kota Murra,‚Äù who lives at his home in love and hall.  The hero of the novel, Kreisler, a priest of "pure art", is changing the cities and principalities of the country in search of a corner where you can find harmony between society and the artist.  Kreisler, whose autobiography is not in doubt, dreams of raising a person from colorless everyday life to the heights of the divine spirit, in higher spheres. </p><h2>  Completion of a life journey </h2><p>  First, the beloved cat Murr will die.  In less than a year, a great romantic who has already charted a new realistic path in literature, Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann, will die of 46 years of paralysis.  His biography is the path of the search for a way out of the "game of gloomy forces" to "crystal streams of poetry." </p>
