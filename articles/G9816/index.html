  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sodium Gluconate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A flavor enhancer known as E-576 as a <span>food supplement is</span> widely used in the food industry.  Here, sodium gluconate is used as a <span>flavor enhancer, the</span> effect of which is based on increasing the sensitivity of the tongue receptors when eating.  In accordance with current SanPiN, the substance is recognized as safe for human health and approved for use.  It has excellent hygroscopicity.  In one hundred milliliters of water at a temperature of 20 ¬∞ C, 60 grams of the substance sodium gluconate is completely dissolved. </p><p>  The harm from taking the food <span>supplement E-576</span> is that with large doses of its use, the so-called ‚ÄúChinese restaurant syndrome‚Äù may occur.  It includes a combination of symptoms, including headache, a feeling of heaviness, increased sweating and redness of the face.  Inflammation in the throat, pain in the chest area, shortness of breath and palpitations are less common. </p><p>  In addition to the indicated name of the substance, industrial samples are also used under the names sodium gluconate, sodium D-gluconate, sodium salt of D-gluconic acid.  As a component, sodium gluconate is indispensable in alkaline compounds. </p><p>  The main natural source for this substance is gluconic acid.  When it interacts with alkalis, sodium gluconate is formed, the preparation of which in this way is accompanied by the release of impurities in the form of various carbonates. </p><p>  Sodium D-gluconate, like its source - <span>gluconic acid</span> - is used to produce alkaline detergents as agents for the formation of metal cations.  The fact is that such use of the substance is very effective compared to other complexing agents due to synergistic properties. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sodium gluconate, due to properties such as hydrolysis stability and biodegradability, acts as an active component in various glass detergent formulations, for example, in those industries where bottle washing is carried out.  Compositions containing sodium gluconate as an active substance are effective in ultrafiltration of milk and whey molecules that accumulate on containers intended for storage and transportation of dairy products. </p><p>  In the <span>production of beer</span> , the process of growth of microorganisms often occurs, which negatively affects the taste of the product.  To prevent this phenomenon, a conventional washing of vessels with a solution of sodium gluconate is used, and the accumulation of calcium on the walls of the vessels will be reduced or not occur at all.  Washing surfaces of various units and devices requires detergents with a high concentration.  It is such solutions that can eliminate various organic as well as mineral deposits. </p><p>  Another common area of ‚Äã‚Äãuse of the compound is the production of building materials, namely concrete of various grades.  Here, sodium gluconate, which is part of concrete as a special additive, provides it with increased ductility, reduces hygroscopicity and facilitates the technology of laying concrete at low temperatures.  The same properties make sodium gluconate a popular additive in the oil industry for well cementing.  This protects the well from soil vibrations and corrosion.  With such technologies, the compound in question is already introduced directly into <span>the cement composition</span> to increase the penetrating effect. </p><p>  As an element that effectively binds metal ions, sodium gluconate is used in the metallurgical industry, in the production of various metal alloys.  Most effective is its action in the production of aluminum. </p>
