    <p>  At the tour desk or on the streets, travelers buy tours to Colombo, Galle, Ambalangoda, Seenigama Island, turtle farms located in the vicinity of Hikkaduwa, a gem mine.  Tourists visiting the sad expositions at the Telwatta Tsunami Photo Museum.  Enthusiasts collected for the museum, existing through donations, photos, documents and drawings, testifying to the devastating tsunami of 2004.  Gangarama Maha Vihara is famous for its frescoes, a sacred tree, and numerous <span>Buddha statues.</span> </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Upon request, the Chaaya Tranz 4 * hotel will provide a cot to the apartment at no extra charge, and a special chair for the child in the restaurant.  Babysitters provide paid babysitting services.  The hotel area is equipped with a children's pool. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  One minus is the hotel Chaaya Tranz 4 *.  Guest reviews indicate that the rooms have incredibly high humidity.  Get rid of it helps around the clock air conditioning or heat gun.  It is necessary to turn off the equipment, as in half an hour water smudges appear on the walls.  The apartment becomes damp, cold and uncomfortable.  With a constantly working air conditioner, the room is cool, and the heat gun pumps intolerable temperature. </p><p>  Some guests complain about the sluggishness and arrogance of the staff, the long check-in at the apartments, outdated equipment and furniture in the rooms, the need for repairs at the hotel, and the fact that for Wi-Fi you have to ask for a new password every day at the reception. </p><p>  The food in the hotel restaurants is varied, for ten days the dishes are not repeated even once.  The food is prepared deliciously, fruit is served to the table in abundance.  However, not all tourists are ready to take meals when they visit Chaaya Tranz (Hikkaduwa) 4 * again.  Reviews on this subject are as follows: food prices in the hotel restaurants are prohibitive.  Near the complex there is a restaurant serving giant portions of delicious food at a ridiculous cost.  It is in it that travelers prefer to satisfy hunger. </p>

    <p>  All guests like the good location and rich infrastructure of the hotel.  Hand squirrels live in the park.  Tourists are impressed by the large apartments with attractive interiors, equipped to the smallest detail.  For the presence of a spacious balcony-terrace with a soft sofa, from where stunning views of the ocean open, guests are ready to forgive the small flaws of the Chaaya Tranz 4 * hotel (Sri Lanka). </p><p>  Reviews about the beach are good.  It has enough comfortable sun loungers and umbrellas.  Huge turtles live near the shore, who willingly make contact with people.  True, swimming in the ocean should be done with caution, especially when it is restless.  There are places in the lagoon where the current easily carries people to the open ocean.  But it doesn‚Äôt reach the tragedy - lifeguards work on the beach. </p>
