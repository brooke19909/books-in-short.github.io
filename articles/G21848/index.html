    <h2>  Historical context </h2><p>  The Granada region was inhabited before our era.  After the fall of the Roman Empire, an era of decline begins throughout its territory.  The city of Granada passes from one conqueror to another, losing its scale and beauty.  In the VIII century, the <span>Cordoba Emirate</span> appeared here <span>,</span> and on the site of Granada only the fortress, which is used as a defensive structure, is preserved.  At the beginning of the collapse of the emirate in 1013, the territory was captured by a representative of the Algerian Berbers, who on the site of the present city creates its own settlement Midanat Garnat ("hill of pilgrims" in Arabic).  The Zirid dynasty rebuilds the historical center, but the city again changes owners - in 1090 the Almoravid dynasty comes to power.  After its decline, the Almohad dynasty took possession of the territory.  So, for many centuries, Muslim culture has dominated this land.  At the beginning of the XIII century, the dynasty experienced numerous military setbacks, which leads to the fact that in 1238 the territory was captured by Muhammad ibn Nasr the First, who creates the <span>Emirate of Granada</span> and leads the Nasrid dynasty.  From this moment begins the real flowering, development and planning of the city and today are visible in Granada. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1492, the emirate fell under the onslaught of the troops of the Queen of Spain, Isabella the First, from this moment begins a new page in Granada.

    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  Granada is located in southern Spain, part of the administrative district of Andalusia.  Any sightseeing tours to Spain necessarily capture a visit to this region as one of the most interesting and unusual.  The city is located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, which provide a mild, liveable climate.  The tropical climate and fertile soils made this region so attractive for invaders.  The city is spread over three hills, which created favorable conditions for defense, it is not in vain that the first Muslim fortresses appeared here back in the VIII century.  The city feeds the Darro River with water, and the proximity of the Mediterranean Sea provides great opportunities for trade.  Such a favorable geographical location caused long wars in this territory, everyone wanted to live in this paradise. </p>

    <h2>  Nasrid Dynasty </h2><p>  The Nasrid dynasty that came to power in 1238, represented by Muhammad I, became an island of prosperity for art and culture.  Muhammad occupied the territory of Granada and, realizing that he could not keep it under the pressure of Christian offensives, concluded an agreement with Ferdinand III.  This helped him not only save his land, but even expand its borders.  The descendants of Muhammad ruled the city until 1492.  For 250 years, Granada has been a center of education and art.  Nasridas were highly educated and had a passion for science and art.  Scientists, artists, musicians and poets from all over Europe were invited to their capital.  The Alhambra Palace became a monument of this dynasty, it showed the best features of Moorish art and culture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  History of construction </h2><p>  Granada has seen for many centuries.  The Alhambra as a palace began to be erected in the 13th century.  Muhammad I, having transferred his residence to the Alhambra, first of all began to strengthen the palace.  The Watchtower was built, the ancient walls were reinforced.  Then came the Tower of Honor.  Providing security, the emir began to engage in beautification.  His endeavors were continued by his successor.  Under Yusuf I and Muhammad Fifth, the largest number of buildings appears.  Alcabasa is being improved and expanded, palaces are being built, walls are being strengthened, the famous courtyard with lions, the Comares tower, and the iron gate appear.  In 1492, the Alhambra was conquered by the Catholic forces and became the royal residence.  The palace of Charles V, the church of Santa Maria, is being built here. </p><p>  Later, a happy fate turned away from the Alhambra.  The bourbons did not have any interest in her and even blew up part of the complex.  They say that they wanted to destroy the entire palace, but, fortunately, did not.  In 1821, significant damage to the Alhambra was caused by an earthquake.  In the second third of the XIX century, a colony of romantics was formed here, Byron, Goethe, Chateaubriand created here.  Then the restoration of the palace begins and the attitude towards the Alhambra, as a monument of history, culture and architecture, gradually develops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Architectural complex </h2><p>  Granada has a very unusual architecture for a European city.  The Alhambra was built according to Muslim customs.  Today, at the first moment, the visitor is impressed by the chaotic pile of buildings, gardens and courtyards.  But in reality, the layout of the palace was carefully thought out.  Each zone is grouped around an open courtyard.  The entrance gate and the garden were intended for solving small matters, for receiving visitors who blocked the way inside.  Next came the ceremonial chambers for receptions with beautiful halls and courtyards.  The long aisle that led into the hall was called La Barca; it served as a place for welcoming speeches.  The most intimate and most beautiful part is the private chambers.  Half of the emir and the female part stood out here.  The center of this part is the magnificent Lion's Yard.  There was also a separate zone - the garden, which was a real work of art.  In the original plan, the complex has not survived to this day.  Some of the buildings were destroyed, some were built up by later structures.  But even in this form, the palace makes an indelible impression of scope and luxury. </p>

    <h2>  Moorish style </h2><p>  Built in the eastern style of Granada.  The Alhambra was built mainly by Arabs.  The castle is an excellent example of the Moorish style, which was born in Muslim, Arabic culture, but organically absorbed the features of Spanish art.  The architecture of the Moors has a pronounced specificity.  This is primarily due to the attitude to the buildings.  Arabs originally lived in deserts, where a comfortable life is possible only in oases.  It was these oases that they tried to make all their palaces look like, hence such a love for creating gardens, such a special significance of water in castles and parks.  The architecture of the Moors was based on a harmonious combination of such figures as a square and a cube, they were the basis of both designs and decor.  It is always easy to recognize Moor constructions by their great ornamentality and the use of calligraphy in the design of constructions.  Constructive features of the Moors' style are horseshoe-shaped arches, vaulted ceilings, often converging in the center in the form of an eight-pointed star.  Planning buildings in this style were always centered by the courtyard, around which buildings for various purposes were located.  The interiors were distinguished by brightness, using carvings, mosaics, carpets, colored textiles.  In the Alhambra, the Moorish style reached its peak, the complex has a more elegant and refined shape than the buildings of previous periods. </p>

    <h2>  Nasrid Palace </h2><p>  An example of the <span>Moorish style</span> is the most valuable part of the complex - the palaces of Nasrid.  These include three autonomous monumental complexes: Meshuar - buildings for audiences and courts, Komares Palace - the official residence of the emir for receptions, Lion Palace - private chambers of the ruler's family.  The oldest part of the palace is Meshuar, part of the buildings was rebuilt in Christian times.  However, the main hall, decorated with tiles and quotes from the Koran, has retained its appearance.  The passage from Meshuar to the Comares Palace is decorated with gold tiles.  Under Yusuf I, the Komares Palace was erected with the famous Golden Room.  The guest entered the official residence through the spectacular Myrtle courtyard, decorated with evergreen trellises.  Around the courtyard there are graceful openwork columns with arches.  The palace and the Comares tower are connected by a long hall of welcoming La Barca, the walls of which are decorated with stucco moldings and tiles.  A tall tower of 45 meters accommodates the largest hall of the Ambassadors.  Its magnificent wooden ceiling depicts the seven heavens of the paradise from the Koran and is surrounded by a spectacular frieze in the form of stalactites.  The most luxurious part of the palace, private chambers, begins with the famous Lion's Yard.  From the courtyard you can get into the Stalactite Hall, the ceiling of which is decorated in the traditional Arabic way - with special folds.  Also from the courtyard you can enter the halls of the Kings, Justice, Two sisters, Biforiev and Abenserrahov.  Each of them is an example of the Moorish style of the heyday.  Here you can see murals, tiles, stucco molding. </p>

    <h2>  Famous courtyards </h2><p>  Islamic homes were built around courtyards, which were the main center of life, so they were arranged with maximum convenience.  An obligatory design element is a fountain that provides coolness and creates a calming mood.  The Mirtovy Dvor, the center of the public life of the palace with a large pond in the middle surrounded by the myrtle border, is considered to be the main ones in the Alhambra, the Lion's courtyard is the heart of the emir‚Äôs personal life, the center of which is a fountain with 12 figures of lions, graceful columns with carvings stand around the perimeter of the courtyard.  Another courtyard in the personal half of the emir is Alberka ("pond").  It is surrounded by white <span>marble walls</span> with colonnades and a rectangular pond, lined with greenery, which reflects buildings.  All courtyards are filled with columns and arcades, which create a welcome shadow and give the space grandeur.  The luxury of decorating the courtyards is striking: these are tiles, graceful carving of columns, ornaments and calligraphic inscriptions.  In the Generalife Palace there is a Water Court, in the center of which there is a rectangular pond surrounded by walls and arcades. </p>

    <h2>  Towers and gates </h2><p>  The Alhambra has always existed not only as a palace, but also as a defensive structure.  Therefore, its walls are decorated with many towers that perform sentinel functions.  In total, the castle has preserved more than 15 such structures.  The Armory Tower - one of the oldest in the fortress, it was erected during the construction of Alcabasa.  Her brutal appearance still gives the impression of power and reliability.  The 13th-century Prisoner Tower served as a prison for the Emir‚Äôs beloved wife.  The Peak Tower was built in conjunction with the Outskirts of the Gate and protected the gardens of Herenalife. </p><p>  The gates in the time of the Arabs were of great importance, they should not only be strong, but also express a certain idea, fulfill an aesthetic function.  The oldest surviving ones are the Vinnykh, decorated with beautiful lancet arches and carvings.  Iron gates were built in the XIII century and were a reliable defense of the bastion.  Outskirts guarded the entrance to the Generalife garden. </p>

    <h2>  Gardens of the Alhambra </h2><p>  <span>The eastern palace of the</span> Alhambra is famous for its gardens no less than the buildings.  The emirs strove to create a <span>garden of paradise</span> around themselves <span>, which is</span> why nature in palaces was sometimes given more attention than buildings.  Water and plants play the most important expressive function in the architecture of palaces.  The bubbling water, the scent of flowers and the rustle of leaves create an atmosphere of absolute peace and harmony.  At the entrance to the palace, the visitor got into the gardens of the Main Entrance, each corner of which is carefully planned, fountains and ponds are thought out here.  And everywhere there are a lot of flowers: bushes, flower beds, flowerpots - the visitor is immersed in this flowering aura and attuned to the spirit of the structure.  Each palace is surrounded by external gardens and has internal, to which entry was restricted to outsiders.  In the interior, the rarest plants, the most beautiful flowers, were planted.  Previously, the outer and inner gardens were limited to each other by walls; today, usually, bosquets are planted between them, trimmed in the form of fortress walls. </p><h2>  Palace of Charles the Fifth </h2><p>  After the capture of the Alhambra by Christian authorities, a royal palace was erected in it for Charles the Fifth and his wife <span>Isabella of Portugal.</span>  Today, excursions in Spain necessarily include a visit to this building.  Against the background of elegant and luxurious buildings in the Moorish style, the palace looks like a foreign body.  It is made in the Italian mannerism style, its plastered walls and classic square proportions in another place would be beautiful, but they look out of place here.  The building has a courtyard paved with stone, it is surrounded by two-story arcades from columns with ionic capitals.  Today it houses the Museum of Fine Arts and the Alhambra Museum. </p><h2>  Generalife </h2><p>  In the XIII century, the Alhambra castle received another beautiful residence - a summer one, named Generalife.  The palace consists of a main building, secondary buildings and a beautiful garden.  The main house was built in a deliberately simple style, which contrasts sharply with the palaces of Nasrid.  Here, nature comes to the fore.  The Generalife main courtyard is the courtyard of an irrigation canal along which trees are planted and rows of water jets are made.  The palace has an excellent viewing platform, from which Granada is visible in full view.  In the XIX century, the Upper Gardens are broken down in the palace with a spectacular water staircase and a romantic neo-Gothic mirador.  The lower gardens are a building of the 20th century, there is no former sophistication here, but beautifully trimmed bushes and various flowers make the place very pleasant for walks in the summer heat. </p><h2>  Party </h2><p>  A separate area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Alhambra is the Partal.  At the beginning of the 14th century, the Smokovnica Palace or Parthal ("portico") was built here.  However, most of the buildings have not been preserved.  Today in this area you can see the Dam Tower or, in another way, the Prince's Tower.  It is built into the outer wall and consists of a portico with five arched entrances.  In the center is a traditional rectangular pond decorated with plants.  From the top platform of the tower offers a beautiful view of the Alhambra.  At the end of the 19th century, a German entrepreneur bought the southern part of the territory for private development, he gave the land to the Spanish king, in return asking for the right to take to Germany the luxurious carved cedar and poplar ceiling that is on display at the Berlin Museum today.  Gardens adjoin the territory of Partal, in which the foundations of the dignitaries' dwellings have been preserved. </p><h2>  Practical information </h2><p>  In order to get to the Alhambra, you need to take care of tickets in advance.  The bandwidth of the object is small, so they diverge quickly.  You can buy tours in Spain and Granada via the Internet, but the ticket must be printed at the box office of the palace.  To do this, you need a card on which it was paid.  There are separate tickets for visiting the gardens and all buildings except the Nasrid Palace.  There are complete ones - for access to all objects.  The exact time of the visit will be indicated on the ticket for the Nasrid Palace, the visit lasts only 30 minutes, you cannot go inside again. </p>
