    <h2>  The modern approach of the creators of the Lego series </h2><p>  All LEGO constructors are based on the same principle of joining parts by pressing protruding round connecting elements into recesses on the back of the ‚Äúbricks‚Äù.  Kits of many series, including City, Technics, Ninja, Critor, Chima, Star Wars and many others, are intended for assembling complex compositions, the images of which are printed on the front side of the packaging box.  Each set is accompanied by detailed instructions, in which the technology for turning a large number of numbered parts into another fantastic monster, sometimes having impressive dimensions, is painted step by step.  This approach allows us to judge the modern LEGO designers as developing games, but it also makes us think about exactly what character traits are developed in a kid who is fond of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  How to make a car from Lego?  Follow the instructions! </h2><p>  This is not an empty tip.  The colorful instructions enclosed in the box give recommendations on <span>how to make a car</span> from Lego.  The first thing, as when creating a real car, is building a chassis with front and rear suspensions.  Then the body is carried out step by step, the glazing is installed, the holders for auxiliary units, the steering wheel and the seat are mounted.  The driver is going separately, this is a man with moving arms and legs, whose appearance, headgear and coloring of the ‚Äúsuit‚Äù denotes specific professional features. </p>

    <p>  For example, if the set of the City series is intended to recreate the scene of a bank robbery and subsequent prosecution, then the criminal characters will be dressed accordingly, and will have the means to achieve their evil goals.  After the raider jeep breaks the bars with a special hook and chain, law enforcement officers in blue uniforms on motorcycles and company cars will immediately rush in pursuit.  Moreover, the instructions describing how to make a Lego police car indicate with European pedantry that the colors of opaque parts should be white and blue, and flashing lights should be installed on the roof. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2></h2><h2>  Thoroughness and punctuality </h2>

    <p>  An equally careful selection was also shown when completing all other sets.  Fire fighting equipment is equipped with fire extinguishers, hoses, hoses, stairs and other equipment designed to combat fire, mainly red, while the installation location of each <span>assembly unit is</span> again meticulously limited.  It‚Äôs also not necessary to think about how to make a Lego racing car for a long time, everything is described in detail.  In addition, each kit, in addition to the standard ones, includes special parts intended for installation on specific landing sites formed after several assembly stages.  It can be hoods, roofs, windshields and other elements suitable only for a specific scheme. </p><p>  So, the main character traits that modern Lego designers develop are pedantry and thoroughness.  The qualities are undoubtedly meritorious and useful, they are very useful in adulthood, but children, especially technically gifted, so want to show imagination ... What to do? </p><h2></h2><h2>  LEGO Competitions </h2>

    <p>  LEGO regularly organizes competitions among young fans of its products, and there are many in all countries of the world.  The designer is very useful for acquiring initial technical skills; he develops attentiveness, ingenuity and a sense of design composition.  From a huge number of details, children choose the right elements, make quick decisions and put them into practice, showing imagination and imagination.  Courageous forms, graceful decisions and unusual approach can sometimes be envied by professional designers.  To take part in such a competition, it is not enough to know how to make a car from Lego according to the instructions, you need to be able to create something of your own, which no one has thought of yet.  This is not given to everyone, and the abundance of details is not the main condition, rather, on the contrary, their lack sometimes makes you look for a way out and develops non-standard thinking. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Show imagination </h2><p>  As a rule, parents who are fond of Lego children, despite the high cost of this designer, buy sets, not limited to one or two.  All fathers and mothers, as well as grandparents, are not indifferent to the successes of the growing descendants in the development of motor skills and quick wits.  At the same time, the age restrictions adopted in Europe and the rest of the world do not apply to our children, usually they are ahead of their foreign peers, easily coping with designers who are designed for children a year, two, or even three older.  When deciding how to make a car from Lego, they get acquainted with the attached instructions, but act in their own way.  Our boy can easily install the engine not from the front, but from the rear, to seat the driver in a completely different way, not as indicated in the instructions, but to assemble from the saved parts, for example, a trailer, gas station or something else. </p>
