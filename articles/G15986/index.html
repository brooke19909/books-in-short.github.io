  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Which iPhones does Apple Pay work on? Device requirements and payment methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This article will give an answer to which ‚ÄúiPhones‚Äù Apple Pay works on.  The procedure for using the payment system will also be described and the requirements for a mobile device will be outlined.  In addition to this, a non-standard procedure for using Apple Pay on older versions of smartphones will also be indicated.  The material set forth below will allow iPhone owners to use them for various purchases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.optus.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone 6 Plus" class="if uuid-3114899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3114899.jpg"></div><h2>  What is this technology? </h2><p>  Since its introduction in 2014, the Apple Pay payment system has been developing quite successfully.  It is based on a concept that boils down to the fact that for the purchase of a product there is no need to carry a wallet with money, but just take a smartphone.  The device must be equipped with an encoding chip, an NFC transmitter, and special software.  All this will allow you to wirelessly make a transaction, for example, with the iPhone 6 Plus.  Again, the security level of this technology is quite high and it‚Äôs easy for an attacker not to hack it - financial means are adequately protected. </p><p>  Initially, this technology was used only in the United States, but now it has found its application in most parts of the world.  In addition to Apple, other companies have provided similar programs: for example, Google and Samsung.  That is, this technology will find more and more application every year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Separately, it should also be noted the fact that you can use this payment service not only on smartphones, but also on other devices of this eminent manufacturer.  Support for Apple Pay is present on both the Apple Watch and iPad tablets.  This approach makes it a universal tool for shopping both online and offline stores. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphonemode.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Pay on iPhone 7" class="if uuid-3114900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3114900.jpg"></div><h2>  On which "iPhones" is it possible to pay? </h2><p>  Now let's figure out on which devices this system can be used.  For example, the question often arises: ‚ÄúIs there an Apple Pay on the iPhone 6?‚Äù  The answer to it will be positive. </p><p>  The contactless payment system under consideration was introduced almost simultaneously with this model, and all the necessary technical specifications were implemented in it.  Simply install the Wallet program, add a card and start using the system for its intended purpose. </p><p>  The same goes for iPhone 6 and SE smartphones.  Later mobile devices of this manufacturer also received full support for this technology.  The latter include 6S and 6S Plus devices released a year later.  Then smartphones 7 and 7 Plus were introduced.  Everything needed to launch Apple Pay was also implemented in them.  The next step was the emergence of gadgets 8, 8 Plus and X. They also worked perfectly in the framework of this transaction system.  Last year, XS, XR and XS MAX smartphones appeared on store shelves.  They also have everything you need to use Apple Pay. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mobile Device Requirements </h2><p>  The list of key requirements for a mobile device to work with this payment system is as follows: </p><ol><li>  The presence of an NFC transmitter that allows you to transfer data to a payment terminal. </li><li>  Installed Wallet application.  It is in it that payment cards are added. </li><li>  Latest software version for more security. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.arnnet.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is there an Apple Pay on iPhone 6" class="if uuid-3114910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3114910.jpg"></div><h2>  Apple watch </h2><p>  As noted earlier, this system is universal, and it can be used not only on the iPhone 6 Plus, but also on other Apple products.  For example, on the Apple Watch.  It is amazing that even the very first device in this series is capable of making contactless payments.  In subsequent versions of the smartwatch of this manufacturer, the technology under consideration is also fully implemented. </p><p>  There are two different ways to use Apple Pay on iPhone 7.  One of them is based on the use of a smartphone, and the second allows you to use smart watches of the same manufacturer for these purposes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.smh.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Which iPhones does Apple Pay run on?" class="if uuid-3114911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3114911.jpg"></div><h2>  Workaround </h2><p>  Earlier, a detailed list of which "iPhones" Apple Pay works on has already been listed.  But 5S can also be included in this list.  Initially, such a mobile device is not capable of carrying out wireless transactions.  NFC transmitter and encoding chip are not indicated in its hardware parameters.  But a smart watch can be connected to such a smartphone using the Bluetooth wireless interface.  And this device already has all the necessary hardware.  That is, with these two devices, you can use Apple Pay without restrictions.  The only difference is that the watch will be used for payment.  For technical reasons, the smartphone will not be able to make such a payment. </p><h2>  Development prospects </h2><p>  After we found out on which "iPhones" Apple Pay works, we will determine the prospects for the development of this payment system.  It was developed in 2014, since then it has become quite widespread.  Now Apple Pay is used all over the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="au.pcmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 6 plus" class="if uuid-3114914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3114914.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This article answered which iPhones Apple Pay runs on.  Also indicated are some other mobile devices from this manufacturer, with which you can pay for purchases.  Also, a non-standard procedure for using this system on earlier models of smartphones is given. </p>
