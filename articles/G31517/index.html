    <p>  The food, as noted by former guests, is also not bad - guests are served fresh dishes, there is always enough fruit, and the desserts are incredibly tasty.  Drinks at local bars are good.  Many hotel guests do not even attend public catering establishments in the city - what is on the hotel territory is enough. </p><p>  The employees here are smiling and polite, and any misunderstandings that arise are resolved in no time.  Many workers understand and communicate well in Russian, which is convenient for tourists who do not speak English.  There is enough entertainment on the territory - guests have fun. </p><p>  If you are looking for a hotel in Turkey, Belconti Resort Hotel 5 is the right place for a pleasant and eventful vacation.  Former guests unanimously recommend the hotel. </p>
