Hundreds of books and articles are written on this subject annually.  Violent discussions are regularly held in the media about the existence of secret societies that rule the world.  Proponents of the theory believe that the Masonic trace stretches from the Middle Ages and leaves an imprint on all the events of world history. </p><h2>  The origin of the Masons </h2><p>  In Western countries, the word mason is translated as "mason".  The Masonic conspiracy originates in medieval construction artels.  Massive churches and temples were erected throughout Europe at the dawn of Gothic architecture.  Their size and features of the external decoration required many decades of work.  History knows cases when one church could be built for more than a hundred years.  Therefore, masons (the common name of architects, engineers and other participants in the construction process) settled right near the construction site and could spend more than half their lives there.  Staying in such conditions prompted them to create various brotherhoods and organizations.  The first Masons were simple masons who established behaviors in their settlements, hierarchy, etc., thus acquiring the appearance of a community. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Masonic conspiracy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1044127.jpg" width="455"></div>

A lodge is an association of people on a territorial basis.  They all submit to the Grand Lodge, which determines the primacy in the local.  The rich <span>people of the Renaissance</span> quickly realized that you can use inconspicuous associations of masons to expand their influence.  Thus, the Masonic conspiracy did exist in France and a number of other Western states. </p><p>  Gradually accepting new participants, among whom were even members of the royal families, the Freemasons more and more moved away from the masons.  They began to call themselves "architects of life."  From the founders there were only symbols - a pair of compasses and a square.  Also, the image of the eye in the pyramid is often mentioned as an emblem.  In general, the Masonic conspiracy involves the use of diverse occult symbolism by secret societies. </p>

    <h2>  Theory spread </h2><p>  The Masonic conspiracy is <span>a theory</span> according to which secret societies accept prominent public figures, politicians, rich people and other "elites" to influence the world system.  The ultimate goal of Freemasons is the complete unification of the world and the creation of a new order, where lodges will play a decisive role.  The popularity of such a theory reached its peak in the late 19th - early 20th centuries.  Although back in the days of Elizabethan Russia, the first accusations of conspiracy against the Russian people appeared.  The empress accused the boyars and some members of the intelligentsia of belonging to Masonic lodges and embezzlement of the treasury. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Masonic conspiracy in Russia" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1044128.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the United States, the popular belief was that the "founding fathers" (Lincoln and others) were members of the Masonic lodge.  This fact is confirmed by real historical sources.  A number of US office buildings have a variety of symbols that identify as Masonic.  For example, at the Capitol Building, the White House, at Dallas Airport. </p><h2>  Theory of the Masonic conspiracy: the participle of Zionism </h2><p>  Most supporters of conspiracy theories associate the Masonic conspiracy with Zionism.  Such a concept gained popularity among the masses in the first half of the 20th century.  At this time, the first large corporations appeared, which had a significant impact on the policies of their countries.  Among the richest people in the world there was a very high percentage of Jews (for example, the Rothschilds).  They organized whole societies within their families.  Such dynastic organizations provoked a storm of criticism from right-wing conservatives.  The killing of John F. Kennedy, who allegedly spoke out about his intentions to put an end to ‚Äúsupranational structures,‚Äù caused a huge resonance. </p>

    <h2>  The overthrow of the regimes </h2><p>  Various conspiracy theorists also see the Masonic mark in the revolutions of the 19th century, which overthrew the regimes in European countries, using material support from Jewish capital.  The Masonic conspiracy in Russia gained fame after the 1905 uprising.  Radical nationalists, better known as the <span>Black Hundreds, have</span> blamed Masonic lodges and Zionist sects for organizing a revolution.  Since then, conspiracy theory has occasionally provoked a wave of discussions in Russian society.  Almost all public figures of Jewish origin were accused of belonging to the box. </p>

    <h2>  Who professes </h2><p>  Most often, far-right nationalists and radical conservatives who are in opposition to the authorities in their country speak of a Masonic conspiracy.  What is it - no one can say specifically.  For such people, belonging to the bed itself is a priori something reprehensible.  Conspiracy theory is used for political struggle.  Symbolism and numerology are called evidence.  For example, they are looking for hidden meaning in dates of events significant for world history.  Such statements are often criticized by philosophers and scientists.  At the moment, the existence of Masonic lodges is a well-known and undisguised fact. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Masonic conspiracy is" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1044817.jpg" width="600"></div>  Disputes are conducted only around the degree of their influence on society.  It is worth noting that so far no significant facts or documentary evidence of the Masonic conspiracy have been given.  Nevertheless, this topic is often used by famous writers.  For example, Dan Brown wrote a series of books mentioning the secret societies of Masons and Illuminati.
