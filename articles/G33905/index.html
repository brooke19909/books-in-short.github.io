People who have already rested here have a positive opinion about this hotel.  Most often in their comments they note the following nuances: </p><ul><li>  A paradise atmosphere reigns on the territory.  The hotel is small and cozy, with a well-groomed green area, on which there are many palm trees. </li><li>  The hotel is located far from the city center, but you can get to the place of concentration of supermarkets, shops and other institutions by taxi for 70-100 thousand dong.  This is approximately 200-280 rubles. </li><li>  In the center of the city there is a Bokeh market, where there are several excellent cafes that deliciously cook seafood.  Many tourists dine there. </li><li>  On the beach, which is private (only for hotel guests), there are always free sun loungers, and towels are also brought to vacationers. </li><li>  Breakfast in the restaurant is excellent, there is always a choice.  For 10-14 days there is no way to get enough.  For the European guest, there is everything here - from scrambled eggs and toasts, ending with cheeses and sausages.  Fruits, pastries and Asian delights are also served. </li><li>  The rooms are as good in reality as in the photo.  Guests especially like the presence of terraces and balconies in them - in the evening you can have a very romantic drink of wine in comfortable armchairs.  In general, in the apartments everything is thought out to the smallest detail, there are even aromatic drops in the bathroom for a pleasant aroma and a mosquito ring. </li><li>  Cleaning at a height.  Perform it daily, with the obligatory replacement of towels. </li><li>  The spa is very worthy, all the procedures are done in a high quality, at a high level.  People, having tried something of interest, for the most part come back in order to continue. </li><li>  The staff working at the hotel leaves an extremely pleasant impression.  The guests are treated as long-awaited, dear guests.  Everyone is very smiling and pleasant. </li></ul><p>  This place will definitely appeal to people who want to relax from the hustle and bustle and enjoy the beach pastime.  This hotel is ideal for relaxation and unity with nature.  You can verify this by just looking at the photos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nhommua.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="aroma beach resort and spa hotel Phan Thiet" class="if uuid-2958214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2958214.jpg"></div><p>  It is not worth going here only to those who take their children on vacation - for them there is no entertainment here, and the beach is not suitable for them.  There are frequent waves that adults like to ride (including jet skis), and the wind rises in the evening. </p><p>  When is the best time to go to Aroma Beach Resort and Spa (Vietnam)?  The city of Phan Thiet has a mild climate all year round, the beach season never ends.  But the best time to relax is all three winter months. </p><p>  This season there is no stuffiness and unbearable heat (average is from 29 to 31 ¬∞ C), it does not rain, and the sea temperature is comfortable both for lovers to bathe in ‚Äúfresh milk‚Äù and for lovers of refreshing coolness - from +24 ¬∞ C up to +26.5 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  Voucher cost </h2><p>  Many lovers of exotic travel would love to visit the Aroma Beach Resort &amp; Spa (Muine).  The average tour price for two people is 100,000 rubles.  Here is what is included in this amount: </p><ul><li>  Stay in a room overlooking the garden for 8 days (7 nights). </li><li>  Breakfast </li><li>  Return flights. </li><li>  Group transfer. </li><li>  Medical insurance. </li></ul><p>  It should be noted that the cost of the permit is approximate.  Depending on the season and tour operator, it can be either higher or lower.  Last minute, sometimes, hot deals are available at which you can save a decent amount.  In addition, in our time, you can arrange a tour in interest-free installments, and this is profitable. </p>
