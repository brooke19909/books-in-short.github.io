At first, these devices did not predict anything good in the mobile technology market, but, as it turned out, they became much more popular than laptops and gained great success.  At first, Apple contributed to this, but a little later tablets began to be developed by other enterprises, and with a fundamentally different operating system.  This state of affairs has opened up great opportunities for mobile operators who sought to create a branded device of their own manufacture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline tablet" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10685/248021.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  It should be noted that the Beeline tablet appeared on the market much earlier than other branded devices of other operators.  And not only in Russia, but throughout the world.  At the same time, the MTS company should have appeared, but she was not able to resolve the issue of its timely launch.  Therefore, Beeline tablets, the price of which at the time of release was 13 thousand rubles, immediately began to be very popular.  And considering that the peak of sales was in 2010, its layout was quite successful. </p><p>  However, there is a small drawback that Beeline M2 has.  The tablet is tied to the SIM cards of the mobile operator, and to unlock it, you need to go to the company‚Äôs salon or call a specific phone number.  Although for knowledgeable people such an action is not difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline m2 tablet" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10685/248022.jpg" width="500"></div>

It has a 600 MHz processor, as well as a <span>resistive screen.</span>  At the same time, only 130 MB is provided to the user from flash memory, which is quite small by today's standards.  However, the Beeline tablet has its own positive qualities.  It is equipped with a rather successful WIFI module and Bluetooth, which makes it much higher than some budget models.  Moreover, he is able not only to receive Internet data via a SIM card, but also to distribute them, acting as a router. </p><p>  Another advantage that the Beeline tablet has is the presence of A-GPS and a 3 MP camera.  Such a number of additional functions makes this model very functional, and if it were not for the budget processor and the small amount of RAM, it could be called one of the best Russian mobile devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline tablets Price" class="if" height="211" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10685/248023.jpg" width="329"></div>

    <p>  Separately, it is worth noting that the device has a back cover that can be easily removed.  At the same time, the Beeline tablet provides access to the battery, which is made in a removable version.  This is very convenient for long-term use, as it allows replacement. </p><p>  It is important to note that user reviews about this device are positive even in our time.  The fact is that due to the large number of additional functions and the ability to work in 3G mode, it is often used to connect several tablets or computers using the WI-FI system.  However, the lack <span>of processor speed</span> makes it obsolete and impractical because it causes frequent freezes and crashes.  At the same time, taking into account its current price, the Beeline tablet feels great in the category of budget mobile equipment. </p>
