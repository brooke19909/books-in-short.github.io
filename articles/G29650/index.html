The speed of information processing and customer notification of the completion of transactions depends on the quality of the system’s functioning.  It is she who displays messages on the type of “Accepted ABS” (Sberbank).  What this means, you will learn from this article. </p><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  ABS consists of a core and modules.  Their number depends on the needs of the bank in data processing.  The main requirements that apply to the system are reliable information protection, operational data collection, and the ability to quickly make decisions. </p><p>  A key element of the system is the cash management module.  It contains all the payments made and assigns them the status “Accepted by ABS”, “Rejected”, “Delivered”, etc. Based on this data, reports are then generated and submitted for verification to the Central Bank.  For each individual operation, a module is purchased.  All of them can be manufactured by different manufacturers, but must be subordinate to one ABS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accepted abs sberbank what is it" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/758154.jpg" width="600"></div><strong> </strong>

    <h2>  Implementation </h2><p>  Some domestic banks operate on their own ABS.  Only large organizations with a large staff of IT specialists and a substantial amount of <span>investment</span> can afford this <span>.</span>  <span>The payback period of</span> such systems is 1.5-2 years.  There are disadvantages to this solution.  Firstly, the low quality of studies that do not allow you to track changes in conditions in the future.  Secondly, in such ABS, accounting and control are practically not integrated into separate programs.  Thirdly, the creation process can take a long time if several specialists work on the same project.  On the other hand, such automated banking technologies are completely exclusive and prepared for one organization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many people think that it is better to buy a ready-made software product, and then adjust it to the features of the system.  The development of domestic specialists can be purchased for 15 thousand dollars, foreign - ten times more expensive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="verification of documents" class="if" height="199" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/758153.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bank-Client System </h2><p>  A striking example of the functioning of the ABS is the “Personal Account” of users on the website of a credit institution.  All processes, starting with registration in the system and ending with viewing the history, are carried out in close cooperation with the ABS.  Consider this process by the example of sending a payment order in the Sberbank-Online system. </p><h2>  Document generation </h2><p>  First you need to create a payment order by entering in it all the details of the recipient.  Automatic banking technologies are arranged in such a way that each stage of document formation is assigned a unique status: </p><p>  1. “Control error” - the generated document at the stage of saving did not pass the check for filling all the fields. </p><p>  2. “Imported” - the payment order was transferred from the accounting program. </p><p>  3. “Created” - the document was successfully generated in the “Client-Bank”. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is necessary to highlight a <span>payment order.</span>  In the upper column of the menu, additional buttons are activated.  Among them, you need to select "Signature".  If several payment orders were formed at once, then before carrying out them it is worth clarifying the details.  A preliminary check of documents saves users from further errors.  It is very difficult to cancel a payment after it has been executed.  And if the operation is successful, then the money will be returned to the account within three days. </p><h2>  Transfer to processing </h2><p>  After creation, the document must be assigned an electronic signature of all authorized persons.  At this stage, you must enter the password specified in SMS.  The Bank-Client system assigns the status of “Signed” to the payment.  Now the payment order can be sent to the bank.  A special button on the <span>toolbar is</span> provided for this <span>.</span>  Further, the application is assigned the intermediate status “Added”.  This means that documents are being checked.  After its completion, the payment is considered accepted and sent to processing.  The application can be canceled until the document is assigned the status “Accepted ABS” (Sberbank).  What does it mean?  Documents will be removed from the queue.  Money is not debited from the account.  After calculations, the document is assigned the status of “Completed”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="customer bank system" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/758152.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Additional statuses </h2><p>  Documents may be located at such stages of processing: </p><ul><li>  “Delivered” - the document has been submitted to the bank and is at the stage of passing checks.  This process, according to internal regulations, can take an entire operational day. </li><li>  “Accepted” - the payment order has passed all verification and is sent for unloading at the ABS. </li><li>  “Suspended” at the recall command.  Such a document may be revoked or accepted by the ABS (Sberbank).  What does it mean?  The application is reassigned to the same status at which processing was interrupted. </li><li>  “Unloaded” - aimed at further passing checks. </li><li>  “Accepted by Sberbank ABS.”  What does it mean?  The document is at the last stage of processing. </li><li>  “Card file number 2” - the client does not have enough funds in the account to conduct the operation. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what does it mean accepted abs" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/758148.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Final statuses </h2><ul><li>  “Removed from existing documents.” </li><li>  “ASP is incorrect” - the document is not signed by the bank. </li><li>  "Error details." </li><li>  “Completed” - funds are transferred to the beneficiary's account. </li></ul><h2>  New version of mobile application </h2><p>  It will be possible to track in detail the status of payment orders only through the "Personal Account" on the website or through the "Client-Bank".  Using a mobile application, you can create and view the history of completed applications.  For individuals, this service provides other interesting features. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="status accepted abs" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/758149.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In March 2015, a new version of Sberbank-Online was launched for Android owners.  Of the main innovations, it is worth noting the built-in antivirus, which checks not only the application, but also the smartphone itself.  If threats are detected, the program will not start.  Through the application, you can carry out all the required operations, from <span>paying utility</span> bills and replenishing a mobile phone, ending with the transfer of funds to another account in the Russian Federation.  This is a real "bank in the palm of your hand." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="automated banking technology" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/758150.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The application still starts after entering a unique five-digit code.  The improved interface allows you to pay taxes and fees in one click.  Through the program, you can find out about the presence of fines in the traffic police.  You only need to enter your driver’s license number.  If there are any, then directly through the smartphone they can be repaid. </p><p>  Another important innovation.  The program automatically analyzes the version of the operating system on the smartphone.  If official firmware is installed, the application will be updated regularly, constantly expanding the set of tools used.  But if a modified OS is installed on the gadget or the user has root access, then the service will work in light mode, without updates and improvements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="automated banking technology" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/758151.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A payment that passes through Sberbank is assigned a certain status at each stage of its existence.  By its name, you can determine at what stage the process of transferring funds is, whether there are any errors.  A payment order must be created, then signed and sent to processing.  After the successful completion of these processes, the document is submitted for execution.  That's what “adopted by the ABS” means. </p>
