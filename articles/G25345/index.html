    <p>  A crocheted openwork collar is always very feminine and elegant.  Such collars look great both on business attire, and on evening and everyday.  If you know how to crochet, then creating a collar will not take you much time and effort.  All you need is yarn (suitable acrylic) and a suitable size hook. </p><h2>  Where to start knitting </h2><p>  Before you tie the collar, you must make a pattern in full size.  Draw the collar as you want it to be.  It can be rounded or with sharp edges, small or large.  Also consider where the fastener at the detachable collar will be.  Draw all the details on the cardboard and cut.  During the creation of the product, from time to time, apply work to the pattern, so you will not be mistaken and as a result you will get what you expect. </p><h2>  Crochet collar for beginners.  Tips for beginners </h2><p>  If you have recently mastered the basics of knitting, learned to hold and choose a hook, pick up yarn for it, then with lace items you should be very careful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34505/802068.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Always make sure that the loops are the same size.  You should not tighten them too much or, conversely, weaken them too much.  If your crocheted collar in places will have large loops, and in some places narrow, then it will be sloppy, curved.  The pattern on such a product will look blurry, and the edges may wrap when worn.  Always pick up yarn that will not fluff, and grabbing it will be easy.  If you suddenly picked up the wrong hook, then this can be understood by several signs.  The thread you grab flies.  Or with tight knitting, you still have too big holes in the work.  Crocheting always involves knowing the basic loops and posts.  In openwork things, as a rule, several columns are always used.  Therefore, if you have not yet learned how to make <span>double crochets, half-crochets with</span> or without <span>crochets</span> , purl knitting and crocheting, then study and practice how to make them. </p><h2>  Old new lace </h2><p>  We will learn how to crochet an openwork collar.  After you have done the pattern, you can get down to business.  Take the iris yarn, it can be found with the addition of silver or gold thread or in one color.  Knitting must begin with the neck.  Dial the required number of air loops.  Attach the finished chain to the pattern.  Do not pull it, it should lie down freely.  If you are comfortable with the chain, then do another five lifting loops and turn the job over. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the ninth loop from the hook, knit a single crochet.  Perform two air loops, skip the two loops of the previous row and again knit a single crochet.  Again, dial two loops and repeat according to the scheme to the end of the row.  Turn the job over and dial seven air loops.  In the second gap between the <span>double</span> crochet <span>stitches,</span> knit four single crochet stitches.  Then dial five loops and in the next hole, tie four columns with one crochet.  Therefore, continue to work until the end of the second row. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet collar for beginners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34505/803668.jpg"></div></h2><p>  In the third row, draw a chain of four air loops and knit two double crochets over the column of the previous row.  Perform two air loops.  Sew a double crochet between the second row.  Next, again dial two loops and tie a crochet post.  This time you need to knit it in a large hole.  Sew another double crochet in the same place.  Tie the two air loops and the next two columns into the large first hole.  After you complete the next two air loops, they need to be knit together with a single crochet between four columns of the last row.  Knit to the end of the row. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Knit the next row by analogy with the second.  And the fifth is the same as the third.  Continue alternating until the eighth row. </p><p>  In the eighth row, dial three air loops and knit them together with three crochet posts into the closest hole from the hook.  Perform three loops.  In the column of the previous row, knit a crochet column and again three loops.  Next, knit as the second row, only instead of two air loops, knit three.  The eighth row is final. </p><p>  Trim and hide the working thread.  Make a loop at one end of the collar.  Sew a button on the other.  Also, the collar can be tied with ribbons.  To do this, pass a thin ribbon between the main chain and the columns of the first row.  Crochet collar ready.  Ready accessory can be worn with dresses, blouses and turtlenecks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet collar" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/804526.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Stand Collar Fashion </h2><p>  As you know, fashion has a habit of returning.  What was fashionable twenty, thirty or even more years ago comes back to our wardrobes.  Sometimes it‚Äôs useful to look in the closet to your grandmother, perhaps you will find there what your fashionista neighbor or models on the catwalks go to. </p><p>  The stand-up collar was fashionable back in the 40s.  Then for a while he lost his popularity and returned to us in the 80s.  Now this <span>kind of collar</span> is gaining attention again among representatives of the fashion industry.  Now prices for <span>removable collars</span> range from 15 to <span>100 dollars.</span>  Not everyone will be able to afford such an accessory.  A crocheted crochet stand collar will cost you only one skein of thread and take a bit of your time.  To decorate the collar, you can still purchase several pearl beads. </p><h2>  We knit a stand-up collar with flowers </h2><p>  Next, we learn how to crochet a stand-up collar with openwork flowers. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie a collar" class="if" height="496" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34505/799906.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Think of how wide you would like a collar.  Usually it is about ten centimeters.  Gather the required number of air loops and try on your neck.  It fits in very well.  It is enough to perform simple double crochet.  At the end of the work, you can knit the waves on which to sew buttons for fasteners. </p><p>  To decorate the product, knit several flowers and sew them to the collar.  Patterns of required colors can be found in knitting magazines. </p><h2>  Winter collar </h2><p>  When the cold comes, and one wardrobe is replaced by another, many women suddenly discover that they have absolutely nothing to wear.  But if you know how to knit, then you do not need to be upset at all. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet stand collar" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34505/803677.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  If you knit a scarf collar, it will not only warm you, but it will certainly become a favorite accessory that will suit any outfit and will not let you freeze.  Moreover, it fits very simply. </p><p>  Take thick wool yarn and a suitable hook.  Decide how you want to put on your removable collar - over your head or fasten it around your neck. </p><h2>  A collar worn over the head </h2><p>  Make a chain of air loops and try on it around the neck.  It should not be too tight.  Connect the chain into a ring and try again.  This time, try to put your head in there: if it easily enters, then you will put on a scarf without difficulty, and it will not put pressure on you.  Knit double crochet in each row.  Such rows can be from about fifteen to forty.  If you want a collar with a collar, then safely perform thirty rows, then try on and, if necessary, tie another.  This crocheted crocheted collar is warm, soft and very comfortable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="warm crochet collar" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34505/799908.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <h2>  Buckle Collar </h2><p>  This option fits in exactly the same way as the stand, the only difference is what yarn you use for this.  It is better to knit with woolen threads.  The collar on the clasp looks best with a collar.  Sew a few hidden hooks or buttons on the finished product. </p><h2>  How to decorate a collar </h2><p>  You can diversify and decorate collars with the help of brooches, appliques, beads and beads.  If this is a collar for a dress, then the pearl beads sewn around the edges look very beautiful. </p>
