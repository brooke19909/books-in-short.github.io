In Soviet times, the attitude to this resort has not changed, and for many, a trip here remains one of the best memories of youth. </p><p>  Now that the peninsula has again become part of Russia, it is quickly becoming one of the most popular holiday destinations.  There are many sanatoriums, holiday homes, hotels and private pensions, which offer fairly comfortable living conditions for the period of beach holidays. </p><p>  One of the best places of rest that Crimea offers is Rodina, a sanatorium where you can enjoy a comfortable rest and a warm sea outside. </p><h2>  Sanatorium "Homeland", Crimea.  Description </h2><p>  We began to build this elite health resort in 1950.  The construction of the main building took five years, after which a snow-white palace rose above Yalta.  Massive columns, magnificent stucco molding, and also spacious viewing platforms give resemblance to a royal structure to a sanatorium.  The architects did everything to give the building a unique grandeur, which even today leaves no one indifferent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea homeland sanatorium" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40456/1299736.jpg" width="600"></div>
