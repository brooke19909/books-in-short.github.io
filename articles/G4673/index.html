    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Let's start with the description of the Turbo-Button service (MTS).  500 MB or more of Internet traffic, as already mentioned, will be available to you for use for a certain period.  This is a kind of opportunity to save on the Internet for MTS subscribers. </p><p>  It would seem nothing special.  But only many consumers need such a ‚Äúbutton‚Äù.  After all, one does not always want to overpay for Internet services from a telephone.  The ‚ÄúTurbo Button‚Äù allows you to add Internet traffic to the World Wide Web for a certain period of time.  How long will the service last?  It all depends on the chosen tariff.  Allocate "buttons" to: </p><ul><li>  100 MB </li><li>  500 MB </li><li>  1 GB </li><li>  2 GB; </li><li>  5 GB </li></ul><p>  With all this, you will receive traffic for a time corresponding to the following indicators: </p><ul><li>  24 hours (for 100 megabytes); </li><li>  30 days </li></ul><p>  In principle, if you are satisfied with such conditions, then you can think about connecting.  Please note that all ‚Äúbuttons‚Äù have their own value.  In any case, it is not as high as paying for Internet traffic in excess of the connected tariff package. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mts turbo button 2gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139492.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Turbo Button </h2><p>  But first, you should pay attention to another rather interesting service.  It is simply called the ‚ÄúTurbo Button‚Äù from MTS.  Excluding traffic.  This feature allows you to get unlimited connection speed for 20 minutes.  And it costs only 19 rubles.  Helps to acquire fast Internet when necessary. </p><p>  The thing is that the ‚ÄúTurbo Button‚Äù (MTS) 500 MB (or more) is the traffic for the Internet.  But if you need to connect it, taking into account the fact that you need to remove the speed limit for 20 minutes, then you will have to additionally ‚Äúfork out‚Äù just the ‚ÄúTurbo button‚Äù.  Do not confuse these features.  Otherwise, you will not be able to achieve the desired result. </p><h2>  Call connection </h2><p>  And now a little about connecting a particular service.  MTS "Turbo-button 2 GB", like any other function, can be enabled in various ways.  The first here is a banal call to a telecom operator.  Not the best and most popular method of solving a problem, but it does have a place to be. </p><p>  To implement it, dial 0860 and wait for the operator to respond.  As soon as you hear a voice, let us know that you would like to connect a Turbo Button.  Next, you have to name which one.  Clarify you are talking about traffic or connection speed.  During the conversation, the operator will issue an application for your SIM card and name.  As soon as it is processed by the system, you will receive a notification about the successful connection of the service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="1 turbo button pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139491.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The call to the MTS operator is free.  And direct application processing too.  But the connection of one or another option of the ‚ÄúTurbo-button‚Äù line is not.  You should have enough funds on your mobile to pay for the service.  You can learn about the cost of connection directly when talking with the operator.  Typically, call center employees immediately tell you all the conditions of a particular service package.  Very comfortably. </p><h2>  Personal appeal </h2><p>  By the way, ‚ÄúTurbo-button‚Äù (MTS) 500 MB (and not only) can be connected through a personal appeal of the client to the office.  Also not the best solution.  But sometimes it can be extremely useful.  Especially if you suddenly decided to connect, and the MTS office is nearby. </p><p>  Take your mobile phone with you and contact your nearest operator‚Äôs liaison office.  There you will have to inform about your intentions to connect the "Turbo buttons" and ask for help in this matter.  Pass your gadget to the operator - he will do everything on his own.  Do not forget to say which tariff and service you would like to connect: speed or traffic.  And to what extent - too. </p><p>  They will tell you about the conditions for using the opportunities.  For example, ‚ÄúMTS Turbo Button 1 GB‚Äù (now in some regions the traffic has been increased to 2 gigabytes) costs 250 rubles.  And this offer is valid for a month, that is, 30 days.  You get 1 gigabyte of additional Internet traffic for this period.  As soon as all actions are completed (after your consent to connect), you will receive a message with the result of the operation.  You can use the "Turbo button". </p><h2>  Teams </h2><p>  The next option is already more appropriate and is used by most subscribers.  The thing is that almost all MTS services can be connected and disconnected through the use of self-service functions.  These include the so-called USSD requests.  These are special combinations that help to connect / disconnect certain features, change the tariff plan or get some information.  Each opportunity has its own teams.  For example, at MTS "Turbo-button 2 GB" is connected via * 168 #.  Type this command, and then click on the "Call" button.  You are waiting for the request to be processed - and that‚Äôs it, it's done. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turbo button pay 1 gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139490.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  But how can I connect all the other line packets?  To do this, use USSD requests: </p><ul><li>  100 MB: * 111 * 05 * 1 #; </li><li>  500 MB: * 167 #; </li><li>  5 GB: * 169 #. </li></ul><p>  There is nothing difficult about this.  In addition, a simple "Turbo button" (speed for 20 minutes) is connected using the command * 165 #.  Easy and simple.  Now it doesn‚Äôt matter which package you are interested in.  You can activate the MTS Turbo-Button service (500 MB and not only) yourself at any time, day or night. </p><h2>  Networks </h2><p>  But that is not all.  Remember one thing to start with - you can only have 1 Turbo Button (MTS) connected to you.  The next service is available after spending the previous package.  This is a small digression. </p><p>  Now about the last method of connecting the line "Turbo-button".  It is about using the Internet to implement ideas.  This will help the site mts.ru.  Here you must log in to the "My Account" and get access to all services on the SIM card.  If you go to the appropriate section, you will see all the possible packages and options that you have, and in general. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disable turbo button on pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139489.jpg"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Here you need to find the "Turbo Button" (of course, the plan that interests you).  Then click on ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù on the right side of the screen and enter the operation confirmation code in the window that appears.  It will come in an SMS message to your mobile device.  After that, the action can be considered completed.  By the way, you can disable the ‚ÄúTurbo button‚Äù on MTS by any method.  But the operator‚Äôs official website is more popular.  In this case, you must select the "Disable" function and enter the confirmation code. </p>
