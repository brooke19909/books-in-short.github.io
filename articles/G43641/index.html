And one of the most interesting among them is the Uno desktop, the rules of which are very simple and understandable to everyone without exception. </p><h2>  Game Package Contents </h2><p>  The Uno card game is always sold in a small cardboard box in bright red.  Opening it, you can see these cards inside: </p><ul><li>  108 simple cards of four colors - red, yellow, blue and green; </li><li>  a stack of eight Draw 2 cards that contain two cards of each color; </li><li>  a stack of eight Change of Direction cards containing two cards of each color; </li><li>  a stack of eight “Skip Pass” cards containing two cards of each color; </li><li>  4 cards with the name "Wild Card"; </li><li>  4 wild cards called Pull 4. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.meijer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="packaging with the game uno" class="if uuid-2393310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46461/2393310.jpg"></div><h2>  Purpose of the game </h2><p>  Before you figure out the rules and <span>how to play</span> Uno <span>cards</span> , you should decide on the purpose of this card game.  And it is very simple - you need to be the first to discard all your cards from your hands, while other players must have cards to the maximum.  Indeed, in the final game, players count points on the cards that they have in their hands, and then they are all summed up, and the final figure is written into the winner’s account.  The game continues until one of the participants reaches 500 points. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Game progress </h2><p>  Having learned the purpose of the game, you can begin to find out in more detail how to play Uno, the rules of which, by the way, are quite simple.  The first thing to do is to shuffle the deck well, give seven cards to all the players, and put the remaining cards in a pile face down with face value.  Next, one card from the deferred deck is turned face up and placed right next to it, so that cards are put on it in the end.  After that, the first player can begin to walk from any card, for example, "Green Two."  However, this is only if the open card with the pending deck was a number, if there was a card with action, then the first player must skip the move, take 2 cards or take some other action, depending on the open card. </p><p>  After the “digital” card has been laid out on the table, the rules of the Uno game require the next player to lay out any card of the same color or the same denomination.  So, behind the “Green deuce” it will be possible to lay out either a “deuce” of blue, yellow or red color, or any other card of green color.  And so the game goes in a circle.  If a person does not have the required card, he draws cards from the pending deck until he finds the one that he needs.  And when the pending deck is completely disassembled, all those cards that are on the table go in its place, taking into account that we do not postpone only the last card, but leave it open so that the game continues.  And of course, if you have action cards, you can walk around with them, guessing the right moment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unfolded uno cards" class="if uuid-2393326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46461/2393326.jpg"></div><h2>  Simple cards </h2><p>  Having learned the approximate course of the game, let's now find out how, according to the rules of the Uno card game, simple cards look like 108 in total.  So, simple cards are four suits - green, yellow, red and blue.  And each of these suits has 10 denominations - from 0 to 9. </p><h2>  The value of the “Pull 2” card </h2><p>  Having dealt with simple cards, now let's find out the meaning of action cards, which, according to the current Uno rules in Russian, can change the course of the game.  And one of these cards is the “Pull 2” card, which can be green, yellow, red or blue.  So, noticing that the player sitting next to you has few cards left, you will need to put it on the table so that this player collects two cards from his deck and skips the move.  However, it will be possible to lay it out only if the color of this card corresponds to the card lying on the playing surface, or another card “Pull 2” already lies there. </p><h2>  The value of the card "Change of direction" </h2><p>  Another important valid card, according to Uno rules, is the “Change direction” card, on which two arrows are drawn, pointing in different directions.  If a player puts this card on the playing surface, of course, either on the same action card or next to a card of the same color, then the game progresses to the opposite.  That is, initially the game progresses in a circle and the next one is always the player who sits to the left of the one who first begins to lay out his cards.  So, if this person lays out a card with arrows, then the next one will have to go not the one who sits on the left, but the one who sits on his right. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The value of the card “Skip” </h2><p>  Also in the Uno rules in Russian it is indicated that often the turning point in the game can be a laid-out “Skip Pass” card, which shows a crossed out circle.  As the name implies, if this card was laid out, it means that the next player skips the move, and the player following him goes instead.  If two are playing, then the next move is made by the same person who laid out this card on the playing surface.  And of course, you can put it only if it matches the color of the cards lying on the table or there is another card “Passage”. </p><h2>  What is a Wild Card? </h2><p>  No less important, according to the rules of the Uno game in Russian, is a card with the unusual name “Wild Card”, which depicts an oval divided into 4 multi-colored segments.  Unlike other action cards, it can be put regardless of whether there is another such “Wild card” on the table or a card with a certain color.  And the function of this card is to determine the further trump card of the game, that is, the color that the next player will have to lay out, unless, of course, he has another “Wild Card”.  Most often, they try to preserve this card in the end, so that later they can resemble at the most successful moment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="uno cards" class="if uuid-2393300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46461/2393300.jpg"></div><h2>  The meaning of the Wild Card “Pull 4” </h2><p>  But the most important, according to the rules of Uno, in this exciting game is the Wild Card “Pull 4”, on which we see an oval, in the center of which there are four multi-colored cards.  It’s worth putting this card, how you can order a trump card, and the next player draws four cards from the deck and skips the move.  However, there is a very important nuance!  Such a card can be posted only if you do not have a card of the desired color or dignity.  Of course, initially no one will be able to find out if you have the necessary cards, but if the next player doubts your honesty, he may ask you to reveal the cards.  And in the event that the muhlezh was confirmed, you will have to collect 4 cards instead, and that player will calmly play on, as if the Wild Card “Pull 4” was not in the game. </p><h2>  Game ending </h2><p>  A very important point of this game, according to the rules of Uno in Russian, is its ending.  Because at the same time that the player has only one card left, he is obliged to inform everyone present by shouting “Uno!”, Which means “One!” In Russian.  Indeed, in this case, the players will be able to do something and prevent the game from ending.  And if you forget to shout to the players that you have only one card left, but someone has time to notice it yourself, then you will have to draw 2 more cards from the pending deck, so you will be far away again until the end of the game. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bell-san.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="uno cards" class="if uuid-2393314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46461/2393314.jpg"></div><h2>  Fines in the game </h2><p>  And this is how our board game Uno ends.  The rules of the game, however, do not come to an end on this.  After all, they have one very important point, namely the presence of several game fines, which add to the game's excitement. </p><ol><li>  If during a game a player forgot to shout “Uno!” When he had one card left in his hands, while other players noticed it and showed a finger at him, shouting “Uno!”, Then the one who forgot to shout this word takes it from the buyout two cards. </li><li>  If during the game it was noticed how one player tells the other which card to go to, and they pointed him out, then the prompter should take two cards from the deck. </li><li>  If during the game the player either thought or simply wanted to cheat, looking like the wrong card, and was caught red-handed, he must take two cards from the deck. </li><li>  We have already said what happens if a player was caught red-handed when he went out the Wild Card “Pull 4”.  But in the event that a person, not believing in the sincerity of the player, told him to open the cards, and there it turned out that he did not have other cards suitable for the move, then this person should take as many as 6 cards from the deck. </li></ol><h2>  Scoring </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thisisinsider.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="play uno" class="if uuid-2393319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46461/2393319.jpg"></div><p>  After we have dealt with the fines, you can start calculating points for each player, which according to Uno rules is very easy and simple.  So, let's correlate all the cards with the points that they will bring to their owners, and therefore to the winner: </p><ul><li>  any card with numbers from 0 to 9 gives exactly the same points; </li><li>  Pull 2 ​​card gives 20 points; </li><li>  the card "Change of direction" gives 20 points; </li><li>  Wild Card gives 50 points; </li><li>  Wild card “Pull 4” gives 50 points. </li></ul><h2>  Uno Spin Rules </h2><p>  When the creators of the Uno game noticed that their game was already boring to the players, they decided to slightly diversify and supplement it, so the Uno Spin desktop appeared, which instantly got a bunch of fans.  This game has all the same rules as the classic Uno, however it is also supplemented by a small drum with an arrow and nine sectors on it, which each player spins before making his move.  And depending on which picture the arrow points to, the player, or even all players without exception, is obliged to complete one or another task.  Perhaps the player will have to draw cards from the deck until he finds the card of the desired color, or, conversely, he will be able to fold all cards of the same face value, or maybe he will have to fight with other players to lay out the largest card.  In any case, all these tasks are extremely exciting, so playing this type of board game Uno will be even more interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hobbysyjuguetes.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="uno spin" class="if uuid-2393340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46461/2393340.jpg"></div><h2>  Uno with interception </h2><p>  But we ourselves can somehow change and complicate the game by adding certain rules.  So, the classic Uno game can be diversified by adding the ability to intercept it.  It consists in the fact that any player can intercept the move from the player who must be like, having managed to put his card on the pile of cards, which must be exactly the same color and face value as the one that lies there.  And in this case, the player who was supposed to walk, loses his turn and waits for a whole circle, because the one who sits on his left hand throws a card next to the one who walked.  However, the Wild Card “Take 4” cannot be walked in this case, it can only be walked in turn. </p><h2>  Uno seven-zero </h2><p>  Even more exciting will be the Uno game "seven-zero", the rules of which, of course, fully coincide with the classic version of this board game.  However, cards of any color with numbers 0 or 7 play a very important role here. If a player puts a card with a face value of 0, then all players change their cards in a circle.  That is, each player gives his cards to his neighbor on the left hand.  If a player lays out a card with a face value of 7, then he can exchange his cards with any other player at the table at his discretion. </p><h2>  Uno Stacked </h2><p>  There is another interesting variation of this board game.  Naturally, the rules of the game in it are exactly the same as before, but there is some nuance.  So, if a player put a “Draw 2” card, and the next player has such a valid card, then he can not take two cards from the buy-in and skip the move, but immediately put his card.  But in this case, the player who must go after him will have to take four cards from the deck.  However, if he also has a “Draw 2” card, then he puts it, and the next player draws six cards.  And the exact same rules apply to putting the Wild Card “Take 4” onto the table, however, in this case, the players will have to take 8, 12, 16 cards and so on. </p><h2>  Interesting facts about the game </h2><div class="photo" data-original="store.playstation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="play uno" class="if uuid-2393323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46461/2393323.jpg"></div><p>  And finally, let's find out some interesting facts about Uno, which will allow you to show off erudition during the game process in front of other players. </p><ol><li>  The first mention of the specifics of this game can be found in materials dated 1930, however, it was officially registered only in 1971. </li><li>  At the moment, all rights to the implementation of the game belong to Mattel (USA), which also produces the world famous Barbie doll. </li><li>  There are a huge number of variations of Uno games.  So, for children under three years of age, Uno Junior games are released, and there is also a unique game Uno N <sub>2</sub> O, in which the cards are not cardboard, but plastic, half transparent and waterproof. </li><li>  The rules of this game are very similar to the rules of the famous game “101” in Russia, or as it is also called “Czech Fool”. </li><li>  Uno is the most famous card board game in the world, the number of sold copies of which is more than 150 million. </li></ol>
