The territory of the country is 8.512 000 square meters, which exceeds the area of ‚Äã‚Äãall European countries combined.  Most travelers are attracted to Amazonia, the mountainous regions, the capital of Brasilia, the Iguazu Falls, as well as the noisy and idle Rio de Janeiro. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brazil landmarks rio de janeiro" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/337725.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Brazil: Attractions Rio de Janeiro </h2><p>  Rio (the former capital of the country) is definitely one of the most picturesque cities in the world.  The southern vegetation, the blue of the sea in the Gulf of Guanabra, the green of the mountains and the abundance of the sun all year round - all this makes an unforgettable impression.  Separately, it is worth noting the beaches of Ipanama, Copacabana and Leblon.  Here you can lie around carelessly on a golden sand and swim for free in the cool blue water of the Atlantic Ocean. </p><p>  You can enjoy delicious local cuisine in the many restaurants and barbecue of Rio de Janeiro.  It is quite difficult to get around the sights of the city on foot.  Therefore, it is best to choose a comfortable bus where you can take a tour of the central part of the metropolis.  It houses the colonial period buildings, many skyscrapers, the picturesque Flamengo Park and the Candelaria Church, which is an exact copy of the cathedral, which is located in Rome.  It‚Äôs also worth seeing the library building, the Municipal Theater, the Marocan Stadium and the Cinelandia district with your own eyes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rio de janeiro attractions" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/337724.jpg?1392644792547" width="600"></div>

The sights of this metropolis are so diverse that in order to see them all, you will need to climb to the top of Mount Corcovado.  At an altitude of 710 meters is the Statue of Christ, which was built in 1931.  Its height is 125 feet and its arm span is 30 meters.  From this place the whole huge city is visible at a glance. </p><h2>  Sugar head </h2><p>  You can also look at the Rio panorama from a slightly different angle - from a mountain called Sugarloaf.  Its top can be reached in a few minutes by cable car.  The first stop is Mount Urka.  There is an extensive platform where numerous bars and restaurants are located, in which the amazing Mulatto Show takes place.  Further, directly on top of the Sugarloaf, there is a smaller observation deck.  From it, beaches, mountains, a <span>statue of Jesus Christ, the</span> island are perfectly visible. </p><h2>  Rio nightlife </h2><p>  <span>This metropolis</span> never sleeps.  The sea of ‚Äã‚Äãnight clubs, bars, discos, restaurants, small eateries on the beaches with its own show program attracts crowds of nightlife lovers to the city.  It is also impossible not to mention the Carnival, thanks to which Brazil is so famous.  The attractions of Rio de Janeiro will give all the tourists a real firework of unforgettable emotions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brazil sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/337723.jpg?1392644877198" width="600"></div>

The city was built from scratch in just 4 years.  The architects planned it in the form of a bird, in the middle of which there are administrative buildings, on the ‚Äúnose‚Äù is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Three authorities, and on the ‚Äúwings‚Äù are residential areas.  Along the axis of the metropolis is an ultramodern highway, on which there are almost no intersections.  Among the sights of the capital, it is worth highlighting the Metropolitan Cathedral, the black tower of the Central Bank, the Cathedral, the Botanical Garden, as well as the City Park, which houses mineral water pools. </p><h2>  Sao paulo </h2><p>  This city is the largest industrial center of the state.  S√£o Paulo makes a dual impression, as the metropolis cannot boast of special beauties.  But, on the other hand, such an incredible urban landscape, perhaps, can not be found anywhere else in Latin America.  Due to the fact that the metropolis is literally strewn with skyscrapers, factories, old residential neighborhoods, it was nicknamed "Latin American Chicago."  Such sights deserve special attention: the Museum of Modern Art, the Japanese Quarter, the Museum of Painting, the art gallery, the Museum of Brazilian History, the Museum of Impiranha, a zoo with a large collection of birds and others.  The city is home to about 13 million people of various nationalities.  Not far from S√£o Paulo are the resort areas of Ilya Bela and Ubatuba. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="main attraction of brazil" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/337728.jpg?1392644705146" width="433"></div>

    <h2>  Paraty </h2><p>  In addition to the bustling Rio, the unusual architecture of the capital and the urbanistic S√£o Paulo, much more can show you Brazil.  The sights of the country can be seen 280 km from Rio - in the city of Paraty.  Once, through this settlement there was a path along which gold and precious stones were transported.  Now Paraty is considered a national monument of the country and the most important example of colonial architecture. </p><h2>  Iguazu Falls </h2><p>  Iguazu is a real miracle created by nature.  These waterfalls are located on the border of three countries - Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil.  The Iguazu River is the border between Argentina and Brazil, and it flows into the Parana River, which separates Paraguay from Brazil.  Waterfalls formed at the place where these two rivers meet, forming huge cascades of water.  Sights of Brazil (photos of the waterfall are simply mesmerizing!) Without Iguazu it is difficult to imagine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="natural attractions of brazil" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/337727.jpg?1392644501863" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Amazonia </h2><p>  To get to the jungle of the Amazon, you must first fly to the airport of Manaus.  The population of the town consists of 80% of the Indians, which gives this place a special charm.  In this locality you can visit the Museum of the Indians, the Palace of the Palaciu Negru, the Museum of Man, the Church of San Sebastian, the Museum of Numismatics, as well as numerous floating markets.  Not far from Manaus is an amazing place where the rivers Rio Negro and Solimoes merge.  It is noteworthy that the waters of these two reservoirs do not mix, but flow over hundreds of kilometers with colorful ribbons. </p><p>  30 km from Manaus is a tourist attraction - a typical Native American village, extremely popular with tourists.  The flora and fauna of this region is amazing and have no analogues on the planet.  Here you can admire the water lilies, whose leaves in diameter reach more than one meter.  The flora of this area has been studied so far only by 30%.  Many substances that are in local plants are considered medicinal and are widely used in world pharmacology.  More than 1800 species of birds, 1500 of fish and 250 of mammals live in the forests of the Amazon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of brazil photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/337726.jpg?1392644554738" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All the natural attractions of Brazil can show the country in a completely different light.  <span>The Amazon River</span> with its tributaries is 20% of the fresh water reserves of the entire planet.  Terrible piranhas, a surprisingly beautiful <span>pink dolphin</span> and a huge bull fish live in the basin of this river.  Hunting alligators, canoeing along the numerous arms of the Amazon, traveling in the thick of the jungle, getting to know local customs - all this will give unforgettable emotions. </p><p>  Despite the fact that this country has a unique nature and unusual architecture, the main attraction of Brazil is its inhabitants.  They are always friendly with tourists and are ready to show guests the beauty and charm of their country. </p>
