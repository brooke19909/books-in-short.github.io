In just a few decades, it has turned from a backward colonial country into one of the most developed in the world, with the highest level of wealth.  A lot of interesting and original stories, sometimes completely incomprehensible to us, tell about Singapore, its laws, state structure, life.  Many tourists want to visit this country and see firsthand and see if all that is said about this state is true.  Singapore (see photo in the article) is also attractive for its urban solutions.  The metropolis, at first glance, resembles a city from the future.  Once here, you feel like on another planet.  There are many original and incomparable architectural structures.  For example, the building of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore is considered one of the masterpieces of world futuristic architecture.  Of course, not everyone can afford to stay at this hotel, but nevertheless, the hotel never experiences a shortage of guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marina bay sands in singapore" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/518522.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  This mysterious Singapore ... </h2><p>  Singapore is a tiny state in Southeast Asia.  It consists of many small islands located in the South China Sea, and is constantly lacking in area.  The name of this policy-state comes from the Malay word “singa”, which means “lion”.  In a word, Singapore is a southeastern “city of a lion” that could make a giant leap to a post-industrial level.  Millions of tourists visit this country every year.  Despite the fact that it is located in the middle of the sea, people most often come here, driven by curiosity, go for exotic, for new sensations.  Indeed, in this country there is a lot of things, the description of which begins with the epithet “the most”, for example, “the largest zoo” or “the largest oceanarium”, etc. But the building of the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore can be called one of the most original.  For many tourists, acquaintance with a metropolis begins precisely from it, right from the borate of the aircraft during landing.  The giant pool, towering above the city, leads many to the delight, but at the same time to bewilderment.  The bottom view is also striking.  The pool looks like a huge ark, resting on three huge columns.  In a word, Singapore has a lot of interesting things that may surprise even the most sophisticated tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Singapore hotel marina bay sands" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/518519.jpg" width="600"></div>
