Perhaps this is the same as going without a wallet to the store.  Thanks to the universal payment tool, you can easily pay for purchases, cash out anytime, anywhere, get loans, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tecraze.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank credit card insurance" class="if uuid-2938997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2938997.jpg"></div><h2>  Relative security of clients' financial assets on the maps </h2><p>  The financial means that the cardholder always has at hand are in relative safety.  It is relative because fraudsters have already invented more than one sophisticated way of appropriating the contents of people's cards to themselves. </p><p>  No one guarantees that such unpleasant situations will bypass a person, and his money will be safe and sound.  You should prepare for everything in advance, and in this case, the best solution is to apply for the ‚ÄúCard Protection‚Äù insurance policy from Sberbank.  This product is optional, however, bank employees strongly advise their customers to connect insurance as an additional protection card, which guarantees monetary compensation if an insured event still occurs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of Sberbank Card Insurance </h2><p>  In Sberbank, a plastic card insurance service is a reliable method of protecting financial resources in its account from illegal actions by intruders, as well as maximizing the security of the process of paying for services and goods in shopping centers, chains, cafes, shops and the Internet. </p><p>  Sberbank bank card insurance has several advantages: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.idfcbank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="voluntary insurance of credit card holders sberbank" class="if uuid-2938995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2938995.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Comfort and reliability.  Without exception, all bank card holders are given the opportunity to purchase an insurance policy without any special delay.  You can do this while visiting any branch of Sberbank, by contacting a competent banking officer or by yourself using a virtual network in the Sberbank Online program. </li><li>  Guaranteed safety of financial resources, no matter what actions were taken by intruders.  One insurance policy protects all cards held by the client and issued to his bank account. </li><li>  Benefit.  All owners connected to the ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù bonus program can save up to 15% of the cost of the purchased insurance policy. </li><li>  Using the ‚ÄúCard Protection‚Äù policy allows a client of Sberbank to insure the totality of his cards (basic, debit, additional and credit) for such an amount of insurance protection, which is set at the discretion of the holder. </li><li>  The term of the policy is one year.  The protection program begins to operate after fifteen calendar days from the time of its execution.  Insurance is valid for the card around the world around the clock. </li></ul><h2>  In what cases do you need financial insurance on a Sberbank card? </h2><p>  If you use the advantageous offers on card insurance, you can be sure of the insurance coverage of the cards in the following situations: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  shadow use of financial resources on the card holder by strangers; </li><li>  inability to manage money due to the loss of a plastic card. </li></ul><p>  What can Sberbank card insurance protect against? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.consumerreports.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank insurance card protection" class="if uuid-2938994" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2938994.jpg"></div><h2>  From fraud </h2><p>  Shadow use of financial resources from a bank card means the following: </p><ul><li>  disposal of an unauthorized stolen or found plastic card; </li><li>  withdrawing funds from the card after the personal signature of the account holder or plastic was forged at the cash desk of the Sberbank branch; </li><li>  receipt of a plastic card, as well as a PIN code suitable for it, as a result of a hooligan attack on the card holder or threats against him; </li><li>  theft from the plastic holder during the first two hours after the card was cashed in an ATM; </li><li>  the use of a fake plastic card in order to receive cash, pay for services and goods using this information on the original plastic; </li><li>  other unlawful actions to assign a card to third parties. </li></ul><p>  Sberbank card is also insured in case of loss.  The insurance cover applies to a bank card in the following situations: </p><ul><li>  theft; </li><li>  robbery on the owner of plastic; </li><li>  technical malfunction of the terminal or ATM; </li><li>  demagnetization or mechanical damage to the plastic card. </li></ul><p>  How much does Sberbank card insurance cost? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="insurance.exidelife.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank credit card insurance" class="if uuid-2938996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2938996.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The exact cost of the Card Protection insurance policy is determined by two main circumstances: </p><ul><li>  by concluding an insurance agreement - at a branch of Sberbank directly with the help of an employee of the organization or independently through the Sberbank Online system; </li><li>  the amount of insurance protection, the amount of which the cardholder determines at his discretion. </li></ul><p>  Now you can talk more about the cost of plastic card insurance services.  When applying for the ‚ÄúCard Protection‚Äù policy at the bank branch, the following prices will be charged: </p><ul><li>  if the amount of insurance is 120,000 rubles, then the policy will cost 1900 rubles; </li><li>  with the amount of 250,000 rubles - 3900 rubles; </li><li>  with an amount of 350,000 rubles - 5900 rubles. </li></ul><p>  When applying for a policy through the Sberbank Online system, the policy will cost: </p><ul><li>  for 120,000 rubles - 1710 rubles; </li><li>  for 250,000 rubles - 3,510 rubles. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="finance.nine.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank card insurance" class="if uuid-2938999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2938999.jpg"></div><h2>  Online cheaper </h2><p>  After analyzing these data, we can conclude that the minimum cost of the insurance policy is ensured by completing the contract through the Sberbank Online system independently in the client‚Äôs personal account.  The amount of this insurance will be the lowest.  If we compare the conditions of insurance policies, it is obvious that a plastic card to insure via the Internet is more profitable and easier.  For example, with a <span>bank</span> card <span>insurance of</span> 250,000 rubles directly at the financial institution itself, the policy will cost 3,900 rubles, while online transactions will cost less - 3,510 rubles. </p><p>  How does Sberbank credit card insurance go? </p><h2>  Credit Card Insurance Terms </h2><p>  Sberbank plastic card holders can insure them in order to protect themselves from intruders.  If an insured event occurs (for example, fraudsters cash out financial resources from a credit card, and the cardholder learns about it from an SMS message), then the insurance company will compensate for the loss in accordance with the selected insurance amount.  But in case of too much damage, if the stolen amount exceeds the insurance amount, the difference will not be refunded. </p><p>  To conclude a Sberbank card insurance contract with a bank, you must contact any branch and have your original passport with you.  In addition, you can insure your card via the Internet yourself. </p><p>  Sberbank credit card insurance is becoming increasingly popular. </p><h2>  Instruction manual </h2><p>  To issue an online policy, you can use the following instructions: </p><ul><li>  open the official website of Sberbank; </li><li>  then go to the tab "Insure yourself and your property"; </li><li>  stop the selection in the menu that opens on such an item as "Bank card insurance - apply online"; </li><li>  choose the amount for which the credit card will be insured; </li><li>  in the appropriate fields leave your details: passport data, registration address and other information; </li><li>  actions are confirmed by pressing a button; </li><li>  then an email will be sent to the client‚Äôs email with the ready-made ‚ÄúCard Protection‚Äù policy; </li><li>  after reading its contents, you can pay for the service using a bank card. </li></ul><p>  The entire procedure for voluntary insurance of Sberbank credit card holders online will not take even fifteen minutes, however, while the client‚Äôs payment instruments will be provided with reliable protection against intruders for a whole year. </p><h2>  Debit Card Protection </h2><p>  The card protection policy covers both credit and debit cards of Sberbank.  All debit cards at the client‚Äôs disposal can be insured against illegal use and unauthorized access. </p><p>  It does not matter in what way the policy was drawn up (in a bank or online), and the forms of agreement (paper or electronic), the insured cards will be under good protection, since all financial losses in the event of an insured event will be reimbursed for the amount of insurance chosen by the client. </p><p>  A paper and electronic contract of insurance of funds on the card of Sberbank act as equivalent documents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.banknizwa.om" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sberbank card insurance reviews" class="if uuid-2939000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2939000.jpg"></div><h2>  Is it possible not to insure a Sberbank card? </h2><p>  People who issued a bank card (especially a credit card) constantly faced the fact that a bank employee offered to add very beneficial insurance to the card, providing absolute protection and guaranteeing that in case of illegal control of finances from the card, its loss or theft the company compensates for the loss of the client. </p><p>  The legislation of the Russian Federation refers only to certain mandatory types of insurance, and here we are not talking about consumer insurance at all.  Therefore, any Sberbank card holder can absolutely absolutely refuse insurance that is imposed on him (including credit), and even after the fact, after the bank employee was able to convince the client of the high value and need for insurance and made him a policy. </p><p>  The insurance service for Sberbank credit card holders, as well as debit holders, is purely voluntary, and everyone determines for himself the degree of necessity and importance of this procedure.  There is only one minus - if the client refuses insurance, the bank can reduce the credit limit on the card or increase the interest rate (although this is rare, it is practiced since the bank insures first of all its possible risks caused by the issuance of the loan). </p><h2>  Insurance termination method </h2><p>  In order to refuse the insurance already issued, the client needs: </p><ul><li>  go to the nearest branch of Sberbank, taking with you the originals of the insurance policy and passport; </li><li>  voice your intentions to a bank employee; </li><li>  fill out an application of the appropriate form, which will indicate the reason for rejecting the service, as well as contact details. </li></ul><p>  The application for the rules is considered for two weeks, but in practice, the decision on the client‚Äôs case is made faster. </p><h2>  Sberbank Card Insurance Reviews </h2><p>  Only the owner himself can judge the appropriateness of insuring his card.  But to objectively evaluate and, accordingly, establish the degree of need for this service is not entirely simple.  In most cases, people refer to the feedback of other users who have a certain opinion on this matter, which is supported by practical experience.  So, what do Sberbank customers think about the plastic card insurance service and the policy? </p><p>  Some users say that, as unorganized people, they lost their salary cards, which just received a certain amount.  Naturally, they were upset and sometimes did not guess at once to block the card, as a result, in the evening a message came to the phone saying that they paid for the purchase in the store with a card.  After that, the bank employee‚Äôs offer to insure a new card is enthusiastically accepted by customers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="how2do8.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="voluntary insurance credit card sberbank" class="if uuid-2938998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2938998.jpg"></div><p>  Other users say that they have been cooperating with Sberbank for many years and they have never come in with insurance.  But at the same time, they never refuse insurance coverage, acting on the principle of "avaricious pays twice."  Now fraud fraudsters are so intricate that you can feel calm only with insurance. </p><p>  Some customers say that they were aggressively offered to make an insurance policy to protect the card when applying for a Sberbank credit card.  He had to cover losses.  However, the owners refuse, because they can not pull unplanned expenses and are not sure that they will need insurance at all. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, the opinions of Sberbank customers regarding the provision of additional card protection are divided.  Maybe this is because in our country the insurance system is just starting to work at its full potential, and many people are still not used to this practice.  However, every year the number of users who have voluntarily insured Sberbank credit cards, as well as debit, is steadily increasing. </p>
