Now on sale there is a huge selection of beads of different texture, color and quality, so the material can be selected suitable for a blouse or dress. </p><p>  In the article, beginner needlewomen will find information on how to easily create a dragonfly brooch.  A master class with step-by-step description and photographs will help you do the job quickly and without errors.  Knowing the technique of this craft, you can make not only a brooch, but also earrings or a pendant on a chain.  The principle of action is similar.  Let's start with the simplest option. </p><h2>  Dragonfly made of elongated beads </h2><p>  To make a dragonfly brooch yourself, you need a thin wire, tweezers or small pliers to make bends and turns, beads of different sizes. </p><p>  Let's start with the head of the insect, for which the largest part is selected.  We fold the wire 30 cm long in half and immediately put on a large green bead at two ends.  So that it rests on the product and does not fall out, the wire is twisted several times, making a loop with turns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="littlebeader.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="easiest bead brooch" class="if uuid-2779214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2779214.jpg"></div><p>  Next, the two ends of the wire are bred in different directions and put on medium-sized green beads on each of the parts.  Then you need to thread the ends in them as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  on the left, the wire stretches through two parts and exits on the right; </li><li>  on the right, the end is also inserted into two beads and stretched to the left. </li></ul><p>  Thus, the body of a dragonfly is firmly fixed in one place. </p><h2>  How to make wings and tail </h2><p>  The next step in the manufacture of dragonflies (brooches) will be stringing elongated parts in combination with small blue beads.  When the required wing length is reached, the wire is strengthened by pulling through the openings of the body parts. </p><p>  The second wing of the dragonfly is done similarly.  Only pre-strengthen two green beads for the body (2nd row), and only then engage in stringing small elements of the wing. </p><p>  The main part of the craft is assembled, you can smoothly proceed to the creation of the tail of the insect.  For this, two more rows of green and red are installed for the body, poking the wire through the holes, as at the beginning of the work.  Then the two ends are connected together and the details of the tail are already threaded immediately onto two wires.  Both elongated beads and small rounded details alternate.  The very edge of the wire is neatly bent into a small loop. </p><p>  The dragonfly brooch is ready, it remains to attach a pin to the wire and can be attached to a blouse or dress! </p><h2>  Another way of working </h2><p>  In the next embodiment of the craft, the function of the wings is performed by ready-made long beads.  The photo below clearly shows that all the details were put on the wire at once to create the body of the insect.  The order of their location on the wire does not need to be described, since it is perfectly visible in the photograph.  When all the parts are correctly worn, the ends of the wire are connected together and the elements of the insect's head are already strung on its two ends. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="creative-crafting-magazine.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make the body of a dragonfly from beads" class="if uuid-2779210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2779210.jpg"></div><p>  First, one small detail is put on, then a large one (actually the head), then several small ones complete the work, depicting a proboscis.  The edge of the wire is neatly twisted with a loop and hardened in several turns. </p><h2>  Tail section </h2><p>  The back of the insect is collected separately from alternating small cylindrical beads and beautiful large faceted elements. </p><p>  To connect with the body, buy a finished ring or twist it from the end of the wire, wrapping around the middle of the upper part of the craft. </p><div class="photo" data-original="creative-crafting-magazine.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a bead brooch" class="if uuid-2779207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2779207.jpg"></div><p>  Such a dragonfly can be worn both as a brooch and as a keychain on a bag.  Earrings will also turn out beautiful, while walking the tail will sparkle spectacularly from wiggle. </p><h2>  Original brooch </h2><p>  <span>The dragonfly made of beads</span> in the photo below is assembled on a more durable and springy wire, which is given the necessary shape only with the help of pliers, but parts of the craft retain the configuration chosen by the master and are not deformed. </p><p>  Production begins with the tail end.  The wire is wavy and the edge is twisted in a shallow loop.  Then put on 11 brown beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beaded dragonfly brooch" class="if uuid-2779200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2779200.jpg"></div><p>  Further, the end is turned with pliers to the right and beads are strung with alternating blue and dark blue, then the wire is wrapped in the opposite direction and crosses in the center.  Similar work is being done on the second opposing wing. </p><p>  In the same way, everything is repeated for large dragonfly wings, only here the beads take all the same.  Since the wire is twisted several times in the center for firm fixation, it is hidden under any decorative element.  In our sample, this role is played by a blue spiral of wire in a sheath.  You can dream up and come up with something of your own. </p><h2>  Gentle dragonfly </h2><p>  Let's look at another version of a dragonfly brooch.  Beads are selected transparent and with a blue tint, as well as in the form of small pearls.  Most of the craftsmanship is made by twisting silver thin wire, which gives the product tenderness, sophistication and airiness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="exquisite brooch" class="if uuid-2779215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2779215.jpg"></div><p>  In such painstaking work, you need to have a special tool and accurately measure the length of all parts so that all opposite parts of the dragonfly are symmetrical and the same size, otherwise the craft will look messy. </p><p>  In the article we examined several interesting dragonfly brooches from beads.  A master class with photographs of finished products will help to easily understand the principle of combining beads into a common composition.  And knowing the basics of beadwork, you can subsequently independently perform a variety of work.  Good luck </p>
