  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Rook of well-being" in Tolyatti: owner reviews, description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the Samara region, on the banks of the Volga River, the city of Togliatti is spread.  Its population is growing steadily and has already exceeded 700 thousand inhabitants.  This is due in no small part to the fact that the city has a city-forming enterprise - PJSC AvtoVAZ, which gives jobs to many citizens.  In addition to it, there are many industrial, manufacturing enterprises.  And the climate is very favorable in order to choose Togliatti as a place of permanent residence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="24." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bird's-eye view" class="if uuid-2323635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2323635.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of the cottage village </h2><p>  ‚ÄúRook of well-being‚Äù the owners' reviews earned almost one positive result in vain.  The developer chose a very good place to implement his project.  The village is located just 20 kilometers from the center of Togliatti, which allows its residents to easily get to work.  But at the same time, it guarantees a quiet life away from noisy enterprises and enjoyment of clean air.  If you leave the city on the Southern Highway, the path will be several minutes on a direct highway. </p><p>  The "boat of prosperity" in Tolyatti, according to living reviews, is an ideal place to stay.  The village has more than 500 townhouses, one-story and two-story.  Each family owns a land area of ‚Äã‚Äã3.5 acres, which is enough to place a barbecue on it and enjoy the rest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="samara-region.afy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Playground" class="if uuid-2323638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2323638.jpg"></div><h2>  Apartments in a cottage village </h2><p>  According to the owners, in the Rook of Well-being in Togliatti, each townhouse is fully landscaped and adapted to accommodate families of various sizes.  Here you can live as a lonely person in a one-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã33 square meters, or a large family - in a spacious three-room apartment, reaching 100 square meters.  All apartments have different layouts, which allows you to choose housing in accordance with your tastes and budget. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blagostroi-volga.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Already built houses" class="if uuid-2323641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2323641.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Built houses are equipped with all necessary utilities.  Water supply is started.  The issue of the possibility of connecting gas is being addressed.  According to the residents of the Rook of Well-being in Togliatti, already two streets are completely ready for the gas pipeline.  Residents are also satisfied with utility bills, which are relatively small compared to rents in the city itself.  This is because the village belongs to a rural settlement, electricity and gas tariffs are lower than city tariffs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A small kindergarten has already been built on the territory of the cottage village so that small residents do not experience inconvenience and can attend a preschool near the house.  In addition, according to the owners, in the ‚ÄúWell-being boat‚Äù in Tolyatti they plan to build a sports and fitness center with a swimming pool, a restaurant, a shopping center and shops.  This is not counting children's playgrounds and sports grounds, the protection of the cottage village and the stadium. </p><div class="photo" data-original="radver.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Townhouse in the village" class="if uuid-2323651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2323651.jpg"></div><h2>  Residents of the village </h2><p>  Currently, the cottage village, designed for 7,000 families, is almost completely populated.  Many have chosen it as a place of permanent year-round residence.  Therefore, customer reviews about the "Well of Rook" in Tolyatti can already be found.  Or hear them by talking to the public. </p><p>  Living in clean air away from industrial giants and the noise of the city, small utility bills, water from artesian wells - these are the main positive points that affect the choice of future residence.  But there are also negative ones.  Even with such indicators, many residents consider housing payments to be overpriced and have been trying to figure this matter out with the management company for a long time.  And there are three organizations in the village, by the way. </p><p>  Many reviews of owners about the "Well of Rook" in Togliatti are connected with poor-quality, in their opinion, building material from which they are made at home.  Some believe that when filling the foundation, all the regulations laid down in this case were not met.  In the social network "VKontakte" there is a group of "New buildings of Togliatti", in which you can see discussions of this cottage village as well.  Some rightly fear that they will get low-quality housing.  Many are worried, as already mentioned, the situation with utility bills and the struggle with the management company. </p><p>  But here everyone has the right to decide where and in which dwelling he lives.  In a noisy city with poor environmental conditions or to raise children in the fresh air, in a new house with a land plot.  Therefore, the reviews of the owners about the "Well of Rook" in Togliatti are different. </p>
