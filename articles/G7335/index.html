  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thailand All-Inclusive Hotels: Featured List, Addresses, Room Reservations and Guest Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For a long time, the all-inclusive concept of food in hotels in Thailand was simply not practiced.  And an explanation should be sought in the specifics of rest in this country.  In Egypt and even in Turkey, tourists often spend their entire vacation in the hotel complex.  There, lazy pastime for a ‚Äúgratuitous‚Äù cocktail is appropriate.  All Inclusive is a Turkish invention by hoteliers.  But Thailand, in principle, is another tourist country.  He takes a bright exotic, exciting excursions and, to be honest, the widest selection of exceptionally cheap food. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="15.870032" data-lng="100.99254100000007" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="4"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/8/5/9/17859.png"></div><p>  It is also necessary to take into account the fact that if in Egypt or Turkey a woman is considered shameful to go to a cafe alone, then in Southeast Asia, even in Muslim regions, there is no such sexist stereotype.  There are catering establishments for every taste and budget, including those with buffet service.  However, recently in Thailand there are hotels that practice the concept of AI ("all inclusive").  Their review will be carried out in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="5 Star All Inclusive Hotels in Thailand" class="if uuid-3234731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3234731.jpg"></div><h2>  When is it profitable to buy a tour to a hotel with AI </h2><p>  Agree, it will be a shame, having paid a lot of money for food in a hotel, to watch how right at the gates there is a market, where they sell and immediately cook king shrimps, lobsters, crabs, dorado and much more for the buyer.  And most importantly, all this gastronomic splendor is available for a penny.  So that the client was not disappointed, the hotel should provide him at least the same, if not better.  Therefore, do not be surprised that the lion's share of all-inclusive hotels in Thailand is 5 stars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such hotels take not only first-class food, but also a range of other "free" services.  In fairness, it should be noted that there are four-star hotels with all inclusive.  But they are usually located in quiet, secluded places, on small islands or in the distant outskirts of cities such as Pattaya or Hua Hin.  The infrastructure around such hotels is poorly developed, and it makes sense to buy an all-inclusive package.  If you are traveling to Thailand with a small child who is not used to exotic exotic food, then it is also advisable to choose a hotel with AI. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Thailand - All Inclusive Hotels" class="if uuid-3234732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3234732.jpg"></div><h2>  Top 5 Best Thailand All-inclusive 5 Star Hotels </h2><p>  For the sake of lazy tourists who come to a foreign country to do just that, to fill up with "gratuitous" alcohol, such a concept worked even in Bangkok.  This metropolitan city meets European standards of impeccable relaxation.  Therefore, the first place in the ranking of the best hotels in the country with AI is Marriott Executive Apartments Mayfair Bangkok.  This representative office of the Marriott network in Bangkok consists of apartments with kitchens, but offers everyone who wants to relax without the hassle, with free food in the restaurant or room service.  The hotel is located in a quiet side street of Soi Langsuan 60, in the Lumpini area, near two metro stations.  There is a swimming pool on the roof of the 26-story building. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second place in the ranking is occupied by another hotel chain - ‚ÄúHoliday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Hao Beach‚Äù.  It is located on the largest island of Thailand at the address: 81, Moo3, Tumbol Mai Khao Amphur, 83. Mai Hao beach is very quiet, almost deserted, which explains the concept of "all inclusive". </p><p>  In third place is Amari Watergate Bangkok.  The 32-story hotel building is located at 847 Petchburi Road, Payathai. </p><p>  The penultimate place on the list is the hotel in Pattaya "Wellcome Ward Beach Resort and Spa."  It is located on one of the cleanest beaches in the city, on the outskirts of Jomtien. </p><p>  And closes our top 5 all-inclusive hotels Anantara Bophut Koh Samui Resort.  This hotel is located near the small village of Bophut on Koh Samui.  The hotel takes impeccable service.  At dinners, jazz music or fire shows are held. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelhoteltours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="All Inclusive Hotels in Bangkok" class="if uuid-3234742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3234742.jpg"></div><h2>  All Inclusive and Private Beach </h2><p>  It is no secret that Russian tourists often travel to magical Thailand not at all to go to see cultural sights or immerse themselves in Buddhist spirituality, but for a relaxing holiday by the sea.  Therefore, the hotel has its own beach for them - a priority.  In the previous list, we had two metropolitan hotels.  Let's now take a look at the best seaside five-star all-inclusive hotels in Thailand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you book the Muang Samui Spa Resort through Booking, you will see that its rating is quite high - 8.8 out of 10 possible points.  ‚ÄúMuang 5 *‚Äù is located in the city of Chaweng, along Moo Street.  Pullman Hotel Hotel J is located on the northern outskirts of Pattaya.  Free tuk-tuks ply into the city center, and the complex itself is planted with orchids and equipped with artificial waterfalls.  The third place of honor on the first line of all-inclusive hotels is occupied by SALA Resort and Spa 5 *.  It is located in Phuket, on the remote and clean Mai Khao Beach beach. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="All Inclusive Thailand Hotels with Private Beach" class="if uuid-3234753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3234753.jpg"></div><h2>  We go to Thailand with children: all-inclusive hotels </h2><p>  Parents know that rest is possible for them only if their child is busy with something.  Therefore, when choosing a hotel, they are guided by the presence of a mini club.  Sentara Grand Fratamnak 5 * in South Pattaya has two such establishments at once - for children and teenagers, and also a lazy river with waterfalls and caves.  Avani Resort &amp; Spa 4 * is also located in this resort, but in the very center, on 218-2 Beach Road.  This hotel captivates with a children's menu. </p><p>  Dusit Thani Laguna is located in Phuket, on Bang Tao Beach.  The hotel offers young guests a wonderful swimming pool, a mini club, a special menu and a catamaran ride on an artificial lake.  Family vacations will be cloudless at the Royal Cliff Hotels Group.  However, when booking a room, you should clarify that you want to settle in the Beach building.  This part of the hotel complex on the outskirts of Pattaya is located almost on its own beach.  A gentle entrance to the sea is ideal for bathing young children.  For them, entertainment and a special menu are thought out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.royalcliff.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="All Inclusive Thailand Hotels for Children" class="if uuid-3234757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3234757.jpg"></div><h2>  An overview of all-inclusive hotels in the resorts of Thailand.  Phuket </h2><p>  There are many smiles in the Kingdom of regions (including coastal ones) in the Kingdom, but a Russian tourist paved a wide pole road for only a few of them.  These are the islands of Phuket and Samui, as well as the city of Pattaya.  For a long time, even talking about "all inclusive" in these resorts was considered a bad manners.  Most hotels offered breakfast only, rarely half or full board.  And now hotels in Phuket (Thailand, ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù) give their guests the opportunity to choose their own food concept - BB, HB, FB or AI. </p><p>  One can only wonder how cleverly the staff is guided by the color of the bracelets in the categories of guests.  We have already mentioned all-inclusive Phuket hotels.  It remains to supplement the list.  This is Club Med 5 * on Kata Beach;  <span>D Varee Mai Khao Beach</span> 4 * on the wonderful quiet and deserted coast of Mai Khao;  the neighbor of the previous hotel is Dream Resort &amp; Spa Natai 5 *;  "Centara Grand West Sands Resort and Villas" and "Double Three Resort by Hilton 4 *". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.clubmed.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="All Inclusive Hotels in Phuket" class="if uuid-3234760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3234760.jpg"></div><h2>  Samui </h2><p>  On this island in the Gulf of Thailand in Thailand, all-inclusive hotels are less common than in Phuket.  Be sure to remember the representation of "Sheraton" on Samui.  The hotel is impeccable in everything except one: it is located between Chaweng and Lamai and is located on a hillside.  Therefore, going down and going up to the beach will be hard for the elderly and small children. </p><p>  Tourists leave commendable reviews about the Centara Villas Hotel.  It is located on the quiet Laem Set Beach.  The lack of infrastructure near the hotel led to the all-inclusive concept.  Tourists noticed only one minus - tangible ebbs, during which the sea recedes far from the beach.  On the third place of Samui hotels with AI is ‚ÄúShiva 4 *‚Äù with a rating of 7.8 out of 10 possible points.  Meals and services at this hotel located in Lamai are pulled by a solid five. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ampersandtravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="4 Star All Inclusive Hotels in Thailand" class="if uuid-3234764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3234764.jpg"></div><h2>  Pattaya </h2><p>  The youth and budget resort, which has earned fame as the capital of the Thai sex industry, is not at all designed for a measured, relaxing vacation inside the hotel.  In addition, the dirty beaches and muddy bottom of the sea force tourists living in the city to travel to nearby islands every day.  Therefore, the resort has the least all-inclusive hotels in Thailand. </p><p>  Pattaya nevertheless is a large city, one might even say agglomeration.  Therefore, it makes sense to look for all-inclusive hotels on the northern and southern outskirts of the resort.  We have already mentioned them above.  However, in this case it is not necessary to count on a budget vacation. </p><h2>  Krabi </h2><p>  The southern province of the country has not yet been fully mastered by Russian tourists.  And in Krabi, Thailand has the least all-inclusive hotels.  This is especially tight here.  Only one hotel at the moment has implemented this concept of food and services.  It is called "Sofitel Krabi Fokitra Golf and Spa Resort 5 *".  Tourists leave the most enthusiastic reviews about it.  The gripe is only the coast.  The ebb on the hotel's own beach is very tangible.  During them, the bottom is strewn with debris of coral. </p><h2>  Khao Lak </h2><p>  The reserve island is positioned as a place of calm and measured family or romantic vacation.  All inclusive hotels in Khao Lak are also numerous because it is located near Phuket.  And this island, as we recall, was the first in the country to introduce the concept of AI and even UAI.  A characteristic feature of Khao Lak is a large number of 4 star all-inclusive hotels. </p><p>  Thailand offers for recreation and cheaper hotels, but in them the tourist can only hope for breakfast included in the price.  The most praised hotels in Khao Lak are ‚ÄúThe Sands by Katatani 4 *‚Äù, ‚ÄúApsara Beachfront Resort and Villa 4 *‚Äù and ‚ÄúCentido Graceland Resort and Spa 5 *‚Äù. </p><h2>  North of the country </h2><p>  Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai - these are places of exclusive sightseeing in Thailand.  All-inclusive hotels here are a rarity.  After all, tourists immediately after breakfast go to travel to the mountains and temples.  But the seeker will always find.  And so we found for you several all-inclusive resort hotels where guests are fed, watered and still taken on excursions. </p><p>  The best of these is the five-star Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp.  This tourist camp is located in the middle of the jungle, 57 kilometers from Chiang Rai, between the villages of Chiang Saen and Mae Sai.  Very good reviews are provided by guests of the three-star Tao Garden Health Spa and Resort Chiang Mai Hotel.  True, the hotel is about 30 kilometers from the city.  Tourists assure that here you can not only have a good rest and get acquainted with the culture of Northern Thailand, but also improve your health. </p>
