The pattern is simple, but the finished craft allows you to solve a number of educational problems.  Felt, drape as a basis - a fertile material for children's crafts.  It is bright, of different thicknesses, softness, colors, does not crumble.  The most diverse images are obtained from it: fruits, vegetables, animals, birds, trees.  Felt toys are used as a decorative decoration, applique, educational aid.  Consider the example of a hedgehog function homemade toys. </p><h2>  Decorative hedgehog made of felt </h2><p>  The pattern is a solid oval with a muzzle, nose, ears, leaves, needles.  Apply paper patterns to felt.  You will need two ovals with a rounded nose of beige color, one red circle for the nose, two beige oblong ears, ten zigzag brown stripes of needles, two green leaves, red and gray beads, a filler. </p><p>  First, you have all the details on the basis, then you start work.  Then sew gray eyes, embroider your mouth.  Now you bite your nose, stuff it with a padding polyester, tighten the thread.  Next, from the end, sew the needles to the halves of the hedgehog.  Sew on the ears on the fourth strip of needles, and leaves and berries on the first.  Now sew the halves of the hedgehog, sew the nose, fill it with padding polyester, finish the job with a blind seam. </p><p>  It turned out a multifunctional hedgehog made of felt.  If you sew a loop, there will be a Christmas toy.  If you make one-sided hedgehogs and sew them to a long ribbon - there will be an original garland. </p><h2>  How to use? </h2><p>  Such a hedgehog is good as an application for clothes, bags, backpacks.  Then a fine felt will do.  The nose will be thin, and a synthetic winterizer will not be required, that is, the crafts will be flat, one-sided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hedgehog from felt pattern" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1491951.jpg" width="505"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you use different fillers from cereals, legumes, seeds, seeds, musical fastening, you get a developing rattle.  Then the filling goes in parallel with sewing.  For example, fill your head with buckwheat, sew a hedgehog, fill it with a synthetic winterizer, sew through two rows of needles, pour millet and completely sew up the craft.  Reviews of mothers say that even the smallest children are willing to play with such toys, because they make different sounds and are so pleasant to the touch. </p><p>  Thanks to multi-row needles, a developing hedgehog made of felt was obtained.  Pattern of fruits, berries, vegetables, mushrooms, leaves, flowers is made according to any pattern from children's coloring.  Then the hedgehog's needles should be long, made of hard felt, so that the "crop" is inserted like in a pocket.  Such a felt hedgehog can be used as a toy for didactic studies, theatrical performances or as an element of a developmental book. </p><h2>  Hedgehog as a didactic allowance </h2><p>  The child should be surrounded by different toys, then, using their example, you can show the general and distinctive signs of appearance in comparison with people.  To do this, print patterns of hedgehogs and other animals from coloring books, cut parts, translate into felt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multifunctional hedgehog made of felt" class="if" height="465" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1491952.jpg" width="579"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this case, you need to think through the training task of the manual.  If you develop sensory activity, diversify the filler (peas, beans, buckwheat, chickpeas, millet, semolina, dried herbs, flavorings, salt, cotton wool, synthetic winterizer), texture and fabric color for additional elements (drape, satin, cotton, wool, fur) , fastenings of the "crop" (adhesive tape, buttons, buttons, zippers, ropes). </p><p>  If you want to consolidate speech, mathematical, cognitive skills, think over additional elements.  It can be a hedgehog made of felt with a heart, vegetables, fruits, geometric shapes, mushrooms, flowers, transport ... With these elements, you can "immerse" the hedgehog in a fairy tale, play psycho-gymnastic or finger games, physical exercises. </p><h2>  Educational book </h2><p>  It is a large fabric book with numerous heroes, objects that move and attach to the pages in different ways.  Standardly, one book is dedicated to one fairy tale, story, and each page gradually reveals the plot.  That is why, at first, the action and manipulations with the subject are carefully thought out based on the anatomical age, individual characteristics of the child. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of a hedgehog from felt for a developmental book" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1491929.jpg" width="559"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Next, determine the size of the book, heroes, items.  Their patterns are made on different fabrics.  At the same time, the pattern of a hedgehog from felt for a developmental book can be in several versions according to clothing, appearance, growth.  Sew all removable items that are fastened with Velcro, buttons, buttons.  They help change the main character.  For example, there was a <span>fairy tale about a hedgehog,</span> but it became about a chicken. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, inside there may be different filler in texture, sound, smell.  For example, inside the peach there is one big seed, the apple is rustling, the strawberries are covered with seed beads.  Then on the pages of the book (not yet sewn together) place the fasteners, ropes with objects. </p><h2>  One book example </h2><p>  The younger the child, the fewer pages the book should have.  For example, a fairy tale about a hedgehog and his friends.  All morning the hedgehog Temka thought his friends would give him a birthday.  Perhaps Bunny will pick up wildflowers, and Bear will make a cake ... In anticipation of friends Temka decided to go for fruit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="developing hedgehog from felt pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1491931.jpg" width="533"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  When he arrived, friends were waiting for a hedgehog with gifts.  And what was Temko‚Äôs surprise when Bunny presented fresh flowers in a pot that will delight the birthday boy for many years.  Yes, and Bear distinguished himself at this holiday by presenting a rainbow carpet.  Together, friends drank tea and went to play in the clearing. </p><p>  Based on the plot, you make in several versions three heroes (bear, hare, hedgehog).  From felt, the pattern should be in profile, full face, with different emotions.  How do you think over the elements?  Flowers in a clearing with different mounts, stem length, number of petals or insects.  The cake will be with different toppings and removable decoration berries.  In potted flowers, thanks to the stalks-laces, you can change the middle button. </p><h2>  Developing mat </h2><p>  When making a book, more time is spent stitching the outer fabric and lining, attaching all the pages to the cover.  You can simplify the sewing process and build a developing <span>gaming mat.</span>  It can be sewn whole or flaps.  In the first version, you will need fabric for the front and back sides of the mat, lining (synthetic winterizer, old baby blanket). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself hedgehog from felt patterns" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1491949.jpg" width="570"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  First you place objects and applications on the facial tissue.  Then flash the necessary elements, mounts.  An integral carpet can be of any geometric shape, with objects of different sizes, and it can be a finished image (sun, snail, car, pond, tree, hedgehog).  From felt, the pattern is not made of the entire carpet, but of individual small details (parts of the face, vegetables, fruits). </p><p>  Patchwork rug is a stitched uniform squares, rectangles, triangles, polygons between each other.  Such products are easy to manufacture, since applications, pockets, fasteners are sewn on small segments.  Then the front side of the mat is sewn with a single lining and the wrong side. </p><h2>  Gift "hedgehog" sets </h2>

    <p>  Hedgehogs as a gift will delight adults and children.  Here are some ideas: </p><ul><li>  a set of finger felt toys; </li><li>  a set of a family of hedgehogs in the shape of mittens, like a Bibabo doll; </li><li>  voluminous textile hedgehogs (patterns for sewing soft toys, we discussed above); </li><li>  apron for bottles in the form of animals; </li><li>  set of appliques for clothes; </li><li>  hedgehog-shaped slippers; </li><li>  curly pillows; </li><li>  needle hedgehogs; </li><li>  hedgehog mat for the bathroom; </li><li>  cover for notebook, diary; </li><li>  hedgehog warmer on the kettle. </li></ul><p>  For example, to sew a textile hedgehog, you will need two blanks of the body, one abdomen, needles, nose, eyes.  Two halves of the body are sewn with the abdomen, a hole is left.  Fill the hedgehog with a synthetic winterizer, adjust the shape, sew the seam with a hidden stitch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="textile hedgehogs patterns" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/1491926.jpg" width="347"></div>

        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Next, make a circle, put the filler, tighten the thread, sew the nose to the muzzle.  For the eyes, take large black beads.  Now it remains to sew the needles.  It can be colored small square rags, petals of artificial apple trees, sakura or violets, felt leaves, fur.  Needles are either individually sewn to the body, or before stitching with the abdomen, the body parts are flashed with flaps. </p><h2>  Little tip </h2><p>  You can get any hedgehog from felt (with your own hands).  Patterns will suit both special, for sewing toys, and copied from coloring books or home-made.  Before sewing, decide on the purpose of the product, prepare all the material and start sewing.  Felt toys are sewn across the face, and fabric toys from the inside, so do not forget about allowances for seams. </p>
