This is a quiet district center, quite inconspicuous - a typical five-story building, wide streets with rare cars, the Culture House, several monuments and a beach area. </p><p>  But you can come here for the sake of amazing nature, striking in its imagination and ingenuity.  Why is there only one road leading to the cities - eight kilometers winds along the coast of Lake Ladoga, so that on the one hand there are cliffs and a dense pine forest covered with moss, and on the other - the blue surface of the lake, smooth as glass, in calm weather. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful and history-rich cities in Karelia is Pitkäranta.  It was founded in 1966, translated from <span>Finnish, the</span> name means "long coast".  The territory on which it is located was inhabited by the tribes of hunters and fishermen eight thousand years ago, and from the end of the 11th century the ancient population of Korela lived here.  24 monuments of those times have been preserved, you can see them on the coast and skerries of Ladoga. </p>

    <p>  The first mention of the village, which used to be called Kondushi, dates back to 1500, then it consisted of only three courtyards with a population of 30 people, but after 150 years there were 7 courtyards, and the number of inhabitants grew to 50. Most of the territory was farmland, hunting, as a way of obtaining food, has faded into the background. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of the 17th century, Swedes came to this land, with their presence they connect the most ancient historical site of the region - Varashev stone, established as a border sign between Russia and Sweden in 1918. </p><p>  After the defeat of Sweden in the Northern War, Pitkäranta returned to the Russian lands.  But in 1812, by decree of Alexander I, it passed to the Grand Duchy of Finland; again, the city became Russian territory only in 1940. </p><p>  Pitkäranta gained fame thanks to scientists - metallurgists, geologists and miners.  They talked about an unusual almadine stone the color of blackberry juice, found copper and tin ore.  Ore mining and processing plants began to be built one after another, and a glass factory appeared after them, whose products were famous for their special strength and quality no worse than the European level.  Mines operated until the middle of the 20th century, but their remains can be seen now. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city of Pitkäranta in the <span>Republic of Karelia</span> stretches in a narrow strip along <span>Lake Ladoga.</span>  It is distinguished by magnificent landscapes - dense taiga, rocks, waterfalls, many rivers and lakes, canyons, skerries and sandy hills.  Together with the rich flora and fauna, the area is a unique natural museum where you can get acquainted with various rocks and geological structure. </p>

The border with Finland is only 115 kilometers (the border checkpoint "Vyartsilya"). </p>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Like almost all of Karelia, in Pitkäranta the climate is continental and mild.  In mid-summer, the temperature usually stays in the region of + 16 ° C, and in winter it drops to -9.5 ° C. </p><p>  The weather is strongly influenced by winds from the Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean. </p><h2>  Economy and Population </h2><p>  The population of the city of Pitkäranta of the Republic of Karelia has been steadily decreasing since 1996, if only 14,700 people lived here ten years ago, now it’s only 10,530. Such a strong outflow of the population is explained by an acute shortage of jobs, inability to get a higher education, and a weak cultural entertainment, bad medicine.  Young people are increasingly leaving in search of a better life in larger cities - Petrozavodsk, St. Petersburg and Moscow. </p>

    <p>  The economic basis of the city is forestry, pulp and paper and woodworking industry, which gives 4% of the total production of the whole republic. </p><p>  Outside of Karelia, Pitkaranta is known not only for the beauty of Ladoga skerries, but also as the most convenient starting point to the famous island of Valaam. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  <em>Museum of Local Lore named after V.F.</em>  <em>Sebina</em> </p><p>  The museum has a large and varied collection of antiquities that tell about the life and culture of the peoples who previously lived in Pitkäranta, as well as the history of the founding of the city and the development of industry. </p><p>  <em>House of Culture</em> </p><p>  In this building, ongoing reviews of urban folklore groups are held, interest groups are working here, which try to involve not only young people, but also the older generation. </p><p>  <em>Monument to V.I. Lenin</em> </p><p>  A sculpture dedicated to the leader of the proletariat can be found in the heart of the city.  It does not constitute a special artistic value, but it brings diversity to a rather dull city landscape. </p><p>  <em>District Peryakul</em> </p><p>  The most ancient of all urban areas, it may interest old, recognized monuments, houses. </p><p>  There are no more attractions in the city.  To go for amazing and beautiful places is a little further, where there are waterfalls, Ladoga skerries and the path to the island of Valaam.  Just look at the photo of Pitkäranta - and Karelia will beckon to her. </p>

    <h2>  Pulp mill </h2><p>  Special mention should be made of the former breadwinner of the city, the <span>city-forming enterprise</span> for the production of cellulose - the Pitkyaranta plant, all its types are produced here - commodity, electrical insulation and condenser.  In addition to it, coniferous turpentine and tall crude oil were produced. </p><p>  It was founded in 1921 by Diesen Wood on the island of Pusunsaari, separated from the city by a narrow part of the Gulf of Pitkäranta.  Before the advent of the railway, it was necessary to transport products along Ladoga, and in winter they saved the horse's position. </p><p>  In the future, the plant was reconstructed more than once, equipped with the most modern equipment, but five years ago the management declared bankruptcy.  This event dealt a severe blow to the city’s economy, the outflow of the population increased significantly and continues to grow every year. </p>
