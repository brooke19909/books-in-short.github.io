General rules for check-in and check-out</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A trip to a foreign city makes it necessary to search for housing where you can stay for a while.  Most often, the choice of place to check in falls on the hotel, so it is extremely important to know about the checkout time.  You must also familiarize yourself with how the calculation of the cost of living is. </p><h2>  What is checkout time? </h2><p>  As a rule, in each hotel two times of such an hour are established: upon check-in and upon eviction of guests.  In most cases, check-in time is 14.00 and check-out is 12.00.  A sign must be installed at the reception desk informing guests of the check-out time at the hotel.  Sometimes guests wonder why check-out is two hours earlier than check-in.  It is necessary to understand here that the hotel‚Äôs economic service needs to have time to wet clean the room and replace bedding and bath accessories after the departure of the previous guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homecleaningforyou.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maid service" class="if uuid-2681860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2681860.jpg"></div><p>  During check-in, payment is made for the hotel room, as well as information about the services provided in the hotel.  Upon departure, the hotel is handed over to the administrator of the hotel, payment for accommodation, if it was not made upon arrival, and preparation of reporting documents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.linguahouse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Registration reporting documentation upon departure" class="if uuid-2681852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2681852.jpg"></div><h2>  Early check in and late check out </h2><p>  Many hotels provide guests with check-in services before checkout time and check-out after it.  It is very convenient for travelers.  In order to be able to check into the room before 14.00, it is necessary to check with the reception service at the hotel if there are any rooms that correspond to the category you have chosen.  Payment for early check-in is subject to the rates established by the hotel management.  Most often, if check-in is carried out an hour or two before check-out time and there are free rooms ready for check-in, then payment for this time of stay is not charged from the guest.  According to the rules, check-in from 0 to 12 hours of the day preceding the booked is calculated as half the cost of a day of stay.  If there are no ready-to-check-in rooms available, the administrator can offer the guest to leave their luggage in the hotel‚Äôs luggage room and relax in the lobby bar, or advise where you can spend time in the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.meininger-hotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Luggage room at the hotel" class="if uuid-2681864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2681864.jpg"></div><p>  The possibility of extending your stay after 12.00 also depends on the availability of rooms.  In most hotels, the cost of late check-out is calculated as follows: from 12 to 18 - the hourly payment, which depends on the category of the room and its cost per day.  From 18 to 00 payment is made for half a day.  Check out after midnight is paid in full. </p><h2>  Guest and hotel services during eviction </h2><p>  Upon eviction from the room during check-out time, the guest must make sure that he has collected all his belongings and has not forgotten anything.  After which the guest goes down to the reception and gives the administrator the keys to the room.  The administrator asks the maids to accept the room in order to ensure that the hotel property has not been damaged or stolen.  After the maid makes sure that there are no problems in the room, she informs the administrator about this, who prepares the guest documentation for the guest and helps to call a taxi if necessary. </p>
