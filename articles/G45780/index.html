City architecture</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In March 1999, a new city of Aktobe appeared on the maps of Kazakhstan and the world, the former Aktobe for more than a hundred years.  The etymology of the name is based on a combination of the words ‚Äúak‚Äù and ‚Äútyube‚Äù, which means ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and ‚Äúhill‚Äù in the Turkic languages, respectively.  Previously, one could also come across a name such as Belovershinsk.  Cretaceous rocks, which come to the surface where the soil layer is destroyed by erosion, give color to the hill.  The word ‚Äúak‚Äù can also be translated as ‚Äúspiritually pure‚Äù, ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù, ‚Äúundefiled‚Äù, which gives the name of the city a slightly different, majestic meaning. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city of Aktobe was founded on the left bank of a rather large (over 600 km long) tributary of the Urals - the Ilek River - in the area where the Kargaly River flows into it, but due to the steadily developing construction, it ‚Äúcrossed‚Äù the river and began to develop the right bank.  It is approximately in the center of the Podural Plateau, in the northwestern part of Kazakhstan, near the border with Russia.  To better imagine where the city of Aktobe is located, let us call its location relative to the nearest large settlements and objects.  It is about 230 km from Orenburg, 500 km from Ufa, 430 km from Uralsk and 550 km from the nearest coast of the Caspian Sea.  You can get to Aktobe by any means of transport - air, rail, road.  The federal highway M32 (future A300), leading to the Samara and Orenburg regions, the A24 to Martuk and A27 to Atyrau pass through the city.  In addition, through Aktobe laid the largest highway "Europe - Western China", which is called the "modern silk road." <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aktobe city" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1053042.jpg" width="541"></div>

He grew out of the military fortification of Ak-Tyube, founded here in 1869 by two companies of foot soldiers and a hundred Cossacks, commanded by the count, who was in the rank of Adjutant Wing, von Borg.  Before the arrival of the military, nomads lived here mainly engaged in cattle breeding.  Not everyone was happy about the appearance of strangers.  So, the detachment commanded by Bekbauov tried to conduct military operations against them, but after the first defeat from the Cossacks surrendered.  Around the military fort, people gradually settled.  By 1891, the settlement had grown so much that it received the status of a county town called Aktyubinsk.  Its successful development was facilitated by the railway line, which appeared here in 1902 and connected the town with Tashkent and Orenburg.  The development of industry also led to the emergence of a revolutionary-minded working class.  Already in 1905 the party of the RSDLP was created in the city.  After the revolution, Aktyubinsk several times passed from the hands of the Bolsheviks to the hands of the White Guards and vice versa, until, finally, on September 2, 1919, the Soviet government was finally established in the city with the support of the aviation of those years in the city.  At first, Aktyubinsk belonged to the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, but in 1936, when the <span>Kazakh SSR was</span> formed on the territory of the RSFSR <span>, it</span> joined its composition.  In 1990, Kazakhstan became an independent state, and after 9 years, Aktyubinsk received a new name - the city of Aktobe.  For his not-so-long life, a lot of bad and good things happened.  In the first years of Soviet power, when the young state was strangled from all sides, and it was incredibly difficult to get on its feet, Aktobe residents experienced hunger (1919-1922) - at that time, according to official figures, about 1000 people died.  Further from mistakes in economics and politics, there was a second famine (1932-1933), which claimed the lives of about 4,500 citizens.  There were so few products in those terrible years that people ate the bark of trees and clay, and there were cases (documented, by the way) that of each other.  Despite these horrors, housing was being built in the city, water and electricity were being developed, and landscaping was being carried out.  And only everything began to improve, as the war broke out.  About a dozen plants and factories from Moscow, Zaporozhye, and Dnepropetrovsk were evacuated to Aktyubinsk.  After the war, the rapid development of the economy of Aktobe began, large-scale construction of housing, expansion of the city's infrastructure.  Almost all the objects created then function now. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akim of Aktobe" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1053027.jpg" width="559"></div>

Deputies to each maslikhat are elected by the residents of the locality to which it belongs.  Akimat (city administration) is formed by akims, and its structure is approved by maslikhat.  The administrative apparatus includes deputies, employees of various departments, employees of the management of economic structures, resources, activities of enterprises and organizations.  Akims of large territorial units (capital, regions) are appointed by the president.  Akim of the city of Aktobe is appointed endowed with broader powers of the Akim of Aktobe region.  The first in Aktobe was occupied by E. Sagindykov, Doctor of Economics, a person with extensive experience.  Before becoming the head of the city administration, E. Sagandykov worked as a physical education teacher at the school, as a master of vocational training in vocational schools, then rose to leading posts in the field of vocational education.  He managed to work in the regional committee of the CPSU of Kazakhstan, and also served as deputy minister of education and consultant in the Supreme Council.  E. Sagandykov worked as Akim in Aktobe until 2004, until he received the post of head of administration of the entire Aktobe region.  Now Akim of Aktobe is Bekbol Sagyn, a lawyer by profession, a bachelor.  He was appointed to this high post in 2015.  The akimat building is located on the central avenue named after Abilkayyr Khan (former Lenin Ave.). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Old part of town </h2><p>  There is an unofficial division into two almost equivalent parts of Aktobe - the Old City, located on the slope of Ak-Tyube, and Novy, the center of which is the most ambitious city avenue named after Abilkayir Khan.  In the old part of the city there is a railway station.  And the districts bear the following names: Moscow, Tatar (Tatar settlement), Kurmysh, Otorvanovka, Baby, Gormolzavod.  It is dominated by private residential buildings and buildings on one floor.  The Otorvanovka district appeared one of the first, back in 1887.  He began to build up immigrants from the <span>Astrakhan province.</span>  No less old is Kurmysh, named after the blacksmith Kurmys who once lived here.  The lands on which it is located can be flooded by the rivers of Kargada and Ilek spilling into the flood.  Kurmysh borders on the Shygys fair and market.  The Moscow region comes close to the railway, and also adjoins the Bolshak microdistrict, which is considered promising in terms of development.  The architecture of Aktobe is such that new skyscrapers and old buildings coexist peacefully and even create some kind of eclectic harmony.  True, there are not many of them in the central part of the city.  Among the existing ones, one can distinguish the Shahrezada restaurant, which is located in the building of the former female gymnasium, erected in 1894, and the Lokomotiv cinema, which was once the House of Culture of Railway Workers (built in 1928). <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aktobe city photo" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1053017.jpg" width="571"></div>

    <h2>  New part of town </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, the new city of Aktobe is the most beautiful and interesting.  The photo captures one of the squares with the mosque in the evening lights.  The new part includes the following areas: Shanghai, Ken Dala, Microdistricts (go under numbers), Sazdy and Bolshak.  Microdistricts are located along the central avenue and are mainly built up with <span>high-rise buildings,</span> have a developed network of shops, banks, comfortable hotels offering world-class service, and other infrastructure.  The central avenue houses the administration building, shopping centers, a stadium, banks, two mosques, and higher education institutions. </p><p>  The farthest area in the New City is Shanghai.  It is built mainly by one-story residential buildings. </p><p>  In addition to the above, in Aktobe new areas appear with enviable consistency.

There are so many of them that even a fountain celebration is held on May 1.  By the number of reservoirs, Aktobe can be called a city of not only white peaks, but also blue rivers.

It is also notable for the fact that just one step away is one of the central mosques, also called Nurdaulet.  The population of Aktobe, for the most part (73%), is Muslim, and at first not everyone welcomed the entertainment complex next to the temple of the Lord, but since, according to ancient traditions, markets were always located next to mosques, the townspeople gradually appreciated and approved this new <span>architectural project.</span>  In addition to Nurdaulet, the city has a mosque Nur Gasyr - very beautiful, located on the central avenue.  A museum of religious Muslim themes ‚ÄúRukhaniyat‚Äù is working in its building, where unique copies of ancient books and objects sacred to Muslims are collected. </p><p>  There are Orthodox churches in Aktobe, which are also of interest for their architecture.

The coat of arms of Aktobe has the shape of a circle, which means "perpetual motion."  At its bottom is the name of the city, made in white, symbolizing purity and holiness.  The blue background means the never-ending movement of water, the ornaments of yellow, green and red are the sun, nature and tulips.  A griffin is placed in the center of the coat of arms, which in heraldry has always been a symbol of strength, speed, vigilance and power. </p><p>  Aktobe is a multinational city.  Most of all, Kazakhs (73%) and Russians (20%) live here.
