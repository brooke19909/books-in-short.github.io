Maybe you imagine a paradise somewhere on Earth?  Or do you think this is a place for entertainment?  Do not guess.  We will tell you everything from the very beginning! </p><h2>  Briefly about the park </h2><p>  Just imagine: more than three hundred hectares at your disposal!  There is absolutely everything that you and your children will like.  Now fast forward to the past.  In the nineteenth century, the park "Sunny Island" was given over to the famous Martha Golovatova, the widow of the colonel.  In those days, her husband was not only an artillery officer, but also a famous Kuban writer.  Time passed, slowly flowing into the new century, and in the twentieth century Rokkol Adolf Nikolaevich bought this site.  Thanks to the good entrepreneurial and economic qualities of the new owner, a park soon appeared at this place, which was open to all wildlife lovers.  Gradually, this area was rebuilt, reconstructed, more and more ennobled, and soon officially recognized as a place of rest. </p>

    <h2>  Safari Park </h2><p>  It’s time to dwell on what Sunny Island Park received for one of its awards.  Krasnodar, thanks to this place, won the love of many visitors to the city. </p><p>  The zoo has recently opened.  And it happened quite unexpectedly.  The director of the zoo (at that time he was not there yet) was presented with a <span>parrot Aru.</span>  This bird aroused considerable interest among visitors, and soon guests who came to Krasnodar began to leave various animals as a gift to this park.  The collection gradually grew and reached the boundaries of a real zoo.  Buildings, scenery and animal care are on top here.  Despite the fact that Safari Park is considered the only one, pay attention, a private zoo in Russia! </p><h2>  Planetarium </h2>

    <p>  Another very interesting place in the park is the Planetarium.  A huge number of films that will be interesting to both children and adults are shown in it.  The Kuban Cosmonautics Federation maintains close ties with the park.  Indeed, scientific films are broadcast in the Planetarium, which are built not on fiction, but on real facts and events of our time.  And for those who have never been to such a place, a visit is a must!  After all, a lot of positive emotions are guaranteed to you! </p><h2>  Rides </h2><p>  It is also necessary to tell about these entertainments, which the Sunny Island park is proud of.  Krasnodar (photo of one of the attractions you can see below) welcomes its guests with hospitality.  After all, the city still has many attractions and interesting places. </p><ul><li>  <em>Autodrom.</em>  Two types of this entertainment are presented to your attention: adult and children's.  So you can go on a journey with the child together, and not stand quietly on the sidelines. </li><li>  <em>Aerial track.</em>  This entertainment was invented relatively recently, so crowds of visitors want to ride.  It resembles a slightly slow-motion version of a <span>roller coaster.</span> </li><li>  <em>All-round visibility.</em>  And in our opinion - a Ferris wheel.  This attraction is very popular, because everyone wants to enjoy the bird's eye view of the park. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  <em>Wild train.</em>  For older visitors, an excellent adrenaline rush was found.  Such slides, as they say, will certainly blow their heads off their shoulders. </li><li>  <em>Trampoline hill "Dragon".</em>  There are children who do not accept any attractions other than this.  Therefore, for such small visitors, there was also a pleasant place. </li><li>  <em>The road of fairy tales.</em>  This ride takes you and your children through the pages of your favorite books.  Pretty good entertainment, moderate and calm.  Children always have positive emotions and a desire to return here again. </li></ul><p>  Of course, you can talk about this wonderful place for a very long time.  But you probably already wanted to visit the city of Krasnodar yourself.  Park "Sunny Island", whose address is Tramvaynaya-2 Street, is always waiting for new visitors.  Entertainment will be to everyone's liking.  And if you are not lovers of hype, then unity with nature and the pleasure of the rustling leaves you can find here too.  The park is universal.  Therefore, waiting for each visitor, large and small, noisy and quiet. </p>
