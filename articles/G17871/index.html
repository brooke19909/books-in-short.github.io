    <p>  Both devices fit very well into the modern trend, which can be described as "3D everywhere, wherever possible."  After the release of James Cameron‚Äôs grandiose creation ‚ÄúAvatar‚Äù, as well as the unprecedented success of the film and 3D technologies in particular, producers of various kinds of content and technology rushed headlong to the development of the stereo-vision field, which had hitherto stood in stagnation. </p><p>  The famous picture of the legendary director proved that people are ready to pay good money for 3D, if it will please their entertainment.  Manufacturers of mobile gadgets took advantage of this situation and began to equip their devices with all sorts of 3D functions (and not cheap), even if they are not really needed by the user.  The LG brand was a pioneer in this segment, and the NTS caught the wave with its EBO. </p><p>  Let's see how the company is doing with its new gadget.  So, the HTC EVO 3D smartphone: the characteristics, features and advantages of the device along with the shortcomings are the topic of our article.  The opinions of specialists in this field and the reviews of ordinary gadget owners will be taken into account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The model is sold in a rather modest (by design standards) box of white and thick cardboard.  The packaging is relatively small, but this did not stop the manufacturer from placing all the necessary information on it: a description of the device, brief characteristics and the main capabilities of the device. </p>

But sometimes poor-quality charges (squelchy and backlash) or safety glasses for NTS smartphones may be missing, so take the time to open the box in the store and check the contents. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  If one could compare this smartphone with a car, then the EBO would be a classic SUV.  That is, not in the sense that it can be easily taken on any impassability and deserts, but on the impressions of the design. </p>

    <p>  The smartphone turned out to be massive, heavy and inspiring confidence.  No, the gadget does not exceed the usual comfort limits in terms of weight or overall dimensions - it just inferior to third-party competitors in the thinness of the case and, perhaps, in lightness.  Nevertheless, the characteristics of the case of HTC EVO 3D do not allow calling it a "brick" or another offensive word. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The appearance of the device has strict notes and, as it happens with the NTS models, this attracts its client.  Dark gray and pure black plastic tones act as a key to the hearts of potential consumers, responding with a business and serious echo. </p><p>  Due to its thickness, the model with enviable ergonomics lies in the hand, unlike new-fashioned thin gadgets.  Nevertheless, the weight and dimensions indicate that the owner of the device should be a man, and for the fair sex it is better to find something more acceptable in terms of mass and ‚Äúmore fun‚Äù in terms of colors, although no, no, and you will see at some some girls brand new HTC EVO 3D. </p>

    <p>  The case made of high-quality plastic looks monolithic.  Silver inserts in the exterior of the model are found to a minimum: camera edging, logo and a pair of keys.  Separately, it is worth mentioning the cover of the back of the smartphone - this is a high-quality corrugation Soft Touch, visually resembling tactile rubber.  In general, judging by the reviews of the owners, leaving fingerprints on the device is extremely difficult, the only where it is possible with HTC EVO 3D is the screen.  Due to the high-quality coating of the display, dust, dirt and minor scratches are not as scary as for the same LG or Samsung. </p><p>  The appearance of the front of the smartphone accurately guesses the brand identity of the brand.  Just as many car companies are anxiously filling out a radiator fake lattice, so the NTS follows its own style year after year.  This is especially noticeable on the speaker grid in the upper part of the gadget, by touch keys, and by the body as a whole. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  The back of the device is a cover that completely captures the perimeter of the entire device.  Just above the central part of the gadget, you can see a paired massive camera unit with two flashes on high-power LEDs. </p>

    <p>  On the left side is only one micro-USB-connector.  On the right side of the smartphone, you can see the camera control button, volume rocker and the shooting mode switch (2D / 3D).  The upper part of the gadget is reserved for the headphone and headset jack (3.5 mm) and the power control key, as well as a backup microphone.  Below is a recess for removing the cover and the main microphone of the HTC EVO 3D. </p><p>  The characteristics of the case and the design of the model as a whole leave positive emotions.  Many owners in their reviews do not harass designers for such dimensions and weight, but even, on the contrary, note that such a thick and heavy gadget is much more convenient to wear due to its external data: you always feel where it lies and use one hand with this model is much more comfortable. </p><h2>  Display HTC EVO 3D </h2><p>  The characteristics of the screen are very impressive: one of the best and most successful matrices such as ‚ÄúSuper LCD‚Äù with a completely acceptable resolution of 540 by 960 pixels.  Greater performance can only be seen in the "apple" display of the Retina series.  The ppi is also pleasing, the point size is so small that the normal human eye is simply not able to distinguish individual pixels. </p><h2>  Viewing angles </h2><p>  The picture on the display looks quite clear, saturated with tones and moderately bright.  The only negative that has been mentioned more than once in user reviews is a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãcomfortable viewing.  If you tilt the smartphone a little to the side, then the 3D effect begins to disappear, so it will not work to try new technologies in the company of like-minded people - the gadget has come out "selfish." </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Both cameras on the back of the gadget are equipped with a quick autofocus function.  A stereomatrix with five megapixels can not give a resolution of more than 2560 by 1920 pixels, but in most ordinary cases this is more than enough. </p><p>  If desired, you can switch to regular or 3D shooting.  Working in three-dimensional mode requires certain skills, so before shooting it is not out of place to carefully read the instructions. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The well-proven Snapdragon Qualcomm MSM8660 chip, running on two cores with a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz, is responsible for performance.  The video core "Adreno" of the 220th series is responsible for the graphic component. </p>

    <p>  On board HTC EVO 3D (firmware 3.28.401.1) there is 1 GB of RAM and the same amount for storing user data.  If desired, the internal volume can be increased due to SD cards (up to 32 GB).  In general, the performance is not bad, the interface works without any friezes and brakes, but ‚Äúheavy‚Äù applications will noticeably sag along the FPS. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The device is equipped with a mediocre 1730 mAh battery.  She copes with her main task, and users do not leave any critical comments in their reviews.  The operating time in the all-inclusive mode is about 3.5 hours, and on the basic energy-saving settings and using the smartphone just as a means of communication, the battery runs out during the day. </p>
