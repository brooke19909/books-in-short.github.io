One of them is described below, the most simple and convenient one.  It is suitable for most owners, including those who do not know <span>how to flash iphone 4g.</span>  It does not hurt to mention that this option works flawlessly in almost all models of phones and OS (especially since some programs simply do not support Windows).  Therefore, if you could not <span>flash the iPhone in</span> other ways, you should pay attention to this article. </p><p>  <strong>What is needed for this</strong> </p><p>  So how to flash iphone.  Unlike the use of special utilities, everything is extremely simple here.  It is required to find custom firmware for phones on the Internet and download it.  Usually this is a small file with the extension .ipsw, like most similar ones.  The downloaded file is the same standard firmware, only it has already been unlocked, hacked, and contains additional useful utilities, such as Sidia or jailbreak.  For further actions, we need to install this file on the phone. </p><p>  In such a difficult matter as flashing the iphone, the user will also need some additional utilities.  Firstly, this is iTunes, and best of all is the latest version.  As a rule, you can download one through the program itself in the update section.  If for some reason this cannot be done, go to the official website of the developer (apple.com) and download the latest version there.  You will also need to download a utility for Windows called iH8sn0w.  Actually, the <span>custom firmware</span> itself too. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In fact, there are a lot of options.  You‚Äôll have to choose the one that best suits the user.  After all, one of the most important is the firmware, others care about the size of the system file.  The main thing is that it should be for your <span>iPhone model.</span>  Important: before starting any action, you must definitely check the synchronization of the phone with iTunes, otherwise nothing will work.  And, of course, save all the data.  This will allow you to return the necessary information and settings, returning the device to its original state. </p><p>  <strong><span>How to flash iphone:</span> user actions</strong> </p><p>  Now let's move on to the process itself.  First of all, you should start iTunes, and then connect your iPhone to your computer.  Next, you need to put the device into recovery mode.  Those who do not know about such a function on their phone do the following: hold Home and Power on the buttons simultaneously and hold them in this position for about ten seconds.  We are talking about the keys on the phone, and not on the computer, of course.  After the above ten seconds, release the Power button, but hold the second pressed for the same amount of time.  If everything is done correctly, a system sound will sound on the phone, notifying you that recovery mode is on. </p><p>  From now on, we will need to close iTunes and enable the iH8sn0w utility.  In the window that opens, you will need to select the desired device option.  A few seconds will pass, and the phone screen will turn white, and the application itself will close with an error.  Do not immediately panic and think that they did something wrong.  Everything is fine, everything is going according to plan.  This effect should be.  Next, restart iTunes.  A window appears with the only ‚ÄúRestore‚Äù function available (in English).  Having pressed the Shift button on the computer keyboard (or alt for Macintosh owners), we click on this function. </p><p>  Another window should appear on the screen, in which the user will be asked to select the firmware option.  You will need to find the recently downloaded file and open it.  This ends the owner‚Äôs actions, the program works by itself.  It will take about ten minutes to complete the firmware, but for now you can drink some tea.  When the process comes to an end, you will need to connect the phone to iTunes again and restore the previously saved data.  Now you know how to flash iphone.  In principle, during the flashing process, you can do without the iH8sn0w program, but in this case various errors may occur. </p>
