Schemes and Description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes it is believed that knitting is losing its popularity over the years, that few people are already engaged in this, but this is not so.  Many craftswomen daily create their masterpieces from threads and constantly come up with new patterns.  This is especially true for experienced craftsmen who very often bring in something new. </p><p>  With the help of a chic pattern, you can create a unique element of clothing.  To learn how to use it, read this article carefully.  Here you will find a description and patterns for knitting with a peacock tail.  Proper execution will make the skirt or light dress unique. </p><h2>  "Wave peacock tail" knitting.  Schemes and Description </h2><div class="photo" data-original="newstitchaday.com" data-author=": Johny Vasques, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Picture for article" class="if uuid-2771458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102789/2771458.jpg"></div><p>  This style has many names.  Someone calls it "waves," and someone calls it a "fan."  But the most common name is Peacock Tail. </p><p>  Now we will present the scheme and description of the openwork peacock tail with knitting needles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="exclusive.mk.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Peacock Tail Pattern" class="if uuid-2771973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/2771973.jpg"></div><p>  This pattern has many details, which include: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Front loops.  They are located at the edges of the product, as well as in some internal parts. </li><li>  Wrong loops.  In one ‚Äúwave‚Äù there are 3 wrong loops, which are located through 1 row. </li><li>  Double and double front loops.  Together they form one row - 3 double at the edges and 6 double in the center.  There should be one front loop between each loop.  Each row is located after the wrong one. </li></ul><p>  Before learning the patterns and descriptions of the peacock tail with knitting needles, you need to improve your technical skills.  This is a very complex pattern, and therefore it is necessary to constantly practice in creating loops.  If you are a beginner needlewoman, then practice creating the wrong side and front knit. </p><p>  You can learn how to knit inclined rows.  The loop tilted to the left is tied through the back wall, and the one that tilts to the right through the front. </p><p>  The training scheme will help you apply beautiful patterns to various elements of the wardrobe. </p><p>  "Peacock tail" can be used in the following types of clothing: </p><ul><li>  summer dresses and skirts; </li><li>  T-shirts and tops; </li><li>  sweaters. </li></ul><p>  Now consider two different descriptions and patterns of the peacock tail with knitting needles. </p><h2>  Lightweight peacock tail </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog.weareknitters.com" data-author=": Knitting Stitches, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Picture for article" class="if uuid-2771464" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102789/2771464.jpg"></div><p>  This method will give clothes elegance and lightness.  Great for creating shawls.  All you need is ordinary knitting needles, as well as knitting threads. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The total number of connected loops should be equal to 17, excluding edge loops.  One wave should be connected in 4 rows.  Observe just such a quantity. </p><p>  Instruction: </p><ol><li>  We knit 17 loops, and also do not forget about 2 hem. </li><li>  The first row consists of only facial loops. </li><li>  Edge loops should have a different arrangement.  The first should be fixed on the right knitting needle, and the second is knitted with the wrong loop. </li><li>  The second row consists of purl loops. </li><li>  We knit the third, which consists of 3 identical cycles: the first loop is tied, the other two are knitted together with the wrong one. </li><li>  We make a series of five cap and front loops. </li><li>  We knit the fourth row only on the wrong side. </li><li>  The fifth row is repeated similarly to the fourth. </li></ol><h2>  Wave Peacock Tail Pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": AnacapaKnits, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Picture for article" class="if uuid-2771502" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102789/2771502.jpg"></div><p>  The second method is not as "openwork" as the previous one, but no worse.  It also looks great and is very easy to perform. </p><p>  It uses not 17, but 18 loops.  But in this pattern, 2 rapports are used, which means their number increases to 36. </p><p>  In addition to them, there are two edge loops. </p><p>  Instruction: </p><ol><li>  The first four rows need to be knitted with satin stitches from the front and back loops.  The first and third are facial, the second and fourth are wrong. </li><li>  In the fifth row, you need to observe the exact number of loops.  Work at this stage needs to be done as carefully as possible. </li><li>  We knit six double crochet stitches. </li><li>  We carry out the sixth row.  All its parts, including the flare, consist of purl loops that fit on the front side. </li></ol><p>  Having tied the first six rows, they received the first rapport.  Knit a few more, and get a gorgeous pattern. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Read the instructions very carefully and work with great care and accuracy.  With the help of the description and the Peacock Tail patterns and knitting patterns, you can help create beautiful things.  Have a nice knitting! </p>
