  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Perm: description, photo, history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The regional center of the <span>Perm Territory, the city of</span> Perm, founded in 1723, is located in the European part of the Russian Federation.  It occupies an area of ‚Äã‚Äã780 square meters.  km  The article tells about the history and most popular sights of Perm (a city located on the Kama River). </p><h2>  History of Perm </h2><p>  The lands of the future regional center in the 17th century belonged to the Stroganov merchants from an old family of Russian industrialists. </p><p>  In 1720, by order of the Russian Emperor Peter the Great, <span>Vasily Tatishchev</span> (author of the first historical work, History of Russia) was sent to the Siberian province in order to determine the territory for the construction of a silver and copper smelting plant. </p><p>  Given the large number of natural deposits of copper ore and the convenient location for the export of finished products, the territory where the settlement was located on the Yegoshikha River was chosen.  Three years later, the construction of a smelter began. </p><p>  In 1780, by decree of Catherine II, a provincial city was created around the constructed plant.  He subsequently became the center of Perm governorate (administrative-territorial unit in the Russian Empire in 1775-1796). </p><p>  Thus, the center of the new Perm province appeared.  The construction of urban infrastructure facilities has begun.  Since 1920, Perm has gradually become one of the main cultural and industrial regions of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  In 1940, the regional center and the region were renamed the city of Molotov and the Molotov region.  The renaming took place in honor of the politician <span>Vyacheslav Molotov</span> in connection with his 50th anniversary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After 17 years, the historical names were returned to the city and the region.  Now Perm is a region with developed heavy industry.  The main industries that make up the main economy of the region are considered to be the electric power industry, mechanical engineering, woodworking and oil and gas processing.  The main industrial enterprises are Perm Motors and <span>Motovilikhinsky Plants.</span>  The city has 13 universities and 42 branches of higher educational institutions in Moscow and St. Petersburg. </p><p>  In addition, 132 secondary schools, 20 technical schools of various directions, museums and theaters operate in the territory. </p><p>  An interesting fact: in 1965, on the Voskhod-2 spaceship, on which A. Leonov made the first spacewalk in history, an automatic orientation system failed during landing.  Then the astronauts landed manually, as a result of which the ship landed in an off-design place.  This happened 180 km from Perm, and that part of the Kazan Tract (route to Perm), along which the astronauts were brought after landing in the city, was renamed the "Cosmonaut Highway." </p><p>  Thanks to its rich history and interesting sights, many tourists are interested in excursions in Perm. </p><h2>  The origin of the name of the city </h2><p>  The city was officially founded from the moment the construction of the copper smelter began in 1723, which became the basis for the future regional center of the Perm region. </p><p>  Historians have established that the city got its name from the descendants of the Finno-Ugric Veps tribe.  The lands of the Northern Dvina basin were called Perya Maa (translated ‚Äúdistant land‚Äù). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Russians, who came to the territory of the Vepsians, first called this region Perem, but later - Perm. </p><p>  The city, which has been the official capital of the Urals for more than 200 years, and its leadership, in collaboration with the regional travel agency, are trying to maintain the image of the cultural center of the Urals region.  For tourists, walking tours of the main attractions of the city are organized. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitperm.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Perm Antiquities" class="if uuid-2326439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2326439.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum of Antiquities </h2><p>  In the city center, on Sibirskaya Street, is a museum of Perm antiquities. </p><p>  Visitors can get acquainted with the development of life on our planet.  The Museum of Perm Antiquities has more than two thousand samples of two directions.  In the first hall of geology, you can inspect the exhibits to get acquainted with the development of the Earth, and in the paleontology hall there are fossils of ancient animals. </p><p>  The most valuable specimen are the remains of a mammoth.  They were found in 1927 in the Perm region. </p><p>  In 2007, based on the bones of the skeleton that have been preserved to our time, scientists reconstructed the appearance of the mammoth and exhibited it in the central part of the hall.  In this place you can also see the bones of the ancient rhinoceros, the skeleton of the carnivorous predator dimetrodon and many other exhibits found during archaeological excavations in the Urals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Museum "Khokhlovka" </h2><p>  Using buses No. 487 or 340, tourists have the opportunity to visit the first museum of wooden architecture in the Urals (45 km from Perm).  It is created in the open.  The opening of the Khokhlovka architectural and ethnographic museum took place in 1980. </p><p>  The expositions are wooden buildings of the XVII-XX centuries, brought from different parts of the Ural region.  All elements are located on the banks of the Kama River near the village of Khokhlovka. </p><p>  Tourists can see 23 monuments of wooden architecture of past centuries.  Many buildings are open, where the reconstruction of the life of the inhabitants of this area is created. </p><p>  The main exhibit and pride of the museum employees is the Bogoroditskaya Church.  It is considered the oldest building.  Near the temple is a bell tower - the only wooden thirty-meter bell tower in the Perm region, preserved to this day.  Given the popularity of this museum, now traditional mass festivities are held on its territory: ‚ÄúShrovetide Shrovetide‚Äù, ‚ÄúApple Savior‚Äù, ‚ÄúBig Maneuvers on the Khokhlov Hills‚Äù (military reconstruction) and the annual international music festival Kamwa. </p><h2>  Art Gallery </h2><p>  What other sights of Perm are known?  For example, an art museum.  It will be discussed further.  In 1890, a scientific and industrial museum was created. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newsko.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="perm art gallery" class="if uuid-2326453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2326453.jpg"></div><p>  Two years later, the museum opened an art department, where the artists Vasily and Petr Vereshchagin donated their paintings as a gift to their hometown. </p><p>  The paintings of these creators and other painters became the basis of the future Perm art gallery, which opened in 1922. </p><p>  Now the museum is located in the building of the Transfiguration Cathedral, which houses more than 50 thousand works of fine art of different times and directions.  The Perm Art Gallery is open to art lovers.  Visitors have the opportunity to see the collection of wooden sculptures of the 17th-20th centuries and the exposition of icons of the Stroganov school (the Russian school of icon painting of the late 16th century and named after the Stroganov merchants who created this school). </p><h2>  Monastery </h2><p>  On the Bisimskaya street is the Holy Trinity Stefanov Monastery.  In 1736, a new factory was built on the terrain where the connection of the two rivers, the Bolshaya and Malaya Motovilikhi, was built.  A working village was formed around it, and this area was called Motovilikha. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourister.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holy Trinity Stefan Monastery" class="if uuid-2326467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2326467.jpg"></div><p>  It was difficult for the workers to get to church service in the Peter and Paul Church (more than 5 km).  Therefore, the Perm diocese decided to build a wooden church in the village.  It was consecrated in 1790 in the name of the Holy Trinity. </p><p>  After some time, it was decided to build a stone structure on the foundation of a wooden church.  The temple was consecrated in 1836 and, along with other extensions, the church complex was officially named the Holy Trinity Stefanov Monastery. </p><p>  In 1935 the temple was closed.  His building was converted into a workshop of the city bakery plant.  After 60 years, after restoration work, the monastery was returned to the parishioners of the Christian religion. </p><p>  Tourists can attend the liturgy, inspect the restored interior, and visit the icon painting workshop. </p><h2>  Perm Academic Theater </h2><p>  This drama theater was founded in 1927.  Then bore the name "Theater of working youth." </p><p>  The play ‚ÄúBattleship Potemkin‚Äù (based on a poem by the Russian poet Georg Shengeli) opened the first theater season.  Four years later, the whole troupe was transferred to the city of Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg). </p><div class="photo" data-original="sistema-stage.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="academic theater-theater in perm" class="if uuid-2326459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2326459.jpg"></div><p>  After the formation of the Perm Region (in 1938), the theater returned to its former seat.  Then began to be called "Perm Dramatic named" Komsomolskaya Pravda ".  It was located in the former building of the People‚Äôs House on Mostovaya Street (Motovilikha). </p><p>  In 1948, by decision of the city administration, the troupe moved to a building built at the beginning of the 20th century for the widow of industrialist Ivan Lyubimov.  Now here is the theater of the young spectator (Bolshevitskaya street). </p><p>  In 1981, a new building was built in the central part of the city (Lenin Street).  And since 2007, this institution has officially been called the Perm Academic Theater-Theater. </p><p>  Over the course of the 20th century, more than 450 performances were staged in it.  At different times, the corpses included Mark Zakharov, Petr Velyaminov, Vladimir Ginzburg, Georgy Burkov, who raised the image of the Perm Drama Theater with their talent. </p><h2>  Mansion of the merchant Sergei Gribushin </h2><p>  Not far from the drama theater is the house of Gribushin.  The mansion was built in 1897 for the family of a civil servant of the Russian Empire Konstantin Kashperov.  In 1899, the building was bought by the son of the Russian wine merchant Alfons Poklevsky-Cosell. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arch-heritage.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mushroom house" class="if uuid-2326462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2326462.jpg"></div><p>  In 1905, this building was acquired by Gribushin.  And sixteen years after his death, the widow became the mistress of the mansion.  In 1919, after the family emigrated abroad, the mansion was used as a military hospital, and in 1922 a children's hospital was located in it.  After the restoration work has been completed since 1988, the Perm Scientific Center of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (PNC UB RAS) is located here. </p><p>  An interesting fact about Gribushin‚Äôs house is that this particular mansion is depicted as a ‚Äúhouse with figures‚Äù in Boris Pasternak‚Äôs novel Doctor Zhivago. </p><h2>  Monument to Pasternak </h2><p>  In 2009, a monument to Pasternak in Perm was erected in a park near the opera house. </p><div class="photo" data-original="perm.vsedomarossii.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monument to parsnip in perm" class="if uuid-2326472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2326472.jpg"></div><p>  This is due to the fact that the future Nobel Prize winner in literature was in Perm several times in 1915 and lived in the village of Vsevolodo-Vilva at the invitation of the biochemist Boris Zbarsky. </p><p>  Biographers claim that thanks to traveling around the Urals region, he abandoned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbecoming a pianist and devoted his life to literature. </p><h2>  Monument to the heroes of the front and rear </h2><p>  Esplanade is a wide area between the two main city streets.  Such a part of the city is in Perm. </p><p>  On this territory there were residential buildings, which at the end of the XX century were demolished.  Then they prepared a place for future construction sites. </p><p>  At this time, the city leadership was deciding on a <span>monument to the heroes of the front and rear</span> and determining the place for its installation.  The decision was made in favor of the esplanade. </p><p>  Tourists can explore this Perm attraction.  It depicts a warrior who raised his weapon up as a sign of future victory, he looks west (the invaders came from that side).  Nearby is the figure of a worker, whose gaze is facing east.  There was a part of the country where products for the front were manufactured at evacuated factories.  Between the statue of a worker and a soldier, a woman‚Äôs figure is installed.  It symbolizes the Motherland, for the sake of which labor and military feats were accomplished. </p><p>  The monument to the heroes of the front and rear in Perm was erected in 1985 in honor of the 40th anniversary of the victory in the Second World War.  All city events are taking place here now. </p><h2>  Goal </h2><p>  Near Perm II station there is a structure, surprising in its originality, that attracts the attention of all tourists: the letter "P" made of randomly stacked logs denotes the first letter of the word "Perm".  The author of this building is the artist and sculptor <span>Nikolai Polissky.</span>  What are Perm gates?  This composition, composed of logs, resembles one of the main industries of the region in past centuries - woodworking.  It was along Kama that the rafting of the forest passed. </p><p>  The size of the arch is 12 x 12 x 12 meters.  Thus, the weight of the cube, for the production of which 52,200 logs were spent, is more than 200 tons. </p><p>  The author of the project believes that this work of art is a monument to the founder of the city Vasily Tatishchev. </p><h2>  Salty Ears </h2><p>  Tourists are attracted by the Permak Salty Ears sculpture.  Installed on Komsomolsky Avenue in front of the Prikamye Hotel. </p><p>  The art object consists of two parts: a round frame with large ears.  A person can stick his head in a frame and take a picture.  The author of this unusual monument is the sculptor Rustam Ismagilov.  The artist took as the basis of his idea a version of the origin of the name, which states that salt was mined in the Perm region in ancient times.  Received it by evaporation, mined from wells. </p><p>  The latter were at a fairly large distance from the river, along which it was possible to transport the product.  Therefore, workers carried salt in bags, breaking tens of kilometers. </p><p>  In connection with this hard work, they constantly had red salty ears.  And they were called Perm Salty Ears. </p><p>  According to the author, the monument should remind the indigenous people about the history of the city and entertain the guests. </p><p>  An interesting fact: in 2009, Permyak Salty Ears was recognized as the most ‚Äústrange‚Äù artifact throughout Russia. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Tourists in their reviews note that Perm is admirable.  There are many beautiful places in the city where you can relax.  It is especially beautiful in summer: fountains and a large number of parks are located throughout the territory. </p><p>  Parkland Khokhryakova is especially beautiful.  Guests of the city like the unusual tradition of the newlyweds: in the Sverdlov park there is a pond fenced with a lace fence, on which various locks hang.  The heroes of the day hang their lock, and throw the key into the pond.  It is said that this tradition brings happiness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="samovar.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Permyak salty ears" class="if uuid-2326469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2326469.jpg"></div><p>  In the middle of summer in Perm, white nights come.  And during this period, domestic and foreign artists came to the city with tours.  The main festive celebration takes place in the city center on the Esplanade. </p><p>  In winter, an ice park "Ice Town" is opened for indigenous people and visitors of the city.  Its main attraction is considered to be an ice palace made of ice.  In addition, tourists are attracted by the benevolence and hospitality of the indigenous inhabitants of the regional center, which leave pleasant memories. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know the famous sights of Perm.  We named them and also described them.  We hope that this information was not only interesting to you, but also useful. </p>
