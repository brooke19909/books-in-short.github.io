    <p>  No less impressive will look pots of different sizes or buckets with ‚Äúberries‚Äù. </p><h2>  Original rugs </h2><p>  Pebbles are ideal for creating rugs.  They can decorate the interior of any room, or it will act as a good massager.  In this case, the craft will have a healing effect on the person - foot massage is very useful. </p><p>  When choosing such a material, the question of what patterns can be made of stones disappears by itself.  To make such rugs, you need a rubber base or carpet backing.  To create an original pattern or ornament, the material must be selected in different sizes and colors.  Previously, it is better to draw an image on paper, at least schematically for clarity.  Or choose any photo you like or a finished picture.  It is also necessary to prepare the basis: clean it well and give it the desired shape. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To make the work easier, you can first place all the stones on the substrate according to the selected sample.  Then go on to fixing each pebble individually.  Typically, a transparent waterproof glue is used for these purposes.  In this case, all the stones must be positioned so that they completely cover the base.  You also need to make sure that there are no large gaps.  What can be made of stones?  The photo below gives a more accurate answer. </p>

    <p>  If the rug will be located in the bathroom with a tiled floor, then you should choose a rubber backing so that it does not slip on the tile.  And for an orthopedic rug, it is better to find stones with a greater bulge. </p><h2>  Stone plants </h2><p>  The flower kingdom looks no less original, for which decorative stones can be suitable.  Such flowers do not need care and perfectly decorate any room with their appearance. </p><p>  For example, you can take large or medium-sized pebbles and paint them "under the cacti."  Then it remains to scatter them in flower pots, into which they then pour small crumbs or even real earth for greater naturalness. </p><p>  In the same way, you can create any other plants, without forgetting to connect your imagination.  Very interesting is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a topiary - a "tree of happiness." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For its implementation, you will need to take a tube or branch of medium length and diameters of about a centimeter.  Then you need a ball of polystyrene foam, to which a tube or branch is attached with glue.  Only previously in the ball will need to make a hole.  It is worth noting that such an activity will not only solve the problem of what can be made of stones in the country, but also brighten up your free time. </p>

    <p>  The ball will serve as the crown of the tree, so to create it you should choose small pebbles.  At the same time, pay attention to the color scheme, the shape of the pebbles.  They are also glued to the ball.  If ‚Äúdummies‚Äù have formed between the stones, they can be covered with various small elements.  To do this, shells, multi-colored pebbles of glass and other trinkets that can only be found are suitable.  This will give the craft a special originality. </p><p>  Then all this is fixed on a cut bottle or some container with sand, which before that needs to be dried well. </p><h2>  Garden paths </h2><p>  Whoever has a summer cottage, you can put beautiful paths out of stones.  They will not only serve as decor, but also perform a practical function for quite some time.  You can use both natural stones and artificial. </p><p>  Simple instructions on what can be made of stone: </p><ul><li>  First you need to prepare a picture of the tracks on paper. </li><li>  For convenience, sort selected stones according to size, color and shape. </li><li>  After preparing the foundation, cement is poured onto the marked track, on which the stones are fixed. </li><li>  Pebbles are laid flat or on the ribs, making sure that the stones are as tight as possible to each other. </li><li>  If the material is of different sizes, then large specimens are placed first, and then small elements complete the composition. </li><li>  Care should be taken to create a decorative border. </li><li>  After laying the stones, let the cement dry for 24 hours, after which the entire path is again poured with liquid cement mortar to smooth out all the cracks. </li></ul><p>  In conclusion, the entire canvas is covered with a film, and until the concrete is completely dry, do not walk along the path.  It usually takes 10-15 days. </p><h2>  Jewelry </h2><p>  What else can be made of stone?  If the family has children, then manual labor will only benefit them, as it can develop certain skills in them.  To create good decorations, fine sea pebbles are suitable due to their streamlined shape. </p>

    <p>  Using a drill in the stones, holes are made to collect the original necklace or bracelet.  Also, the material is ideal for making earrings, for which you need to purchase a base, glue and paint in a specialized store.  Among all the pebbles, two identical specimens are selected, which are mounted on the base.  Only previously the joints are degreased with alcohol. </p><p>  If there is a desire, then sea pebbles can be painted with a kind of "gilding."  For these purposes, it is better to take a spray can.  Stones must be painted before they are fixed to the substrate.  Using the same technique, earrings can be made into a ring.  You just need to choose a level base to facilitate the process of choosing pebbles. </p><p>  If you want to solve the problem of what crafts can be made of stones, you can connect children who can quickly find many ideas. </p><h2>  Artificial stone is a good alternative </h2><p>  In fact, artificial stone is a special material that mimics the texture of natural material.  It was widely used in the construction industry.  With its help, wall cladding is carried out, both outside and inside.  Typical advantages include: </p><ul><li>  in terms of beauty, the material is in no way inferior to its natural counterpart; </li><li>  a light weight; </li><li>  material is easy to process if necessary; </li><li>  high profitability. </li></ul><p>  Nevertheless, there are disadvantages, among which a high degree of abrasion of the surface. </p>

    <p>  Only this is critical when the material is used to create tracks.  In addition, over time, the coating on the stones fades under the influence of solar radiation.  However, they are not so significant. </p><h2>  Original compositions </h2><p>  And what can be made of artificial stone?  Such material is ideally suited for creating whole compositions in its suburban area.  Only in this case it is worth adhering to simple, but important principles: </p><ul><li>  The structure should be located relative to only one point of contemplation. </li><li>  The contrast between emptiness and fullness must be observed. </li><li>  In the concept of the garden, asymmetry should be clearly traced.  Japanese masters at the same time take into account the reflection of objects in the water and the shadows cast by them. </li><li>  The number of structural elements must be odd.  Traditionally, the base should be a regular heptagon. </li><li>  It is also important to balance the horizontal and vertical lines of the structure.  At the same time, there should be more stones with horizontal orientation, since there are already so many vertical objects on the site (trees, a fence, buildings, and so on). </li></ul><p>  Using these principles, you can let a dry stream in your garden or equip a small pond with real water.  Small waterfalls or fountains look good.  By constructing retaining walls, you can not only decorate your garden yard, this solution is relevant for areas with a slope. </p>

    <p>  If you show a little creativity in solving the ‚ÄúWhat can be made of stone‚Äù problem, the right decision will come to mind - to make flower beds or flowerpots for flowers and other cultivated plants.  You can also lay curbs from stones around a site with vegetation, placing them in an even or chaotic order and in several tiers to a certain height. </p><p>  Crafts made of stones are a simple but exciting activity that can interest children by developing ingenuity and future design abilities in them.  In the process, time will pass with benefit, and the surrounding neighbors will be pleasantly surprised. </p>
