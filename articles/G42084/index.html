    <h2>  Cardboard doll bed </h2><p>  What can be useful when making a <span>crib for dolls with your own hands?</span>  The most common and affordable material is cardboard.  A good set will come out of it, which will decorate the doll's bedroom.  Still in work glue, scissors, napkins or newspapers and waterproof paints are useful.  First, the height of the doll for which this piece of furniture is intended is measured.  In accordance with this, a rectangle is cut out, which will serve as a berth.  In order for the doll bed made of cardboard to be durable, the details need to be made of 3-4 layers.  Cardboard blocks are formed for the legs, which are easy to glue from thin strips or folded from a rectangular segment, respectively, folding it in the form of a bar and gluing the open edge.  The legs can only be under the bottom of the bed, and can protrude high above the bed, in the process of decorating them beads of the corresponding diameter are glued.  On one side, a part is fixed that will serve as the head of the crib.  For dolls with their own hands on such a piece of furniture you can make a back in the shape of a heart, a crown, a circle or a square.  With the right decoration, even the simplest headboard will look chic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cribs for dolls photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/375657.jpg?1397629788191" width="500"></div>

To do this, you will need a newspaper, as well as PVA glue, diluted with water.  You can use not a newspaper, but napkins or toilet paper, later this will facilitate the staining process.  So, small pieces of the selected material are applied to the frame previously coated with glue and cover the entire surface with them, generously lubricating everything with glue.  Carefully it is necessary to fix all the bends and joints of parts so that the product becomes solid. </p><h2>  Decorating a cardboard bed </h2><p>  When the bed dries well, you can start painting and decorating.  At this stage, hot glue fixes all the elements that should be the same color as the base - these are beads, chains or pieces of guipure.  They are laid out in a beautiful pattern on the head for the formation of an interesting texture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cardboard doll bed" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/375663.jpg?1397629821995" width="600"></div>  Next is the turn of painting.  The spray can is easiest to use, but any <span>waterproof paint is suitable.</span>  Work should again be left for some time so that it dries.  If the headboard is planned to be made soft, it is decorated after this stage.  A synthetic winterizer or foam rubber is lined with fabric, decorative seams are laid on it, glued to the headboard, decorative braid or pre-prepared and painted cardboard blocks are attached along the perimeter of the soft insert.

From this material, you can make a bed that can be easily disassembled.  To do this, you will need special templates for cutting parts, which are simple geometric shapes with slots in certain places for assembly.  The child will be able to take such a bed with him for playing outdoors, and it will not take up much space in the backpack. </p>

    <h2>  How to decorate a bed of plywood? </h2><p>  To make the toy look attractive, it can be painted in rainbow colors.  All girls love the pink color, which will ideally combine with white pearl beads, from which flowers are laid out and fixed with hot glue on the details of the bed.  The glued pieces of lace and decoupage patterns will look good. </p><h2>  Wooden bed </h2><p>  For those who are not looking for easy ways and at least a little familiar with the carpentry, an ideal option would be a crib for a wooden doll.  By the way, such a product will be the most durable.  And even if the child wants to sit on such a bed, nothing will happen to her, which cannot be said about the previous options.  The calculation of measurements here is also based on the growth of the doll for which the product is intended.  To complete the simplest option, you will need such details: the bottom of the bed, 4 legs, the headboard and (optionally) the sides along the perimeter of the berth so that you can put a mattress.  All elements are assembled by gluing. </p>

    <h2>  Wooden bed decoration </h2><p>  If in the first two versions the painting was ideal, then there is an alternative - the toy can be opened with varnish.  If you want to decorate it, furniture cloves with interesting hats that drive into the frame either in a special sequence or along the contour of the pattern in the form of hearts or flowers are perfect.  Wood is an excellent material for making a four-poster bed; it will not hesitate, as is the case with cardboard, and will be much stronger than plywood.  To do this, take the slats and build a frame in the form of edges of a quadrangle, on which the fabric of the canopy of the crib for dolls is subsequently attached.  Photos of such toys will help determine both the finish and the look of the structure itself.  You can see some pictures above. </p><p>  Making cots for dolls with your own hands is not particularly difficult, the main thing is desire and imagination.  And the result in any case will please the child, even if, in the eyes of an adult, something does not work out quite neatly and beautifully. </p>
