    <p>  It is best to book a car in advance, because sometimes it happens that the right option may not be in place.  The east of the USA differs from the west with the lowest car rental prices. </p><h2>  What should I remember before starting a trip? </h2><p>  Before you start a journey along the US East Coast by car, it is worth taking care of some important points so that the trip is not clouded by anything: </p><ul><li>  In some <span>states of America, the</span> presentation of Russian rights is not enough to rent a vehicle, international drivers will also be required from the driver. </li></ul><ul><li>  Mandatory knowledge of local traffic rules is required to avoid violations and fines in a foreign country.

You can not write off the use of paper cards, which are sold at each gas station. </li></ul><ul><li>  Plan your route at home and do not forget about traffic jams in major cities. </li></ul><ul><li>  When visiting the US East Coast, be aware of road tolls. </li></ul><ul><li>  Do not rely only on your credit card.  In some places, it may not be accepted, so cash will be required on a trip. </li></ul><ul><li>  Do not put strangers into the car for personal safety reasons. </li></ul><h2>  Popular tourist area </h2><p>  What attracts travelers to the East Coast of the United States?

    <p>  It is best to come here by car in spring, when snow melts everywhere, fueling water flows, and in autumn during prolonged rains.  But in winter, travelers will be surprised by frozen cascades that will remind of natural magic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Philadelphia full of attractions </h2><p>  What else attracts the US East Coast?  When making a car trip to America, you can not visit Philadelphia - one of the oldest <span>cities in the country.</span>  Only there you can understand how precious the history of the state is to the Americans who keep the Liberty bell, which informed everyone of the signing of a declaration important to the state. </p><p>  In the quiet and narrow streets with low buildings it is best to walk on foot, leaving the car nearby.  A city full of sights is famous for the buildings in which the fate of the country was decided. </p><h2>  Memorial corners </h2><p>  One of them is Independence Hall, in which the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4.  To get into the landmark building for all Americans, you need to go through tight security controls.  Inside an important UNESCO World Heritage Site, daily excursions take place to tell you about the most significant events in American history. </p>

    <p>  Disneyland Entertainment Center, consisting of several theme parks, is located on a vast territory of 100 square kilometers near Orlando.  An incredible amount of rides, river cruises around the park, colorful parades of famous Disney cartoon characters, a laser show and daily fireworks attract millions of visitors every year. </p><p>  Of course, pleasure is not cheap: you need to pay more than $ 100 for a ticket, and you will have to fork out for the same amount for a visit to the water park.  Therefore, be prepared that returning to childhood costs a lot of money, but, despite the high cost, it will become one of the main events of the trip. </p><h2>  Key West - Tropical Paradise </h2><p>  After an entertaining trip to nature reserves, history-filled cities, and entertainment centers, a visit to the southernmost US city will be a wonderful end to the adventure by car. </p><p>  Key West (Florida), located on the small island of the same name, is the abode of bliss and relaxed relaxation.  The whole city, in which time seems to freeze, you can go around by car, consider not only attractive beaches, but also noteworthy architecture.  Here is the house of E. Hemingway, an observatory of butterflies, an aquarium, where you must definitely look. </p>
