  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What physics studies</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many people ask: ‚ÄúWhat does physics study?‚Äù  Let's try to clarify.  The word is of Greek origin and it is translated as nature.  It was first recorded in the works of the greatest thinker Aristotle, who lived BC in the 4th century.  This is one of the oldest sciences, the field of natural science, and in Russia it appeared thanks to M.V.  Lomonosov.  He published the first textbook on this subject. </p><p>  Carefully looking at what is happening around us, we notice all those various phenomena or changes that occur everywhere, all that physics studies.  They occur with substances and bodies in the surrounding world, and are called phenomena.  For example: the water in the kettle, standing on a fire, begins to boil, a piece of ice melts in the room, an electric current passed through the wire, red-hot, lightning, thunder, and wind heat it.  The phenomena are magnetic, mechanical, sound, thermal, electrical and light.  The most fundamental and general laws governing the evolution and structure of the material world are all that physics studies. </p><p>  <span>Physical phenomena</span> are called all the processes of transformation of a substance or the manifestation of their properties that occur without changing the composition of the substance.  <span>This science</span> has an extraordinary feature.  The uniqueness lies in the fact that physics studies simple phenomena, and with their help one can derive general laws.  Its task is to study and discover the laws that relate the phenomena that occur in nature.  They underlie all natural sciences. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are a great many examples.  One of them is the fall of various bodies on the earth, caused by the gravity of the Earth.  The change of night and day is associated with its rotation around its axis.  Many sciences, such as astronomy, biology, geography, chemistry - they all study nature and necessarily apply the laws of physics.  Everything that this branch of knowledge is studying is vital for human existence, the development of society, the knowledge of the world, and much more.  Its value in the modern world is extremely great. </p><p>  All the differences of today's world from past centuries occurred as a result of the application of physical discoveries in practice.  The basics of physics are experiments.  All laws were derived empirically.  They are quantitative ratios expressed by mathematical language.  In general, physics is divided into parts: </p><ul><li>  experimental.  Its purpose is to establish new facts and test hypotheses and known physical laws; </li><li>  theoretical.  Focusing on the foundations of physics, its laws, <span>natural phenomena</span> are explained and new ones are predicted. </li></ul><p>  The structure of science is very complex.  It includes various sections and disciplines.  Depending on what processes are being studied and what <span>form of matter motion</span> is distinguished <span>, the</span> mechanics of solids and material points, continuous media (including acoustics) and statics, thermo- and electrodynamics, optics, quantum mechanics, field theory and gravitation are advanced. </p><p>  A very interesting section is quantum.  For many, it‚Äôs notorious, but not everyone knows what <span>quantum physics is</span> studying <span>.</span>  This is a study and study of the microworld.  Its tasks are to describe the interaction of matter and energy in elementary particles.  In plain language, it is almost impossible to tell about such a complex science.  One of its concepts is quantum, which is an elementary indivisible particle of matter or energy. </p><p>  In many respects, what quantum physics is studying, there are a number of paradoxes, inexplicable things, on which the best minds of the planet have fought and continue to fight.  As an example, here are a few terms that are associated with inexplicable phenomena.  For example, a wave particle - an electron can behave like a wave, or <span>the</span> Heisenberg <span>uncertainty</span> principle - all of them are not amenable <span>to Newton's laws.</span> </p>
