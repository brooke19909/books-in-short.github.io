  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Carnival costumes for children with their own hands - soon, quickly, cheaply, but angrily!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The childhood holiday is a costume performance, a surprise moment with gifts and, of course, carnival costumes for kids.  Some parents, not wanting to fool themselves, go to the store and buy what they need.  Others use the Internet and also buy.  But you can create carnival costumes for children with their own hands!  It comes out much cheaper - one, a thousand times more interesting - two, working together with your baby develops diligence and perseverance - three, brings together - four, helps realize creative potential - five.  And this is far from all the positive aspects that <span>children‚Äôs carnival costumes have</span> created with their own hands! </p><p>  <strong>Amanita <span>Mushroom</span> or King Amanita Costume 12</strong> </p><p>  First of all, you need to decide on the role that the child wants to play at the ball.  You can dress a very little man into a mushroom - Amanita: making a costume is very simple and almost without additional costs.  And if you apply imagination, then the usual poisonous mushroom will acquire the status of King of Mushrooms Amanita 12. Or 13, as you like. </p><p>  So, we will make <span>carnival costumes for children</span> with our own hands.  The easiest option, if time is running out or financial difficulties, is to make a hat out of thick paper, such a red cap with polka dots - a bag with an obtuse angle with ties at the neck. </p><p>  You can immediately use colored paper or cardboard for the cap, you can paint it after manufacturing.  But it turns out quite wonderful if you coat the top of the cap with <span>ball plasticine.</span>  Have you really forgotten about this stuff?  It just creates a unique effect of naturalness and fabulousness in one bottle! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Is there a little more time left?  Then let's ponder over the collar, because the fly agaric has such a fringe on its leg.  The collar can be made of material, for example, from a nylon ribbon, by sewing one long side with a seam ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù and then pulling the thread around the circumference of the neck. </p><p>  And you can make a collar out of paper.  Sheets should be folded into tubes and fixed with glue so that they do not unfold.  Then from these tubes to collect, again with glue, a collar.  The hollow hole should face the viewer.  A ballerina tutu effect is created. </p><p>  Here, by the way, is another tip on how to make an original pack of ballerina out of paper!  In general, needlewomen who prefer to make carnival costumes for children with their own hands always keep attributes from last year's carnivals.  Then, when choosing accessories for a new suit, there is always the opportunity to adapt something from old things. </p><p>  If you plan to turn the baby into the Mushroom King, then you should also take care of the mantle.  A piece of cloth, gathered at the neck for a "drawstring" and decorated with autumn leaves, twigs of berries and pictures of other mushrooms, will perfectly serve it. </p><p>  A hat can be replaced with a crown or a small crown can be placed on top of a mushroom hat.  By the way, I propose to crown the crown from paper or newspaper tubes, a sort of basket without a bottom, so that it is worn on the baby‚Äôs head.  And fill the basket with mushrooms - they are easy to draw on the landscape sheet, cut and paste on the basket as if they protrude from it.  On the crown basket, you can also inscribe the name of the costume or attach a plate to the mantle. </p><p>  <strong>Costume "Grandma Yozhka - Fashionista"</strong> </p><p>  Carnival costumes for their children <strong> </strong>  hands - this is, first of all, not even money and labor, but fantasy and fiction.  For example, this suit does not require any expenses at all.  You just need to shake your hair, on the one hand braid a high braid, tied it with a string, and on the other hand, on the other level, make a ponytail using a colored rubber band or stab it with a ‚Äúcrab‚Äù.  The face should be painted like a ‚Äúchildren's make-up‚Äù, with shapelessly smeared lips and bright shadows, on each eyelid of different colors.  Indeed, Babka Yozhka has become so beautiful for the first time in honor of an invitation to a holiday! </p><p>  Thick woolen socks with patches on the heels of a contrasting color and shoes without heels, it is possible on a low heel.  Although fit and sneakers.  And you can even do with huge felt boots! </p><p>  The attire itself can be super-fashionable, for example, a small black dress, a short skirt "in a veil" and a topic.  And you can go the old way and dress up a granny with a long skirt with patches and a long woolen sweater.  A super-fashionable touch should be a wide belt and bright long beads, large lurid clips or dangling earrings.  You can also decorate the head with a shiny scarf, tied up by corners, or use the now fashionable stole. </p><p>  So, with almost no financial costs, you can make original carnival costumes for children with your own hands - witty, unique and quite practical. </p>
