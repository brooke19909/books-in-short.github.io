  <section class="page js-page"><h1>State mechanism</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the <span>theory of state and law,</span> there is the concept of a state mechanism.  This mechanism is a holistic hierarchical <span>structure of organizations that</span> carry out functions and implement the tasks facing a particular country.  Such organizations operate on the basis of uniform <span>principles of organization</span> and work, as well as common to all their goals. </p><p>  <strong>Structure</strong> </p><p>  The mechanism of the state is a structural and substantive embodiment of a country.  Its structure depends on the functions that it entrusts to itself.  It consists of the following elements: </p><ul><li><p>  government bodies vested with authority.  These include: the government, parliament, committees, ministries, etc. Their peculiarity lies in the fact that they are endowed with power and make generally binding <span>managerial decisions</span> ; </p></li><li><p>  government organizations that are needed to carry out security activities nationwide.  This is a security service, police, armed forces, etc .; </p></li><li><p>  state institutions performing general social functions in various fields (in healthcare, economics, education, science, culture, etc.).  Thus, the state mechanism includes hospitals, schools, theaters, post offices, museums, and other organizations; </p></li><li><p>  state enterprises engaged in economic and economic activities.  They are necessary for the production of goods, the performance of various kinds of work and the provision of services, profit, satisfaction of the needs of citizens; </p></li><li><p>  <span>civil servants</span> engaged in management activities.  Depending on the authority granted to them, they can be classified into the following types: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div></li></ul><p>  - <span>officials whose</span> activities are related to the direct execution of the powers of a state body (ministers, deputies, head of government, etc.); </p><p>  - persons carrying out activities to ensure the authority of the above employees (consultants, assistants and advisers); </p><p>  - officials holding positions established by state bodies for the execution and securing of their powers (specialists, referents, etc.); </p><p>  - persons who do not have administrative powers (university professors, doctors in municipal hospitals and other employees who receive salaries from the state budget); </p><ul><li><p>  organizational and financial resources required to ensure the activities of the state apparatus, as well as the strength for its normal functioning. </p></li></ul><p>  <span>State bodies</span> are the main element of the mechanism.  Their system is formed by the state apparatus, endowed with authority to exercise state power. </p><p>  <strong>The mechanism of the state and its characteristic features</strong> </p><p>  The mechanism of the state is a system of government agencies that are interconnected with each other.  It includes the president and his administration, legislative bodies, the prosecutor's office, courts, the armed forces, etc., which make up a single system of power. </p><p>  The integrity of the state mechanism is ensured by the common tasks and goals facing it, which unite state bodies into a single organism, contribute to the coherence of their actions. </p><p>  The mechanism of the state is the means by which power is exercised in the country and the necessary result is achieved. </p><p>  Its main element is government agencies endowed with power. </p><p>  The mechanism of the state does not remain unchanged.  It is influenced by both external and internal factors.  These include the international situation, existing relations with other countries, the level of economic development achieved, religious-moral, national-psychological and cultural-historical features, the territorial dimensions of the country, the balance of political forces and much more. </p>
