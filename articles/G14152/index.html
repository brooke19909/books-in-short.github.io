    <p>  Non <span>-</span> governmental <span>pension fund</span> (NPF) is a non-profit organization that accumulates pension accumulations of the population, ensures their investment, assignment and payment of the <span>accumulative part of the pension to the</span> participants of the fund.  The Fund gives citizens the opportunity to participate in the non-state pension system, which allows them to create a decent old age in advance. </p><p>  <strong>Reasons for appearance and development</strong> </p><p>  The emergence of such organizations required <span>pension reform,</span> carried out in order to overcome the crisis of the old system and improve the living standards of pensioners.  Citizens were given the opportunity to receive a pension from various sources (the state component and personal savings, which non-state pension funds were supposed to deal with).  Reviews and public discussions have been shaping public opinion on this subject for 20 years. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="private pension fund promagrofond reviews" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15125/259196.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the early 1990s, NPFs were created very actively, but control over their activities was insufficient.  Only since 1995, regulatory documents began to be adopted, according to which it was possible to regulate and control their work.  A year earlier, the Inspectorate of Non-State Pension Funds was created under the Ministry of Social Protection of the Population of the Russian Federation, which is authorized to manage and control their activities.  They began to fulfill their functions in accordance with legal norms (to obtain licenses, strictly adhere to the standards developed by the Inspectorate, and submit reports).  But legal chaos in the initial stage of development nevertheless caused damage to the new pension system.  Both people and <span>non-state pension funds</span> lost from this <span>.</span>  <span>Feedback</span> on the level of reliability of the latter was negative, so the percentage of public confidence is still low. </p><p>  <strong>About funds</strong> </p><p>  Due to the tightening of requirements for the activities of these organizations by the state, their number has decreased, but there are also a lot of them left on the market - about one hundred and twenty-five.  It is not surprising that it is difficult for citizens to choose whom to entrust their savings.  Ratings that characterize non-state pension funds in several key indicators can help.  Feedback from ordinary citizens and professionals will also bring some clarity and help make a decision.  Here are some examples. </p>

Reviews, of course, are different.  It has been on the market since 1994, since 2004 it has a license for unlimited work.  According to the results of 2012, “Expert RA” assigned “A +” rating to “Promagrofond” (very high level).  This assessment was influenced by the solid volume of the fund’s assets.  This is a guarantee that if it is impossible to pay back to depositors from the <span>reserve fund,</span> it is quite realistic to satisfy customers by making payments at the expense of property.  More than a hundred cities of Russia have branches of the Promagrofond.  Also, for more than 15 years (since 1997), the non-governmental pension fund Trust has been operating in the pension services market.  Reviews of his activities are based on the opinions of contributors and expert ratings.  According to the results of 2011, the fund entered the top five in terms of the profitability of pension deposits and had a rating of “A” as estimated by the National Rating Agency, and in 2013 the rating rose to the level of “AA”.  "Trust" operates in more than 40 cities of Russia.
