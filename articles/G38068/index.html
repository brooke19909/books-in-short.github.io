    <h2>  Definition </h2><p>  From Latin ornamentum is translated as a pattern, which is based on the repetition and / or alternation of its main and minor elements.  It was used from ancient times to decorate utensils, weapons, furniture and other things.  The ornament for painting can be used for large areas of architectural structures and miniatures in decorative art. </p><p>  Defining the style of the composition, several varieties of the pattern can be distinguished.  Depending on the nature of the surface, it is applied with a tape, like a border, in the center, filling the entire surface or part of it.  Based on the motif, an ornament can consist of geometric shapes, abstract forms (dots, straight lines, broken lines), elements that replicate plants, animals, people.  Also often fragments of architecture, weapons, heraldic signs are present. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khokhloma painting ornament" class="if" height="473" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/1114009.jpg" width="500"></div>

Even in a simple blade of grass you can find a motive and translate it into a stylized form. </p><p>  It is believed that almost every plant is ornamental.  Its device involves the presence of repeating elements.  Leaves, mustaches, flowers - they are arranged symmetrically in a certain order.  Bends have naturally smooth radii, and they can be arbitrarily completed in imaginary circles. </p><p>  A simple pattern can have one flower, and leaves will diverge from it to the sides.  Complication can be associated with the inclusion in the circle of elements.  With distance from the center, the sizes of the constituent parts also decrease.  If the ornament is located in a strip, then all the following successive repeating elements must have a constant size and organically connect at the final stage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Floral ornament for painting" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/1114075.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Main types </h2><p>  In the composition of the <span>floral pattern</span> often use the form of "bouquet".  Such an ornament for painting is chosen when decorating cutting boards or dishes.  The main composition is located in the center, and stems with <span>smaller flowers</span> and leaves diverge in a circle.  A variety of "garland" is used when it is necessary to place the painting with tape or sickle, filling it with the side faces and corners of the planes.  The “rhombus” shape is distinguished by a pronounced branching of “weaving” from the central composition towards acute angles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The techniques and painting techniques vary greatly.  The same can be said about the pattern.  Polkhov-Maidan murals are based on roses, poppies, chamomiles, tulips and rose hips.  In Khokhloma - among the grassy curls there are rowan berries and wild strawberries intertwined with stems and branches.  In the Boretsky painting around the main symbol - the Tree of Life (the main flower with a straight stem) - there are smaller elements: graceful leaves, flowers, branches with berries and birds. </p><p>  Petersburg painting is known for white flowers and golden leaves made with translucent brush strokes on a black background.  Her main motive: daffodils, daisies, peonies.  Zhostov specializes in painting metal trays.  Motive - a bright and juicy bouquet of wildflowers and garden flowers, as well as a still life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ornaments for spot painting" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/1113998.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Khokhloma </h2><p>  On the products of masters painted with herbal motifs, one can guess the outlines of plants known since childhood.  Someone prefers grapes, strawberries, gooseberries, cranberries.  Other paintings showcase flowers: bells, tulips, daisies.  But on each there is a subtle depiction along the stem, along the contour of the leaves, large berries. </p><p>  In the technique, two directions are distinguished, differing in the way the background paint is applied to the prepared product.  “Grass” is a well-known “horse” ornament of Khokhloma painting.  Masters apply it in a silver tone with various strokes with the formation of curls, ears. </p><p>  The letter may also contain leaves, flowers and berries.  Such an ornament is distinguished by larger elements.  Depending on the nature, it can be called: “under the leaf” or “under the berry”.  It is usually used on massive blanks where there is a large area of ​​painting.  Leaflets can have an oval or spiky shape, and the smallest berries are formed by the tip of the brush. </p><p>  Another direction of "background" writing is "kudrina."  First, details are drawn (usually in gold), the remaining space is filled with a tone (red or black paint), a thin drawing on top.  The name comes from the similarity of the contours of curls with gilded curls.  They form all forms of ornament: leaves, flowers, fruits.  Filling the entire area, the painting resembles a carpet.  The main role is given to a thin contour line in various designs, and not to wide and thick wrist strokes. </p><h2>  Gorodets </h2><p>  This craft originated in the middle of the 19th century.  The name of the technique received from the village of the same name.  What is special about Gorodets painting?  Ornaments, in addition to plant motifs, are represented by vivid genre scenes.  Often in combination with floral patterns, horses and roosters are present.  Feature of the technique: free stroke and white or black graphic stroke along the contour.  Spinning wheels, shutters, furniture, doors and kitchen utensils were often decorated with murals. </p><p>  There are several stages of execution.  First, the main color spot is placed.  Then gradually undermining takes place.  Vegetable elements are added: rosettes, buds, berries, grooves.  The more complex the motive, the more steps it takes to model the pattern. </p><p>  In the Gorodetsky ornament, the type of pattern “flower strip” is well preserved.  In different versions, it divided the product into tiers.  If we consider an oval convex casket, then a wider strip of flowers is located in the central part.  Below and above it is separated by symmetrically arranged leaves.  At the edges, painting is done in narrower stripes.  In this design, the product is three-tiered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorodets painting ornaments" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/1113976.jpg" width="372"></div>

    <h2>  Ornaments for spot painting </h2><p>  The peculiarity of this type of creativity in the method of applying paints.  It uses <span>spot painting</span> on different surfaces, but looks especially good on glass.  In this case, stencils with <span>contours of the pattern</span> located behind the decorated transparent surface are used for work.  On a tree or other material, the sketch is pre-applied with a pencil or helium pen in the tone of the future color. </p><p>  It is painted with dots.  The motive of the picture may be different.  You can choose a template or come up with an original composition.  Points are placed at different intervals.  You can make them different in size, combine in different combinations.  Of particular importance is the symmetry.  The technique is closer in execution to a geometric ornament, since it is important to maintain proportions.  Work requires endurance and accuracy, but after proper execution, even a simple painting will look spectacular and stylish. </p>
