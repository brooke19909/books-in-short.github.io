    <p>  What countries does Lebanon border with?  In the north and east, it has common borders with Syria, and in the south - with Israel.  The western regions of Lebanon are washed by the waters of the Mediterranean Sea. </p><p>  The territory of Lebanon is conditionally divided into four sharply differing physiographic regions.  These include the coastal plain and mountain range, which has the same name with the country, the Bekaa Valley, as well as the Antilivan mountain range.  The highest point of this Middle Eastern country is at the top of the Kournes al-Saud ridge.  This mountain rises 3083 meters above the ground. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among the many rivers in Lebanon, there is the longest.  It is called Litani.  This river, 140 km long, flows through the central and southern regions of the country.  Such large rivers as Al-Hasbani and Oront originate from the territory of Lebanon.  In addition to this country, they carry their waters in Israel and Syria. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  According to some historians, the word "Lebanon" comes from the ancient Persian "aivan".  Translated, it means "vaulted hall" or "terrace on the columns." </p>

    <p>  There is another version according to which, the capital of Lebanon received the name from the ancient Jews.  It is in their language that the roots of the naming of this Middle Eastern country should be sought.  Translated from it, the word "Lebanon" means "white mountains". </p><h2>  Ancient history </h2><p>  The country of Lebanon was attractive to immigrants as early as the 10th century.  BC  e.  And already after 7 millennia, the first city-states began to appear on its territory, most of whose population was merchants and sailors. </p><p>  Phoenicians founded their settlements on the Mediterranean coast.  There was no centralized management.  That is why, in order to maintain dominance, these people used the power and political wisdom of city-states.  The Phoenicians were skilled craftsmen and the first to invent the alphabet.  These people had their reliable ships and navigation skills.  Its merchants sailed to Spain, Egypt, Northern Europe and to the shores of the entire African continent.  Phoenician merchants sold glass and the famous purple fabrics.  But cedar forest, which grew on the mountain slopes of Lebanon, was still in special demand among buyers.  Wonderful ships were built from the millennial trunks of this mighty tree.  The main centers of Lebanon in those days were cities such as Sidon, Tire, Byblos and Berit (present-day Beirut). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Phoenician trade monopoly was destroyed by the Assyrians in the 9th century.  BC  e.  Then the Neo-Babylonians came to these lands, and then, in the 6th century.  BC  e., they were replaced by the Persians.  In the 4th century  BC  e.  the country was conquered by Alexander the Great.  After this, the Phoenician state finally fell into decay.  In the 1st century  BC  e.  neighboring Egypt and Syria were conquered by Rome.  Phenicia also came under the rule of the invaders.  The territories of this Mediterranean state have become part of the Syrian province. </p><h2>  New era </h2><p>  Between 634 and 639  Arabs came to the Mediterranean lands.  They conquered Syria, turning coastal Phoenician city-states into small settlements.  Arabs actively populated the mountainous regions of the country, exploring valuable fertile lands located there. </p>

    <p>  In the 4th century  BC  e.  Lebanon became part of the Byzantine Empire.  On its territory, Christianity began to gain ground.  However, for a century, the Umayyah ruled Lebanon.  They belonged to the first great Muslim dynasty and instilled in the people their religion.  As a result of this, frequent clashes took place in the country between supporters of this faith and local Christians, as well as Jews.  The Syrian Maronites were especially active, having settled their settlements near the mountain of Lebanon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 750, the Abbasids began to rule the Middle Eastern state.  This empire, one of the provinces of which was Lebanon, lasted until the 11th century.  Further power was seized by the Fatimid dynasty, which were forced to give it to the warlike crusaders.  After them, Ayyubid Muslims invaded the territory of Syria, Egypt, Yemen and Western Arabia.  But never having had time to create their own empire, they were overthrown by the Mamelukes - their slave soldiers.  These conquerors ruled Lebanon from the 13th century. </p><p>  Three centuries later, the Mamelukes lost their positions under the pressure of the emirs of Tanuhid, the tribal leaders of Lebanon.  Part of the country in the 16th century  was captured by the Ottoman Sultan Selim, who was soon replaced by a more talented politician Fahreddin.  This sultan managed to unite the whole region, which is currently a country called Lebanon. </p><h2>  History of the modern state </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century.  the country was divided by the Ottomans into two administrative regions: Maronite and Druz.  Quarrels broke out between the regions, which the Ottoman Empire openly encouraged.  As a result, the differences ended in a war in which not only the Maronites and Druze took part, but also the feudal leaders and peasants who supported them.  Even European politicians had to intervene in the conflict.  Under their pressure, the Ottomans were forced to unite Lebanon, destroy the feudal system and appoint a Christian governor.  This political system lasted until the First World War, during which the country was conquered by Turkish militarists.  After the establishment of peace, France began to rule this Middle Eastern state. </p><p>  What next awaited Lebanon?  The history of the country has changed dramatically since World War II.  The state gained independence and became the largest shopping center.  This is the time when Lebanon is called a country that was the cultural, historical and financial center of the <span>Arab world,</span> as well as Middle Eastern Switzerland or Eastern Paris.  However, in 1975, the state was waiting for a new test.  During this period, Lebanon was seized by the economic crisis.  In addition, the Muslim coalition and right wing Christians unleashed a civil war that lasted almost two decades. </p>

    <p>  Lebanon - what country is it today?  Currently, the state is on the path to reviving its economy.  The tourism business is actively developing on its territory, which, like many decades ago, brings the main revenues to the country's budget.  All this became possible due to the fact that the Lebanese people managed to preserve the rich history of their region, which everyone can see in mountain caves and ancient Roman buildings, medieval castles and mosques.  Today, cities are growing in this Middle Eastern country, modern hotels are appearing, and ski resorts such as Mzaar, Faraya and Lakluk are being organized in the highlands. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Lebanon is the country where the Mediterranean subtropics zone is located.  This area is characterized by hot summers and slushy dank winter.  In July, the average temperature is +28 degrees, and in January - +13 ¬∞ C.  Frosts occur only in some mountainous areas. </p><p>  Most precipitation falls in western Lebanon.  The peaks of the highest mountains are covered with snow throughout the year. </p><p>  Those who dream of a sightseeing or pilgrimage trip to this country are best suited for the period from April to May or from October to November.  These are the months when the weather is especially comfortable for humans. </p><p>  Ski lovers should visit Lebanon from November to April.  For those who have priority beach vacations, it is recommended to buy tours to the Mediterranean coast from April to November.  Anyway, having arrived in Lebanon in the summer, you can enjoy swimming in the sea, and then, after spending only an hour on the road, get to the snow-covered ski resort. </p><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Often, the real pearl of the Mediterranean is called Lebanon.  What country is this in the world of flora and fauna located on its territory?  It is worth saying that the nature of Lebanon is amazingly picturesque.  Two mountain ranges cross the country from north to south.  One of them stretches parallel to the coastal plain, which is buried in the greenery of banana plantations and orange groves.  This is the mountain of Lebanon.  Those slopes that face the sea are covered with forests of oak, Syrian maple, laurel and wild olive trees.  In the higher regions, not far from the peaks, juniper grows, there are also small groves of Lebanese cedar (its silhouette can be seen on the national flag of the country). </p><p>  The second mountain range - Antilivan - rises in the eastern part of the country along the borders with Syria.  Here you can find karst caves decorated with "crystal" stains of <span>stalagmites and stalactites.</span>  Rivers, which are used as rafting trails, swiftly carry their waters from the mountain peaks. </p><p>  Bekaa Valley is located between two Lebanese ranges.  The southern part of its territory is the real breadbasket of the country and has been cultivated by man for many centuries. </p><h2>  Capital </h2><p>  Lebanon's largest city is Beirut.  This is not only a famous seaport, but also the capital of the country.  Beirut is currently the most important financial and banking center of the entire Middle East region.  In addition, there are a large number of international organizations. </p><p>  The capital of Lebanon was first mentioned in the 15th century.  BC  e.  called Barut.  For a long time the city could not compete with Sidona and Tyra.  Its heyday came with the advent of the Romans, who made Beirut the center of Syria and the entire Mediterranean coast. </p><p>  In 635, the city was captured by the Arabs, including it in the <span>Arab Caliphate.</span>  From 1516 to 1918 Beirut was owned by the Turks, who imposed their customs on the local population.  Further it was the center of the state, mandated by France.  And only in 1941, the capital of Lebanon became the main city of an independent republic. </p>

However, it is worth remembering that this eastern country has a number of features.  For example, if Lebanese suggested you drink coffee, then you should not refuse.  Your unwillingness will be taken as the highest sign of disrespect. </p>

    <p>  Also, do not talk with local residents about the relations between ethnic groups or discuss political affairs.  You cannot take pictures of Lebanese without asking their permission. </p><p>  Special rules exist when visiting mosques.  You need to go into them in closed clothes.  In addition, women need to tie a scarf over their heads.  Representatives of the fair half of humanity should not walk the streets in very short skirts and overly open blouses. </p>
