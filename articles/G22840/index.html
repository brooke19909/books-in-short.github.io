The first semantic load declares inheritance as a fiefdom, territory subject to the owner.  The second - as fate, share, rock. </p><h2>  "Specific period" as part of the history of Russia </h2><p>  The first interpretation of the word, explaining it as land ownership, was so popular in Russia that the time period from the middle of the 12th to the middle of the 15th century was called the “specific period”.  It was a time of fragmentation of a single state into small principalities - an integral stage in the development of feudalism in any country.  Sometimes the lot was reduced to the size of a small estate.  This happened because the Russian princes, having, as a rule, a large number of children, when writing a spiritual letter (testament) endowed the lands of each of them or, most of them, those who did not violate their father. </p><h2>  From father to son </h2>

    <p>  Thus, an inheritance is part of the father’s lands given to one of the heirs.  In ancient Russian sources it is sometimes called a settlement, but, according to some experts, this does not sound very elegant.  Of course, during the period of his reign, the prince could attach significant conquered lands to himself, thus increasing part of the inheritance to each of his sons, but still it was a process of fragmentation of the state.  The master, prince, boyar, senor, having received their inheritance (as a rule, in those days there were wild lands with a small fortified city), were forced to have their own army, their own squad.  It could not be so significant as to stand alone against a large army.  Fragmentation and <span>internecine wars</span> were the main reason for the conquest of Russia by the Golden Horde. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The notion of inheritance as a fiefdom existed until 1917 </h2>

    <p>  However, in all this there were positive aspects too - the princes strengthened their estates, rebuilt their capitals, and erected churches.  That is, the "inheritance" in Ancient Russia is that territory which completely depends on the talents of the specific prince.  It will be like <span>Yaroslav the Wise, the</span> patrimony will grow both with lands, and new cities, and numerous temples.  Interestingly, in tsarist Russia until 1917 the concept of inheritance existed, and it denoted land property or real estate owned by one of the members of the royal family.  After the <span>abolition of serfdom,</span> even before 1863, peasants also entered <span>this concept</span> except real estate and land. </p><p>  The term under study itself was very often used in literature, it was found by A. Pushkin in a poem about Boris Godunov: "... we have lost our inheritance for a long time ...", and in the legend about Gvidon, when he, as a mosquito, flew to himself across the sea revenge aunts.  But <span>Buyan Island</span> was not allocated to him by the priest.  So a lot is a land plot, <br>  property owned by one prince. </p><p>  Stephen King has the novel “Salimov’s lot”, where this word takes on meaning and fate (as the name of one of the Russian translations of the book - “The Lot” speaks), and as a land allotment, the location of the city where the events take place. </p><h2>  The second meaning of the term </h2><p>  The second interpretation of the term "inheritance" (this is the lot) has, like no other word, dozens of synonyms in which even phrases are found - the finger of fate, it is written in kind, it fell to the lot, the wheel of Fortune.  There are synonyms that imply a sad fate - shortage, fate, cross, howl.  This also includes Parks and Moira - these ladies are known for chasing their victim with the aim of punishment until it is completely destroyed. </p>

    <p>  Interchangeable words exist for this term, evoking melancholy, despondency and the absence of any pleasant prospect - fatum, rock and fate.  There are synonyms that determine a happy fate - future, field, planida.  Good words are perspective, cup, conduct, share and even happiness.  There is a great many magnificent verses about destiny as fate, such as, for example, "... the destiny of love is beautiful and bright ...". </p><p>  The term under study is also found in geographical names.  So, the territory in the north of Palestine is called the Naffalim’s tribe inheritance. </p>
