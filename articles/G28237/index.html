Since the long past 1976, Mario gave his life to translate this idea into reality.  It took Mario about 30 years to cover the entire hill with professional attention.  In 2007, this creative plan and the project itself were awarded entries in the Guinness Book of Records.

    <p>  For Manarola (Cinque Terre, Italy) to shine and appear in all its glory and magnificence to a large audience, the master needed about 7 kilometers of electric cable, about 15,000 LED bulbs, about 300 sculptures in human height, which were made from industrial and food waste.  Recently, this design has become not only environmentally friendly, but also autonomously illuminated using its own power plant.  It is worth saying that the energy consumption here is completely small. </p><p>  On the territory of the village there are also temple buildings. </p><h2>  St. Lawrence Temple and Chapel </h2>

    <p>  The church was built back in 1338.  It is believed that this building was erected by the masters of Antel.  The holy place is equipped with a nave in three compartments, a Gothic facade, a window in the form of an all-seeing eye, decorated with marble chips.  The main entrance to the temple is decorated with a bas-relief, which depicts paintings of all the torment and persecution experienced by St. Lawrence.  The triptych of the 15th century in the monastery of Lawrence is presented in the Baroque style.  Not far from the church itself is a high <span>bell tower, the</span> construction of which dates back to the 16th century.  From the very beginning, this bell tower served as a normal viewing platform.  The flagellant chapel, which used to play the same role, was conveniently located in the side of the building. </p><p>  In the corner of the small square is a miniature church for church employees.  This institution bears the name of a famous Italian saint named Rocco. </p><h2>  Ruins </h2><p>  The ruins belong to a castle built in the 13th century and, unfortunately, now completely destroyed.  Currently, the walls of the temple and all the towers just organically fit into the surrounding landscape and are in harmony with the cliffs hanging over the sea depths. </p><h2>  Groppo </h2>
