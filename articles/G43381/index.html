Unfortunately, this process leads to a partial destruction of the cultural soil layer.  Unlike laboratory experiments, the re-implementation of archaeological excavations of the site is not possible.  In order to perform an autopsy, many states require a special permit.  In Russia (and before that in the RSFSR) "open sheets" - the so-called documented consent - are drawn up at the Institute of Archeology of the Academy of Sciences.  Carrying out this kind of work in the territory of the Russian Federation in the absence of the specified document is an administrative offense. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="archaeological excavations" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/444307.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Ground for ground excavation </h2><p>  Land cover tends to increase its mass over time, resulting in a gradual concealment of artifacts.  It is for the purpose of their detection that an autopsy of the earth is performed.  An increase in the soil stratum may occur for several reasons: </p><ul><li>  Natural accumulation in the soil of organic substances formed, for example, as a result of decay of the remains of dead plants. </li><li>  The subsidence of cosmic dust on the surface of the earth. </li><li>  Accumulation of waste from human activities. </li><li>  The transfer of soil particles by the wind. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="archaeological site is" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/444312.jpg" width="398"></div></li></ul><h2>  Tasks </h2><p>  The main goal pursued by scientists, carrying out archaeological excavations, is the study of the ancient monument and the restoration of its significance in the <span>historical process.</span>  For a comprehensive, comprehensive study of the <span>cultural layer, it is</span> most preferable when it is fully opened to the full depth.  Moreover, even the interests of a particular archaeologist are not taken into account.  However, as a rule, only partial opening of the monument is carried out due to the high complexity of the process.  Some archaeological excavations, depending on their complexity, can last for years and even decades.  Work can be carried out not only for the purpose of researching historical monuments.  In addition to archaeological, there is another type of excavation, called the "guard".  In accordance with the legislation, in the Russian Federation they must be carried out before the construction of buildings and various structures.  Since otherwise, it is possible that the monuments of antiquity available at the construction site will be lost forever. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="archaeological site" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/444308.jpg" width="505"></div>

If it becomes necessary to measure the direction and thickness of the cultural layer, a sounding is done, trenches or pits are digging.  These tools also allow you to search for an object whose location is known only from written sources.  However, the use of such methods is of limited use, since they significantly spoil the cultural layer, which is also of historical interest. </p><h2>  Showdown Technology </h2><p>  All stages of research and clearing of historical objects are necessarily accompanied by photographic fixation.  Archeological excavations in the Russian Federation are accompanied by strict requirements.  They are approved in the corresponding "Regulation".  The document focuses on the need for high-quality drawings.  Recently, they are increasingly being issued in electronic form using new computer technologies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="archaeological site of Russia" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/444309.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Archaeological site of Russia </h2><p>  Not so long ago, Russian archaeologists published a list of the most important discoveries of 2010. The most significant events in this period were the discovery of a treasure in the city of Torzhok, archaeological excavations in Jericho.  In addition, the age of Yaroslavl was confirmed.  Under the leadership of the Institute of Archeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, dozens of scientific expeditions are equipped every year.  Their research extends throughout the European part of the Russian Federation, at some points in the Asian region of the country and even abroad, for example, in Mesopotamia, Central Asia and the Spitsbergen archipelago.  According to the director of the institute, Nikolay Makarov, at a press conference, during 2010, the Institute of Archeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences conducted 36 expeditions in total.  Moreover, only half of them were carried out in Russia, and the rest - abroad.  It also became known that approximately 50% of the funding comes from the state budget, revenues of the Russian Academy of Sciences and such scientific institutions as the Russian Foundation for Basic Research and the <span>Russian Humanitarian Scientific Fund.</span>  While the rest of the resources intended for the work related to the preservation of monuments of archaeological heritage are allocated by investor-developers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="archaeological excavations" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/444310.jpg" width="550"></div>

Makarov, in 2010 there was also a significant shift in the study of monuments of ancient times.  This is especially true of Fanagoria, the largest ancient city found on the territory of Russia, and the second capital of the Bosporus kingdom.  During this time, scientists have studied the buildings of the Acropolis, and found a large building, whose age dates from the middle of the IV century BC.  e.  All archaeological excavations in Fanagoria are conducted under the supervision of Vladimir Kuznetsov, doctor of historical sciences.  It was he who defined the building found as a <span>public building,</span> which once held state meetings.  A notable feature of this building is the hearth in which earlier burning fire was daily supported.  It was believed that while its flame was shining, the state life of the ancient city would never cease. </p><h2>  Research in Sochi </h2><p>  Excavations in the capital of the 2014 Olympics were another significant event in 2010.  A group of scientists led by Vladimir Sedov, a doctor of art history and a leading researcher at the Institute of Archeology, conducted research near the construction site of the Russian Railways terminal near Vesyoloye.  Here later the remains of a Byzantine temple of the 9th-11th centuries were discovered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="archaeological site of Crimea" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/444311.jpg" width="415"></div>

    <h2>  Excavations in Krutik </h2><p>  This is a trade and craft settlement of the 10th century, located in the forests of Belozorye, Vologda Oblast.  Archaeological excavations in this area are headed by Sergey Zakharov, candidate of historical sciences.  In 2010, 44 coins minted in <span>Central Asia, the</span> countries of the caliphate and the Middle East were found here.  Merchants used them to pay for furs, especially valued in the Arab East. </p><h2>  Archaeological excavations.  Crimea </h2><p>  The historical curtain of this territory rises in many respects thanks to the research work that often takes place here.  Some expeditions have been going on for many years.  Among them: "Kulchuk", "The Seagull", "Belyaus", "Kalos-Limen", "Chembalo" and many others.  If you want to go to the archaeological site, you can join a group of volunteers.  However, as a rule, volunteers have to pay for their stay in the country on their own.  A huge number of expeditions are carried out in Crimea, but most of them are of short duration.  In this case, the size of the group is small.  Research is carried out by experienced workers and professional archaeologists. </p>
