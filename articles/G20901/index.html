Almost everyone, from the baby to the gray-haired elderly woman, is not indifferent to beads, earrings, necklaces and rings.  And it is beads that are the element that can emphasize the lightness and grace of the image or create a bright accent in a strict and casual attire.  And although most often the beads are strung on an ordinary thread, it is more correct to use a jewelry cable for these purposes. </p>

    <h2>  Decorations of ancient years and modernity </h2><p>  People learned to make beads many millennia ago.  And, of course, even before the fashionistas of those old years, a reasonable question arose: ‚ÄúWhat should beads be strung on?‚Äù  The jewelry cable, which can now be easily bought at hardware stores, was completely different. </p><p>  The first beads were strung on a thread or strand.  For strength and durability, the base was waxed, this protected the threads from quick grinding.  And the beads themselves were made of completely different materials.  These were bones, stones of a suitable shape, a tree.  With the growth of craftsmanship and the development of handicraft, glass beads appeared, as well as products from various metals, including precious, beads. </p><p>  <span>Necklaces, beads,</span> pendants - all these accessories do not lose their relevance for millennia.  And no wonder, because few people wear precious jewelry every day.  Jewelry can also look very attractive, and handmade products are absolutely exclusive, unique things that any girl will be glad of. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is bead wire? </h2><p>  Lanka is a special fishing line with a metal base.  This is one of the names that a jewelry cable wears among the people and among sellers of hardware.  This attribute of jewelers has not in vain gained wide popularity.  Products made with its use are incredibly strong.  It is almost impossible to break the beads strung on such a wire. </p><p>  Why is it called a cable?  The metal base consists of strands woven together.  They form a kind of cable.  And for a more presentable appearance, reliability and smoothness, the wire is coated with a polymer material.  The shell prevents corrosion of the metal core, its stretching and deformation. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the possibility that the beads on the jewelry cable will break and crumble is very small, so you can not be afraid for their integrity and safety. </p><h2>  A thousand and one species </h2><p>  There are many different types of wire rope for stringing beads.  The main criterion by which one jewelry cable is distinguished from another is the number of cores in its core. </p><p>  In the shop windows you can find a seven-core cable.  This means that it consists of seven thin <span>wire strings that</span> are specially woven together and wrapped in a transparent or colored polymer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But you can also find lanka, in the core of which 3, 19, 21 or 49 wire strings are woven. </p><p>  In addition, the material of the cable is also different.  The simplest and most common options use steel.  Then the base is gray.  When you need a golden core, you can purchase a brass or copper cable. </p><p>  Most often, such jewelry is jewelry, and it is not customary to use expensive materials for their manufacture.  Jewelers sometimes use a cable made of precious metals - gold and silver. </p>

    <p>  Well, the last thing that distinguishes different types of cables for beads is the color of the braid.  Manufacturers offer the attention of needlewomen almost two dozen of the most common colors and their shades. </p><h2>  How to choose a cable for a bead? </h2><p>  No wonder that among such a variety it is easy to get lost.  What should you pay attention to and how to choose the right option?  First of all, it is important to consider in advance what <span>type of jewelry you</span> want to create. </p><p>  For single-strand beads, consisting of light and medium-sized elements, you can choose budget cables for 7, 19 or 21 wires.  If you need to create a multi-row decoration, then it is best to use 49-wire wire.  Due to its structure, it is very flexible and easy to operate.  For a rigid frame, on which a heavy suspension will be attached, the craftswomen recommend using a three- or seven-core cable. </p><p>  It is characteristic that European-made jewelry cables are of higher quality.  First of all, the difference lies in the fact that they are not subject to bending and breaking, this is their main advantage over cheaper Chinese counterparts. </p><h2>  What is this stuff about? </h2><p>  In general, working with a jewelry cable is very simple and does not require additional skills or abilities.  If there is a choice between different options for creating the basis of a bead, then a jewelry cable gets a clear preference.  How to use such accessories, a beginner will understand.  Stringing beads on a cable is very simple, because its rigidity allows you to not use needles.  Beads and beads pass the vein very easily.  The most important thing is to choose the right diameter of the hole in the beads and the cross section of the lanka. </p>

    <p>  The most diverse accessories for jewelry are attached to the cable without problems.  It can be fasteners, pins, latches, tips and caps for beads. </p><p>  Before starting work, it is worth considering that such a wire is quite rigid, and in order to facilitate the process of work, it is worth stocking up with a special tool.  For cutting use nippers, and for tightening the nodules it is best to use pliers. </p><h2>  Various useful things </h2><p>  Long beads do not need additional accessories and fasteners.  But what if you need to create a necklace or bracelet?  For these purposes, special fasteners are put on the edges of the jewelry cable, which fasten the short thread together. </p>

Clasps are threaded, magnetic, in the form of a carabiner and lock. </p><p>  To carefully hide the ends of the wire in a multilayer decoration, a variety of cones, end pieces and toggles are used.  And bails and pendant holders will help to carefully attach the pendant.  All these accessories are golden, silver colors and their more muted shades. </p><h2>  DIY beautiful beads </h2><p>  Before you assemble the beads using a jewelry cable, you need to prepare the necessary material.  For work, beads with a diameter of 5 mm will be required.  The quantity depends on the required length.  To make rough calculations, you need to measure the expected length with a centimeter, and then divide it by the diameter of one bead. </p>

    <p>  Beads from elements of the same type may look a little boring, so they can be revived by adding larger balls or curly pebbles with some order. </p><p>  A jewelry cable is so good because it is easy to string beads on it, it is very simple to cope with such a process.  When this stage is completed, you need to fasten the locks at the ends, tying strong knots with the help of round-nose pliers.  That's all, the beads are ready! </p>
