A cult place for travelers attracts with delightful river landscapes and mysterious dolmens, keeping ancient secrets. </p><p>  Vacationers in the Krasnodar Territory must go on an exciting excursion to the village, through which Janet carries its waters - the river forming one of the most picturesque valleys in Russia. </p><h2>  Special Valley Magic </h2><p>  This is the most popular place among tourists, struck by the special magic of this unique corner with an interesting history.  Once upon a time, the Tethys Sea spilled here, which appeared at the beginning of the Jurassic period.  And to this day, the remains of relict marine animals that lived in Jean are found and transferred to the local museum.  The river and several of its tributaries on its way create unique waterfalls that cause a lot of pleasant emotions among tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jane river in gelendzhik" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1372247.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The amazing atmosphere of the valley, which has strong energy, is emphasized by bewitching cascades that will not surprise anyone in size, but nevertheless attract the attention of all guests with their charm. </p><h2>  Waterfalls formed by a river </h2><p>  Waterfalls on the river Janet delight with a stunning play of light in shining jets and smooth bends.  They do not conduct excursions in rainy weather, when all the paths are washed away by a shower and become impassable for tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One hundred kilometers from the village is the first waterfall with a swimming pool, where you can swim and recharge positively.  Jane is a river, which over the vast period of its existence has washed the so-called bowls resembling lakes, and now tourists are splashing in them with pleasure, declaring the healing power of the local water. </p><p>  You will have to walk at least three kilometers to the next cascade, but the delightful sight that opens to the eyes of tourists will give you an extraordinary sensation.  An unusual color waterfall with a height of about ten meters and the Bowl of Love resting at its foot are the main attractions of a popular holiday destination. </p><p>  Observation decks are equipped near natural monuments, and narrow stairs lead to the bowls, which are convenient for descending.  True, even on a hot day, the water here is icy, so tourists should be careful. </p><h2>  Ancient Cascade Legends </h2><p>  Local residents will tell the legend of a glorious hunter who fell in love with the king of water.  For a long time, the young man suffered alone and did not know how to attract the attention of a dear woman.  He did not spare his dear pendant with emerald and threw it into the dark water, which immediately acquired a beautiful greenish tint.  So the girl‚Äôs father blessed the future happy union. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="waterfalls on the river jean" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1372251.jpg" width="600"></div>

Newlyweds from different parts of the country rush here to plunge into the waters, giving love and happiness for a long life. </p><h2>  Waterfalls on the river Jan: how to get there? </h2><p>  Popular among tourists, the valley with waterfalls is located 15 kilometers from Gelendzhik.  From the resort's bus station runs a shuttle bus that will take everyone to the village of Vozrozhdenie, and from it to the valley tourists go on foot.  People come here as part of an excursion, or on their own.  Entrance to the valley is paid - the environmental fee is about three hundred rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="waterfalls on the river jean how to get" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1372245.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are souvenir shops, fairs and a large number of food service outlets, so bring plenty of cash with you. </p><h2>  Magic artifacts </h2><p>  The value of this corner lies not only in the uniqueness of the landscape.  The famous cascades are not the only attraction of the valley formed by the water artery of Janet.  The river, on which there are monuments of the Bronze Age, magnetically attracts tourists who want to unravel its secret.  Mysterious dolmens that preserve the historical memory of their ancestors possess tremendous power.  There is a legend that the most secret desire, made near them, will certainly be fulfilled, and everyone who is experiencing serious problems will find their unexpected solution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jane river photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1372261.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The megalithic buildings erected before our era excite the minds of all scientists of the world trying to comprehend the innermost secret of ancient artifacts.  In dolmens, surrounded by centuries-old trees, the remains of people were found, but researchers can not accurately say that they were erected exclusively as graves.  Most likely, the "stone tables" (that is how the word "dolmen" is translated from the Celtic language) had a different purpose, about which science still does not know anything. </p><h2>  Iconic dolmens </h2><p>  The picturesque valley of the Janet River is famous for megaliths, consisting of huge plates or processed stones.  The surface of the stone structure is decorated with ornaments and images of interest to scientists.  It is amazing that the plates forming a kind of ‚Äúhouse‚Äù are very precisely fitted to each other, and they even have grooves and protrusions. </p><p>  Dolmens, consisting of large stones, from which bricks were carved by ancient craftsmen, have a rounded shape with a single hole-hole.  The building was laid out from small blocks, and one stone blocked this structure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jane valley" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1372248.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is an interesting version that megaliths are cult objects by means of which communication with the other world was carried out.  Scientists found on the dolmens a bas-relief depicting the gate, and felt that the figure indicates a portal to another dimension.  Priests came to the buildings and predicted the future in an altered state.  It was found that stone buildings emit <span>low-frequency vibrations,</span> affecting the psyche of people. </p><h2>  Funerary monuments </h2><p>  Dolmens with ancient stories is another attraction that the Jane River Valley is famous for far beyond Gelendzhik.  An excursion to a corner with mystical power is remembered by everyone for a long time.  Tourists admire cult artifacts who heard terrible spells and witnessed mysterious rites, the secrets of which scientists around the world can not unravel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jane river" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1372254.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Funeral monuments preserve the cult of departed ancestors, and esoterics not only from Russia, but also from other countries come to dolmens to feel the special aura of this place.  A land full of mysteries attracts lovers of everything unusual who believe that with the help of megaliths one can attract good luck and family well-being, achieve enlightenment and gain energy. </p><h2>  Sacred place </h2><p>  Fans of yoga, Buddhism and all who are interested in mysterious stories believe that a sacred place helps to find peace in the soul and harmony with the outside world.  Probably there is not a single tourist who would not be inspired by the spirit of this amazing corner.  Near megaliths, of which there are about a dozen, there are shops where people meditate in the hope of finding long-awaited happiness. </p><p>  Many try to take dolmen pebbles for memory, but scientists recommend that this not be done.  Firstly, due to the powerful energy of the valley, which was formed by the Janet River (photo presented in the article).  And secondly, in the stone structures were the remains of people, and taking objects from the cemetery is a bad sign for the living.  For those who want to take something with them as a souvenir, at every step are souvenir shops that sell miniature copies of dolmens. </p>
