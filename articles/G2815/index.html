In addition, a women's sniper school was organized, whose pupils more than once entered the history of Soviet military achievements.  A separate company of women sailors was also organized. </p>

    <h2>  Kremlin Disguise </h2><p>  <span>Considering <span>interesting facts about the Great Patriotic War</span> , we will not once encounter the ingenuity of the Soviet military.</span>  <span>During the first month of the war, the Moscow Kremlin literally disappeared from the face of the earth.</span>  <span>At least it seemed so from the sky.</span>  <span>Flying over Moscow, the Nazi pilots were in complete despair, as their cards did not coincide with reality.</span>  <span>The thing is that the Kremlin was carefully masked: the tower stars and cathedral crosses were covered with covers, and the domes were repainted black.</span>  <span>In addition, three-dimensional models of residential buildings were built around the perimeter of the Kremlin wall, beyond which even the battlements were not visible.</span>  <span>Manezhnaya Square and the Alexander Garden were partially forced by the plywood decorations of the buildings, the Mausoleum received two additional floors, and a sandy road appeared between the Borovitsky and Spassky gates.</span>  <span>The facades of the Kremlin buildings changed their color to gray, and the roofs to red-brown.</span>  <span>The palace ensemble has never looked so democratic during its existence.</span>  <span>By the way, the body of V.I. Lenin was evacuated to Tyumen during the war.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Feat of Dmitry Ovcharenko </h2><p>  <span>Soviet <span>feats in World War II</span> repeatedly illustrated the triumph of courage over armament.</span>  <span>July 13, 1941 Dmitry Ovcharenko, returning with ammunition to his company, was surrounded by five dozen enemy soldiers.</span>  <span>The rifle was taken from him, but the man did not lose heart.</span>  <span>Snatching an ax from his wagon, he chopped off the head of the officer who was interrogating him.</span>  <span>Then Dmitry threw three grenades at the enemy soldiers, which killed 21 soldiers.</span>  <span>The rest of the Germans fled, with the exception of the officer, whom Ovcharenko caught up and also beheaded.</span>  <span>For the courage shown, the soldier was awarded the title <span>Hero of the Soviet Union.</span></span> </p><h2>  Hitler's main enemy </h2><p>  <span>The history of the Second World War</span> <span>does not always tell about this, but the leader of the Nazis did not consider Stalin, but Yuri Levitan, as his main enemy in the Soviet Union.</span>  <span>Hitler offered 250 thousand marks for the announcer‚Äôs head.</span>  <span>In this regard, the Soviet authorities carefully guarded Levitan, misinforming the press about his appearance.</span> </p><h2>  Tractor tanks </h2><p>  <span>Considering <span>interesting facts about the Great Patriotic War</span> , one cannot ignore the fact that due to the acute shortage of tanks, in emergency cases, the USSR Armed Forces made them from simple tractors.</span>  <span>During the Odessa defensive operation, 20 tractors covered with sheets of armor were thrown into battle.</span>  <span>Naturally, the main effect of this decision is psychological.</span>  <span>Having attacked the Romanians at night with the sirens and lights turned on, the Russians forced them to flee.</span>  <span>As for weapons, many of these "tanks" were equipped with dummies of heavy guns.</span>  <span>Soviet <span>soldiers of the Great Patriotic War</span> jokingly called such machines NI-1, which means ‚ÄúTo Fright‚Äù.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Son of Stalin </h2><p>  <span>In the war, the son of Stalin, Yakov Dzhugashvili, was captured.</span>  <span>The Nazis offered Stalin to exchange his son for Field Marshal Paulus, who was held captive by the Soviet troops.</span>  <span>The Soviet commander in chief refused, stating that the soldier was not being changed to field marshal.</span>  <span>Shortly before the arrival of the Soviet army, Jacob was shot.</span>  <span>After the war, his family was exiled as a prisoner of war family.</span>  <span>When Stalin was informed about this, he said that he would not make exceptions for relatives and cross the law.</span> </p><h2>  The fate of prisoners of war </h2><p>  <span>There are historical facts that make <span>memories of the war</span> especially unpleasant.</span>  <span>Here is one of those.</span>  <span>About 5.27 million Soviet soldiers who were held in terrible conditions were captured by the Germans.</span>  <span>This fact is confirmed by the fact that less than two million soldiers of the Red Army returned to their homeland.</span>  <span>The reason for the cruel treatment of prisoners by the Germans was the refusal of the USSR to sign the Geneva and Hague conventions on prisoners of war.</span>  <span>The German authorities decided that if the other side did not sign the documents, then they may not regulate the conditions of detention of prisoners by international standards.</span>  <span>In fact, the Geneva Convention regulates the treatment of prisoners, regardless of whether the countries have signed the agreement.</span> </p><p>  <span>The Soviet Union treated enemy prisoners of war much more humane, as evidenced by at least the fact that 350 thousand German prisoners <span>died in the Great Patriotic War</span> , and the remaining 2 million returned home safely.</span> </p><h2>  Feat of Matvey Kuzmin </h2><p>  <span>During the <span>Great Patriotic War, interesting facts about</span> which we are considering, the 83-year-old peasant Matvey Kuzmin repeated the feat of Ivan Susanin, who in 1613 led the Poles into an impenetrable swamp.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>In February 1942, a German mountain rifle battalion lodged in the village of Kurakino, who was instructed to break through to the rear of the Soviet troops planning a counteroffensive in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Malkinsky Heights.</span>  <span>Matvey Kuzmin lived in Kurakino.</span>  <span>The Germans asked the old man to act as a guide for them, offering in return food and a gun.</span>  <span>Kuzmin agreed to the proposal and, having notified the nearest part of the Red Army through an 11-year-old grandson, set off with the Germans on the road.</span>  <span>Having led the Nazis by roundabout roads, the old man led them to the village of Malkino, where an ambush awaited them.</span>  <span>Soviet soldiers met the enemy with machine gun fire, and Matvey Kuzmin was killed by one of the German commanders.</span> </p><h2>  Air ram </h2><p>  <span>On June 22, 1941, the Soviet pilot I. Ivanov decided on an air ram.</span>  <span>This was the first military feat marked with the title <span>Hero of the Soviet Union.</span></span> </p><h2>  Best tanker </h2><p>  <span>The most qualified tank ace of WWII was rightfully recognized as <span>Dmitry Lavrinenko,</span> who served in the 40th Tank Brigade.</span>  <span>For three months of battles (September - November 1941), he participated in 28 tank battles and personally destroyed 52 German tanks.</span>  <span>In November 1941, a brave tanker died near Moscow.</span> </p><h2>  Losses during the Battle of Kursk </h2><p>  <span>The losses of the USSR in the war</span> <span>are a difficult topic, which they always try not to touch upon.</span>  <span>So, official data on the losses of Soviet troops during the Battle of Kursk were published only in 1993.</span>  <span>According to researcher B.V. Sokolov, German casualties in Kursk amounted to approximately 360 thousand killed, wounded and captured soldiers.</span>  <span>Soviet losses exceeded the Nazi losses seven times.</span> </p><h2>  Feat of Jacob Studennikov </h2><p>  <span>On July 7, 1943, in the midst of the Battle of Kursk, Yakov Studennikov, machine gunner of the 1019th regiment, independently fought for two days.</span>  <span>The remaining fighters from his calculation were killed.</span>  <span>Despite being wounded, Studennikov repulsed 10 enemy attacks and killed more than three hundred Nazis.</span>  <span>For this feat he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.</span> </p><h2>  Feat of the 1378th Regiment of the 87th Division </h2><p>  <span>On December 17, 1942, near the village of Verkhne-Kumskoye, soldiers of a company of senior lieutenant Naumov defended a height of 1372 m with two anti-tank rifle crews.</span>  <span>They managed to repel three enemy tank and infantry attacks on the first day and several more attacks on the second.</span>  <span>During this time, 24 soldiers neutralized 18 tanks and about a hundred infantrymen.</span>  <span>As a result, Soviet brave men died, but went down in history as heroes.</span> </p><h2>  Shiny tanks </h2><p>  <span>During the fighting near Lake Hassan, Japanese soldiers decided that the Soviet Union, trying to outwit them, was using plywood tanks.</span>  <span>As a result, the Japanese fired on Soviet equipment with ordinary bullets in the hope that this would be enough.</span>  <span>Returning from the battlefield, the tanks of the Red Army were so densely covered with lead bullets molten from the impact on the armor that they literally shone.</span>  <span>Well, their armor remained unscathed.</span> </p><h2>  Help camels </h2><p>  <span>In the <span>history of the Second World War</span> , this is rarely mentioned, but camels used camels as a draft force to transport cannons for the 28-reserve Soviet army formed in Astrakhan during the battles near Stalingrad.</span>  <span>The Soviet soldiers had to catch wild camels and tame them because of the acute shortage of vehicles and horses.</span>  <span>Most of the 350 tamed animals died in various battles, and the survivors were transferred to household units or zoos.</span>  <span>One of the camels, who was given the name Yashka, went with the soldiers to Berlin.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Child removal </h2><p>  <span>Many <span>little-known facts about the Great Patriotic War</span> cause sincere sorrow.</span>  <span>During the Second World War, the Nazis took thousands of children of "Nordic appearance" from Poland and the Soviet Union.</span>  <span>The Nazis took children from two months to six years of age and drove them to a concentration camp called "Kinder KC", where the "racial value" of the kids was determined.</span>  <span>Those children who were selected were subjected to ‚Äúinitial Germanization‚Äù.</span>  <span>They were called <span>German names</span> and taught the German language.</span>  <span>The new citizenship of the child was confirmed by fake documents.</span>  <span>Germanized children were sent to local shelters.</span>  <span>Thus, many German families did not even realize that the children they adopted were of Slavic origin.</span>  <span>At the end of the war, no more than 3% of such children were returned to their homeland.</span>  <span>The remaining 97% grew and grew older, considering themselves to be full-fledged Germans.</span>  <span>Most likely, their descendants will never know about their true origin.</span> </p><h2>  Minor heroes </h2><p>  <span>Finishing to consider interesting facts about the <span>Great Patriotic War, it should be said about the children-heroes.</span></span>  <span>So, the titles of the Hero were awarded to 14-year-old Lenya Golikov and Sasha Chekalin, as well as 15-year-old Marat Kazei, Valya Kotik and Zina Portnova.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Battle of stalingrad </h2><p>  <span>In August 1942, Adolf Hitler ordered his troops leaving for Stalingrad "not to leave stone unturned."</span>  <span>In fact, the Germans succeeded.</span>  <span>When the fierce battle was over, the Soviet government concluded that building a city from scratch would be cheaper than restoring what was left.</span>  <span>Nevertheless, Stalin unconditionally ordered the restoration of the city literally from the ashes.</span>  <span>During the clearing of Stalingrad, so many shells were thrown at Mamaev Kurgan that for the next two years even weeds did not grow there.</span> </p><p>  <span>For an unknown reason, it was in Stalingrad that the adversaries changed their methods of warfare.</span>  <span>From the very beginning of the war, the Soviet command adhered to tactics of flexible defense, retreating in critical situations.</span>  <span>Well, the Germans, in turn, tried to avoid massive bloodshed and bypassed large fortified areas.</span>  <span>In Stalingrad, both sides seemed to have forgotten their principles and triple the fierce battle.</span> </p><p>  <span>It all began on August 23, 1942, when the Germans massively attacked the city from the air.</span>  <span>The bombing killed 40 thousand people, which is 15 thousand more than during the Soviet raid on Dresden in early 1945.</span>  <span>The Soviet side in Stalingrad applied methods of psychological influence on the enemy.</span>  <span>Of the loudspeakers installed right on the front line, popular German music sounded, interrupted by reports of the next successes of the Red Army on the fronts.</span>  <span>But the most effective means of psychological pressure on the Nazis was the knock of the metronome, which after 7 strikes was interrupted by the message: "Every seven seconds, one Nazi soldier dies at the front."</span>  <span>After 10-20 such messages included tango.</span> </p><p>  <span>Considering <span>interesting facts about the beginning of World War II</span> and, in particular, about the Battle of Stalingrad, one cannot ignore the feat of Sergeant Nuradilov.</span>  <span>On September 1, 1942, the machine gunner <span>Khanpasha Nuradilov</span> independently destroyed 920 enemy soldiers.</span> </p>
