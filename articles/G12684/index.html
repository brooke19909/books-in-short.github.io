Of these, more than a quarter are sandy beaches. </p><p>  This stunningly beautiful country, due to wars in neighboring states, has until recently been closed to tourists.  But today, this direction is chosen by travelers from all over the world, including Russians.  And this is not surprising: almost completely the territory of Montenegro is protected by UNESCO, in addition, the clean <span>Adriatic Sea,</span> sandy beaches, friendly locals and cozy hotels contribute to the flow of tourists here constantly increasing. </p>

    <p>  Great stay at a modest cost.  This is how many Russians characterize their stay in Korali 2 *.  The rooms are spacious, comfortable large balconies with excellent views, unobtrusive service, judging by the reviews, many liked it. </p><p>  Decent food, no one was left hungry.  The staff is ready to help in any matter.  However, in some reviews, Russians express dissatisfaction with the fact that, according to the rules of the hotel, eviction takes place at ten in the morning, which the tour operator does not warn in advance.  Therefore, many advise when planning a trip, choose a return charter before noon.  Although even this, judging by the reviews, did not overshadow the rest. </p>
