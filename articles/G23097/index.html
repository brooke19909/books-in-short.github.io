Almost anywhere in the country there is a place with that name.  Of course, it is not original.  But it‚Äôs immediately clear how the name came about. </p><h2>  Why did the villages call the peace word </h2><p>  There are 2 reasons why villages were given such a friendly name: </p><ol><li>  Perhaps the village was built in the XIX-XX centuries by the combined forces of all residents.  As they said before, the whole world.  So they gave the village built by joint efforts the name Mirny. </li><li>  Another option - the village was restored or built after 1945.  The horrors of war left an imprint on the consciousness of people who wanted to see around them only joyful, peaceful, flourishing. </li></ol><h2>  Mirny settlement on the map of Russia </h2><p>  Among the many diverse villages with a peace-loving name, there are those that have become famous, despite the small territory and small number of inhabitants.  It is worth telling more about such settlements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peaceful village" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2192785.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Peaceful in the Arkhangelsk region </h2><p>  On the shore of Lake Plesetsk in the Arkhangelsk region is the village of Mirny, better known as Plesetsk. </p><p>  Probably, only the lazy did not hear about the <span>Russian spaceport</span> .  It is from here that unmanned spacecraft soar into space, and scientific, applied, and defense activities are carried out outside the earth.  In the 70-80 years of the last century, almost half of all space launches were made from the cosmodrome.  Therefore, in 1966, Mirny received city status.  The village is a closed territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  About 32 thousand people live in the village. </p><h2>  Near Kazan </h2>

In the history of the village there were terrible fires and heroic labor, estimated by the state of victory. </p><p>  Now in the village of Mirny, Samara Region, about 7 thousand people live, for whom all the necessary infrastructure has been established.  There is a comprehensive and music school for children, a sports complex, shops, pharmacies, and regular transport links with Samara. </p><h2>  In Yakutia </h2><p>  The diamond capital is called the village of Mirny in Yakutia, in the Far North. </p><p>  The name of the village, which later became a city, was given by the Mir kimberlite pipe, discovered in 1955. The richest diamond deposit caused the development of this desert region.  Now in the village there are several factories for the extraction and processing of diamonds.  It even built its own airport.  Unique is the kimberlite museum opened in the village. </p><p>  About 37 thousand people live in northern Mirny. </p><h2>  Peaceful in Crimea </h2><p>  Probably in the Crimea is the friendliest village of Mirny.  Yevpatoriya - the famous children's resort, which is located next door: 25 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peaceful yevpatoriya" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2192747.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The sea, sandy beaches, healing steppe air, peace and quiet - this is how you can characterize this settlement.  In summer, the village becomes crowded, and in winter only local residents remain: about 4 thousand people. </p><p>  Nearby is a lot of interesting things: </p><ul><li>  <span>Donuzlav lake,</span> which was chosen by fans of surfing; </li><li>  wind power station; </li><li>  dolphinarium; </li><li>  therapeutic mud lake Oyburskoe. </li></ul><p>  In the village, the Center for Long-Range Space Communications is based.  Its huge antennas are visible from afar.  Thanks to these installations, communication was maintained with Yuri Gagarin, the work of the lunar rovers was coordinated, and broadcasts from the Olympics-80 were broadcast throughout the country. </p><h2>  And other Peace </h2><p>  In the Volgograd and Rostov regions, in the Stavropol Territory, Ulyanovsk and Bryansk Regions, Krasnodar Territory, as well as near Saratov and Chelyabinsk, you can find the village of Mirny.  But that is not all.  Near the capital, in Ramensky, Noginsky district and near Serpukhov, there are small settlements with the same name. </p><p>  So, when you are going to send a letter to Mirny, you must carefully indicate in which area and region it is located in order to avoid confusion. </p>
