What is interesting about Normandy?  You will find sights, photos and a description of the region in this article. </p><h2>  Viking land </h2><p>  Normandy is a modern region of the French Republic, as well as its historical area.  This is the birthplace of <span>Blaise Pascal,</span> Gustave Flaubert, Claude Monet, <span>Pierre Cornell</span> and other famous personalities. </p><p>  The region is located in the north of the country, it is crossed by one of the largest rivers in France - the Seine.  From the north-west it is washed by the English Channel, on land it is adjacent to Brittany, <span>the Loire Valley,</span> le-de-France and O-de-France. </p><p>  The first known peoples who settled on these lands were Gauls.  As often happened, they were captured by the Romans, and later the Frankish state.  In the 9th century, Charlemagne gave the territory to the Vikings or the Normans.  Viking leader Robert of Normandy turned the lands into his duchy.  Thanks to him, the name ‚ÄúNormandy‚Äù was permanently entrenched in the region. </p>

    <p>  The sights of Normandy will appeal to many.  These are the sea resorts of Dieppe, Deauville, F√©cain with beautiful beaches, expensive restaurants and yachts, and the modest villages and medieval cities of Vernon, Louvier, Honfleur, Evreux.  Only in Normandy make real apple cider Calvados and mold cheeses Camembert, Pont-l'Evec, Livaro. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sights in Normandy, France </h2><p>  Now Normandy is an integral region with the capital in the city of Rouen.  Historically, it is divided into two separate areas called Lower and Upper Normandy.  The sights of Lower Normandy are very contrasting.  The region includes departments of Calvados, Orne and the English Channel.  The main city is Caen - the monastery of Conqueror Guillaume, where its castle still stands. </p><p>  Trouville and Deauville are popular for their luxurious beaches, festivals and gourmet restaurants.  Calvados is also famous for beaches, although history buffs come here more often.  On the coast of the department in 1944 the battle for Normandy took place.  The memorial, the Battle Museum and military cemeteries keep this in mind. </p><p>  The sights of Normandy Upper are no less interesting.  The region includes the departments of Ayr and Seine-Maritime.  The administrative center is Rouen - the city where Jeanne d'Arc was burned at the stake.  Now at this place is a church dedicated to her, after the church recognized its <span>rash act.</span> </p><p>  Upper Normandy is known for exemplary Gothic and half-timbered architecture, numerous museums and theaters, its dairy products, as well as parks and gardens, which are more than 50. Impressionism was born on its green valleys and rocky shores from under the brush of Claude Monet.  His house and grave is located in the town of Giviene. </p>

    <h2>  Mont Saint Michel </h2><p>  The sights of Normandy can be explored for months.  Among the most exciting places can be called Mont Saint-Michel - an island of rocks, turned into a fortified city.  Above sea level, it rises almost 79 meters.  The city was built back in 709 on a natural formation of granite. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Mont-Saint-Michel appears to emerge from the earth in the middle of a flat coastal landscape.  During high tides, it is surrounded by water for 8-9 hours, which rises to 15 meters in height.  At low tide, it leaves the cliff for 20 kilometers.  Such a natural defense served as a reliable ally of the ascetic city. </p>

    <p>  In early Christian times, hermits came here to devote their lives to prayer.  Because of their many remains, the mountain was called the Grave.  Later, a monastery was built on an elevated cliff, which then became an abbey.  Once it was completely burned, after being restored and turned into a political prison. </p><p>  Now the abbey belongs to the Benedictines and is used for its intended purpose.  And the scriptwriters of The Lord of the Rings even wrote off his image for the fortress of Minas Tirith. </p><h2>  Chateau de Bomenil </h2><p>  The sights of Normandy are also represented by palace and park complexes.  Chateau de Bomenil, located in the department of Ayr, is notable for its architecture and the adjacent park.  It belongs to Upper Normandy and was built in the era of King <span>Louis XIII</span> from 1633 to 1640. </p>

    <p>  Combining the features of the Renaissance and the then popular Florentine style, Bomenil is in no way inferior to Versailles in beauty.  It is built of pink brick, lavishly decorated with pediments of various shapes and mascarons, the plots for which are taken from Italian comedy. </p><p>  The castle is surrounded by a pond with fountains, symmetrical flower beds and sculptures.  The complex also has a park with a boxwood labyrinth and a small garden, accessed through a stone arch twined with greenery. </p>
