    <h2>  Silence Beach Resort 5 *: traveler reviews from Russia </h2><p>  As you know, modern tourists are becoming more demanding.  So, the choice of a hotel today is carried out not only on the basis of a description of the hotel and the advice of managers from travel agencies.  Most travelers also prefer to carefully read the opinions of other people who have happened to visit this or that place.  Indeed, it is such information that can give a more accurate picture of the hotel.  In this regard, today we decided to ease your task a bit and save time by summarizing the comments of our compatriots regarding their stay at the five-star Silence Beach Resort hotel in Turkey.  In general, most Russians were satisfied with their choice.  But we propose to understand the issue in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel selection" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/950130.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The hotel itself, its territory and location </h2><p>  First of all, the guests positively note the fact that the hotel complex is as if divided into two parts.  In one of them, all the entertainment is concentrated - swimming pools, a water park, animation, etc. The other part is suitable for a quiet and relaxing holiday.  If you prefer the second option, then experienced tourists recommend choosing rooms in a bungalow.  All have separate access to the pool.  In addition, you will not need to go to the main restaurant, as there is one here. </p><p>  The rooms in Silence Beach Resort 5 * (Turkey, Side), according to the guests, are quite spacious, bright, with a good repair.  Pleased with the fact that the staff does not forget to replenish the supplies of bath toiletries, as well as the contents of the minibar.  Claims for cleaning and changing towels at the hotel guests also did not arise. </p><p>  As for the territory of the hotel complex, the tourists found it beautiful, well-groomed and large.  However, some guests note that they did not really like the fact that most of the entertainment is located quite far from each other.  But still this cannot be called a significant drawback. </p><p>  Many modern tourists also care about the quality of the Internet at the hotel.  So, as for the hotel complex under consideration, then, according to our compatriots, Wi-Fi "catches" everywhere.  However, the quality of communication sometimes leaves much to be desired.  But you can use Skype and view mail without any problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel silence beach resort 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/950132.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  restaurants and bars </h2><p>  As for food, on this point the choice of the Silence Beach Resort hotel also did not disappoint most vacationers.  A number of tourists note with enthusiasm the fact that they could eat here 24 hours a day.  So if you return to the hotel from a night club late at night and feel hunger, then you will have the opportunity to have a bite. </p><p>  The choice of dishes in the main restaurant seemed insufficiently diverse to some guests.  And this is despite the fact that the menu always has meat, poultry, fish and seafood.  From time to time, visitors are offered shrimp and crayfish.  You can also always enjoy delicious desserts and fresh fruits.  However, at the same time, guests of Silence Beach Resort 5 * (Turkey, Side) have the opportunity to visit a la carte restaurants.  So to diversify your menu is not difficult.  In particular, guests praise the Asian restaurant. </p><p>  There were no complaints from travelers about the drinks offered at the bars.  If you want variety, then order their signature cocktail from the bartenders.  So you can try drinks prepared according to a variety of recipes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="silence beach resort 5 prices" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/950134.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment Reviews </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, everyone will find something to their liking at the Silence Beach Resort Hotel.  So, many enjoyed visiting the water park.  By the way, guests note that upon check-in they give several tickets for water slides.  For the remaining visits to the water park you will have to pay extra.  On the territory of the hotel complex animators work all day.  In general, guests had no complaints about them.  The only thing our compatriots pay attention to is the fact that the animators practically do not speak Russian.  This does not apply to people working with children.  By the way, tourists who came to rest in Silence <span>Beach Resort 5 * (Turkey, Side) as</span> whole families speak very warmly about the animators who worked with their children.  So, according to them, every day they invented something new and entertained the kids with various funs, made crafts and had a great time.  In the evenings, the hotel hosts a mini disco, which children enjoy visiting.  Also for young guests on the territory of the hotel complex there is an amusement park. </p><p>  Since tours to Turkey are often chosen by people who plan to have a great time at the sea, the question of having your own beach at the hotel and its quality is always relevant.  As for the Silence Resort Beach, it is on the first line.  The hotel's private beach is sandy.  However, when entering the water at the bottom there are small pebbles.  Guests say that for adults this is not a problem, but for kids it is advisable to wear rubber shoes.  As for the beach itself, it is spacious, clean.  There is a sufficient number of sunbeds.  Our compatriots note that there is enough space for everyone.  Therefore, there is no need to get up early in the morning in order to take a sunbed.  By the way, the same applies to pools.  So in this regard, the Silence Beach Resort compares favorably with a number of other hotels where the number of sun loungers is not designed for the number of vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="silence beach resort 5 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/950133.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Personnel Impressions </h2><p>  Since tours to Turkey have long become more than popular with residents of our country, our compatriots are used to the fact that in almost all hotels the staff speak Russian.  As for the Silence Beach Resort, not all the staff can boast of this.  This is due to the fact that the contingent of hotel guests more than 60% consists of residents of Turkey.  However, if you encounter a problem and cannot speak English, there will always be an employee who speaks Russian.  So worry about this is not worth it. </p><p>  In general, according to the guests, the hotel staff left an extremely pleasant experience.  All are very polite, courteous, attentive and do their job well. </p>
