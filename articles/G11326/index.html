Photo, appearance, meaning</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cossack hairstyle - forelock, chuprin or haircut "under the makitra" (pot) - this is not just an element of the image.  Behind every haircut is a legend.  In this article we will talk about the history of the appearance of peculiar hairstyles and their significance in the life of the Cossacks. </p><h2>  Chub Taras Bulba </h2><p>  To begin with, let's recall what was the appearance of one of the most famous Cossacks in literature.  Taras is an elderly man, his head is shaved, but there is a forelock (oseledets).  This lock of hair is completely <span>gray.</span>  He shaves his beard, but he has grown a long hanging mustache.  His face is covered with scars that he received in battle.  As you can see, one of the most striking representatives of the Cossacks wears a traditional hairstyle - forelock. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nytimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Taras Bulba" class="if uuid-2525158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2525158.jpg"></div><h2>  Varieties of hairstyles </h2><p>  Hair for the Cossacks was of particular importance.  No one gave instructions to wear a forelock to the Cossacks, but for them it was a sign of belonging to one community, clan, and village.  Warriors also always wore a hat, jamming on one side. </p><p>  Let's look at exactly what hairstyles the Cossacks wore and what is their difference.  Among the widely known, one can distinguish the following: </p><ul><li>  crest; </li><li>  forelock "bastard"; </li><li>  Choprin haircut; </li><li>  ‚Äúbrace‚Äù, hairstyle ‚Äúunder the pot‚Äù or ‚Äúunder the watermelon peel‚Äù. </li></ul><h2>  Crest </h2><p>  The custom to wear such a hairstyle was mainly among the Circassian Cossacks.  Haircut "crest" was done to boys who passed the initiation rite.  After the child was initiated into warriors, his head was shaved smoothly around the edges, and in the middle they left what is now called the ‚ÄúIroquois‚Äù.  Such a crest was the basis for a slightly mocking nickname of the Slavic warriors.  Interestingly, among the Persians living in the neighborhood, the word "Cossack" also had the meaning "crest". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Oseledets </h2><p>  Only the warriors who "sniffed gunpowder" had the right to wear the chub "osledets" or chuprin.  This is not just a hairstyle, but an ancient rite.  For the Normans, for example, it was a consecration to the service of a god with one eye - Odin.  It was believed that such a hairstyle was worn by the one-eyed ruler and his entire army.  There is documentary evidence that the pagan warriors of Prince Svyatoslav of Kiev wore the same hairstyles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="500px.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Long forelock of the Cossack" class="if uuid-2525160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2525160.jpg"></div><p>  What did a Cossack look like with a forelock?  It is known that the artist Repin, portraying Cossacks in 1880 on the canvas of the same name, was clearly mistaken.  If you look at the picture, you can see that the Cossacks oseledets are very thin, similar to Chinese pigtails.  In addition, they were laid behind the right ear, which was not permissible.  There are, however, Cossacks in the picture and with haircuts "under the pot." </p><div class="photo" data-original="sandra-rimskaya.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Repin's painting" class="if uuid-2525172" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2525172.jpg"></div><h2>  What did the sedentary look like? </h2><p>  The entire surface of the head was completely shaved, and a bundle of hair was left above the forehead itself.  It had a width of three fingers, and a length of at least three to four fingers or more.  Some Cossacks grew rather long forelocks.  During the battle, they fluttered in the wind and frightened the enemy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cossack appearance" class="if uuid-2525161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2525161.jpg"></div><p>  Hairstyles "crest" and forelock-sedentary was customary to wear in the north of Ukraine, for example in Cherkasy. </p><h2>  What significance did the Cossacks attach to the forelock? </h2><p>  Only experienced warriors had the right to wear such a Cossack hairstyle as a forelock.  It was believed that the more a man went through the war, the longer the lock of hair could be.  Such Cossacks were called ‚Äúchuprinders‚Äù.  Young warriors cut their forelocks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lewiatan84.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cossack &quot;osledets&quot;" class="if uuid-2525178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2525178.jpg"></div><p>  There was a custom to lay a Cossack forelock solely on the left ear.  It was believed that on the right side of the warrior sits an angel, and on the left the devil.  So the Cossacks brushed it off with their long locks of hair. </p><p>  Warriors who honored the Cossack traditions, or, as they were then called, the traditions of "grassroots partnership", considered the forelock a distinction, the same as a sword, medal, order. </p><p>  Some historians believe that the Cossack forelock in Kievan Rus was a sign of belonging to a noble family.  A description of the son of Princess Olga - Svyatoslav Igorevich, which stated that the great commander had a bald head, and only on one side there was a lock of hair, has survived to this day.  The prince also had a long hanging mustache and one large earring in his ear.  All three signs related to the appearance of Zaporizhzhya Cossacks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What does the word "forelock" mean?  There is a version that it came from the Persian word "chob".  It means a bunch or bunch.  For a Cossack, such a hairstyle was a business card or password.  Wherever the brave warriors brought in, they could always recognize their own by the traditional hairstyle. </p><p>  In addition, the Cossacks believed that there was energy in the hair, which means that completely cutting them off would lose protection.  People also believe that a Cossack needs a forelock, so that after he falls on the battlefield, an angel can pick it up and take it to heaven. </p><p>  He was also called "redeeming."  There was another legend in which it was talked about why the Cossacks have such a hairstyle.  A forelock is a lock of hair, for which the Lord had to get a Cossack out of the hell cauldron, because the person who kills people, even if they are enemies, cannot be clean before heaven. </p><h2>  Haircut "under a forelock" or "chuprin" </h2><p>  This hairstyle arose after the Tatars defeated Russia, and most of the Russian princely lands became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  Later it turned into the Commonwealth, which means ‚ÄúUnited Republic‚Äù. </p><p>  Chuprin hairstyle was created very simply.  The hair was shaved baldly over the forehead, on the temples and on the back of the head.  Part of the palm-sized hair of an adult male was left at the crown.  They were combed, evenly distributed throughout the head, and cut in a circle.  It seemed that the head was completely covered with hair, but with a gust of wind, the skull of a warrior was exposed.  This made his appearance more belligerent and wild.  This haircut was worn for the most part: </p><ul><li>  <span>Registered Cossacks</span> ; </li><li>  free peasants; </li><li>  landowners; </li><li>  city ‚Äã‚Äãdwellers. </li></ul><p>  There was also a variety of this haircut, which had the name "under the forelock in Polish."  The difference was that a lock of hair was left higher.  The hair was worn mainly by the pans, but apparently they cut their serfs in the same way.  Hence the proverb that when the lords fight, the forelocks crack at the slaves. </p><p>  All the same, "under the forelock" was most often cut to know.  This "hairstyle of the Cossack" was worn by princes who belonged to the Lithuanian, Polish and Russian families. </p><p>  Choprin haircut was also relevant in Moldova in 1595-1606 and later.  At this time, Lord Jeremiah Grave ruled there.  He was the uncle of Peter the Grave.  He himself preferred such a haircut, and his children, Alexander and Konstantin, were depicted in the paintings with the same hairstyles.  In the old days, Moldova was called Shipotskaya land and was part of Kievan Rus.  The heads of state were called rulers and all were of Russian origin.  Ivan Pidkova - the legendary Cossack hetman - were from the kind of Moldavian rulers.  The Turks, who, as you know, brought up Janissaries from Christian boys, also cut them "under a chuprin". </p><h2>  Makitra haircut </h2><p>  She also had the name "under the pot", "under the watermelon peel."  It was very easy to complete.  A roundish container or the same watermelon peel was worn on the head.  All the hair that peeked out from under her was cut.  This hairstyle was worn mostly by Cossacks of the middle Don and Yaik.  The image of the blacksmith Vakula is a vivid example of a representative of the Cossacks with a "under the pot" haircut. </p><div class="photo" data-original="balov-kovka.jouwweb.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Potty haircut" class="if uuid-2525163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2525163.jpg"></div><h2>  The fight of the kings with the hairstyles of the Cossacks </h2><p>  Russian rulers were annoyed by the hairstyles of the Cossacks.  Peter 1 issued a decree to shave off his mustache and forelocks.  From this it was only possible to pay off a large sum. </p><p>  Catherine 2, who did not really like the Cossacks, called the forelocks "herrings."  In Ukrainian, it sounds like "osledets".  In fashion at that time there were starched huge wigs with curls, and the Cossacks looked very strange against this background. </p><h2>  The value of hair for Cossacks </h2><p>  The hair that remains after the haircut carries information about the person, so with their help you can harm the owner.  Cossacks believed in this.  After the haircut, they buried them in the ground, because part of the hair could get to the enemy, which could cause damage to the owner. </p><p>  The Cossack custom has come to our days for the first time to cut a boy when he is one year old.  The godmother is involved in the process, which cuts the baby, and other relatives.  The mother does not participate in the procedure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gazetarespublika.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Makitra haircut" class="if uuid-2525162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2525162.jpg"></div><h2>  Cossack customs related to hair </h2><p>  When the soldiers buried a friend who was treacherously killed, they tore a piece of hair from a forelock and threw it into the grave.  This meant that they would definitely find the killer and take revenge. </p><p>  Gogol also mentioned the forelock of Taras Bulba and the curse.  The old father tore a tuft of hair from his head and cursed the day when he gave birth to a divine traitor. </p><p>  But the Cossacks knew that the Lord forbids us to think about revenge, and therefore they understood that they doomed themselves too.  If the warrior decided to take revenge, he knew that now he would not go to heaven, and that he would not rest in this world, nor in this.  Therefore, Gogol's Taras Bulba was probably killed. </p><p>  Next, we‚Äôll talk a little about how the Cossacks watched their appearance. </p><h2>  Traditions related to appearance and clothing </h2><p>  Cossacks had a special attitude towards hats.  To lose her was to lose her head.  Icons were sewn into it, and important documents were placed behind the lapel.  To knock off a hat from the head, as well as to remove a scarf from a woman, is a blood offense for which they avenged. </p><p>  Cossacks wore several types of hats: a <span>hat (hat)</span> or a cap.  At the first, awards were sewn. </p><p>  When the Cossacks gathered in a circle (for advice), they voted in hats.  The hat was also thrown into the courtyard of the girl to whom they were going to send matchmakers.  They called such "praises."  The girl had to take a hat and put on the table in front of her father.  If she laid her bottom down, it meant that she agreed to marriage, and if up, then no. </p><p>  If a Cossack perished in the war, his cap or cap was brought into the house and put on the deity.  If a warrior decided to marry a widow with children, then he came to the river and threw at her the dead man‚Äôs oath with an oath to protect and love his wife and protect the children. </p><p>  According to the charter, the Cossack was obliged to carefully monitor his appearance.  This should have become a solid habit, since in war non-compliance with hygiene standards could lead to infection and death. </p><p>  The senior officer could stop the Cossack right on the street and ask him to show how clean the fighter‚Äôs legs or underwear were.  This was also done in order to prevent diseases that spread very quickly in the field and could cause the death of an entire regiment. </p>
