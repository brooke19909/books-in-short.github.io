    <h2>  Sochi Beach Hotel (Sochi) - reviews, advantages </h2><p>  Choosing a good hotel is not an easy task.  So, help to evaluate the quality of service in Sochi Beach Hotel reviews.  Based on the comments of tourists, we can talk about the following positive points: </p><ul><li>  helpful and friendly staff; </li><li>  good evening program with concerts, contests and a disco; </li><li>  the presence of two pools - indoor and outdoor (the second is heated in cold weather); </li><li>  next to the hotel building there is a large landscaped area for walking; </li><li>  perfect cleanliness of the rooms; </li><li>  if you are planning a celebration or you have chosen this hotel for your honeymoon, then, by prior arrangement, your room will be decorated accordingly; </li><li>  proximity to the sea and the corresponding view from the window. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Has a number of significant disadvantages resort hotel Sochi Beach Hotel 3 *.  Reviews highlight the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  disgusting quality of food in a restaurant (and prices are more than high); </li><li>  poor sound insulation in the rooms; </li><li>  very slow waiters; </li><li>  There is a railway next to the hotel, and therefore you will constantly be harassed by the noise of trains passing by; </li><li>  to get into the city, you need to climb a mountain that only physically hardy people can do; </li><li>  it‚Äôs bad that there is no elevator - it‚Äôs hard to lift the suitcases upstairs. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  It is worth noting that this hotel can be proud of its location, because not every resort institution can boast that it is located directly on the beach.  In addition, you will simply have a breathtaking view from the window.  Moreover, the room is very clean and beautiful.  If we talk about the shortcomings - this is expensive and tasteless food in a restaurant.  In addition, waiters often try to draw money out of customers for breakfast, which is included in the price.  It is also worth noting that due to the proximity of the train station, you may be disturbed by the noise of trains.  In general, this accommodation option can be considered very attractive for those who want to fall asleep and wake up to the sounds of the sea, and also do not want to spend too much time getting to the beach (in this hotel it is closed, that is, it works only for guests) . </p>
