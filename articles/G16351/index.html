Self-tailoring is good because the finished product will clearly correspond to your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cosiness of the room, it will be unique, it will cost an order of magnitude cheaper than purchased or ordered in the studio. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kitchen curtains" class="if uuid-2625623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2625623.jpg"></div><p>  In the article, we will consider several original curtains in the kitchen.  You can sew them with your own hands quite quickly.  The main patterns are represented by rectangular pieces of fabric, but there are also unusual drawings, about which we will discuss separately.  We will also give advice to beginning masters on how to choose fabric for curtains, how to make fabric calculations so as not to buy less or more than necessary. </p><p>  They will help to choose and sew the curtains in the kitchen with their own hands the photos presented in the article.  In each image you will see a special way of attaching the material to the cornice.  Of the many options, it is easy to choose the one that suits your preferences. </p><h2>  Determine the type of fabric </h2><p>  With your own hands, curtains for the kitchen are sewn different, before choosing a fabric you need to think through all the important points.  Curtains are selected according to the following criteria: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.idealtextiles.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="light tulle curtain" class="if uuid-2625577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2625577.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Depending on the location, they can be long, up to the floor, or short.  If this is the dining room area, it is better to make the curtains long, and if the work area and the gas stove are near, then it is more practical to sew a short version.  There are times when there is an exit to the balcony from the kitchen, here you will have to leave open access to the balcony door, having only a window and an upper wide strip. </li><li>  Since the kitchen is a place where there are many different smells, steam, moisture, when buying fabric, take an interest in its qualities.  This should be a material that does not absorb moisture, dust and static electricity.  If you want the curtains to hang for a long period, then select a fabric that will not fade in the sun, and also does not fade after the first wash. </li><li>  Before buying fabric, you need to consider whether it will fit into the general interior of the room, how it will look next to the furniture.  The color scheme can be both monophonic and motley.  It is better to choose a light fabric, because complete dimming in the kitchen is completely unnecessary; </li><li>  Do not forget about the fire safety rules!  If the curtains are located close to the slab, they should be more dense and necessarily natural, otherwise any wind can lift them, and the artificial fabric will flash in one moment. </li></ol><h2>  Selection of colors </h2><p>  When sewing curtains for the kitchen with your own hands, think in advance how they will fit into the interior.  The shade of the fabric can match the color of the walls or the kitchen unit, be a separate bright spot.  The main thing here is not to overdo it so that the colored curtains do not look clumsy.  Designers have certain rules for the effective selection of colors for kitchen curtains. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew your own curtains in the kitchen" class="if uuid-2625583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2625583.jpg"></div><p>  Let's take a closer look at them: </p><ol><li>  If the kitchen is made in muted soft plain colors, then bright curtains, for example, with a floral pattern or another print, will look great. </li><li>  Plain fabric will give the room a certain elegance and aristocracy. </li><li>  Often, material is selected for sewing curtains for the kitchen with your own hands to match the color of either furniture or the decoration of chairs. </li><li>  If the room is small, it is better to choose light, light curtains, even tulle curtains will do, but their color should not match the color of the walls.  This option will visually expand the space of the room. </li><li>  If the windows are low, then they will help visually lengthen the vertical stripes on the curtains.  And vice versa - horizontal stripes are able to expand the room. </li><li>  If the kitchen is located on the ground floor, the curtains should be longer and darker, blocking the room from the prying eyes of passers-by.  If the kitchen windows face the sunny side, it is advisable to pick up cold tones and perform draperies. </li></ol><h2>  How to sew a curtain in the kitchen with your own hands </h2><p>  Let's start learning sewing with a simple version of small window shades on the grommets.  This is a convenient and practical option for curtains.  Sewing them is quite simple.  The material will need to be taken oversized.  Before buying, you need to measure the length of the stick of the cornice and multiply the data by 2 or 2.5 times.  This will be the width of the curtains.  Usually they are sewn from two pieces, therefore the result is divided by 2. The length of the curtain is measured from the eaves stick (+ 2 cm up, add 5 - 7 cm to the upper hem of the fabric) to the end of the window sill (+ a couple of centimeters for sagging and 2 cm for the hem below) ) </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="curtains with grommets" class="if uuid-2625588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2625588.jpg"></div><p>  On a sewing machine, fabric bends are processed on the sides (if necessary), bottom and top.  The upper wide edge is sealed with a strip of non-woven or special adhesive tape to keep the eyelets well. </p><h2>  How to grommets fasten </h2><p>  Sewing curtains into the kitchen with your own hands according to the pattern is simple, painstaking work remains with the marking and installation of the grommets. </p><p>  They lay out the curtains on the table surface.  Markings are made on the upper sealed part.  At least 2 cm should be retreated from above, the rings are placed on the sides at a distance of 5 cm. The remaining parts are marked so that between the central points of the grommets is from 15 to 22 cm. Further, in the designated places, the inner circles of the ring are outlined with a gel pen.  You can pre-lay them on top of the fabric and check the accuracy of the measurements visually. </p><p>  It remains only with sharp scissors to cut all layers of fabric along the contours 2 mm wider than the circled circles.  Eyelets for curtains in the kitchen are better to choose plastic.  They are suitable for light tissues, and it‚Äôs easier to install them and you don‚Äôt need a special tool.  The back of the mount is inserted from the wrong side, and on the other hand, press the outer ring tightly until you hear a characteristic click.  When all the eyelets are installed, the curtain is simply worn on the curtain rod. </p><h2>  Hinged curtains </h2><p>  Do it yourself kitchen curtains (photo below in the article) can be sewn without additional fittings.  It is enough to sew fabric loops to the upper bar. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hinged curtains" class="if uuid-2625613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2625613.jpg"></div><p>  They can be rectangular, as in the sample above.  Some have tapered details.  The valves are either completely sewn and the curtains are threaded onto the side of the cornice stick or fastened with Velcro or buttons matched to the tone.  Sometimes such loops are additionally tied on bright bows or thin ribbons.  Consider how to sew such loops on the top of rectangular curtains. </p><h2>  How to make loops </h2><p>  Each piece is made up of a fabric rectangle.  Its length depends on the style of the curtains.  If the loops are hidden behind the curtain and are not visible from the outside, then they are sewn to the lower edge of the hem, as in the photo below.  When folding the loop in half, it should not peek over the fabric.  The length of the future loop is best measured with a flexible meter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew stitches" class="if uuid-2625607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2625607.jpg"></div><p>  If the loops are thought of as a decorative element, then their length is chosen at the request of the master, as well as the width.  First they are sewn on the wrong side, bending a rectangle of fabric in half and making a side seam.  Then the part is turned on the front side, and the seam is located on the center line of the back side.  Be sure to iron the workpiece so that it is even.  When many such details are made, the rectangular curtain is laid out with the back on the table surface and the hinges are marked out, reinforcing them with pins with a loop at the end.  Then they perform seams on a typewriter.  The curtain is ready. </p><h2>  Curtains on the curtain </h2><p>  This is the easiest and most common style for sewing curtains in the kitchen with your own hands.  See the photo of the original curtains below.  Making a drawstring is simple, just bend the upper edge of the fabric.  If the drawstring is simple, without ruffling from above, then the fabric is bent to the width of the cornice stick + 1 - 1.5 cm for free sliding when closing.  If a shuttlecock is planned from above, then double the size of the fabric to its height is added and two stitches are made for the drawstring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="curtains" class="if uuid-2625618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2625618.jpg"></div><p>  Decorative ties on the upper curtain look original.  Small pinches of fabric fastened with contrasting ribbons look very gentle. </p><h2>  Curtains to the kitchen do-it-yourself pattern </h2><p>  The photo of the drawing will help to properly cut the fabric if you want to sew the gathered curtains, short in the center and elongated on the sides.  They can be sewn from two parts, the whole curtain will also look beautiful.  On the drawing, the letters of the alphabet denote the sides A, B and C. Having measured the length of the cornice, we get size C. The length of the height of the window from the cornice to the end of the windowsill will give size A. Depending on the preferences of the master, the width of the short part of the pattern B. is measured. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="curtain pattern" class="if uuid-2628829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2628829.jpg"></div><p>  The radius of the rounded part is 1/3 of the length of the cornice C. The lower large radius is plotted parallel to the upper. </p><h2>  Sewing options </h2><p>  The above pattern has many sewing options.  The photo below shows that the curtain does not have a length to the end of the window, but about 2/3 of its height. </p><p>  From below the window is closed with a short curtain on the curtain.  A contrasting frill is sewn across the entire width of the part to match the print on the lower curtain. </p><h2>  Curtains in the kitchen with a lambrequin </h2><p>  The curtains in the classic style of cociguille look very impressive.  This is a kind of lambrequin, which has a central figured part in the form of triangles with cut edges and folded side curtains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="classic pelmet lambrequin" class="if uuid-2625646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2625646.jpg"></div><p>  It is easy to draw a pattern of the upper part, since it has a simple geometric shape.  It is enough to measure the desired width along the ledge, lower the lines from its ends down by 10 or 15 cm and draw a triangle.  In our version, we need to make patterns of two parts of different sizes and colors. </p><p>  Side lambrequins are sewn in the form of a rectangular trapezoid.  The upper line is calculated by folding the fabric with folds, each of which should be at least 10 cm. The lateral parts of the pattern fall down at a right angle.  On the inside of the curtain, the side is short, and on the outside it drops to the required length (depending on the size of the window).  Then these points under the ruler are connected. </p><div class="photo" data-original="podborshtor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern option" class="if uuid-2629515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2629515.jpg"></div><p>  Fold the folds on the surface of the table and mark the edge with stitches or fasten with pins.  It is advisable to iron them before stitching so that the fabric does not move. </p><p>  As you can see, making beautiful curtains with your own hands is not difficult.  Get to work, you will succeed!  Good luck </p>
