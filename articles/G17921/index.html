Or maybe you are going to do the handicraft?  In this article you will find ideas of different difficulty levels.  Someone can laugh, well, what kind of adult will sculpt from plasticine?  But there are many such people.  Modeling calms nerves and develops imagination.  Therefore, if you are drawn to plasticine, do not hold back, do it. </p><h2>  Lamb </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY plasticine crafts" class="if uuid-2269292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2269292.jpg"></div><p>  This is one of the <span>simple DIY plasticine crafts</span> .  Even a child can make a sheep.  There is nothing complicated here.  Step-by-step instructions in the pictures are presented above.  The first thing to do is to roll the face of the animal.  It should be an oval.  The body is also an oval, but of a larger size.  Legs are four sausages.  We glue the parts together and a little knocking blank on the table so that the bottom surface of the toy becomes flatter and therefore more stable.  Now you can start making wool.  It is done in two ways.  First, you roll the balls, and then make a depression in each of them.  The second way - you roll thin sausages and twist them with a snail.  We make wool and cover it with a sheep.  Only the front of the muzzle and paws should be left intact.  From black plasticine you need to mold the hooves.  These will be four ovals, in which a deep groove is made by the stack, dividing the geometric figure into almost two parts.  Glue the hooves to the legs.  From white plasticine we make droplet ears, from black we roll balls-eyes.  The lamb is ready. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Princess </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY plasticine crafts" class="if uuid-2269293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2269293.jpg"></div><p>  These cute <span>plasticine figures</span> are made according to one principle.  Princesses differ only in hairstyle and accessories.  We will make such figures on a shell.  It will become the basis, and at the same time the lower skirt.  We will start production from the head.  Roll up a ball from beige plasticine.  In places where the eyes will be, deepenings should be made.  Now you need to build a hairstyle from sausages.  It should alternate short and long strands.  You can leave your hair loose or tie it in a braid or ponytail.  Now we begin to make a skirt.  We mold five identical leaves from plasticine.  Fasten them to the top of the shell.  Now you should roll up three thin sausages - this will be the sleeve.  We make a hand, and in order not to sculpt a brush, we hide it in our hair.  Remains the decor.  You can make a bunch of flowers for the princess or just beautifully decorate the leaves-skirt.  Lastly, we are working on the face. </p><h2>  Snail </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY plasticine crafts" class="if uuid-2269294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2269294.jpg"></div><p>  A handmade craftwork made of plasticine can be cute.  In life of a snail, few people are touched, but their decorative figures look great.  This animal has an interesting shape, it is easy and pleasant to decorate.  Making snails should begin with the body.  Roll gray plasticine onto some coarse cloth.  This is necessary so that the relief is imprinted on the material.  Now cut out the contour of the body.  Then you should roll an uneven sausage from white plasticine.  On one side it should be thicker, on the other thinner.  Now you need to roll it into the shell and stick it to the base.  It remains to decorate the snail.  From red, yellow and white plasticine we sculpt the petals, and then we collect them into flowers.  We supplement the pattern with green material.  We spread leaves and twigs.  Black flagella should be drawn to the snail's face. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Husky </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY plasticine crafts" class="if uuid-2269295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2269295.jpg"></div><p>  Even a child can create such a dog from plasticine.  The step-by-step process of work is given above.  It should be guided in the manufacture of toys.  Let's get started.  We will begin to make a dog from plasticine with a muzzle.

You can mold them manually, or you can cut out thinly rolled plasticine from a layer.  Decorate the face with three balls.  Two of them will be eyes, and the third will be the nose.

Now, from a brown or any other plasticine, you should make a hairstyle.  You can form it from curls of sausages, as well as cut from the reservoir.  It remains to make surprised eyes.  We stick two black dots, and in them we glue two white highlights.  Now very thin sausages should outline the cilia and eyebrows.  Wings should be cut from white plasticine.  If desired, feathers can be embossed on them. </p><h2>  Panda </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY plasticine crafts" class="if uuid-2269300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2269300.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most exciting activities for children is modeling from plasticine.
