There is nothing strange in this - numbers of acquaintances and new friends, customers and suppliers, colleagues and specialists, from whom we need to order only a one-time service, are somehow entered into our mobile device, because it is easier and faster.  Few people further transfer their contacts to another format (on paper or in spreadsheets). </p><p>  For this reason, it is quite difficult to change one mobile gadget to another - precisely because of the need to transfer all contacts. </p><p>  But do not worry.  Android is a well-thought-out platform so that it can easily <span>transmit data on it.</span>  This is done in a variety of ways.  Therefore, in this article we will talk about what to do and what to do if you need to change your mobile device.  And in general it is not necessary to get rid of the old device.  Perhaps you just want your numbers to be duplicated on both hands. </p>

    <h2>  Description of the problem </h2><p>  Your Android phone has many contacts.  They are presented in the form of a number and the name of the person who owns it.  It‚Äôs normal that each of us has several tens / hundreds of such records (depending on the level of social activity).  All of them, of course, are stored on a mobile.  The question is obvious: if you want to make another phone, how to copy contacts from android to android?  You can sit and manually ‚Äúinterrupt‚Äù each record if you have up to 10 of them.  But, most likely, this process would take too much time and effort, so we do not recommend doing this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It would be much more useful to use one of the methods below.  Read our article and learn how <span>to transfer contacts from android to android in</span> just a couple of minutes. </p>

    <h2>  SIM card or phone? </h2><p>  First, let's determine how our data is stored.  They can be saved either to a SIM card or directly to your smartphone.  In the first case, if you rearrange the card to another device, all entries will be transferred automatically.  And the question of how to copy contacts from android to android will disappear by itself.  However, there are a few comments about this.  In them we will describe why people began to use a telephone directory (rather than a "repository" of information on SIM). </p><p>  It is not very convenient to record numbers on a card due to restrictions on their number.  It‚Äôs much more convenient to keep notes on your mobile device so that you can enter the full name, middle name and last name of the person and, in addition, add a lot more contacts than your card can accommodate.  Still, the use of this method is rooted in the time of black and white ‚ÄúSiemens‚Äù and ‚ÄúMotorol‚Äù.  And the person who started using the device N years ago could all the time record phones on the phone.  So, the question remains, how to copy contacts from android to android.  We give answers to it with the indication of different methods.  Which one do you find more convenient? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bluetooth transmission </h2><p>  The first is the pairing of two smartphones (between which contacts are exchanged) using a wireless interface.  <span>How to transfer contacts from android to android</span> via bluetooth?  Very simple: first you need to activate this module on both devices.  Then on the phone from which you want to reset contacts, go to ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù, select the device search item.  The phone should show a list of gadgets with activated visible "bluetooth".  Accordingly, on the second smartphone, you need to put a check mark in front of ‚Äúsee for others‚Äù.  Next, we carry out the connection. </p><p>  How to copy contacts from android to android now?  Very simple: go to the ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù menu on the old device and select everything by checking the boxes (this can be done with one click).  After that, press the options key and select ‚ÄúTransfer‚Äù.  There will be opened different ways to send contacts, you need to click on the "bluetooth" icon.  Then select the device you are paired with and click ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù </p>

    <h2>  Transfer via memory card </h2><p>  Another interesting way that you can use if you can easily remove the memory card (and you have one).  If you do not know how to transfer contacts from android to android via microSD, read this guide. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  First, install the card on the old device.  On the screen you should see that the phone ‚Äúrecognized‚Äù the card, after which you need to carry out the process of saving contacts to it.  To do this, again, you need to select all the entries in your phone book, then press the ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù and ‚ÄúExport / Import‚Äù buttons.  This designation in the menu is precisely responsible for resetting all entries to the card. </p><p>  Next, you need to install microSD in another phone, where you will do the same operation, only this time - ‚ÄúImport‚Äù.  Go to the contacts menu on the second phone and select the appropriate item. </p><h2>  Single account sync </h2><p>  It is very simple to answer the question of how to transfer contacts to android all at once.  The way is to use one account on both phones.  If this is, for example, your new and old smartphones, then on the new one you just need to log into your account, after which all contacts will be synchronized (if this function is enabled in your settings).  If not, you need to activate it by selecting ‚ÄúSynchronize‚Äù and indicate that you are interested in user contacts. </p><h2>  Transfer via Google Drive </h2><p>  When you go to the ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù menu on your old smartphone and select all the entries, you can use another, alternative version of the service through which the transfer will be carried out. </p>

    <p>  If at the very beginning of the article we described how to transfer contacts from android to android (Sony and Samusing - the models of devices that participated in this) and selected the Bluetooth option, now we can use another data transfer service using the same scheme .  For example, the same Drive from Google. </p><p>  Simply select it and the recordings from your phone will go to the "cloud".  From there, you can extract it using the ‚Äúimport‚Äù tool, also by running this application on your new device.  You just need to understand that for this scheme you need to synchronize your Google Drive account on both smartphones. </p><h2>  Computer Transfer </h2><p>  In addition to the various applications and services available from the smartphones themselves, you can more quickly transfer recordings through a PC.  <span>How to transfer contacts from android to android</span> using a computer?  Very simple - using a USB cable and a special MobilEdit program.  It allows you to directly export lists from the phone book and transfer them to a new device.  Thus, everything is much simpler and more convenient. </p><p>  The option with a computer can be the answer to the question of <span>how to transfer contacts from android to android</span> if the screen does not work.  This is especially true if your gadget is still working, but you know that in the near future it can completely fail, and its screen does not show.  In such situations, connect the device and save contacts as quickly as possible (and with them - everything else is valuable that is there). </p>

    <h2>  Transfer through Yandex.Disk </h2><p>  Another search service deserves special attention, which also provides all the tools necessary for exchanging contacts between devices.  True, account synchronization is also needed here.  But the scheme itself is simple - you need to log in to your Yandex account on one phone, copy your contacts to the system, and then go to the same account on another phone.  There (in the settings) there is the item ‚ÄúTransfer from phone to phone‚Äù.  Since this method implies the presence of one account, it is also suitable for those who have just two different devices. </p><h2>  Transfer through other services </h2><p>  In this article, we have described various methods, but they are all similar to each other.  These are typical procedures that can also be used in other combinations.  For example, contacts can be sent to a notebook from the phone book, and then saved to a PC and used as a backup in case of complete loss of data from a mobile phone.  Or, for example, a contact list can be sent to your mail using the same mobile application mail service as Gmail or Yandex Mail. </p>

    <p>  In the future, you can do what you want with your phone numbers.  You understand how to transfer contacts to android.  Via iTunes (transfer from iPhone to iPhone), by the way, the procedure is a little more complicated, but you can easily get used to it.  Fortunately, the developers have provided such a mechanism. </p><h2>  SIM card transfer </h2><p>  I would like to mention another way related to what we talked about at the very beginning.  It is to abandon the component of the smartphone and use the good old means.  Such, in particular, is transmission via a SIM card. </p><p>  There is an item in the menu of android devices that allows you to transfer contacts from your phone to SIM and vice versa.  With it, you can make SIM-cards from your phone numbers, then insert the card into a new device and see all the contacts.  Now they are stored on the piece of plastic that you put in the SIM slot. </p><h2>  3rd party applications </h2><p>  In this article, we describe how to transfer contacts through various schemes: using mail, services for storing data, "cloud" projects, and more.  However, the transfer of contact records can also be done in another way.  To do this, just download the application that performs this task on your android and on the phone that will work with these contacts in the future.  It, for sure, can be provided free of charge. </p>

    <p>  Programs of this nature, as a rule, develop a more convenient interface than the schemes described above.  However, it should be understood that the device can share the contacts, again, only through the file storage, or using the wireless interface, or the "cloud" service.  And this, in essence, is the same as we discussed above. </p>
