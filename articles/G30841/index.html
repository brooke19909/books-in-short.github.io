To carry out settlement transactions, legal entities apply to the bank in order to open an account.  But sometimes situations arise when an enterprise, for certain reasons, has to break an agreement with a bank for servicing an account.  If the head of the organization is not familiar with the nuances of closing a current account, this procedure can cause certain difficulties. </p><p>  How to close a bank account for a legal entity is described below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smartasset.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Close a bank account for a legal entity" class="if uuid-3139098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3139098.jpg"></div><h2>  Reasons for terminating bank account service agreements </h2><p>  Not only the client, but also the servicing bank can initiate the closure of the current account.  To terminate the contract, the client does not need to warn the bank in advance; you can close the account at any time.  In addition, explaining to the bank the reasons for closing the account and terminating cooperation is also optional. </p><p>  Among the main reasons that you need to close a bank account for a legal entity are the following: </p><ol><li>  The desire of several business partners to be served in one banking institution.  Payments within one bank are much faster, their cost is lower than external.  If an organization has few partners, servicing in one banking institution sometimes can significantly save money, and provides an advantage related to speed of work. </li><li>  Poor bank reliability.  Quite often, you can predict a license revocation from a banking organization in advance.  Many individual entrepreneurs and legal entities in such situations prefer to refuse the services of a troubled bank. </li><li>  Inconvenient for the organization of the territorial location of the banking office.  Despite the fact that recently there has been an active development of remote services, certain issues can be resolved only by visiting a bank branch in person. </li><li>  Bankruptcy of a legal entity, its liquidation.  The need to close an account may arise as part of the liquidation procedure.  If the company ceases to operate, its owners try to terminate the account maintenance agreement as early as possible so as not to pay extra money for the provision of the service. </li><li>  Inability to receive certain services, unsatisfactory quality of service.  Quite often, small organizations and individual entrepreneurs start servicing at other banks if they cannot get a loan in the present. </li><li>  High cost of services.  Often banks change tariffs, as a result of which they become unprofitable for a legal entity or individual entrepreneur.  In such cases, organizations have to look for a bank, in which similar services will cost less. <div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alfa Bank close legal entity account" class="if uuid-3139100" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3139100.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  At the initiative of the bank </h2><p>  Also, account closure may occur at the initiative of a banking organization.  Banks have the right to unilaterally terminate an account servicing agreement.  However, for this they must have reasons regulated by law.  The bank cannot terminate the contract with the organization of its own free will. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Banks close accounts of legal entities.  persons in the following cases: </p><ol><li>  Zero account balance, lack of operations on it.  If the client has not been carrying out operations on the account for more than two years, the banking organization will send him a notification that the operation to close the account will be carried out. </li><li>  Violation of FZ-115.  Banking organizations are required to monitor the operations carried out by each client.  If there is a suspicion that the client is laundering money, or terrorist activity is being financed from his account, the bank will request documents confirming the legality of the operations.  If the requested information is not provided to the bank within the prescribed period, the banking organization may terminate the contract unilaterally.  Also, the bank may close the account if in doubt about the authenticity or legality of the submitted documents. <div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Banks close accounts of legal entities" class="if uuid-3139104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3139104.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  Another reason for closing the account at the initiative of the bank may be a court decision.  However, such situations rarely occur. </p><h2>  Is a banking organization able to prevent termination of an agreement and account closure </h2><p>  How to close a bank account for a legal entity?  This is interesting to many.  In accordance with the law, banks are not entitled to refuse this to the client.  However, there are situations when banks have the right to slow down the procedure for closing an account - if operations on it are suspended or funds are seized on it.  In the event that there are no funds in the seized account, banks close it in the standard manner.  If the money is present on it, the bank will be able to close it only after the debt has been written off or the decision to arrest is canceled. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.financeglobe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to close a bank account in a legal entity" class="if uuid-3139107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3139107.jpg"></div><p>  So, how to close a bank account in a legal entity.  face? </p><h2>  Required documents </h2><p>  To close an account, you should contact the bank with the appropriate statement.
