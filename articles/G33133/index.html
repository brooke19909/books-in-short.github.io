Currently, the third option <span>of motor third party liability insurance</span> is gaining strength - extended <span>CTP insurance.</span>  She is also called a voluntary auto-citizen - DSAGO.

    <h2>  Unlimited CTP </h2><p>  The standard policy of a motor citizen has its own limits for covering losses.  The amount under compulsory motor third-party liability insurance without additional services is guaranteed by the state and cannot be increased.  Therefore, in especially severe cases, when a lot of damage has been proved by the court, the culprit has to pay the victim out of his own pocket.  The same norm is enshrined in the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, Art.  1072, according to which, it is the culprit of the accident that bears full financial responsibility for the liquidation of the damage caused.  In this case, a special OSAGO option will help.  DSAGO allows you to fully pay compensation to the victim due to the increased insurance limits.  Such insurance costs more, but it also has more coverage.  The amount of payments for extended CTP is up to 15 million rubles.  Therefore, if you are not satisfied with the standard package of motor third party liability, and you want more, you can get extended insurance.  Especially relevant is the CTP for beginners who recently got behind the wheel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Many companies offer extended packages that include additional services.  Expanded OSAGO from theft will help to get compensation in case of car theft.  Experienced motorists, whose accident-free experience has exceeded three years, can easily issue compulsory motor third-party liability insurance without additional services - the driving experience serves as a reliable guarantee that, even in the event of an accident, the damage will be minimal. </p><h2>  Characteristics of DSAGO </h2><p>  Extended CTP insurance is characterized as follows: </p><ul><li>  DSAGO is an integral part of the insurance policy.  Without a compulsory auto citizen, it is impossible to draw up a voluntary liability insurance package; </li><li>  the total cost, basic requirements and amount of obligatory payments are established by the representatives of the insurer; </li><li>  the time for payments for extended insurance of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance comes only after the limit on compulsory motor third-party insurance is exhausted. </li></ul>

What unites them is that both documents are voluntary types of insurance.  The difference is more significant.  DSAGO is a more extended version of the standard auto citizen - payments for this type of insurance are made in favor of persons affected by the actions of the policy holder.  CASCO insurance protects the car of the policy holder, regardless of who caused the damage. </p>

    <h2>  Where is DSAGO issued? </h2><p>  Extended CTP insurance can be issued at any insurance company, while many of them offer to issue a voluntary auto-citizen along with a compulsory insurance package.  This is beneficial for both the insurance and the client.  The insurer receives a large amount of the down payment, and in the event of an accident, the client does not need to run through various insurance organizations and collect additional documents - the same organization will bear the payments for the main and extended policies.  if compulsory insurance was issued through the option "single agent", extended CTP can be purchased at any nearby insurance center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  What documents are required for the design of DSAGO </h2><p>  To apply for an extended CTP insurance package, the following documents should be prepared: </p><ul><li>  the current policy of a motor citizen, as without it additional CTP cannot be issued; </li><li>  document confirming registration of the vehicle; </li><li>  driver‚Äôs license of the car owner or power of attorney to drive the vehicle; </li><li>  passport of the car owner. </li></ul><h2>  What determines the size of payments </h2><p>  About how much extended CTP costs in the final version, you can find out from a representative of the insurance company.  The type of final payment to the affected party depends on whether or not to wear the vehicle.  Moreover, if there is an agreement that the percentage of depreciation will be taken into account when calculating payments, then the final reimbursement will be much less.  It is more profitable to draw up a second type of insurance, in which depreciation will not be taken into account. </p>

    <h2>  How to calculate DSAGO </h2><p>  Calculate CTP in the advanced version on its own does not work.  The maximum transaction amount will depend on many additional criteria, the complete list of which is set by the insurer.  Among the most important criteria: </p><ul><li>  vehicle characteristics; </li><li>  insurance period; </li><li>  limit on insurance coverage; </li><li>  length of service and age of the driver; </li><li>  list of additional services. </li></ul><p>  Based on the information collected, the insurer sets its own tariffs for this insurance package.  For example, the minimum payment of 300 thousand rubles obliges the car owner to conclude a DSAGO policy with an initial contribution of 1200-1800 rubles.  The average driver, trying to calculate OSAGO in an expanded form, lays down the amount of payments in the amount of about one and a half million, which obliges him to pay ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù at a rate of up to 6 thousand rubles per year.  Moreover, the bonus system does not apply to DSAGO!  To help car owners, many sites of insurance companies have online DSAG calculators, thanks to which you can find out the approximate cost of the insurance package. </p>

    <h2>  Design DSAGO for beginners </h2><p>  For drivers who first sat behind the wheel of their own car, possible situations on the road can cause a fair amount of concern.  Most of all, drivers are afraid to get into an accident, but no one is safe from this.  But newcomers rarely think about their actions after an accident.  Meanwhile, it will depend on the driver‚Äôs initial steps whether they will pay compensation and whether his car will be restored.  That is why drivers cannot get compensation - due to an inattentive attitude to the insurance conditions, although in principle, every victim has the right to insurance compensation. </p><p>  Because of what, then, drivers lose their right to insurance?  Consider the most common beginner mistakes. </p><ul><li>  The participant of the accident independently leaves the scene of the accident to draw up a protocol. </li><li>  The car owner persuaded the victim to settle the issue without paperwork. </li><li>  The driver restores the car at his own expense, and only then applies for payment. </li></ul><p>  All these actions make it impossible to contact the insurance for compensation. </p><h2>  How is the payment of money </h2><p>  If the driver correctly executed the accident and the insurance company made a decision on compensation, the final payment is made within five days.  For remote regions of the Russian Federation, this period extends to fifteen working days.  To obtain insurance, you must provide the insurer with a certain list of documents.  For the culprit of the accident, the list of papers looks like this: </p><ul><li>  statement; </li><li>  duplicate or original of the CTP policy; </li><li>  a copy of the driver‚Äôs license and power of attorney (if the driver was driving in a strange car); </li><li>  a certificate from the local traffic inspectorate about the place and time of the recorded accident, indicating the damage detected. </li></ul><p>  The injured party is also obliged to provide the insurance organization with a mandatory list of documents, according to which a decision will be made on the calculation of compensation.  It: </p><ul><li>  application for insurance compensation (a sample can be taken on the insurer's website); </li><li>  copy of the passport; </li><li>  document confirming participation in an accident; </li><li>  documents for the car; </li><li>  accident notification form; </li><li>  copies of protocols (if any were prepared during an accident). </li></ul><p>  Documents are filed at the nearest office of your own insurance company. </p><h2>  Compensation under OSAGO </h2><p>  Currently, the owners of the vast majority of injured cars do not receive money in their hands, but simply restore their own car at the expense of insurance.  Almost all private drivers of our country have been transferred to in-kind payments.  According to innovations, the injured party will not receive money for repairs on hand - instead, the car owner will be asked to repair the car at the nearest service center.  With what means the machine will be restored - the owner should not be interested.  All responsibility for the quality repair of the car lies with the insurance company.  It is she who chooses the service station, concludes a contract with her and transfers the money for the repair.  The affected car owner can only choose the most suitable option for the distance to the car service and the timing of repairs.  If the distance to the nearest service station is very large or there is no possibility to repair this car model in this region, the insurance company will make a decision on monetary compensation under OSAGO.  The car owner will receive money in the event of the complete destruction of the car. </p><p>  As you can see, extended insurance for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance solves a lot of problems and completely removes from the culprit of the accident the obligation to compensate for damage in a <span>road accident.</span>  DSAGO will be especially relevant for novice drivers who are offered insurance by OSAGO with additional coverage immediately after buying a car. </p>
