The choice very often falls on the island of <span>Cyprus.</span>  <span>Reviews of</span> tourists are simply beckoning there, promising all the joys of a full beach season.  Let's try to figure out a little in which city is best to buy permits. </p>

If you can’t live without cars, people, big houses, that is, you are an urbanist, then your place is Limassol.  This city is located in the south of the island of Aphrodite.  With a population of 161 thousand people, it is the second largest.  After the famous historical events of 1974 related to the occupation of part of Cyprus by the Turks, when they invaded Kyrenia and Famagusta, this settlement became the largest port and an important commercial and tourist center of the island.

    <p>  If your choice fell on Cyprus - Limassol - reviews of tourists will dispel the last doubts.  Firstly, there is an ideal climate for high-quality sea vacations, since the island is protected from most of the weather by the Troodos Mountains.  What is noteworthy, at the foot of the mountains are large vineyard plantations, known throughout the world.  Indeed, back in the days of Richard, the Lionheart, which landed on the island with its crusaders, this area was very well known for the production <span>of sugarcane</span> and wine.  Currently, Limassol is the largest winemaking center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

These are luxury villas and apartments, hotels, taverns, nightclubs and pubs, which are mainly located in the eastern part of the city.  In the summer there is no crowding.  The beaches on the coast of Limassol are very good, sandy, have everything you need for sunbathing, swimming and sports on the water.  Clean, sparsely populated and cozy beaches include Lady's Mile, Pissouri Bay and Kourion Beach, located on the outskirts.

    <p>  In shopping centers you can buy goods for every taste and budget: from handmade products to trendy things.  Near the embankment there is a street  Endus, numerous tourists take delightful walks along it, combining holidays with visiting a large number of different shops located at every step. </p><p>  Holidaymakers arriving in Cyprus, reviews of tourists are of great help in terms of identifying attractions that make sense to see.  There is an opportunity to visit a distillery in order to observe the process of wine production and taste the product.  Not far from the Old Port is a castle in which Richard the Lionheart in 1191 married Berengaria of Navarre, who later received the English royal throne.  The <span>Museum of the Middle Ages</span> is also located here <span>,</span> where you can see a lot of interesting things, including tombstones and various pottery.  In the city itself, it is proposed to visit the Archaeological Museum, where all the exhibits found in this area for all the foreseeable time are stored;  in the municipal art gallery, which presents paintings by Cypriot creators;  at the museum of folk art. </p>

    <p>  Everyone has a rest in this city - both the partying youth, and respectable gentlemen.  Hotels are available for every taste; the city itself and the tourist area are located very close by.  It is convenient to carry out excursion programs to different parts of the island from here. </p><p>  It turns out that it is very useful to learn about Cyprus reviews of tourists.  April 2013 turned out to be rainy and cool there.  And if earlier by the end of this month some vacationers managed to sunbathe as a daughter, then in the indicated year nobody managed to do it. </p>
