    <h2>  Why is this needed? </h2><p>  First of all, I want to say that luminous shoelaces have been a trend for several seasons, and with such a fashion accessory you can always be in the spotlight without any problems.  However, in addition to this, such laces have a number of positive aspects.  Manufactured in any way, they are inherently waterproof, as well as durable and very strong.  Well, and as a bonus: they always attract the attention of others, and especially people of the opposite sex. </p><h2>  What do you need to cook? </h2><p>  So, to get the desired effect of the glow of the shoelaces, you need to prepare a little and stock up: </p><ol><li>  LEDs of the desired colors - 4 pieces. </li><li>  Silicone tube with a diameter under the cord and a length of about 2 meters. </li><li>  Liquid silicone to fill. </li><li>  Flat batteries - 4 pieces. </li><li>  Soldering iron for work. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="luminous shoelaces from improvised means" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/429839.jpg" width="200"></div></h2><h2>  Option 1. We make a lace using a tube and silicone </h2><p>  So, figuring out <span>how to make luminous shoelaces</span> at home, you must first prepare the <span>shoelaces</span> themselves.  This is pretty easy to do.  The pre-purchased <span>silicone tube</span> must be divided exactly in half so that you get two pieces of one meter.  When this is done, the tubes themselves must be carefully filled completely with liquid silicone.  Now the LEDs come into operation, which you need to put the bulbs in the edges into the silicone, leaving the wires outside and fixing the structure with a soldering iron (the diodes will give a glow effect, spreading the light along the entire length of the silicone cord).  At this stage, you also need to attach the batteries to the structure so that the glow is fed by something.  There are two different ways to do this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Method 1. The battery can be soldered between the wires.  If there is no soldering iron, you can simply fill it with glue so that the two wires touch it.  For the convenience of its placement and finer work it is better to use tweezers. </li><li>  Method 2. More economical in nature, because here you only need to make a small switch that can stop the power supply of the LED from the battery at the right time, the longer it will remain operational. </li></ul><h2>  Option 2. Paint </h2><p>  There is an easier way to make luminous shoelaces at home.  In addition, low cost in materials, money and time.  To do this, you need to purchase simple laces and <span>luminous paint,</span> which is sold in ordinary stores.  It can be called differently: luminescent, fluorescent, phosphorescent, photoluminescent.  There is a special nuance: such shoelaces are short-lived, and the paint will be washed off after two or three washings, and you will need to repeat the painting procedure again.  But in support of this method to create luminous shoelaces at home, I want to say that such products are no different from ordinary ones, and they can be tied as you wish. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="luminous shoelaces at home" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/429841.jpg" width="440"></div></h2><h2>  Option 3. Neon </h2><p>  It is worth saying that this is a very unusual way.  Understanding how to make luminous shoelaces at home, you need to stock up: </p><ol><li>  Neon wire (2 meters). </li><li>  Batteries (approximately 2-4 pieces). </li><li>  Inverter (preferably with flicker control). </li></ol><p>  First you need to work with the previously purchased cord.  To do this, it must be cut in half so that it turns out two identical segments 1 meter long.  Next, each piece must be attached to the inverter.  That's all the wisdom, in essence, the luminous shoelaces from improvised tools are ready!  If the inverter has a flickering effect, the product will look even cooler, blinking from time to time. </p>
