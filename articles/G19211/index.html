The phenomenon of the metropolis: this originally Russian town, which became the ancestor of the towns and villages around, is based on the territories of the Tyumen Khanate.  Today, there is not a drop left of the Great Horde Chingi-Tour on these open spaces, however, Russian culture is presented here in a wealth of attractions that open the curtain of local history and culture. </p><p>  In addition to a significant inheritance, Tyumen is also one of the cleanest Russian cities.  For this reason, a walk in the metropolis will be doubly enjoyable.  Photos with a description of the city of Tyumen and attractions can be found below.  Fascinating zones are regularly supplemented because Tyumen is rapidly developing its infrastructure.  The qualitative symbiosis of antiquity and urbanism forms a separate atmosphere in this town. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  In order to gain a deeper understanding of the culture of the city of Tyumen than it is famous for and how old it is, you need to familiarize yourself with the history.  The city was founded by two governors, Vasily and Ivan, in the 16th century on the site of an ancient settlement, the so-called capital of the Siberian Khanate.  It was located near the village of Tatars Chingi-Tura.  In the 16th century, this Khanate was called the "Great Tyumen."  The city was a kind of springboard for the beginning of the development of Siberia. </p><p>  In the first third of the 17th century, nomads constantly attacked the Tyumen Khanate, this fact was reflected in the Tale of Tyumen.  In 1634, about 2 thousand people lived in Tyumen.  In 1695, the city burned down, it was after this that stone buildings began to be built in it.  Until now, several buildings of the Trinity Monastery, which were built in those distant times, have been preserved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.1612975" data-lng="65.52501719999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/3/9/9/4399.png"></div><p>  By the 18th century, the city had become a large transit center through which trade routes from China and practically all of Siberia flowed.  Even then, the city was famous for the production of wooden products and furniture.  In 1763, the population grew strongly, about six and a half thousand inhabitants lived in the city, about 300 of them were artisans.  In the 18th century, Tyumen became known due to its artisans who were engaged in leather dressing.  Products from it were in great demand at the <span>Irbit Fair</span> and abroad. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, the city became the center of manufacturing.  The economic importance of this center is growing by leaps and bounds, in 1885 a railway was built.  In 1868, N. Davydovskaya founded a beer factory.  Already at the end of the 19th century shipbuilding in the city was at the highest level.  Various types of industry developed, especially forestry.  In 1912, a railway was built to Omsk. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the number of inhabitants exceeded 30-odd thousand.  Already then there were 117 factories in the city.  In 30, the first university was opened in the city.  Buses appeared, finally, the first school was built, the training period in which was 10 years.  The city produced huge steamers, all kinds of machine tools, wooden furniture, shoes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the war, about 20 enterprises that were evacuated worked in Tyumen.  From here, armored boats, motorcycles and many other military equipment were delivered to the front.  In 1944 they formed the Tyumen region.  In the 1970s, they began to develop forests and build numerous railways.  They also began to actively explore hard-to-reach places, aviators helped surveyors to get to places untouched by man.  They began to develop new waterways, of which there are very, very many on the numerous rivers of Siberia.  City enterprises began to work for the oil and gas complex.  Already in 1970, the first trolley began to ride through the streets, and the first university was opened. </p><p>  Nowadays, Tyumen is a huge city in which industry, science and sports are developed at a high level.  In 2015, a jubilee 700,000th <span>resident of Tyumen</span> was born <span>.</span>  <span>The population of the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãis rather big.  Over the past few years, the city has undergone significant changes.  New neighborhoods, bridges, roads, and various sights were built. </p><p>  To answer the question briefly, what is famous for Tyumen and what sights in the city are most popular among tourists, will not work. </p><h2>  Church of All Saints </h2><p>  The Church of All Saints was built in 1779 in the city of Tyumen, originally the building was wooden and over time it became very dilapidated.  In 1833, at the request of the local abbot, the construction of the church began again, but only in stone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of All Saints" class="if uuid-2543535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92269/2543535.jpg"></div><p>  The Church of All Saints did not repeat the fate of all the churches in Soviet times that were closed or rebuilt.  Even at that difficult Soviet time, church services were constantly held, in spite of all the calamities.  Today, the Church of All Saints belongs to the existing monument of history and culture of the Russian Federation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tyumen State Circus </h2><p>  The State Circus is another place where the city of Tyumen became famous.  It originates from the performances of street gymnasts in 1839.  Later, replacing the tents, a room with heating was opened.  In 1903, a new building, a summer one, was erected with money from E. Strakai.  Then the circus belonged to V.T. Sobolevsky, bearing his name, later Kostousov. </p><p>  After the revolution and nationalization, the circus was assigned to the art department.  In the mid-20s, the building was demolished, rebuilt only in 1932.  Here on the street  May Day, the circus was until 2001.  The construction of the new building, designed by Igor Litovka, lasted from 2002 to 2004.  Its area is exactly 5425 m <sup>2</sup> , the diameter of the arena is 13 meters, and the capacity is 1600 people.  In the circus there is an elephant and a stable. </p><h2>  Tsvetnoy Boulevard </h2><p>  This is another place that Tyumen is famous for.  Souvenirs are the main thing that tourists need.  And here you can buy them in unlimited quantities. </p><p>  This pedestrian boulevard appeared in 2004. It was designed by Yekaterinburg architects.  The walking area was opened on the site of the amusement park, and the stadium.  Even earlier (in the 19th century), there was the Trading Square.  An entrance arch was erected at the base of the boulevard.  Tsvetnoy Boulevard covers 5 areas: Arts, Fountain, Lovers, Circus and Sports.  Each of them has its own distinctive feature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.elentur.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="color boulevard" class="if uuid-2543542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92269/2543542.jpg"></div><p>  Some people who ask what Tyumen food is famous for and do not know how diverse the cuisine can be tasted in this city.  Here are concentrated entertainment facilities, shopping centers, restaurants and cafe bars.  On Tsvetnoy Boulevard, the Tyumen Circus and the large Central Sports Complex are located.  Near the circus are natural-size bronze statues of famous clowns - Yuri Nikulin, Oleg Popov and Pencil. </p><h2>  Theatre of Drama </h2><p>  What the city of Tyumen is famous for is its theater.  It is the largest in Russia.  The theater is quite young, since the new building was built only ten years ago.  The facade of the building is decorated with large columns, which gives it a more majestic look.  The Drama Theater can accommodate more than 700 people.  But the uniqueness of this building is not in this.  The theater was built in a very short time.  In less than two years, a grandiose building has grown, which will not disregard any tourist in the Urals.  The drama theater has hosted and is hosting famous folk artists of Russia and other countries, showing the people more and more performances. </p><h2>  Tyumen Regional Scientific Library named after D.M. Mendeleev </h2><p>  One of the largest and most information libraries in Russia.  Its development does not stand still.  Every year more and more new information methods are introduced.  Now the reader can learn more not only through books, but on the Internet and other media.  The institution is a member of the Association of Russian Libraries.  Has a lot of rare and modern works.  The administration monitors the exterior of the building well, so the library was reconstructed.  At present, its main mission is to present the reader with a maximum of information in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world. </p><h2>  Temple in honor of the Miraculous Image of the Savior </h2><p>  Spassky Church in Tyumen is an architectural monument of the first quarter of the 17th century.  Initially, it was wooden, but after frequent fires it was rebuilt from stone.  The first floor of the church, the so-called "Tikhvin", in honor of the homonymous icon of the Mother of God.  The second - with the Throne of the Savior of the Miraculous, consecrated in honor of the Miraculous Image of Christ the Savior.  The entire temple complex was created in the style of the Siberian Baroque.  In the Soviet years (1929), the temple was closed and used as a hostel, and since 1959 the regional book fund was located in its walls.  Now the Spasskaya Church is under state protection as a monument to church construction.  A new period began at the beginning of this century with the resumption of church life, the creation of a Sunday school.  Religious processions are currently resumed. </p><h2>  Park named after Yu. A. Gagarin </h2><p>  Forest Park named after  Yu. A. Gagarin is located on the left bank of the river.  Tour, in the north of the Lenin administrative district.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe forest park exceeds 100 hectares; there are historical monuments of the Iron and Bronze Ages discovered during excavations in the early 20th century.  The park has numerous paths suitable for cycling, three-kilometer and five-kilometer ski slopes.  Since the place is a natural monument of regional importance, a large number of rare shrubs, herbs, mushrooms and trees grow in it, rare species of animals are found. </p><h2>  Museum-Estate Kolokolnikov </h2><p>  The estate was the only one built in the classical style.  It has a rich history: from the stay of Czarevich Alexander himself into it, to the transformation of the estate into headquarters.  The building itself has been over 200 years old, but it has preserved the ancient elements of the interior.  The exterior of the museum was preserved until the 90s, but when the estate acquired emergency status, it was finally reconstructed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="old.museum-72.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="museum manor" class="if uuid-2543549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92269/2543549.jpg"></div><p>  In our time, most of the rare creations have been preserved, including a collection of tea accessories and an art gallery of the Kolokolnikov family. </p><h2>  Art Museum </h2><p>  Behind the Urals in the Tyumen region in 1957 the Museum of Fine Arts was opened.  To date, it is considered the best in integrity of the collected collections of portraits of Russian painting of the 18th - early 20th centuries, paintings by contemporaries, Soviet sculptors and artists, as well as including painted canvases by Western European artists of the 15th and 19th centuries.

They noted such a feature as the chronology of the exhibited paintings, which allows us to trace the history of Russian painting.  With a large assortment of items, time periods do not have white spots. </p><h2>  Museum "Masharov House" </h2><p>  The museum is fully decorated in the style of the 19th century.  It has a rich history, which was not completely favorable for the home, and it could not survive until our time.  After the death of the owner, in whose honor the house museum was named, he was turned into a children's hospital.  Having existed for a short time, it was again reconstructed, transforming back into the Masharov family home.  The whole museum carries the spirit of that era.  An interesting fact is that when you visit the museum in one of the rooms there is always a black and white film, the plot of which tells the story of the family and the house of Masharov.  In it, each room carries the comfort and smell of a legendary time. </p><h2>  "Lovers Bridge" </h2><p>  The object acquired such a name when a competition for the most unusual kiss was invented at its opening.  Since then, it began to be called the bridge of the Lovers.  Every evening, it turns on a beautiful and bright backlight, and it becomes a center of dates and walks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bridge of lovers" class="if uuid-2543554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92269/2543554.jpg"></div><p>  The Lovers' Bridge connects the two banks of the Tura River, where one can see old buildings that have just appeared in the city, and new houses on the other.  There is a whole tradition for the bride and groom, which consists of a wedding walk on the bridge, where you must hang up the castle of love, and throw the key into the river.  On Valentine's Day, on the water under the bridge, rose petals create a huge heart, as a symbol of endless love. </p><h2>  Tyumen Puppet Theater </h2><p>  It was officially founded on May 1, 1946, informally - six months earlier, on December 22, 1945.  The theater has been operating without interruptions for over 70 years.  It has large and small halls, a spacious lobby, a buffet with adequate prices.  The capacity of the theater exceeds 600 seats, there are morning, afternoon and evening sessions.  The average ticket price ranges from 200 to 600 rubles.  The creative team consists of both energetic young actors who introduce the trends of the 21st century, as well as experienced honored artists of the Russian Federation, laureates of all-Russian, local and international nominations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kukli.kto72.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Puppet Theatre" class="if uuid-2543555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92269/2543555.jpg"></div><h2>  Znamensky Cathedral of Tyumen </h2><p>  This cathedral is the oldest temple in the city of Tyumen.  Metropolitan of the Tobolsk Metropolitanate His Eminence Demetrius is the rector of this beautiful cathedral.  Its history begins around the middle of the 17th century (the exact date is unknown), but construction was carried out for more than 150 years and initially, it was a wooden church in honor of the icon of the Mother of God ‚ÄúSign‚Äù. </p><p>  At the end of the 18th century, a stone was built on the site of a burned church.  In the refectory on the right side was a warm chapel, consecrated in the name of John Chrysostom for winter services.  In the summer, services were held in the main building - Znamensky.  The icon of the Last Judgment was placed in the recess of the round window and was visible to all worshipers, then the ‚ÄúSign‚Äù icon took this place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="proehal.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Znamensky Cathedral" class="if uuid-2543556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92269/2543556.jpg"></div><p>  In the middle of the 19th century (in December 1850), the Znamenskaya Church, with the funds of the Tyumen merchant I.V. Ikonnikov, was reconstructed (in two chapels) and insulated.  The nearby territory was decorated with a garden surrounded by a church fence. Currently, church life has been resumed in the parish, the tradition of Religious Processions has been revived, a Sunday school is operating at the church, where everyone can study the Law of God. </p>
