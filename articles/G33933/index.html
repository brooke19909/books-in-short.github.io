It all started with the Galaxy Note.  It was this generation that popularized phablets.  In addition, Note has become the best-selling line in the segment of these devices.  In general, only 5 percent of the market is allocated to phablets.  So far, this share is very insignificant, but the development trend is still observed. </p>

    <p>  One such device is the <span>iPhone 6</span> Plus.  The characteristics of this device will be considered in this article.  The creation of the phablet is unambiguously explained by some ‚Äúretardation‚Äù of Apple in the matter of screen sizes.  Now there is a real race between smartphone manufacturers.  They are trying to create a device that will have a huge diagonal screen, high-quality color reproduction, but at the same time the dimensions of the device will be reduced to the minimum necessary values. </p><p>  Apple has been involved in this race over the past 5 years, but is definitely passive.  It‚Äôs worth at least to recall that their devices had a diagonal of 3.5 inches.  Well, the iPhone 5 is 4 inches, but the experienced eye can clearly see that the screen is the same 3.5-inch, just elongated in height. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The flagships produced over the past 2 years, almost all had a screen whose diagonal was close to 5 inches.  And this means that in this regard, Apple is clearly losing to its competitors.  Users of the company's devices have repeatedly stated in polls that they need large diagonals.  Almost a third of the respondents were even ready to overpay a significant amount for the new model. </p><p>  Some users buy the iPhone because of its image to show that they have the means to use top-end, branded products.  They usually do not pay attention to what technical characteristics the device has.  They may decide to purchase the new iPhone 6 Plus.  The characteristic will not interest them again, they will buy the device only because of the brand and the conversations that go about it.  Although the more likely option with an ordinary iPhone 6. </p><p>  And here is another category - people who value in Apple products speed and efficiency, rather than showiness.  Rational reasons may be different for such users.  Someone talks about design and ease of use, others about performance.  However, the fact remains: the iPhone 6 Plus, the characteristics of which will be given below, will be released to the general public and will be in sufficient demand in the smartphone market. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The appearance of the sixth model, in principle, is identical to the iPhone 5. The design is quite attractive.  The device looks very organic.  But some users immediately note that the device looks as if they took the 5th model and just stretched it. </p><p>  Yes, maybe there is something in this sprain.  But even so, the design still does not lose its attractiveness, and the case is made of technologically advanced materials.  The screen is covered with <span>tempered glass.</span>  It, in turn, closer to the edges as if it begins to slip.  The developers took such an interesting move to hide the black front panel.  That is, it seems to the user that the screen has no frames. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  If we talk about the material from which the body is made, then this is aluminum.  Color schemes suggest 3 options: dark gray, silver and gold.  The back panel contains plastic inserts.  Their purpose is to ensure the operation of antennas. </p><p>  What are the design flaws of the iPhone 7 Plus?  The characteristic indicates that the hardware case can be bent if you have sufficiently strong fingers.  The same result can be obtained if the phone is carried in your pocket, if there are massive objects there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Fans of even species are indignant at the fact that the camera protrudes above the plane of the rear panel.  However, this cannot be called a significant drawback, although there is still something in it.  The camera, by the way, has an LED flash.  If necessary, users can use it as a flashlight. </p><h2>  A look on the edge </h2>

    <p>  The left side contains a switch that allows you to change the sound modes.  It is worth noting that the lever is firmly fixed enough, it does not hang.  On the right side is the power button, that is, turning the device on and off.  It was moved from the top, and due to this, the iPhone 6 Plus is identical to the Galaxy S in terms of the elements used to control the device.  This was done so that reaching the power button of such a large device is much more difficult than reaching the button located on the <span>side panel.</span> </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The dimensions of the phone in all three planes are as follows: the length is 158.1 mm, the width is 77.8 mm, and the thickness is 7.1 mm.  In this case, the weight of the smartphone is estimated at 172 grams.  Well, the device is clearly not small.  We can say that with its dimensions the <span>Apple iPhone</span> 6 Plus, the design characteristics of which were described earlier, is similar to similar devices with a screen diagonal of 6 inches. </p><p>  Neither the width nor the thickness of the smartphone plays a special role.  It is hardly possible to work with the device with one hand anyway, it is designed to work with two hands. </p><p>  The company understood that working with two hands at once would be more inconvenient for users.  That is why double tapa technology was developed.  None of the company's devices had this technology before.  With double tapas, the screen decreases.  Thus, it will be possible to select the desired application.  Icons located in the menu can be flipped horizontally. </p><p>  However, scrolling the contents of the screen, as well as scaling it, is impossible. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  Earlier, we examined all the charms and design flaws of the iPhone 6 Plus.  Specifications will be given later, but now we will try to understand the display of the smartphone. </p><p>  The iPhone 6 version has a screen diagonal of 4.7 inches.  But the phablet in this respect clearly succeeded: its diagonal is 5.5 inches.  As you know, the features of Apple are to optimize applications for the screen geometry of a particular model.  In the 6th version, there were no problems with this, but I had to work on the iPhone 6 Plus.  Technical specifications forced developers to make certain compromises to ensure maximum optimization. </p><p>  In the 5th model, as you know, the aspect ratio was 16: 9.  And the last model with a 3: 2 ratio was precisely the 4S model.  Application optimization was carried out for the 5th model, but with the release of the phablet, all of it, in fact, depreciated and lost its meaning.  Fonts displayed on the screen during the old optimization were uneven.  The developers had to work hard, and they probably did not regret that they stopped precisely at that screen size.  Otherwise, the volume of work would increase further.  Perhaps it would be necessary to optimize absolutely all programs. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Lithium-polymer batteries have many devices today, including the iPhone 6 Plus.  The phone‚Äôs characteristics regarding battery life are as follows: it can withstand up to 12 hours of use on the Internet (from the cellular network), up to 1 day of talk, 16 days of standby time, and up to 12 hours of use on the Internet (from the wireless network).  You can play music continuously for 80 hours, watch videos - for 14 hours. </p><p>  <span>The battery capacity</span> is 2915 mAh.  You can charge the device a little more than 3 hours.  The above data are the maximum indicators that were declared by the manufacturer.  In fact, the time of use may vary depending on the load of third-party applications, on the brightness of the screen and other parameters.  But still, the characteristics of the energy efficiency of the phablet are at a high level. </p><h2>  iPhone 6 Plus: specs, performance review, memory </h2>

    <p>  The size of RAM is 1 GB.  In devices based on the Android operating system identical to this model, the amount of RAM reaches 3 GB.  At first glance, the difference is huge, but do not forget about the really cool optimization conducted by Apple.  They make the iron work on the same level as Android devices, while there may be less RAM.  In addition, the operating time of the device as a result of optimization increases. </p><p>  The built-in memory for most models is just over 16 GB.  9 of them are assigned to the system.  However, users who lack this size of internal memory can purchase the iPhone 6 Plus 128GB.  The characteristics of the phone will remain the same, only the amount of memory will increase. </p><p>  Two cores operating at a frequency of 1.4 GHz allow for stable and smooth operation of the operating system.  But with games the situation is a little worse. </p><h2>  iPhone 6 Plus: specifications, price </h2>
