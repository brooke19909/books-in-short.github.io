To date, Starbucks covers a huge number of countries, including Russia.  All over the world there are more than 20 thousand coffee houses with special charm for each individual country.  In every country in the world, in every city, Starbucks is fond of delicious coffee and a warm, homely atmosphere.  Unfortunately, in Novosibirsk just now, the famous chain of coffee houses was able to please the inhabitants with their favorite drink of millions.  <span>Of course, this</span> has become one of the main events for the townspeople.  And what are the reasons for such a long inhibition of the opening of <span>Starbucks coffee shops,</span> you will learn in this article. </p><h2>  Is there a Starbucks in Novosibirsk and where? </h2><p>  In 2014, no one could have predicted Starbucks' appearance in Novosibirsk until the owner of the Monex Trading franchise published a vacancy of an operations manager in coffee shops, which have become a new direction in the city.  The candidate was required to have experience managing at least four points of the network of any institution, and the duties were to ‚Äúguide the activities of the coffee shop network‚Äù, as well as ‚Äúorganize the opening of new retail facilities‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  According to analysts, Starbucks in Novosibirsk could pay for itself due to the fact that the city does not have enough coffee houses per 1000 people, and networks such as Traveler's Coffee, Coffee Grinder, and Cup of Coffee occupy a significant niche in this industry.  However, the franchise company decided to create the first Starbucks coffee shops in Novosibirsk, as the brand will be able to become a significant competitor for them with the opening of "about 30 coffee shops in the city." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the news of the appearance of coffee houses was faced with a big problem.  An official representative from Starbucks on March 2015 denied the rumor that Starbucks would be opened in Novosibirsk.  And this disappointed many coffee fans. </p>

    <h2>  Where is Starbucks located in Novosibirsk? </h2><p>  In 2016, company representatives again encouraged fans of the "green siren" with the appearance of at least 5 coffee houses, but these plans did not succeed.  The worldwide fame of the brand, as well as even the high price of a cup of coffee, could not affect the possible success of the network in the city, in addition to this, a fake Starbucks Instagram account called starbucks_novosibirsk managed to promise a coupon for 700 rubles under a message dated February 10, 2016 to its first, and for subscribers it was enough to take a screenshot and mark the profile in their publication.  Subsequently, the account was deleted, and news about the opening of institutions began to disappear from the search engines. </p>

    <h2>  Opening to be or not? </h2><p>  Starbucks Coffee, as a popular coffee house, could get along with absolutely any competitors, but this was not destined to come true.  And the company has officially refused to introduce Starbucks coffee shops in Novosibirsk at the moment.  Contrary to popular opinion of experts and the positive forecast of rival Starbucks, the owner of local coffee shops Traveler's Coffee, the brand could quite easily coexist with its colleagues, without feeling any discomfort.  Moreover, according to experts, Starbucks coffee houses could receive at least 10% of the market in Novosibirsk, which was a large share based on the size of the city, as well as the existence of other players in the market, such as McDonalds, KFC, Burger King.  But the attempts of some of them were unsuccessful in entering the city market. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Common opinion about coffee houses </h2><p>  So is there a Starbucks <span>coffee shop</span> in <span>Novosibirsk</span> ?  Search engines provide various information on this subject.  If 2GIS shows that in Novosibirsk it is present only in distant plans, then Yandex will issue a referral to a third-party Starbucks Coffee company, which lists more than 7 Starbucks addresses in Novosibirsk.  Checking each of them, you can find out that not one coffee shop exists.  In addition, checking the list of establishments located in the SanCity shopping center, which was supposed to be the pioneer of the Starbucks world for Novosibirsk, you can find out that Starbucks coffee shops are not there at all, but there is their direct competitor - Traveler's Coffee. </p>

    <h2>  Causes of Starbucks Problems in Novosibirsk </h2><p>  When wondering why the company didn‚Äôt enter the city‚Äôs market, it‚Äôs worth turning to the whole history, since in 2014 it was clear that for Starbucks the market would be quite unpromising, even despite various emblems, cups, coffee, sandwiches, confectionery, souvenirs, coffee makers, mugs and glasses, which over the past 5 years can no longer be surprised due to the fact that the format for getting coffee with you has become quite similar to other cafes that can be found in Moscow, where Starbucks nonetheless occupies significant position on the consumer  market.  And its traffic in various shopping centers, as well as streets with high pedestrian traffic is extremely high. </p><p>  It is worth noting that Novosibirsk is a city with a well-developed culture of coffee consumption, and therefore the company's success could have been staggering, however, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating coffee houses in the city was abandoned in the near future for vague reasons, which Starbucks Coffee designated as ‚Äúthe priority of a gradual strategy development with a thorough study of the possibility of the appearance of Starbucks in various cities of the Russian Federation, infrastructure features, including in Novosibirsk. ‚Äù </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="are there starbucks in Novosibirsk and where" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64080/2082006.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  ‚ÄúPersonnel crisis‚Äù as a development problem </h2><p>  Finally, with regard to administrative management, it could also lead to a refusal to open coffee houses, due to the fact that a suitable candidate could not be found due to requirements for the candidate, including knowledge of the language, as well as direct work experience, which in the end could lead to the absence of a suitable administrative unit and the subsequent removal of the vacancy from the HeadHunter website (both due to the removal of the vacancy as unnecessary, and in connection with finding the necessary specialist).  Starbucks Coffee did not comment on the data on the vacancy of the manager, however, it gave a rather vague comment on the further possible appearance of the network in the city of Novosibirsk.  Monex Trading declined to comment, demanding a written request, leaving the question of Starbucks Coffee's future in Novosibirsk open to the present. </p><p>  The main feature of Starbucks coffee houses is the speed of service, the quality of food, as well as the communication features of the staff, which does everything necessary for satisfied visitors to recommend the coffee house as a good place to relax, as well as an institution where you can get first-class coffee. </p>
