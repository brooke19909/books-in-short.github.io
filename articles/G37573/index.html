    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  This modern hotel, opened last year, is located in close proximity to Bang Tao Beach, which stretches for 15 kilometers in a city called Chong Thale.  A good place.  Not only because of the beach, but also because the Phuket Airport can be reached in 20 minutes.  By the way, Patong is also quite close - only 15 kilometers away. </p><p>  But I would like to talk about the beach a little more.  Bang Tao is located in the bay, which means that there are almost always no waves.  The beach itself is the realm of the purest golden sand.  And the sea is clear and shallow.  There are no noisy entertainment on the beach.  So this is an ideal place for lovers of a quiet and relaxing holiday. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About Services </h2><p>  As already mentioned at the very beginning, Cassia Phuket 4 * is a luxury hotel.  So here everything is created for a carefree holiday for guests.  There is free Wi-Fi, private parking, a 24-hour reception, a tour desk, a concierge and a luggage room where guests can leave their luggage and things. </p><p>  Some people come here with children.  For the youngest guests, the hotel has a separate playground and a mini club.  So they won‚Äôt be bored. </p><p>  The hotel has such standard services as dry cleaning, laundry, ironing and car rental.  Also here, guests can be arranged to deliver groceries directly to their rooms.  There is a mini market on site, so guests can even stay within its limits if you need to make purchases.  They also organize transfers if guests do not want to rent a car. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the hotel provides facilities for people with disabilities, family apartments and non-smoking rooms. </p><p>  And the last point to mention when talking about the service is the staff.  In Cassia Phuket 4 * hotel professionals work.  But the most important thing is that they speak seven different languages.  Among them are German, Greek, English, French, Thai, Chinese and, importantly, Russian. </p>

Usually these are fresh pastries, cereals, milk, all kinds of jams and juices.  It is very convenient, because you do not need to wake up later than usual to worry that breakfast is accidentally skipped. </p><p>  By the way, alcohol lovers should know that they don‚Äôt sell it here from midnight until morning.

    <h2>  Larger rooms </h2><p>  When compiling a review regarding the Cassia Phuket 4 * hotel <span>(Thailand, Phuket)</span> , one cannot but mention the apartments, which can accommodate more than two people.  Their area is 62 square meters.  m. The apartments have two bedrooms.  One of them has a king bed for two.  In the other, one is standard.  And in the living room there is a sofa bed.  So all adults will be accommodated in comfort.  By the way, these suites also have two bathrooms. </p><p>  Other conditions and amenities are exactly the same as the previously mentioned rooms.  For four adults, a week of living in this suite will cost about 93 thousand rubles, which is pretty cheap - only 23 thousand rubles.  per person per week.  But this is if guests ordered a suite with garden views.  There are a lot of such options in Cassia Phuket 4 * (Thailand, Phuket).  Laguna will cost more.  For the view of the ocean will have to overpay 10 thousand rubles. </p><p>  By the way, there is another suite with two bedrooms in the loft.  It allows four adults to live in it, and even one child is allowed.  For this option (also with a view of the lagoon) you will have to pay about 115 thousand rubles. </p><p>  And another option is a two-bedroom attic suite with garden views.  It will cost 105 thousand rubles.  in Week. </p><h2>  What is worth knowing? </h2><p>  Speaking about Cassia Phuket 4 * (Phuket, Bang Tao Beach), one can not fail to note several important nuances regarding accommodation and booking. </p><p>  So, check-in here begins at three in the afternoon.  And this is worth considering when buying airline tickets.  Early check-in is possible, but only if the apartments ordered by the guests have already been freed from previous guests and prepared by the maids for check-in.  And this happens only out of season, and then not always.  Therefore, it is better not to take risks if you do not want to wait.  And departure starts at 10:00 and lasts until noon. </p><p>  In Cassia Phuket 4 * (Thailand, Phuket) you can live with children of any age.  But extra beds are not available - you should know about it.  In principle, there are plenty of sleeping places in the apartments. </p><p>  And further.  When applying for a reservation, you must leave your personal credit card details.  The hotel accepts JCB, Master Card and Visa.  Cash can also be paid, but already upon arrival. </p>

    <h2>  Vacationers </h2><p>  People who have already been to Cassia Phuket 4 * (Thailand), in detail tell about their vacation spent here.  Most of the reviews are positive, and this is not surprising.  The hotel is new, everything is working properly, and you can‚Äôt even comment on how high-quality furniture with sanitary ware is.  Yes, and everything looks stylish.  Looking at the above photos, you can verify this yourself. </p><p>  Special attention is paid to the position of the hotel.  Silence and calm - this is how you can briefly describe the place in which it is located.  In the immediate vicinity there is no noise, dirt, eateries and cheap cafes actively visited by dubious persons.  All this is removed from the hotel, so that nothing will interfere with the quiet relaxation of the guests of Cassia Phuket 4 *. </p><p>  Phuket Bang-Tao is a paradise of silence in Thailand.  Therefore, if you want entertainment, guests are advised to rent a car.  This is a very convenient solution, as there are many interesting places in Phuket, and it is better to get acquainted with Thai sights by riding in personal transport.  Otherwise, you can skip a lot, as guides and tour guides do not lead tourists to the most outlandish corners. </p>

    <h2>  Staff </h2><p>  A few words should be said about the service at the Cassia Phuket 4 * hotel.  The reviews left by guests about the hotel make it possible to understand how good the staff is here. </p><p>  In short, everything works like a Swiss watch in a hotel.  And the employees are also affected.  Even the water bus driver, who takes guests to the sea every day, always arrives on time.  The apartments are cleaned every two days, but if you ask the reception to tidy up the room, they will not refuse.  Change of linen and towels is also upon request. </p><p>  The pool is also always clean and tidy - it's such a pleasure to swim.  Towels, as mentioned earlier, are clean and fresh.  And in the mini-club designed for children, there are babysitters who will follow the kids while their parents rest and relax. </p><p>  And of course, the hotel has Russian-speaking workers, who can always be contacted for help or advice. </p><h2>  Interesting information </h2><p>  A lot of reviews have already been left about the Cassia Phuket 4 * hotel (Thailand, Phuket Bang-Tao), despite the fact that this complex opened only a year ago.  But, since Thailand is popular, many have already visited here. </p><p>  Absolutely all guests from Russia pay attention to the fact that dumplings and kefir are sold in a store located in the hotel.  Naturally, they are bought and prepared in the rooms.  Since many miss "Russian" food. </p><p>  And one more thing: it‚Äôs really better to rent a car, because the cost of a taxi is fixed - 700 baht.  This is about 1330 rubles.  Therefore, rented personal transport is a more profitable and justified solution. </p><p>  If you need to buy something, you can go to the supermarket called Villa Market, which has absolutely everything.  But the prices are not low - approximately like in Moscow.  Also nearby is a fruit market and numerous restaurants.  If you do not want to cook anything yourself, you can go there. </p>
