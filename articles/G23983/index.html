  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top Dandy Games. Dendy game console</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the twentieth century, many significant events took place that turned humanity's view of the future: space exploration, the development of the theory of relativity, and, of course, the creation of the Dendy game console, which won the hearts of millions of people around the world.  If you still have the first video game console in the world, you are really lucky, because you can return to the past by going to help Mario and Luigi again to save the princess or by uncovering the villains plot by controlling Chip and Dale. </p><p>  We present to your attention the top 10 games for ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù for two, which every gamer who grew up in the 90s should play.  All places in the top are rather arbitrary and reflect the subjective opinion of the author.  If you do not agree with one or another position - this is quite normal.  The very fact that the game was in this top, suggests that you have a real masterpiece of the gaming industry. </p><h2>  Rank 10: Double Dragon II: The Revenge </h2><p>  During the release of the first part of Double Dragon on NES, developers overlooked one very important detail - they did not give the game the possibility of cooperative passing.  That is why in our top is only the second part of this game, which was called "Revenge".  Although the prequel in itself is quite interesting and deserves the attention of gamers, if only because it tells about the story with which the exciting adventure of the dragon brothers began.  However, today this will not be about that. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Double Dragon game for Dandy." class="if uuid-3164103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3164103.jpg"></div><p>  In the second part of the game, gamers will have to fight for one of two Japanese brothers named Lee - Jimmy or Billy.  The twins continue to avenge the Japanese mafia for the death of a girl with whom the elder dragon was in love.  In the second part, the mechanics of the game received a significant improvement: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  added new types of strokes; </li><li>  difficulty increased markedly; </li><li>  new types of enemies appeared. </li></ul><p>  Now, between the levels of the players, the battle with the final boss awaits, which will be difficult to kill even together.  The plot inserts that await us after each victory over the leader of the group and at the end of the game also deserve special attention.  Be sure, ‚ÄúDouble Dragon‚Äù is one of those games that gave birth to such a game direction as street fighting games. </p><h2>  Rank 9: Battletoads </h2><p>  Battle Toads is the first game that comes to mind when you are asked to advise a game for NES.  One of the most advanced products that made a splash after the release in 1991.  Seeing the graphics in this game, you are unlikely to believe that the product is ported to an old eight-bit Dandy.  A huge number of shadows, high-quality rendering of all characters, excellent special effects - all this makes us recommend this masterpiece to every player who decided to plunge into the past. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hdqwalls.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frog on a motorcycle." class="if uuid-3164105" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3164105.jpg"></div><p>  As for the gameplay, it is very unique and captures after the first minutes of passing (not for nothing that this game is among the top games on the "Dandy").  Gamers have to play for a battle toad named Rush and his loyal friend Pimple, who are just crazy about high-speed motorcycle races.  In the story, you have to save Princess Angelica from the clutches of a malicious villain who kidnapped and holds her captive - it is very commonplace, however, this creation was loved by the players not at all for the original story. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main advantage of "Battle Toads" is their high complexity and diverse levels that do not bother to pass even after several times the full passage.  Of course, in some places the game can be almost impassable, but the cooperative mode, which is implemented here almost perfectly, saves the situation.  Therefore, if you are aiming to find a game for "Dandy" for two, to play with a friend or soulmate, then you should definitely consider the option of passing Battletoads. </p><h2>  Rank # 8: Contra Force </h2><p>  Great shooter, which is a continuation of the acclaimed game Contra, released in 1988.  This game is ideal for those who fan of action movies with Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role, because in the story gamers will have to fight for no less cool guys who are fighting the Red Falcon terrorist organization.  Muscular guys in leotards, big guns, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãexplosions and blood - in a word, all the cinema stamps of the 80s in one place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallpapers-house.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The game &quot;Contra&quot; for &quot;Dandy.&quot;" class="if uuid-3164107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3164107.jpg"></div><p>  A few words about the visual component of the game - it is perfect.  No really.  Implementing such a rich paint, shadows, special effects and detailed characterization for an eight-bit set-top box is a work that deserves unambiguous praise.  You will find a huge variety of different locations to explore: the jungle, desert, city, forest and even a secret underground shelter.  All textures are drawn with maximum quality, and their diversity allows you to immerse yourself in the passage of the game for several tens of hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Despite the fact that Contra Force was released back in 1992, the gameplay of this masterpiece is striking in its diversity to this day.  Players will have to fight with a variety of enemies, against each of which will have to use certain tactics based on the enemy‚Äôs weaknesses.  The developers were also not too lazy to add a huge amount of all kinds of weapons, which come across as they progress.  In addition, at the end of each level you will find a difficult battle with the boss, which will be easiest to kill in a cooperative mode with a friend. </p><h2>  Rank # 7: Bomberman 2 </h2><p>  Well, and what top games for ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù can do without the legendary ‚ÄúBomberman‚Äù, which is released on many platforms to this day.  Sometimes it seems that the developers themselves did not assume that such a passion could arise around a simple pixel world.  It‚Äôs all about the atmosphere that this masterpiece conveys.  If you've never played Bombermen 2 on Dandy, then you missed a lot.  Perhaps it's time to catch up right now? </p><div class="photo" data-original="cafebazaar.ir" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Bomberman 2&quot; for NES." class="if uuid-3164109" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3164109.jpg"></div><p>  According to the plot of the game, the main character, nicknamed Bomberman, was framed, so gamers will have to restore the good name of the guy, passing passing levels of varying difficulty.  The gameplay of the game is quite simple - you need to put bombs in a complex maze, teeming with various enemies, but at the same time - do not die.  Therefore, gamers will have to show not only reaction speed, but also ingenuity, as well as strategic thinking, which will allow you to place the subversive device in the most optimal place. </p><p>  In the second part of the legendary game, a cooperative appeared, which greatly simplified the task of combating annoying monsters.  However, do not flatter yourself!  The number of enemies depends on whether you play alone or with a friend.  Sapper business - it‚Äôs not for you to shoot from a machine gun, as in ‚ÄúContra,‚Äù so you have to put bombs in such a way as not to block the path of retreat to your comrade and not to fall into the clutches of monsters. </p><h2>  Rank # 6: Castlevania II: Simon's Quest </h2><p>  ‚ÄúCastellation 2: Salvation of Simon‚Äù is a continuation of the sensational game Castlevania, which was loved by fans for a huge number of interesting innovations that could not be found anywhere else.  In the story, the players will again fight with Dracula, who imposed a terrible curse on the main character.  One of the features of this product is that the game has four endings at once, depending on the time that the gamer had to spend to complete. </p><div class="photo" data-original="castlevania-ii-revamped.br.networkice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castlevania II: Simon‚Äôs Quest." class="if uuid-3164110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3164110.jpg"></div><p>  Also, one cannot fail to mention the fact that ‚ÄúCastellation 2‚Äù was one of the first games in which a real currency system appeared - the hearts of defeated enemies, for which you can increase the character's level.  Especially the cost of hearts increases when you pass the game with a friend.  On the one hand, together it should be much easier to complete all the missions, and on the other, all the experience gained will have to be divided into two, which complicates the battle with inter-level bosses. </p><h2>  Place No. 5: Megaman </h2><p>  One of the most popular titles from Capcom, which allows players to control a valiant robot with superpowers.  The game is characterized by amazing graphics and special gameplay features, for example, by increasing the level and choosing a new ability after each victory over the boss.  Such power will not only help you cope with enemies much faster, but also color the gameplay with bright colors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pixelstalk.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Poster with &quot;Megamen&quot;." class="if uuid-3164113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3164113.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to start getting acquainted with this series, it is best to play in the first part.  However, if your task is to have a good time playing with friends, we strongly recommend playing Megaman 6. This part of the game has undergone significant changes and left fans with a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive emotions.  Therefore, if you want to have a pleasant evening with a friend, then be sure to play this masterpiece of the gaming industry. </p><h2>  Location # 4: Adventure Island </h2><p>  "Island of Adventure" - this is one of those games that will seem equally interesting to both a young player and an experienced gamer.  The first part of this product was not particularly original, but the second and subsequent ones were liked by the players for a huge variety of locations and new gameplay capabilities.  We advise our readers to definitely play Adventure Island 4 - it was she who sunk into the hearts of millions of gamers around the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nintendolife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Poster for the game &quot;Island of Adventure.&quot;" class="if uuid-3164119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3164119.jpg"></div><p>  The meaning of the game is quite simple.  We have to manage a pink-cheeked fat man who is trying to save his girlfriend and simultaneously struggling with bad guys in the very different ways that the developers offer us.  For example, in the fourth part, it became possible to drive around dinosaurs, and huge fruits began to be used not only to restore health but also as a long-range weapon. </p><p>  The graphic component of this game deserves special attention - it is simply magnificent.  Sometimes it seems that the developers for hours drew levels and characters to surprise the players.  Thanks to the high-quality and juicy picture, the game acquires a special atmosphere that can be compared with the warmth from the hearth.  So feel free to grab the joystick in your hands and embark on an unforgettable adventure! </p><h2>  Place 3: The Last Mission </h2><p>  Three leaders opens one of the darkest games for the ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù - Final Mission.  Here you have to defend your home planet from an alien invasion, destroying hordes of enemies using a variety of weapons (human and alien).  As the main character, you can choose one of three cyborgs, each of which has its own unique abilities.  Of course, the game provides for a cooperative mode that allows you to get unforgettable sensations from saving your native Earth. </p><p>  Perhaps one of the features of "Last Mission" is that you do not expect a rainbow ending, as in most other games.  Even if you destroy all the monsters without losing a single health point, the aliens still will not leave the green planet alone, but at least you will be able to enjoy revenge for the comrades who fell in battle.  This game does not tolerate errors and somewhat resembles an eight-bit copy of Dark Souls.  Perhaps it was because of its dark atmosphere and unusual plot that gamers loved it so much. </p><p>  Also, one cannot fail to note the huge number of secrets hidden at different levels of the game.  Even if you pass this masterpiece several times, it‚Äôs far from the fact that all secrets will be solved.  Moreover, each secret found provides a huge advantage for the player, so you will want to return to Final Mission again and again to see for yourself the secret that a friend or acquaintance told you about. </p><h2>  Rank # 2: Tiny Toon Adventures </h2><p>  A very naive at first glance, but rather complex arcade platformer that has attracted the attention of millions of fans around the world.  Most of all, ‚ÄúThe Adventures of Tina and Tuna‚Äù is captured by the unique abilities of the main characters - the rabbit brothers, who go in search of the missing sweetheart Babs Bunny around the vast world.  During the trip, players will visit dozens of different locations, each of which is completely unique and unlike the rest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The game &quot;Tin and Tong&quot;." class="if uuid-3164124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3164124.jpg"></div><p>  A few words about the schedule.  Tiny Toon Adventures is one of the first games that has stepped up a level higher in terms of the graphic component.  Perfectly drawn shadows, realistic vegetation, vibrant background, gorgeous drawing of characters and enemies - all this allows you to fully enjoy this masterpiece for both experienced and novice gamers. </p><p>  Also in the game there are a huge number of secrets from the developers, which are designed to encourage the most diligent and attentive gamers.  For example, if you manage to collect all the carrots at levels 11, 33, 55, 77 and 99, then your rabbit will fall on the flying saucer of alien invaders, which is a bonus level, at the end of which you will receive a significant reward.  At that time, not many knew about this location at all, and even less knew about what triggers the launch of the bonus level. </p><h2>  Rank # 1: Super Mario Bros </h2><p>  What do most people imagine when they hear about the top games on Dandy?  Of course, Super Mario is a game in which millions of gamers around the world hang for hours as a child.  A true classic of the gaming industry, which does not age even more than 30 years after the release.  This masterpiece is able to break even an adult man into a stingy tear of nostalgia, and products with the symbols of the game are bought up by fans around the world to this day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ricedigital.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mario and Luigi." class="if uuid-3164130" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3164130.jpg"></div><p>  The plot of the game tells us about the story of two brothers, plumbers, who are trying to save the princess from the clutches of a villain, while walking around the mushroom kingdom.  Gamers expect dozens of different locations, each of which is saturated with a special atmosphere and unique enemies (turtles, beetles, carnivorous flowers), which can be quite difficult to deal with. </p><p>  Of course, the game, released back in 1985, can not boast of beautiful graphics and complex gameplay, but ‚ÄúSuper Mario‚Äù was not liked by everyone because of this.  It's all about the emotions that you experience with a friend, passing the next level of this masterpiece.  Even if you have never played NES before, Super Mario Bros is definitely the game with which you should start familiarizing yourself with this gaming platform.  In the end, it‚Äôs not in vain that she enters the top 10 best games on the ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù. </p><h2>  Video and conclusion </h2><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="QlWRr2KLrSU" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlWRr2KLrSU" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/6/0/5/3/16053.jpg"></div><p>  We hope our article helped you decide which game for NES should be passed the next evening.  If this information was not enough for you, then we recommend watching a short video, the author of which compiled his top games on ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù, which you can play for two.  We wish you a pleasant viewing and an exciting game! </p>
