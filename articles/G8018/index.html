It is called so because the loser does not have a single card, that is, he, like a drunkard in life, drank his entire fortune and was left with nothing.

    <p>  Before playing "Drunkard" cards, you need to thoroughly mix the deck, shuffle.  Then they alternately distribute them into piles for each player.  They are located with the figure down, so that the player does not see their values.  All absolutely cards are dealt.  Then the first player who shuffled and handed out makes the first move.  To do this, he takes the top card from his pile and puts it in the center of the table. </p><p>  The other player does the same.  So, in the center of the table are two cards.  They have different meanings.  He takes those two cards to himself the one whose oldest in value.  In some versions of the game, the six are considered older than the ace.  Especially if the game is a card "Drunkard" for two or a deck of 36 cards.  The winner of the first move puts the win at the very bottom of his pile.  For the next move, the second top card is taken. </p><h2>  Controversial issues </h2><p>  It often happens that in the center of the table are two pictures of the same value, that is, two jacks or two dozen.  What to do in such cases?  In the game "Drunkard", in the cards, the rules are as follows: solves all the "dispute".  The player puts the next one from the pile on his first card, but no one knows what the card is, since it is face down.  The last third card is placed on top of these two, but already visible side. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The one whose upper third card will be older takes all six cards.  If the third cards come across the same, then everything continues in the same way.  The winner takes all 10 cards already and puts himself under the pile.  Sometimes it‚Äôs very disappointing when they argue on some small card, and under the mortgage is an ace or a king. </p><h2>  Four-player game rules </h2><p>  Knowing the rules of the game "Drunkard" on cards of 36 pieces, you can safely play cards containing 52 pieces in the deck.  The smallest in such a deck is a deuce.  The oldest is an ace.  You can also use an additional two cards with the image of a joker.  Then the oldest will, of course, be the jokers. </p><p>  Before playing "Drunkard" cards, you need to discuss the conditions of the game in your company.  Which card will be considered high and beat the ace.  You can leave the classic version of card games when the ace is considered the most important. </p>

    <p>  With a large number of players, the rules of the game remain the same, only a large deck of cards is taken.  The first move is assigned to the player who dealt and shuffled cards.  Then they go in turn, clockwise.  You can play with the player on the left and immediately pick up your winnings in the pile, or you can have all the players fold their cards to the center of the table, and the player who had the highest card will take the winnings.  The buy-in will then be immediately 4 cards. </p><h2>  Game features </h2><p>  The game "Drunkard" is very long and long.  Children and older people like to play it.

Therefore, many play it for money. </p><p>  But before you play ‚ÄúDrunkard‚Äù cards for money, think: ‚ÄúBut will I not be left with anything?‚Äù  Indeed, in this <span>game, cards</span> symbolize the money that the drunkard walked without a trace.
