    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Each tariff plan has its own specific description, often it attracts potential subscribers.  To be honest, the Beeline operator describes the Detsky tariff very briefly and clearly.  More precisely, the features of the plan simply stand out. </p><p>  This tariff provides the ability to send messages and make calls at zero balance.  Just what is so necessary to maintain communication between parents and the child.  But what is special about the tariff "First Child" ("Beeline")?  Is it really worth it to pay attention to?  Or can you find some analogue in your area? </p><h2>  Calls by region </h2><p>  The first thing that subscribers look at is the cost of calls within the city.  And here the tariff "First Child" is very popular with the Beeline operator.  Moscow and the region, for example, are territories in which, after connecting, you can receive free incoming calls, and the first minute of conversation will cost 3.75 kopecks.  The second and subsequent - 2 rubles.  With all this, this condition applies to both mobile and landline numbers.  The Favorite Numbers feature allows you to make calls on more favorable terms: the first minute is 1.88 rubles, the subsequent minutes are 1 ruble. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As you can see, the Beeline operator is really happy with the Detsky tariff.  You do not have to think that the child will spend a lot of money in conversation and will remain without communication.  But there are a few more points that are worthy of attention.  And now we will consider them.  You may still have to abandon the connection. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff is the first children's beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1105527.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Intercity </h2><p>  The Beeline operator, the Detsky tariff (Moscow and other regions), as noted by subscribers, offers rather favorable conditions for long-distance calls.  Perhaps for a child this is not so important.  But this moment still arouses great sympathy among subscribers. </p><p>  For Beeline numbers in cities outside your region, a minute of conversation will cost 7.5 rubles.  Not so much, when compared with similar offers, then mobile operators offer 10-15 rubles for such a conversation.  If you just call on intercity (not Beeline), then pay 14 rubles per minute, but that's not all.  Calls to Kyivstar in Ukraine will cost 12 rubles, and to other mobile operators 24 rubles per minute. </p><p>  From all that has been said, it can be concluded that the Detsky (Beeline) tariff is really beneficial, and not only for the child, but in general for any active person who is used to talking on a cell phone.  True, this is not all the features of the tariff plan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Around the world </h2><p>  Sometimes international communication is important.  Beeline (tariff "Children's") offers quite favorable conditions for making such calls.  And this, of course, pleases.  But what opportunities does the subscriber get when connected? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline tariff the first children's Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1105528.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Calls to Beeline to CIS countries will cost 12 rubles, but simply to mobile phones of other mobile operators is 2 times more expensive - 24 rubles each.  Europe, Canada and the United States will be in touch with you for only 35 rubles - a rather small amount, especially if you start comparing it with peers.  So, it's time to think about connecting.  North and Central America will require 40 rubles per minute talking on a cell phone, while other countries will cost you 55. </p><p>  If you think about it, the cost is not so great.  True, if you plan to make many calls to different countries, then it is better to find yourself another plan.  But in general, the Beeline tariff "Detsky" (Moscow and the Moscow region, as well as other regions of Russia) is really great for talking. </p><h2>  Messages </h2><p>  Do not forget that not only calls play an important role in tariff plans.  Messages are also often required.  As already mentioned, with a zero balance, you can send them.  But what is the expense on the tariff? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline tariff for children in Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1105529.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The first message per day will be very expensive - 9.95 rubles.  And this factor quite often repels buyers.  But the next 100 SMS will cost only 10 cents.  Just what a modern sociable child needs.  In fact, in this situation, the tariff "First Child" ("Beeline") is very profitable. </p><p>  If you have exhausted the limit, then 102 messages per day will cost 2 rubles.  Just like the following.  Thus, the overpayment will be only for 1 SMS per day.  All MMS costs 9 rubles 95 kopecks, and messages to international numbers - 3.95 rubles.  In principle, the conditions are favorable.  Only here, far from everyone likes the Beeline operator, the Detsky tariff. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  For example, due to unfavorable conditions for access to the mobile Internet.  Which child will not use it now?  Of course, you can‚Äôt do without it.  And here, ‚ÄúBeeline‚Äù showed itself not in the best light. </p><p>  Why?  The whole problem is that 1 megabyte of transferred data will cost the subscriber almost 10 rubles, or rather, 9 rubles 95 kopecks.  Honestly, a rather large amount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff children's beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1105530.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If you want to use mobile Internet at the Detsky tariff on more favorable terms, you will have to choose a special package with a monthly fee, its cost will average 150 rubles.  It turns out that the conditions are not so profitable already, so you have to think a few times before connecting. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The operator "Beeline" tariff "Detsky" (Moscow and the region) receives a variety of reviews.  And by them, many judge the benefits of connecting.  Practice shows that this ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù is far from always appreciated. </p><p>  Many subscribers often say that the first minutes of the conversation literally ‚Äúsuck‚Äù money from the balance, often it is simply not necessary to talk with the child for more than 1-2 minutes.  Children, in general, do not use intercity and international communications, but the Internet - all the time.  The costs of downloading data and downloading the necessary material are huge at the end of the month.  Sometimes you have to replenish your SIM card account weekly. </p><p>  All this, of course, negatively affects the popularity of the tariff plan.  And therefore, do not be surprised that at the moment it is not available to connect.  The Beeline operator has the Detsky tariff in the archive, which means that it has simply lost its relevance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline tariff for children Moscow and Moscow region" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1105531.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In principle, a similar result was to be expected.  It is important for parents that the tariff plan connected to the child is useful to both him and his family, that is, there are inexpensive calls (in the region, of course), as well as messages.  And most importantly, affordable Internet.  After all, giving a lot of money just for the fact that the child uses the World Wide Web from a mobile phone is stupid.  Thus, you should not be surprised that you can‚Äôt switch to the "Children's" tariff from "Beeline".  Only those subscribers who purchased it before entering into the archive of tariff plans can use it. </p>
