As you see, this happened a long time ago.  It is located between the stations "Savelovskaya" and "Tsvetnoy Boulevard" on the Serpukhov-Timiryazevskaya line. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This is a deep-bed station, notable for its beautiful columns, which, like the traveling walls, are faced with snow-white marble.  As for the subway platform, black and gray granite were laid on it.  To decorate the walls, insets were added on which you can see drawings depicting all kinds of chemicals, atoms and molecules.  Lamps are very similar to crystal lattices.  That's how unusual and interesting the Mendeleevskaya metro station is.  But the most important detail that attracts everyone's attention is a monument to homeless dogs located here.  Looking at him, many recall the difficult fate of stray dogs and decide to help them.  People who are poorly oriented in the capital, but who want to get to the station, need to see where the Mendeleevskaya metro station is located on the metro map.  Now, not everyone will risk going to an unfamiliar area, hoping only for themselves.  If you have a card, then you should use it.  Looking at it, you can immediately understand everything: where to get out of transport, and how to get to the right place.  For many people who can navigate the map well, just a quick glance is enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro mendeleevskaya" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/443393.jpg" width="600"></div>

There is the only underground lobby, the escalator of which takes people to the platform and in the opposite direction.  There is access to Novoslobodskaya street. </p><h2>  Transitions, operating mode </h2><p>  The main hall of the station is equipped with marching flights of stairs, which serve as transitions between points.  From the "Mendeleev", which is located on the Serpukhov-Timiryazevskaya line, you can go to the "Novoslobodskaya" located on the Ring branch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro Mendeleevskaya on the metro map" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/442942.jpg" width="400"></div>  The lobby and station are open from 5:35 to 1:00.  This mode is quite suitable for most passengers.  Mendeleevskaya metro station rarely becomes the object of their complaints.  And really, everything is pretty decent and convenient here, nothing causes discontent.  The design is just at the height - everything is so beautiful and original, besides it reminds of the great science - chemistry.  Nothing like this can be seen at any other Moscow metro stop.  Of course, they are all interesting in their own way, but Mendeleevskaya stands apart, standing out for its unusualness and thoughtfulness.  However, many people who are often here no longer pay attention to the surrounding beauty.  For them, this is commonplace.
