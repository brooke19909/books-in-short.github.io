Which Canon camera is better</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Answering the question of which Canon camera is better is not so simple.  This is especially true for hybrid modifications, since among all the world's leading manufacturers, this Japanese manufacturer began to conquer the corresponding segment last.  Along with this, this approach allowed the company to evaluate the existing offers on the market, while identifying their main advantages and disadvantages in order to further make their cameras better compared to competitors.  As a result, in 2012, the Canon EOS M camera was presented to the general public. Expert reviews indicate that so far it remains one of the most successful mirrorless models from this manufacturer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon EOS M" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/554283.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Design and ergonomics </h2><p>  Its design is similar to the so-called ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù.  Most likely, this is due to the fact that the model became the first "swallow" of the company in this segment.  For the production of the case, a magnesium alloy is used, which is coated with high-strength plastic.  The camera is available in black, silver, white and red.  In general, the model can be called very ergonomic: it fits comfortably in the hands and has a small protrusion for convenient support in front. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  External parameters </h2><p>  The case has dimensions of 109 x 67 x 33 mm in width, height and thickness, respectively.  The weight of the Canon EOS M model without a lens, but with a battery installed, is 298 grams.  Such parameters give every reason to call the device a handheld camera, especially if you use an unstabilized lens.  If you apply any of its other type, the device will become more heavy and overall.  Slots and connectors are located mainly on the left end, while the right side is empty.  The touch screen is located on the back of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon EOS M reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/554287.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Basic controls </h2><p>  The location of the main controls of the device has become its upper part.  It should be noted that the buttons in their form are very similar to the keys of ordinary ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù.  According to many owners of the model, a significant drawback was the lack of a dedicated drive, which is designed to select a mode.  A rotary switch is used instead.  With it, the user can choose between video shooting, automatic and creative mode.  It is located around the shutter button.  As for the PASM mode, it is also provided, however, its activation is carried out through the menu on the Canon EOS M display. Reviews of many users indicate that this solution is not entirely practical and convenient.  In addition, there are buttons on the device for accessing the menu, viewing information, playing back, as well as a button for directly starting video recording. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon camera" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/554289.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Activation of all the basic functions of the camera occurs through the menu, very reminiscent of what is used in the modification of the EOS 650D.  In this regard, there are no particular complaints about the device.  It should be noted that the technology with simple external control works pretty well, thereby making this <span>Canon camera</span> understandable and easy to manage <span>.</span>  <span>Reviews,</span> both connoisseurs of high-quality images, and beginners, are further proof of this. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a three-inch touch screen with an aspect ratio of 3: 2.  In general, we can say that the display is made with high quality.  Excellent image clarity is ensured through the use of Clear View 2. Under direct sunlight, even at maximum <span>brightness, the monitor</span> fades significantly.  Along with this, there is a drawback in it, which has become one of the main ‚Äúdrawbacks‚Äù of the model.  It consists in the absence of an electronic built-in viewfinder.  Moreover, the possibility of installing it as an additional accessory is also not provided.  The screen is covered with oleophobic plain glass.  It should be noted that it does not protect the Canon EOS M display from stains, dust, fingerprints and stains. User reviews of the model, on the other hand, indicate that it is quite easy to wipe them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon EOS M Price" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/554288.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Technical equipment </h2><p>  The device uses <span>a CMOS</span> APS-C <span>matrix</span> with a cascade-phase hybrid focusing system.  With sufficient lighting, it provides the opportunity to receive photos with excellent color reproduction and a fairly low noise level in the format of 18 megapixels.  The photosensitive range is in the ISO range from 100 to 12,800 units.  The image processor is Digic-5, which is also responsible for serial shooting, which is carried out at a speed of 4.3 frames per second.  The buffer volume in this case is 17 images in JPEG resolution.  One cannot but focus on the fact that, compared with the previous version of the processor, the data processing speed has now almost doubled.  When using a memory card with a capacity of up to 32 gigabytes, any delays for the camera are not typical. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The battery capacity of this Canon camera is 875 mAh.  It takes a little more than two hours to fully charge it from a standard adapter.  This is quite a lot at this size.  In the case of operation of the device with the maximum brightness of the display, it is enough for about 250 frames.  If we compare this indicator with mirror modifications, then it can be called very modest.  Be that as it may, do not forget that the device is constantly in LiveView mode.  As for video shooting, the model is completely discharged with it after 45 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon EOS M" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/554286.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  In a few words about the Canon EOS M interface, we can say that it was created for beginner photographers.  The fact is that when you first familiarize yourself with the device, everything looks very primitive in it, but over time, the user realizes that there are a lot of different settings and modes.  After taking a picture, you can apply a number of filters to it, each of which has three levels of saturation.  Images when using them are automatically saved in a separate file.  You can use them in real time.  At the same time, one cannot fail to mention that the use of filters entails a decrease in the performance of the device. </p><h2>  Modes </h2><p>  The set of modes that the Canon EOS M modification has is quite simple.  In particular, it provides for creative, automatic and video shooting.  In the first case, you should configure the camera yourself.  In this case, the user can select traditional modes and scenes using the touch screen, including shutter speed and aperture priority.  It should be noted that the model also provides the possibility of remote control.  When automatic mode is activated, you can be sure that the Canon EOS M camera selects the optimal settings on its own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="camera canon reviews" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/554284.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  Movie Recording </h2><p>  The camera is capable of shooting video in 1080p format with a frequency of 14, 25 or 30 frames per second, or 720p at 50 or 60 frames.  Device control is completely manual.  Moreover, the user can independently adjust the level of stereo sound.  Separate words deserves the presence of an input for an external microphone.  As for the maximum duration of the movie, the data on this is not indicated even in the instructions.  Along with this, one should take into account the fact that having, for example, a memory card of 8 gigabytes, regardless of the HD mode, it will be possible to shoot a movie lasting no more than 22 minutes.  Be that as it may, the Canon EOS M camera has every chance of becoming a great addition to more professional home video equipment, because the quality of the material received is quite acceptable.  At the same time, the device itself can be called convenient and compact. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In general, the kit in which the model is supplied to domestic consumers is standard, as for any modern camera.  In particular, in the box you can find the charger, battery, lens cap, USB cable, belt for fastening and of course user instructions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which Canon camera is better" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/554290.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the Canon EOS M camera, whose price in our country now averages 525 US dollars, has become a rather controversial device.  If you compare it with modifications from the same value segment, you can find in it a number of significant shortcomings.  These include a very weak battery, the lack of a viewfinder and a wide arsenal of optics, as well as a fixed display.  All this suggests that the device is designed for fans.  If you take a closer look at the camera, you can also find many positive characteristics - a large matrix with a low noise level, the ability to quickly adjust the focus point with the shooting parameters, automatic adjustment of peripheral lighting and brightness, small dimensions, and the ability to use gloves. </p>
