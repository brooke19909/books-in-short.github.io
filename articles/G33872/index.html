    <h2>  Artificial wave </h2><p>  This is a fairly new phenomenon of sports tourism, which made it possible to surf without the need to fly to exotic islands and calculate the seasonality of waves.  Now you can do this type of water sports much cheaper and within your own place of residence.  Flowrider - the only <span>surfing simulator in Moscow</span> - is located in the institution "Aqua-Yuna".  The water park (the photo clearly shows the appearance of this building) invites beginners to try their hand at the new image of a surfer gliding along artificial waves, and professionals to maintain and develop their existing skills. </p><p>  The wave generated by the simulator reaches a width of 10 meters and a height of more than a meter.  Classes on it are not only exciting, but also useful - they allow you to tighten the muscles of the legs, buttocks, abs and oblique muscles of the abdomen.  In addition, regular training will help improve coordination.  If then you decide to go surfing, you can show amazing results. </p>
