Manufacturers may find this strange, but the vast majority of potential buyers like ordinary smartphones without any equivocation.  For an ordinary person, the main thing is reliability, design and the availability of the necessary technologies for stable communication.  But comfort also plays an important role.  So, users need smartphones of the budget segment.  Earlier than others, the Chinese company Meizu understood this.  She literally flooded the market with inexpensive, but powerful and high-quality smartphones.  One of them is the relatively fresh Meizu M5S M612H.  Its characteristics are such that it can easily bypass even mid-level gadgets from other manufacturers.  And what kind of company is this to Meise?  Where did she come from?  Let's get it right. </p><h2>  The story of the emergence and success of Meizu </h2><p>  Meizu company was founded in 2003.  And then it was called a limited liability company.  Like, in principle, now.  In 2003, the manufacturer was developing MP3 players.  But in this field, the company did not achieve any noticeable successes, since these gadgets began to rapidly lose popularity.  People began to be interested in universal devices such as smartphones.  And then the management of the company decided to re-profile production.  The first smartphone under the label Meise was released in 2008.  He worked on a mobile platform from the Windows family and painfully resembled the iPhone.  Because of this, the company had to stop producing this device.  But Meizu M5S 32GB and its characteristics never remind "iPhone".  And you will see this soon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  At first, the company tried its hand at the domestic market.  In China, they were successful.  The hardworking subjects of the Communist Party swept Meizu smartphones off the shelves because of their low price and excellent performance.  Since things went well in the Middle Kingdom, the company decided to enter the European market.  Which was performed in 2011.  In the same year, the company officially appeared in Russia.  At first, no one wanted to buy devices of an unknown brand.  But curiosity overpowered caution.  And after the implementation of the first installment, a real "boom" ensued.  Domestic lovers of mobile gadgets are literally obsessed with Maize.  Her devices seemed perfect to everyone.  Meizu M5S also seems to be around.  Characteristics and reviews complement each other and do not differ.  This is one of those rare cases when the manufacturer claims is completely consistent with the real state of things. </p><h2>  The design of the device.  Part 1 </h2><p>  Let's start with the appearance of the Meizu M5S.  The characteristics of the material used to make the case are only positive.  This is a lightweight 7000 series aluminum that has been sandblasted.  This alone distinguishes the device in the budget segment.  No well-known competitor can boast of the same body.  Except, perhaps, devices from Xiaomi.  The front panel is almost all occupied by a screen, which is covered by a protective glass with a 2.5D effect.  Under the screen is a mechanical key with a touch coating.  It performs the functions of "Home" and "Back".  And in the touch coating placed a fingerprint scanner.  And above the screen is a speaker, a front-facing photo module, and light and proximity sensors.  The configuration is, in principle, standard.  The only thing that stands out is the quality of execution.  All elements are fitted very tightly.  There is no liquor anywhere. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The design of the device.  Part 2 </h2><p>  Now consider the back panel of the gadget.  It is also made of metal, which is good, since fashionable glass panels are not practical.  In the upper part is the peephole of the main camera.  A little lower is a flash.  And even lower is the company logo.  That's all.  Truly a purely Spartan back panel.  In all color versions (except black), plastic inserts are visible at the antenna sites.  But in the black version they merge into a single gamut with the body.  So the choice of perfectionists is a black device.  Mechanical buttons are located on the right side edge, and the SIM card slot on the left.  At the bottom end we are greeted by a speaker and a connector for connecting a charger.  At the top there is a 3.5 "jack" jack for headphones.  This is the design of the Meizu M5S.  The hardware platform feature is the next section of our review. </p>

    <h2>  The performance of hardware.  Part 1 </h2><p>  How's the performance of the Meizu M612H M5S 16GB?  Its characteristics are able to please users?  Yes, it seems.  The device has an eight-core 64-bit processor from MTK with a maximum clock frequency of 1.3 gigahertz.  For a budget device, this is more than enough.  RAM is represented by a three-gigabyte module with energy-saving technology.  For the graphic part, the Mali T720 chip is responsible, which fully supports OpenGL and DirectX.  thanks to this, you can even run some games on your smartphone.  And they will work fine.  But very demanding toys are out of the question.  Nevertheless, such parameters allow the device to work quickly, clearly and smoothly.  Hangs and brakes during the operation of the smartphone were not noticed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  The performance of hardware.  Part 2 </h2><p>  The memory capacity of the internal drive is 32 gigabytes.  There are versions with 16 gigabytes of internal memory.  They are generally cheaper.  It is also possible to replace one of the SIM cards with a Micro SD flash drive up to 128 gigabytes.  And then there will be more memory.  Support for LTE networks is another feature of the Meizu M5S.  The characteristics of the communication module are such that it easily copes with the latest generation 4G networks (Cat.6).  In addition, the gadget is equipped with a Wi-Fi transmitter capable of operating at a frequency of 5 gigahertz, a high-speed Bluetooth adapter, a good battery and a mid-level camera.  The operating system uses Android 6.0 with the proprietary Flyme shell version 5 (or 6, as luck would have it). </p>

    <h2>  Display specifications </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the Meizu M5S 16GB screen.  Display characteristics are also inherent in middle-class devices, but not budget models.  Judge for yourself.  The smartphone has a 5.2-inch screen with a very high-quality IPS matrix.  Viewing angles - chic, color reproduction - realistic (for once).  The screen is equipped with a protective glass and a very high-quality <span>oleophobic coating,</span> which was not in previous models of Meizu.  Also available anti-reflective coating, which allows you to comfortably work with the device on a sunny day.  The screen resolution is 1280 by 720 pixels.  For a budget device this is a decent result.  It is unlikely where to find an entry-level gadget with an HD display.  Another distinctive feature of this display is the increased brightness, which also plays a positive role when using the device outdoors.  For most users, this is a very important aspect. </p>

    <h2>  Firmware and OS </h2><p>  The gadget has the Android OS 6.0.  The system works on such hardware as expected.  Everything almost flies.  A proprietary Flyme interface adds originality to the device.  In fact, Flyme is a mix from TouchWiz from Samsung and EMUI from Huawei.  But it still looks great.  And does not affect the performance of the smartphone.  If you come across a version with Chinese firmware, then it is better to change it to the global one as soon as possible, because in such "gray" devices there are a lot of software problems. </p>

    <h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  The characteristic of the <span>Meizu</span> M5S <span>smartphone</span> in terms of battery life is also pleasing.  The gadget has a 3000 mAh battery.  The battery type is lithium polymer.  Some people think that 3000 mAh is extremely small for a device with such technical characteristics.  But this is not so.  Here, the whole point is not in the amount of mAh, but in the degree of optimization of the hardware platform and operating system.  And in this, Meizu engineers achieved stunning successes.  The gadget is quite capable of living a couple of days in normal use.  But that is not all.  The smartphone implements proprietary mCharge fast charging technology.  It allows you to charge the device‚Äôs battery from 0 to 50 percent in half an hour.  Not a bad result. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  Now let's talk about the opinions of the owners of the Meizu M5S.  Phone features play a minor role here.  The main thing is how the gadget behaves in real conditions.  And all the users who purchased this device for themselves agree that the specifications from the manufacturer are no different from the real ones.  The owners note that the smartphone works quickly, clearly and smoothly, has a beautiful screen, a decent camera and excellent performance.  And all this for frankly ridiculous money.  Most of all, users liked the look of the smartphone.  Not a single manufacturer has produced a budget smartphone in a metal case and with 2.5D glass.  This is a completely different level.  And there is nothing unusual in the fact that this smartphone is selling at a frantic pace.  Most owners also say that the battery life is enough to use the gadget for two days.  This is at least.  If the device is rarely touched, then it will easily "live" for four days.  And this is another plus in karma to the Meise engineers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we reviewed the entry-level smartphone <span>Meizu M5S 16 GB.</span>  Characteristics of it to all users, judging by the reviews.  Everyone is happy with the gadget.  And there is nothing surprising here.  The device is beautiful, productive, has all the features of a modern phone and is characterized by increased battery life.  This is not just a mobile device, but the dream of any user.  And the money for this dream is asking for relatively small.  So why not get one. </p>
