    <h2>  <strong>Reviews</strong> </h2><p>  The hotel was built only a year ago, so the number of guests in it, respectively, is not very large.  Nevertheless, Grand Park Lara 4, reviews of which are mostly positive, is gradually gaining its army of permanent vacationers.  And although today the main contingent of tourists in it are visitors from Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands, the number of Russians is growing steadily.  And the correct policy of the hotel administration plays a significant role in this: it is a Russian-speaking specialist at the reception, and the presence of Russian-language television channels in the rooms, and Russian national dishes on the menu. </p><p>  Many of the vacationers are satisfied with the food offered at the hotel, although there are those who prefer to eat by prior reservation in order to taste more dishes from the local cuisine.  Separately, the presence of dietary and vegetarian dinners, and in general, a large selection of buffet meals, as well as a round-the-clock restaurant working under Building F. </p><p>  Many rave reviews left about the sea.  According to vacationers, it is incredibly warm, although somewhat unclear near the coast.  But it is worth sailing a few meters from the shore, as the water becomes clean and transparent.  The swimming area is thought out: it is fenced off with a net and buoys so that different animals, including jellyfish and fish, do not swim.  In the afternoon, it is better to occupy sun loungers closer to the sea, since sand from the sun heats very strongly, almost heats, and it becomes difficult to walk on it without shoes.  There are so many sunbeds on the beach that at any time you can settle down near the water.  And although water entertainments are a little expensive here, but this is understandable: there are only expensive five-star hotels around. </p><p>  The only drawback that all tourists note is the presence of a garbage dump in the territory of a neighboring hotel, which you had to go past, heading to the beach. </p><p>  About the staff, vacationers leave only laudatory reviews.  They can easily cope with a large number of clients, while always being polite, diligent and doing everything in time.  Many were impressed by their uniforms: white shirts with butterflies at the waiters, black collar-cuffs at the cooks against the background of black aprons and black bandanas covering the hair.  There are two administrators speaking Russian in the registry - a guy and a girl. </p><p>  Grand Park Lara 4 (Antalya, Turkey) is positioned as a hotel designed for family and business leisure. </p>
