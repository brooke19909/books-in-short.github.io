    <h2>  Evelyn Beach 4 *: hotel staff reviews and entertainment </h2><p>  Most of the guests speak about the hotel staff as smiling and friendly, always ready to help people.  Only the receptionists speak little Russian here.  However, with them it will be much easier to explain in English.  Also, hotel administrators always try after arrival as soon as possible to settle tourists in their rooms. </p><p>  Despite the fact that Evelyn Beach does not have its own pool, guests can use the pool of a neighboring hotel.  It will cost 3 euros for the whole day, including the rental of sun loungers and an umbrella.  A real expanse here will be for young people, since the resort has a lot of clubs, bars and discos. </p><h2>  Impressions of tourists about a beach holiday </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, from the Evelyn Beach 4 * hotel the beach is literally around the corner.  The sand on the nearest beach is dark, the entrance to the water is large pebbles.  It is advisable to have special shoes, especially for children, as <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãurchins</span> can be found at the bottom <span>.</span>  Sun beds and umbrellas on all beaches are paid.  If you want to soak up the white sand, you can take a little walk to the neighboring beaches.  So, many tourists recommend the beach "Star Beach".  According to them, it is quite large, well-groomed and has excellent infrastructure: pools, attractions, bars, a restaurant, a disco, etc. There is also free Wi-Fi. </p>
