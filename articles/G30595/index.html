However, more and more often it is possible to meet phenomena when completely different products come out under the same brand.  A similar situation occurred with the manufacturer of equipment Caterpillar.  The American brand is well known worldwide as a manufacturer of high-quality construction equipment.  Nevertheless, experts of the company can name a few more areas in the market in which Caterpillar products are presented.  In this case, we will talk about the phone CAT B25, which, although it has nothing to do with the developers of construction vehicles, demonstrates high rates of reliability and durability.  We can say that the device transferred its ‚Äúoff-road‚Äù character to the segment of high-tech gadgets, which allowed it to gain some popularity. </p><h2>  Model Overview </h2>

    <p>  The model was developed by the British company Bullitt Mobile, which acquired a license to use the Caterpillar brand.  At the first glance at the phone, it becomes clear why the manufacturer chose this brand to represent the device on the market.  The model should be associated with reliability, performance and durability.  In many ways, the <span>Caterpillar CAT</span> B25 meets these specifications.  Another thing is that according to other criteria for evaluating a modern mobile device, this product looks rather modest.  If we relate the model to a specific niche, it will be a class of conventional push-button devices that have low functionality, but serve a long and reliable time.  By the way, this phone has a close relative in the Russian market.  The devices from teXet and, in particular, the TM-510R model, look very similar to the Bullitt Mobile product, although the devices are in different lines and do not officially communicate with each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Device Specifications </h2>

    <p>  The technical data of the device should not be compared with the capabilities of other modern models.  The fact is that the CAT B25 mobile phone is seriously behind in key features - again, its main advantages are not in the hardware.  However, something the creators still tried to translate into their product. </p><ul><li>  Mass - 161 g. </li><li>  Dimensions - 125 in height, 55 in width and 22 in thickness. </li><li>  Screen - TFT, 2.0 ‚Äù. </li><li>  Display Resolution - 320x240. </li><li>  The degree of protection corresponds to the marking IP 67. </li><li>  The main memory is 78 MB. </li><li>  Camera - 2 MP module. </li><li>  The camera resolution is 1600x1200 pixels. </li><li>  Power - Li-Ion battery with a capacity of 1,300 mAh. </li><li>  Additional volume - it is possible to use a micro-SD card with a maximum of 8 GB. </li><li>  Additional options - music player, voice recorder, radio, flashlight, melody synthesizer. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the model is focused on practical operation, and in harsh conditions.  This is evidenced not only by the presence of a flashlight, a high degree of protection and a capacious battery.  The CAT B25 is shockproof, waterproof, and dustproof.  For those who use phones in extreme conditions, this will be a very worthy option for good money.  By the way, the price of the device is about 4 thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Case and design </h2>

    <p>  The case is made in a utilitarian style, which is characterized by a monolithic form and a sense of durable assembly.  Despite the seeming bulkiness, the device is quite light and fits well in the palm of your hand.  Most surfaces, especially functional sockets and connectors, are framed by grooves of protective rubberized plastic.  Thanks to this finish, the model received the status of one of the <span>most reliable phones.</span>  Even the <span>Caterpillar CAT B25</span> display has protection in the form of thick, resistant to mechanical damage glass.  In the lower area, as befits button models, there is a five-position joystick and keyboard.  Even lower you can find honeycombs with microphone holes.  It is worth noting the enhanced protection of the unit with the battery.  On the back area there is a strong rubberized plate with the company logo CAT, made of thin metal. </p><h2>  Interface </h2>

    <p>  Realizing that this unit will not compete in performance, the developers decided to bring its convenience and simplicity to the limit.  It is present not only in the ergonomics of physical handling of the phone, but also in the controls for its functions.  So, the user of CAT B25 gets at the disposal of a classic five-way joystick, which is enough for convenient menu control.  At the same time, all the necessary data is displayed on the screen, including the status of SIM cards, time and names of operators with battery indicators.  The menu contains 12 icons with sub-items.  In addition to standard icons, you can note the Internet and multimedia.  Still, in button utility models, these functions are not so common.  Also, the model uses a rare application for this class of phones in the form of a good ‚Äúreader‚Äù of electronic books. </p><h2>  Camera and entertainment </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a 2-megapixel camera and a whole range of different programs.  I must say right away that the developers responsibly approached the choice of applications, focusing not on quantity, but on practical benefits.  As for the camera, it will not surprise you with anything special.  The user receives a standard set of shooting settings, including white balance control and the inclusion of effects.  In terms of the quality of the received images, the <span>Caterpillar CAT B25</span> is a very mediocre device, so there is no particular hope in its camera. </p><h2>  Communication features </h2>

    <p>  Everything related to practical use in this phone is implemented at the proper level.  Of course, there is no question of comparing the functional with premium smartphones, but the creators nevertheless provided a certain base.  To begin with, it should be noted the possibility of using two "SIM cards" and broad support for GSM standards.  In addition, the device is equipped with Bluetooth, and Internet access is provided using EDGE or GPRS technology.  To communicate with the computer, the CAT B25 is equipped with a microUSB connector and a wired headset.  By the way, after the connection, the user will be offered synchronization in several formats.  In particular, you can select the data storage mode, use the device as a multimedia or storage device, as well as a web camera. </p><h2>  Phone Reviews </h2><p>  The model is expected to cause positive feedback about its design, the quality of the body and external ergonomics.  According to the owners, the device is convenient, practical and outwardly attractive.  He has a loud speaker, although the microphone, protected by a coating of a protective layer, distorts speech.  As for the other shortcomings, they mostly relate to the little things.  For example, users mark the small font CAT B25.  Battery reviews are pretty controversial.  The device keeps the active state longer than smartphones, however, compared with its competitors in the class, it loses significantly in this indicator. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The model as a whole makes a good impression.  In part, it is due to the original appearance.  Despite the outward brutality and rigor, the CAT B25 looks pretty pretty.  Pleasant sensations are reinforced by physical contact.  According to the owners, holding this unit in your hand is a pleasure.  Impressions change when you get acquainted with the internal filling, but not much.  There are no modern applications, a powerful operating system and a 5-pixel camera in this device.  But there is a convenient menu, many useful options and a basic set of tools for communication. </p>
