  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The policy of enlightened absolutism</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The declarative statements of Catherine II had a rather sharp difference from her real policy.  In the era of rule, of course, the empress took certain steps that were aimed at the "humanization and Europeanization" of life in Russia.  However, according to a number of historians, against the backdrop of increasing enslavement of peasants and within the framework of the noble dictatorship, all her aspirations looked ambiguous. </p><p>  Catherine the Second ascended the throne, having no actual rights to him.  The future empress was a foreigner.  Having managed to persuade the guards regiments to her side, Catherine was able to remove Peter the Third legally accepting power.  The empress understood very well that her accession was solely due to the actions of the guard, and each guardsman, feeling his personal merit, could demand a policy that was appropriate and protecting the interests of the nobility - representatives of this class constituted regiments. </p><p>  The empress‚Äôs activities went down in history as the ‚Äúpolicy of the <span>enlightened absolutism of Catherine 2,‚Äù</span> which was based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Enlightenment of France, which envisaged the reign of a ‚Äúwise man on the throne.‚Äù  This idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa union of philosophers and sovereigns was developed in different countries.  The role of the ‚Äúwise ruler‚Äù was played by Gustav the Third of Sweden, Frederick the Second of Prussia, Joseph the Second of Austria, Charles the Third of Spain.  In Russia, Catherine the Second became the "enlightened ruler". </p><p>  For the era was characterized by a certain ideology, which had special features.  The policy of <span>enlightened absolutism</span> implied the equality of people, the formation of a welfare society for all.  At the same time, fair laws should be the basis of reforms.  The policy of enlightened absolutism implied the existence of a social contract and the establishment of mutual obligations of citizens and the ruler.  Public administration was carried out with the recognition of freedom of expression, thought, and word.  Enlightenment, on the other hand, was one of the most important functions of the state, being at the same time a certain method of educating citizens. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the era of the reign of the Russian Empress, historians distinguish three directions.  The features of Russian absolutism, according to historians, were manifested mainly in the desire to form a more attractive image of the country and the empress herself outside the state.  Thus, one of the priorities of the ruler was to strengthen the authority of the power in the world and the desire to expand the territory of the Empire. </p><p>  The aim of the policy pursued by Catherine was also to calm the opinions of the country and the states of Western Europe regarding her illegal seizure of power.  In addition, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhumanity and justice of the deeds of the ruler was inspired in Russian society. </p><p>  Catherine II tried to liberalize the ways of public administration, taking into account the advanced ideas of that era.  Another area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity of the ruler was administrative reform, in which the nobility was involved in local government. </p><p>  The policy of <span>enlightened absolutism</span> at its first stage contributed to a clear definition of the balance of power.  At the same time, no major transformations happened.  The second stage of Catherine's rule was marked by some transformations.  The reforms were not as radical as anticipated, however, the western style of the country significantly strengthened and expanded. </p><p>  It should be noted that Catherine the Second did not have time to implement everything that she intended.  However, the empress left the state in better condition than she received it.  The policy of enlightened absolutism contributed to a significant increase in the population and an increase in government revenues.  In addition, a banking system was formed, production expanded. </p>
