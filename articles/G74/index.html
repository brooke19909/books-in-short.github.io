Once, in ancient times, this part of the present suburbs was occupied by the Vyatichi (East Slavic tribal union).  Traces of their stay were found on the territory of the city itself, and in a small distance from it there is a very old Teshilov fortress, which got its name from the nearby village of the same name.  The first mention of this place is found in the annals of 1147.  And in archival books (1578-1579), a record was found that ‚Äúbehind Ogafon Danilov‚Äôs son Pushchin ... half of the village of Pushchin, on <span>the Oka River.</span> There is a yard of landowners ...‚Äù It follows that the first owner of the estate was Daniil Pushchin . </p><h2>  Manor nature </h2><p>  Later (in the late XVIII - early XX centuries), the owner of these lands, a certain major Artsybashev, built a two-story house.  Skillfully using the unusual landscape, the architect was able to design a composition unreal in magnificence.  All the beauty of the river and its distant panorama opens before your eyes.  Subsequently, the estate changed many owners and underwent several restructures.  Before the revolution, it was a whole complex, including a church, a large park, cascading ponds and outbuildings.  Nowadays, only a house, a dilapidated horse yard and a glacier cellar are left of the beautiful estate.  This site is recognized as a natural monument with springs, a waterfall and many streams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof Pushcha, Moscow region" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/461837.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Procedures </h2><p>  The main treatment for pulmonary diseases is carried out using a special "salt room".  This is a peculiar ground model of a potash mine.  Its air has a beneficial effect on the bronchopulmonary system of a person and helps to recover from serious ailments.  The room was called "speleocamera", and the method itself - "halotherapy". </p><p>  A shock-type jet shower will help get rid of a number of diseases.  This is truly a great invention of the French psychiatrist Jean Martin Charcot, and it is named after him.  The principle of its operation is that water under high pressure is supplied to two atmospheres from a distance of 4-5 meters - in this way a point hydromassage of the human body is carried out.  This is a necessary and useful procedure that helps relieve stress, improve metabolism and awaken all processes in the body. </p><p>  Medical inhalations will help to clear the lungs of sputum and get rid of cough.  Everyone knows that this method allows you to most quickly, compared with other methods, penetrate the drug through the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract to the affected areas.  After inhalation, the effect of the drainage function of the bronchopulmonary system is enhanced several times, which contributes to a better discharge of sputum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="health resort zavodino Moscow region" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/461839.jpg" width="500"></div>  As a result, the cough disappears, the breathing process becomes much easier and freer.  Patient services also include therapeutic baths, various types of massage, phytobar, physiotherapy, acupuncture, hirudotherapy and others.  This medical institution also accepts patients who are not able to take care of themselves and need constant care.  All conditions have been created here so that people with disabilities and older people feel comfortable.  They are provided with a number of medical, social and psychological services, food and accommodation, and most importantly, sensitive staff care.  Landscaped territory, professional friendly staff, highly qualified doctors, comfortable living rooms, well-developed infrastructure - all this will make your stay in a boarding house comfortable and relaxing.
