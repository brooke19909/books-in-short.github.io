    <p>  The life of any person is unthinkable without knowledge.  Even people who do not have a formal education have to adapt to reality, acquire skills and shape reactions.  Of course, this does not exhaust the cognitive functions of the brain, but these skills are very important for adaptation to the environment and survival. </p><p>  In modern neurophysiology, it is believed that the cerebral cortex is mainly responsible for cognitive functions.  And the caveat here is because many <span>cognitive processes</span> do not occur without the participation of the emotional brain, the limbic system.  Here motivation is born, here reality is given a sensual coloring.  Without the operation of this system, a person would lose all impulses to action. </p><p>  Cognitive brain functions include memory, planning, speech, mathematical information processing mechanisms, and <span>spatial thinking.</span>  In order not to forget anything, let's start in order, from memory. </p><p>  Memorization is the translation of the information we encounter into a kind of ‚Äúcode‚Äù of the brain.  Moreover, not everything is remembered, but only significant, and here the <span>limbic system</span> enters into its rights <span>.</span>  Often emotionally colored events are remembered all my life, and the necessary information seems banal to the emotional brain - and is not remembered.  So emotions control us.  All areas of the brain are responsible for memory, depending on what kind of information we are trying to remember.  Moreover, much more information is stored in the memory than necessary - sometimes hypnotists sometimes ‚Äúpull it out‚Äù from memory.  A person who found it difficult to remember a drawing often still recognizes it among hundreds of similar ones.  So it‚Äôs a sin to complain about the memory - we simply don‚Äôt know how to work with it.  And if she suffers, other cognitive functions, such as planning, also suffer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Knows planning anterior lobe of the cortex.  Neurophysiologists are sure that this is where consciousness ‚Äúlives‚Äù.  And self-control.  Therefore, people with trauma to this part of the brain became rampant, impulsive individuals who could not fit into society.  Moreover, professional knowledge was not affected.  Intuition and premonition live in the right lobe, while the left lobes make a person an analyst.  Due to the work of the right lobe, we experience negative emotions, but the left lobe makes us happy.  Indeed, if a person starts to plan something, then the fears go away.  And without an analysis of the situation, they intensify.  So there is a switch between these zones. </p><p>  Every little child is a brilliant linguist.  He is able to create in his mind a model of his native language or even several languages ‚Äã‚Äãin the first three years.  Speaking of languages.  Sometimes pronounce the term "cognitive function of the language."  This concept is from linguistics, and it means that language becomes a code, a means for understanding the world by man.  Recent studies prove that not only the <span>left hemisphere,</span> but also the right one is needed to create and understand speech.  Otherwise, a person will not be able to understand the general meaning of a joke or story from the life of acquaintances.  He understands phrases separately, but he won‚Äôt guess what to laugh at. </p><p>  Cognitive functions include mathematical abilities.  Many consider themselves untalented in the <span>oral account</span> and give up, trusting calculators.  As a result, many adults cannot even roughly calculate the amount of purchases in the store or check the invoice issued in the restaurant.  Cunning traders in the markets take advantage of this.  However, not everything is so sad, you can return the lost cognitive functions if you can force yourself to exercise regularly.  It's like fitness - the more time is spent, the brighter the results, although each has its own norms. </p><p>  And finally, about spatial thinking.  Some people work perfectly with a compass and a map, instantly noting all the features of the area, even it seems they can draw accurate maps themselves.  And it‚Äôs hard for others to find the right street.  What if this cognitive function is not at the level?  Recall the school drawing course, come up with fancy objects, draw them from different angles, and then give it to a person who can draw maps. </p><p>  So, no matter what state your cognitive functions may be, the situation can be changed for the better with the help of labor. </p>
