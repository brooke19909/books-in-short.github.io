Balloon with basket</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The question of who invented the balloon will surely be of interest to every student.  After all, this aircraft was created back in the 18th century and has stood the test of time, since it is used in aeronautics today.  Technics and materials are changing and improving, but the principle of action has remained the same for centuries.  That is why an appeal to the personalities of those people who came up with this amazing new vehicle seems especially relevant. </p><h2>  short biography </h2><p>  The inventors <span>of the balloon</span> were the Montgolfier brothers.  They lived in the small French town of Annon.  Both from childhood were fond of science, crafts, technology.  Their father was an entrepreneur, he had his own paper mill.  After his death, the eldest of the brothers Joseph-Michel inherited it and subsequently used it for his invention. </p>

    <p>  He was fond of the scientific works of the prominent British natural scientist <span>Joseph Priestley,</span> who discovered oxygen.  This hobby led to the fact that he began to take part in all the experiments of his older brother. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Background </h2><p>  The story of who invented the <span>balloon</span> must begin with an explanation of the conditions that made such an amazing discovery possible.  By the second half of the 18th century, a number of important scientific discoveries had already been made, which allowed the brothers to put their own observations into practice.  We have already discussed the discovery of oxygen.  In 1766, another British researcher G. Cavendish discovered hydrogen - a substance that subsequently became actively used in aeronautics.  About ten years before the famous experiment with raising a balloon, the famous French scientist A.L. Lavoisier developed a theory about the role of oxygen in oxidation processes. </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  So, the story of who invented the balloon is closely connected with the scientific life of the second half of the 18th century.  In this case, it is important to note that such an invention was made possible thanks to the above discoveries.  The brothers were not only aware of the latest scientific discoveries, but also tried to put them into practice. </p><p>  It was this thought that prompted them to create the ball. </p>

    <p>  At their disposal were all the necessary materials for its manufacture: the paper mill left by him from his father provided them with paper and fabrics.  At first they made large bags, filled them with hot air and launched them into the sky.  The first few experiments pushed them to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a large ball.  At first they filled it with steam, however, when lifted, this substance quickly cooled down and settled on the walls of matter in the form of water precipitation.  Then it was decided to use hydrogen, which is known to be lighter than air. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  However, this light gas quickly evaporated and evaporated through the walls of matter.  Even covering the ball with paper through which the gas still quickly disappeared did not help.  In addition, hydrogen was a very expensive substance, and the brothers were able to get it with great difficulty.  It was necessary to look for another way to successfully complete the experiment. </p><h2>  Preliminary Samples </h2><p>  When describing the activities of those who invented the balloon, it is necessary to indicate the obstacles that the brothers had to face before their experiment was successfully completed.  After the first two unsuccessful attempts to lift the structure into the air, Joseph-Michel proposed using hot smoke rather than hydrogen. </p><p>  This option seemed successful to the brothers, since this substance was also lighter than air and, therefore, could raise the ball up.  New experience has been successful.  The rumor of this success quickly spread throughout the town, and residents began to ask the brothers to conduct a public experience. </p><h2>  Flight of 1783 </h2><p>  The brothers scheduled a test for June 5th.  Both carefully prepared for this momentous event.  They made a ball that weighed more than 200 kilograms.  He was without a basket - that indispensable attribute that we used to see in modern designs.  A special belt and several ropes were attached to him to hold him in the right position until he heated the air inside the shell.  The balloon of the Montgolfier brothers had a very impressive appearance and made a huge impression on the audience.  Its neck was placed over a bonfire that heated the air.  Eight assistants held him by the ropes below.  When the shell filled with hot air, the ball rose up. </p>

    <h2>  Second flight </h2><p>  A balloon with a basket was also invented by these people.  However, this was preceded by a huge resonance, which had the discovery of unknown researchers from a small French town.  Scientists from the Academy of Sciences are interested in this discovery.  King Louis XVI himself showed such interest in the flight of the ball that the brothers were summoned to Paris.  a new flight was scheduled for September 1783.  The brothers attached a willow basket to the ball and claimed that it would withstand passengers.  They wanted to fly on their own, but there was a sharp discussion in the newspapers about the great risk.  Therefore, for starters, it was decided to raise the animals in the basket.  On the appointed day, September 19, the ball in the presence of scientists, courtiers and the king went upstairs with the "passengers": a rooster, a ram and a duck.  After a short flight, the ball caught on tree branches and sank to the ground.  It turned out that the animals feel good, and then it was decided that a balloon with a basket can withstand a person.  After some time, the world's first air flight was carried out by Jacques-Etienne and the famous French scientist, physicist and chemist Pilatre de Rosier. </p><h2>  Ball Types </h2><p>  Depending on the type of gas with which the shell is filled, it is customary to distinguish three varieties of these flying devices.  Those that rise with the help of hot air are called hot air balloons - by the name of its creators.  This is one of the most convenient and safe ways of filling matter with gas, which is lighter than air and, accordingly, can lift the basket with people in it.  Different types of balloons allow travelers to choose the most convenient way to travel.  Of particular importance in this design is the balloon burner. </p><p>  Its purpose is to constantly heat the air.  In cases where it is necessary to lower the ball, it is necessary to open a special valve in the shell in order to cool the air.  Those balls, the inside of which are filled with hydrogen, are called Charlier - after the name of another prominent French chemist-inventor, a contemporary of the Balloons Jacques Charles. </p><h2>  Other types of apparatus </h2><p>  The merit of this researcher lies in the fact that he independently, without using the development of his distinguished compatriots, invented his own ball, filling it with hydrogen.  However, his first experiments were unsuccessful, since hydrogen, being an explosive substance, came into contact with air and exploded.  Hydrogen is an explosive substance, so its use when filling the shell of aircraft is associated with certain inconveniences. </p>

    <p>  Helium balloons are also referred to as sharlers.  The molecular weight of this substance is greater than that of hydrogen, it has a sufficient carrying capacity, it is harmless and safe.  The only drawback of this substance is its high cost, therefore it is used for manned vehicles.  Those balls, which are half filled with air and half with gases, are called roziers - after the name of another contemporary of the Montgolfier brothers - the mentioned Pilatre de Rosier.  He divided the shell of the ball into two parts, one of which he filled with hydrogen, the other with hot air.  He tried to fly on his device, but hydrogen ignited, and he died with his companion.  Nevertheless, the type of apparatus he invented received recognition.  Balloons with helium and air, or hydrogen are used in modern aeronautics. </p>
