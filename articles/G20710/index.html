Tourists reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Club Serena Hotel is a specialty of rural beachfront hotels.  It has a large territory, a very rich infrastructure, and its purpose is to surround dear guests with all kinds of pleasures and immerse them for a couple of weeks in an atmosphere of blissful doing nothing.  There is a park overlooking the sea, a variety of sports activities, places where you can eat and even eat densely, and so on.  In short, Club Serena Hotel 4 HV is a typical Turkish club hotel.  According to tourists, it even exceeds its class in the declared four stars. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Club Serena Hotel is located in Topialty, although some sources say that this is Kizilot resort.  The latter name rather refers to the area around, which has recently been built up by hotels.  Whatever the case, this place is located some twenty kilometers from the famous Manavgat.  We can say that the hotel occupies an important strategic position between Alanya and Antalya, and from a tourist point of view it belongs to the famous resort area called Side.  To get here, you need to fly to Antalya, and then follow the transfer or regular bus, and then a minibus-dolmush.  The airport is eighty-odd kilometers away, but Turkish public transport is so good that you won't even notice it.  In the village, just across the road from Club Serena Hotel 4 Kizilot, there is a good market near the mosque.  There you can buy strawberries and cherries if you are missing the variety of fruits offered at the hotel itself.  There are also good souvenirs at prices that are lower than in Antalya. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What is in the rooms </h2><p>  The decoration and "filling" of the rooms for guests at the Club Serena Hotel is pretty standard.  Of course, there is television, including with Russian channels.  The phone is working.  There is a refrigerator, which is very good for a beach resort.  The air conditioning of the split system cools the atmosphere.  The floor has a ceramic coating.  In the bathrooms, showers are equipped with new plumbing, hot water is constantly, without interruption, everywhere there is a hairdryer.  Toiletries are provided on a one-time basis upon arrival.  Depending on the floor, the room has a balcony or terrace.  If you come with a small child, they can put a special bed in the room, if you ask for it specifically.  But drinks in the minibar, as well as using the safe, are paid services.  Like many Turkish hotels, the Club Serena Hotel, reviews of which are mostly positive, delights guests with its exquisite decoration and aesthetics.  Pink petals on the bed and the famous “swans from the sheets” are far from everything that the staff’s imagination is capable of. </p>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  Club Serena Hotel 4 has free Wi-Fi in the lobby.  Internet can also be used near one of the pools, in the bar.  The speed is good, the guests have no complaints, Skype works without problems.  On the territory there is a hookah room with convenient platforms in the national style, a market with various tourist goods (although the prices are cheaper in the village), a hairdresser, a post office.  You can iron clothes.  Everywhere there are coolers with water, which can be typed without any restrictions.  A photo studio is working.  When you go to the beach, they take you off, and then, on the way back, they suggest you choose the image you like.  Naturally, not for free, but you can refuse.  Service at Club Serena Beach Hotel 4 is unobtrusive.  Have you arrived in your own or rented car?  Generally no problem - parking is free.  You can rent a car directly at the hotel.  If enough people are recruited, then they will be taken to a disco in a city with a special bus. </p><h2>  And what about the children? </h2><p>  For younger guests, Club Serena Hotel 4 offers a comfortable and modern playground for games with swings, special animations and, upon request, an armchair in the restaurant.  You can also order a crib in the room.  A special club has been opened for children from four to seven years old.  In the evenings, discos for the little ones are organized.  Kids are eagerly awaiting the evening to dance.  Then for them cartoons are shown on the big screen.  In general, guests write that the animation is mainly “tailored” for children and adolescents who are not at all bored in this hotel.  By the way, since the entry into the sea is deep, it is better for small children to purchase inflatable vests.  In an extreme case, they will be provided by the local staff. </p><h2>  Sea and other water procedures </h2><p>  Club Serena Beach Hotel, like any club hotel, overlooks the coast.  Not without reason in its name is the word “scourge”, that is, the beach, so, of course, it stands on the first line.  The shore is a mixture of pebbles and sand.  What does it mean?  The beach itself, where the sunbathing zone is located, is sandy, and pebbles are near the entrance to the sea.  However, the presence of special bathing slippers completely removes this problem.  The beach is small, but its own, and therefore umbrellas and sun loungers with mattresses are free for hotel guests, but towels, alas, no, you need to take with you.  For better air bathing, sun loungers are set on the pier.  There is enough space for everyone, and nothing needs to be borrowed in advance.  The beach is well cleaned, and despite the fact that our compatriots tend to throw garbage in the morning, it looks just perfect.  The sea is very beautiful, blue, but constantly worried.  Therefore, for those who are afraid of storms, there are two air pools (the third is a "paddling pool" for children), as well as a water slide - one, but a triple.  The water in the sea is very clear, and if you want to dive with a mask, then a few tens of meters from the coast you can find gorgeous fish. </p>

    <h2>  Club Serena Hotel: 2013 reviews </h2><p>  The hotel is characterized as very suitable for an economical vacation, for young people and active, as well as not particularly picky people.  Guests come here mainly from Russia and the CIS, but at the same time the contingent is completely decent family people.  This is one of the hotels that many want to return to, especially if the price does not rise much in the future.  Rest in it is comfortable, calm, truly relaxing.  Impressions of people are usually wonderful: sea, sun, parks, herbs, sweets, drinks, silence, peace ... If you really want to relax from the hustle and bustle, then this is the most wonderful hotel!  Tourists with children, including small ones, also left good reviews.  In short, if you want to light from morning to evening, it is better to choose Antalya or Alanya.  If you want to enjoy peace surrounded by greenery, you prefer nature, the azure shining sea, polite well-trained staff, excellent food, and all this for little money, then here you are.  After all, here is a continuous relaxation, from morning to evening.  Agree, this is so good after all the nervous stresses at work and in general in our lives. </p>
