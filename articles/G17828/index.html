At least because of these points (especially if you are a woman) you should visit this beautiful country.  Usually they go there in the summer or at the beginning of September - in the season itself.  Meanwhile, Georgia in the winter is no less wonderful place to relax. </p><h2>  Climate of Georgia </h2><p>  A characteristic feature of this amazing country is that several weather zones are located on its territory.  In the mountains, of course, it is colder and, as a rule, there lies snow.  In the foothills, rains and fogs are frequent, high humidity, and the Black Sea coast is saturated with the sun.  Moreover, in the winter in Georgia it is much warmer than in Russia, and, of course, there are no thirty-degree frosts.  The maximum low temperature in this country is minus two degrees, and all because Georgia is located close to the equator.  The average temperature in winter is about plus two to three degrees. </p>

    <h2>  Features of rest in Georgia in the winter </h2><p>  In this country, all ski resorts are at your service.  Let not lie on the beach, but the snowy Georgian mountains in beauty are not inferior to the sea.  In addition, in the winter in this country is not a season, respectively, housing prices and tours are reduced.  Tourist reviews of Georgia in the winter confirm that being there is pleasant not only in the summer.  People celebrate the hospitality of the locals, delicious food, magnificent landscapes.  And what air is there!  There are mountains everywhere, and it’s known that it is easier to breathe there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It's no secret how Georgians love holidays.  Therefore, it is difficult to imagine how large and colorful they celebrate the New Year.  This is another reason for the winter trip: to see everything with your own eyes. </p>

    <p>  There are three options for where to go in the winter in Georgia.  The first is for amateur athletes: there are many ski resorts in the country and they are amazing.  The second is for activist tourists: the architecture in Georgia in the summer and the winter is impressive, you can see the sights of Tbilisi and other cities.  And the third one is for those who care about their health: there are many sanatoriums in Georgia where people from all over the world come for treatment.  And you can combine all three options! </p><h2>  Ski resorts </h2><p>  For supporters of active sports and lovers of skiing and snowboarding in Georgia there are several wonderful places - with picturesque views and reasonable prices.  These are Gudauri, Bakuriani, Mestia and Goderdzi - the most popular resorts.  Each of them is easily accessible from all major Georgian cities. </p><h2>  Gudauri </h2><p>  This resort is located closest to the capital - it is only a little more than a hundred kilometers away.  Gudauri is a relatively young resort, but it is not inferior to the Swiss Alps, and the prices here are much lower: the cost of housing and food per day is about twenty dollars.  Travel time from Tbilisi takes about two hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The length of the Gudauri ski slopes is eighteen kilometers, and the maximum height from which you can go down is more than three thousand meters.  In addition to skiing in Gudauri, you can go snowboarding or freeride (free off-piste).  Also, those who wish have the opportunity to ride a helicopter and hang glider.  The only minus of Gudauri is a small number of cafes and an almost complete absence of shops. </p><h2>  Bakuriani </h2><p>  Bakuriani is located a little farther from Tbilisi than Gudauri - 180 kilometers, at an altitude of almost two thousand meters above sea level.  There is an Olympic sports base, tourists are allowed to visit cross-country tracks. </p><p>  They are divided into categories - for experienced athletes and for beginners.  Bakuriani is considered an ideal resort for families - there is very clean air, and there are also mineral springs. </p><h2>  Mestia </h2><p>  This is a very young ski resort in northwestern Georgia, one hundred and thirty kilometers from Zugdidi.  Airplanes fly from Tbilisi there. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the resort is new (it has been operating for only seven years), it is developing very quickly and can already boast of good infrastructure.  The tracks are uncomplicated, which should please only beginners, inexperienced athletes.  For them, there is generally a three hundred meter short track.  The biggest peak in Mestia is more than two thousand meters. </p><h2>  Goderdzi </h2><p>  Goderdzi is located near Batumi - one hundred and ten kilometers.  The length of the tracks here is small - only eight kilometers, but there is unlimited scope for freeriders.  The height of Goderdzi is almost two and a half thousand meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is a two-level <span>cableway</span> in the resort <span>,</span> which offers stunning views, a hotel, a restaurant.  There are no shops, as in Gudauri. </p><h2>  Sanatoriums </h2><p>  How beautiful Georgia is in winter!  This is clearly visible in the photo, although it cannot fully convey all the beauty of these places.  You can truly enjoy it in the sanatoriums of an amazing country, where they combine business with pleasure: they heal, and breathe indescribably clean air, and enjoy stunning views of the mountains.  Of all such Georgian resorts, one can perhaps mention Kiketi and Tsagveri - both are located at an altitude of one to one and a half thousand meters.  They are ideal for treating asthma, tuberculosis and other respiratory problems, as the air here is thin.  In addition, patients with anemia and vascular diseases also come to these sanatoriums.  The standard procedure here is balneotherapy. </p>

    <p>  High mountain resorts of Georgia (located at an altitude of two thousand meters) - Bakuriani and Bakhmaro.  People come here who suffer from diseases of the skin, lymph nodes, digestive system, and also prone to neurasthenia.  By the way, adjacent to Bakuriani is the well-known source of mineral water - Borjomi, the use of which is also included in the course of treatment. </p><h2>  Active tourism </h2><p>  Those who don’t like skiing in Georgia have nothing to do in winter?  No matter how!  The architecture of this country is beautiful at any time of the year.  So if you like to see the sights, a great solution is to visit Tbilisi, as well as a number of other wonderful places. </p>

    <p>  It is warm in the capital of Georgia in winter - the temperature keeps near zero.  Enough sun, unlike, again, from cold Russia.  All amusement and entertainment facilities in Tbilisi work, as in the summer.  You should definitely visit the Holy Trinity Cathedral, <span>Narikala Fortress, a</span> monument to Tsar Vakhtang the First, enjoy the views from the observation deck, walk along Old Tbilisi and Rustaveli Avenue.  You should definitely see the capital at night!  And on New Year's Eve, the city is becoming incredibly beautiful!  You can not ignore the local cuisine: in Tbilisi, you just need to try churchkhela, khinkali and khachapuri. </p><p>  Not far from the capital is Mtskheta - an old small town in which there are many temples.  There is even a cathedral built in the eleventh century!  And near the town lurks a Chateau-Mukhrani winery, where wine tastings are held.  You can and should also visit Kutaisi, as well as the karst cave of Prometheus, which is located next to it.  From there, a view of the mountain opens, to which the hero was chained.  And in Satallia caves you can see traces of real dinosaurs! </p>

    <p>  Kakheti is located near Tbilisi - the territory of wines.  There are many wineries where tourists are allowed, as well as the most famous wine region - Alazani Valley. </p><p>  On the Black Sea coast extends another Georgian town that deserves a visit.  This is Batumi.  It is considered a resort city, but in fact there are enough attractions: a cable car, a seaport, a lighthouse, Batumi Boulevard, several historical squares - you can list and list. </p><h2>  Visa to Georgia </h2><p>  The question that interests many is whether it is possible to break loose and go to Georgia in the winter spontaneously, or is entry permission required?  A visa is really required, but compared with many other countries, getting to Georgia is much easier for Russian residents.  You can get the document right at the border for a period of three months.  The main thing to remember: entry from South Ossetia and Abkhazia is prohibited, in which case a visa will be denied. </p><h2>  Housing prices </h2><p>  From June to September in Georgia - the season, so the cost of housing soars.  From October to May, they fall, which is another plus visit to Georgia in the winter.  The approximate cost of living for two people in a three-star Tbilisi hotel per day will be about 2300 rubles, the apartment will cost a little cheaper - in the region of two thousand. </p>

    <p>  However, when preparing for a trip to Georgia in winter, you should remember this: there is no central heating.  "Each for himself," that is, he will have to heat his own housing.  Therefore, when planning to rent an apartment or a room, you must definitely find out if it is warm there, otherwise there is a risk that you will have to freeze. </p><h2>  The cost of treatment and tours in the cold </h2><p>  Staying in a sanatorium in winter will also be more affordable than in summer.  Accommodation ranges from fifty to one hundred and ten euros per day, depending on the sanatorium (in any case, three meals a day are included in the price).  The complex of medical procedures costs around four hundred euros.  One specific procedure is ten to twenty euros. </p><p>  Tours to Georgia in winter are also cheaper than in season - you can fly together for a week for forty thousand.  To go to the ski resort, you will need from thirty-five to eighty thousand per person. </p><p>  Thus, everyone can find something for everyone in Georgia to their liking, even in winter.  This unique country will not leave anyone indifferent.  And therefore - to be a winter holiday! </p>
