  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The road from Moscow to Samara: how many kilometers will have to be overcome</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Summer 2018 is expected to be hot in Samara.  One of the cities hosting the World Cup is getting ready to receive guests.  The airport was completely reconstructed, the highway to Moscow was repaired, new interchanges were made.  But the greatest influx of fans is expected by rail.  As befits a good owner, it is again checked whether everything is ready for passenger service. </p><h2>  Moscow, Kazan station </h2><p>  No matter <span>how many kilometers from Moscow to Samara, the</span> journey starts from the Kazan station.  This is where the journey of more than 1,000 kilometers begins.  It is the largest railway station in Europe.  From 6 tracks, 70 pairs of long-distance trains depart and arrive daily.  Of these, at least 11 should go to Samara. Passengers can use tickets for every taste and budget. </p><p>  You can ride a seated car for 2,608 rubles, or you can go in a compartment with a cost of 1,199 rubles.  Soft wagons with a price of 21,844 are offered for the most demanding passengers, everything is provided here to make the person feel comfortable.  The time of the road is from 13 hours to 21 hours 46 minutes.  It matters not how many kilometers from Moscow to Samara, but how many stops the train makes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="visual.rzd.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Branded train" class="if uuid-2515602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2515602.jpg"></div><p>  Those who want to go with maximum comfort and at a convenient time choose the branded train "Zhiguli".  Departure is not very late - in the evening at 20:08, at the service of passengers a delicious dinner.  You can use the Internet, watch TV.  Passengers of soft cars have the opportunity to take a shower.  In the morning, breakfast is offered to passengers.  Arrival at 09:11.  You can calmly put yourself in order before going out.  With any choice, the train Moscow - Samara remains the most popular transport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kurumoch Airport </h2><p>  The 21st century is a century of speeds; trains have to compete for passengers with air carriers.  Samara successfully operates and develops the Kurumoch airport, the largest in the Volga region.  Starting from servicing the Moscow-Samara flights from Sheremetyevo in 1961, it developed and became a modern international air terminal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="--." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kurumoch Airport" class="if uuid-2515605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2515605.jpg"></div><p>  Today, more than fifty flights depart daily at three major Moscow airports: Sheremetyevo, Vnukovo, and Domodedovo.  A distance of 825 kilometers, if you count in a straight line, the plane overcomes in 2 hours 40 minutes.  If you take into account how many kilometers from Samara to <span>Moscow by land transport,</span> the benefit is obvious.  The airfare can be compared with a seated train car.  Often choose the economic flight No. 1069 of the Pobeda airline and No. 2855 of the S5 Airlines company. </p><p>  It is not by chance that the passenger flow through <span>Kurumoch Airport</span> significantly exceeds 2 million people.  Modern ground transportation makes the road from the airport to the city center very convenient.  Time by bus - from 40 to 60 minutes, by train - 1 hour 15 minutes.  Moreover, given how many kilometers are from Moscow to Samara, the extra hour no longer plays a role. </p><h2>  By bus to Samara </h2><p>  For lovers of land transport, 13 bus routes are offered daily.  The length of the general route is approximately 1,100 kilometers.  How much a bus will travel from Moscow to Samara depends on the situation on the road.  The main loss of time can be in Moscow traffic jams.  The ticket price is the most affordable - from 660 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotobus.msk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="By bus to Moscow" class="if uuid-2515603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2515603.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, more comfortable flights are more expensive.  But in any case, the main price range is between 1 and 2 thousand rubles.  There are flights more expensive, but this is for increased comfort. </p>
