She can tell a lot of observant people about her master or mistress.  And even more so, this applies to things done by oneself.  You yourself develop a style, select details, create the style that matches your lifestyle, mood, clothes.  That is, having learned to sew such a ‚Äútrifle‚Äù as a bag, you are taking the first steps towards building your own image. </p><h3>  Work specifics </h3>

After all, such material is denser and thicker, and the sewing machine should be adapted for it.  But more on that later.  In the meantime, urgent tips:

    <ul><li>  Think over the work in detail, because then it will be difficult to make amendments and additions. </li><li>  Good threads, their proper selection is an important condition in order to make your leather bag of high quality.  With your own hands, making patterns, cutting out the elements of the product on the material is half the battle.  It is necessary to sew them in such a way that the seams do not part.  Therefore, pick up kapron, silk or <span>nylon threads.</span>  And it is advisable to do the firmware not once, but several, for greater strength. </li><li>  As jewelry, you can use leather trimmings of contrasting colors, decorative stitching, braid, laces, metal inserts and rivets.  Rhinestones, beads, fringe (also made of leather) will do. </li><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a leather bag pattern" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/314965.jpg" width="570"></div>  If you want a leather bag with handles, you can easily make patterns of this part with your own hands.  And you can buy special rings, belts, clamps, chains.  With such accessories, your thing will turn out to be especially stylish. </li><li>  For a leather bag, you will definitely need cardboard or a thick, stiff fabric to form the bottom, as well as a lining fabric.  You can pick up the latter in tone to the top, or you can choose a contrasting one, with drawings, etc. </li><li>  Since you make such a thing as a leather bag with your own hands, you also have to make patterns.  To do this, store tracing paper and newspapers, a centimeter, rulers and triangles, English and ordinary pins, chalk, pencils, scissors.  For cutting leather you will need roller knives, a cutting mat. </li></ul><h3>  Getting started </h3><p>  How exactly can you <span>sew a</span> leather <span>bag</span> ?  Patterns (options) are made like this: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Determine the shape of the bag (rectangle, oval, square).  Draw on the newspaper (tracing paper) one side of the product in the expected dimensions, and cut out two parts on it (i.e., both sides).  In accordance with them, you need to cut the bottom stencil.  His length should be equal to: the length of the base plus height times 2. If desired, it is made rectangular, narrowed, etc. </li><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of men's leather bags" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/314975.jpg" width="312"></div>  The pattern of a man‚Äôs bag made of leather is generally the same as a woman‚Äôs.  And if you are interested in a female reticule with a round bottom, then draw a circle of the desired diameter with a pair of compasses or simply circle a plate.  And the walls can be made in the form of an even (or curly) ribbon strip, the height of which you determine, and the length should be equal <span>to the circumference of</span> the bottom itself. </li><li>  Do the seam allowance already when the pattern is transferred to the material, otherwise you can get confused.  For them, leave 1.5-2 cm. </li><li>  The pattern for the pen / pens is elementary: rectangular stripes of the desired width and length plus stock for sewing.  To this end, leave 4-5 cm on both sides. </li><li>  Well, the lining.  This is already quite simple: a rectangle of the required width and length and an allowance on the sides and bottom.  If there are additional parts, trim the lining for them too. </li></ul><h3>  Product assembly </h3><p>  When the pattern is ready, the details are cut out, arrange them with pins, figure out what and how, and start stitching.  Tap the skin folds for seams with a hammer to make them softer.  Do it through the fabric.  Sew not with round, but with ribbed needles, this is more convenient.  Having made the basis, take care of the lining.  Then connect both elements, attach handles, sew a fastener and add, if necessary, jewelry, decor elements. </p>
