When there is a suspicion of a fracture or other damage to the bones, radiography is used.  These procedures have long become commonplace, although, if you think about it, they themselves are amazing.  Who was the man who immortalized his name, giving the world a powerful diagnostic tool?  Where and when was Wilhelm Roentgen born? </p><h2>  early years </h2><p>  The future scientist was born on March 17, 1845 in the city of Lennep, on the site of the present Remscheid, in Germany.  His father was a manufacturer and was engaged in the sale of clothing, dreaming of transferring his business one day to William.  Mother was from the Netherlands.  Three years after the birth of his only son, the family moved to Amsterdam, where the future inventor began his studies.  His first educational institution was a private institution led by Martinus von Dorn. </p>

    <p>  The father of the future scientist believed that the manufacturer needed an engineering education, and his son was absolutely not opposed - he was interested in science.  In 1861, Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen moved to Utrecht Technical School, from which he was soon expelled, refusing to extradite a friend who drew a caricature of one of the teachers when an internal investigation began. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having flown out of school, Roentgen Wilhelm did not receive any documents on education, so admission to a higher educational institution was now a difficult task for him - he could only claim to be a volunteer.  In 1865, it was with such initial data that he tried to become a student at Utrecht University, but was defeated. </p>

    <h2>  Training and work </h2><p>  Nevertheless, perseverance served him well.  A little later, he still became a student, although not in the Netherlands.  In accordance with the desire of his father, he was determined to get an engineering education and became a student of the Federal Polytechnic Zurich Institute.  Throughout the years spent within its walls, Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen was particularly passionate about physics.  Gradually, he begins to conduct his research.  In 1869, he completed his studies with a diploma in mechanical engineering and a Ph.D.  In the end, having decided to make his hobby his favorite job, he goes to university and defends his dissertation, after which he starts the <span>work of an assistant</span> and begins to lecture to students.  Later, he transferred several times from one educational institution to another, and in 1894 he became rector in Würzburg.  After 6 years, Roentgen moved to Munich, where he worked until the end of his career.  But then it was still far away. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Main directions </h2><p>  Like any scientist, William worked in various scientific fields.  Basically, the German physicist Roentgen was interested in some properties of crystals, studied the relationship between electrical and optical phenomena in them, and also conducted studies of magnetism, on which the Lorentz electronic theory was later based.  And who knew that studying crystals later would bring him worldwide recognition and many rewards? </p>

    <h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  While still at the University of Zurich, Wilhelm Roentgen (1845-1923) met his future wife, Anna Bertu Ludwig.  She was the daughter of the owner of the boarding house at the institute, so they had to deal with at one time quite often.  In 1872 they got married.  The couple was very gentle to each other and wanted children.  However, Anna did not manage to get pregnant, and then they adopted an orphaned six-year-old girl, the niece of Frau Bertha. </p><p>  Of course, understanding the importance of her husband’s work, the wife at the final stages of research tried to make sure that he ate and rested on time, while the scientist devoted himself entirely to work, forgetting about his own needs.  These patience and work were fully rewarded - it was the spouse who served as a kind of model to demonstrate the discovery: the image of her hand with a ring circled the whole world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  In 1919, when his beloved wife died, and the adopted daughter got married, Wilhelm was already 74 years old.  Despite the worldwide fame, he felt terribly lonely, the attention of strangers even bothered him.  In addition, he was in great need, transferring all means to the government during the First World War.  After the death of his wife, he himself lived quite a bit, having died at the beginning of 1923 of cancer - the result of constant interaction with the rays discovered by him. </p><h2>  Roentgen </h2><p>  Wilhelm, by and large, especially did not try to make a career.  He was already 50 years old, and all the great achievements were not there, but this, it seems, was not at all interesting for him - he just liked to move science forward, pushing the limits of what was studied.  He stayed up late in the laboratory, endlessly conducting experiments and analyzing their results.  Autumn evening of 1895 was no exception.  Leaving and having already turned off the light, he noticed a spot on the cathode tube.  Deciding that he simply forgot to turn it off, the scientist turned the switch.  The mysterious spot immediately disappeared, but the researcher was very interested.  Several times he repeated this experiment, coming to the conclusion that everything was to blame for the mysterious radiation. </p><p>  Obviously, he felt that he was on the verge of a great discovery, because even his wife, with whom he usually talked about work, he did not say anything.  The next two months were entirely devoted to understanding the properties of the mysterious rays.  X-ray Wilhelm placed various objects between the cathode tube and the screen, analyzing the results.  Paper and wood completely transmitted radiation, while metal and some other materials cast shadows, and their intensity depended, among other things, on the density of the substance. </p>

    <h2>  The properties </h2><p>  Further studies yielded very interesting results.  First, it turned out that lead completely absorbs this radiation.  Secondly, placing his hand between the tube and the screen, the scientist received an image of the bones inside it.  And thirdly, the rays illuminated the film, so the results of each study could well be documented, which was what Wilhelm Roentgen did, the discoveries of which still needed to be properly prepared before they could be presented to the public. </p><p>  Three years after the first experiments, a German physicist published an article in a scientific journal, to which he attached an image that clearly demonstrates the penetrating power of rays, and described the properties he had already studied.  Immediately after this, dozens of scientists confirmed this by conducting experiments on their own.  In addition, some researchers stated that they had encountered this radiation, but did not attach importance to it.  Now they <span>bit their elbows</span> and scolded themselves for their carelessness, envying, as it seemed to them, just a more successful colleague named Wilhelm Roentgen. </p><h2>  Interesting discovery facts </h2><p>  Immediately after the publication of the article, a huge number of dexterous dealers appeared, who claimed that with the help of X-radiation you can look into the human soul.  More mundane advertised devices, supposedly allowing you to see through clothes.  For example, in the United States, Edison was commissioned to develop <span>theatrical binoculars</span> using radiation.  And although the idea failed, it caused quite a stir.  And merchants who sold clothes advertised their products, claiming that their goods did not transmit rays, and women could feel safe, which significantly increased sales.  All this terribly bothered a scientist who simply wanted to continue his scientific research. </p>

    <h2>  Application </h2><p>  When William Roentgen discovered <span>x-rays</span> and showed what they are capable of, it literally blew up society.  Until that moment, it was impossible to look inside a living person, to see his tissue without cutting and damaging them.  And <span>x-ray radiation</span> showed what the human skeleton looks like in combination with other systems.  Medicine was the first and main area where open rays were applied.  With their help, it has become much easier for doctors to diagnose any problems of the musculoskeletal system, as well as assess the severity of injuries.  Later, X-radiation began to be used to treat certain diseases. </p><p>  In addition, these rays are used to detect defects in metal products, and even with their help the chemical composition of certain materials can be detected.  In art criticism, X-rays are also used, with which you can see what is hidden under the upper layers of paint. </p>

    <h2>  Confession </h2><p>  The discovery caused a real stir, which was completely incomprehensible to the scientist.  Instead of continuing research, X-ray Wilhelm was forced to consider and reject the endless offers of German and American merchants who suggested that he design various devices based on X-radiation.  Journalists also did not allow the scientist to work, constantly making appointments and interviews, and each of them asked a question about why X-ray does not want to get a patent for his discovery.  He replied to each of them that he considered the rays to be the property of all mankind and did not feel he had the right to limit its use for good purposes. </p><h2>  Awards </h2><p>  Wilhelm Roentgen was characterized by natural modesty and a lack of desire for fame.  He refused the noble title, to which he received the right after being awarded the order.  And in 1901 he became the first <span>winner of the Nobel Prize in physics.</span>  Although this was the highest level of recognition, the researcher did not attend the ceremony, although he accepted the award.  Later he transferred this money to the government.  In 1918, he was also awarded the Helmholtz Medal. </p><h2>  Legacy and memory </h2><p>  All of the same modesty Roentgen Wilhelm called his discovery extremely simply - X-radiation.  This name stuck, but the student of the researcher, the Russian physicist <span>Abram Ioffe,</span> eventually introduced a concept that perpetuated the name of the scientist.  The term "x-rays" in foreign speech is used relatively rarely, but it still occurs. </p><p>  In 1964, one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.  One of the units of ionizing healing is also named after him.  Many cities have streets named after his last name, as well as monuments.  There is even a museum located in the house where Roentgen lived as a child.  The biography of this person may not be full of interesting details, but it perfectly illustrates that you can achieve high results through diligence and perseverance, as well as attentiveness. </p>
