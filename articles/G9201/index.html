    <h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  A work dressing gown is best made from a dense cotton fabric such as cotton.  The price of such material depends on the density and manufacturer.  And if you look in sewing accessories stores, then it is quite possible to find an economical option.  In extreme cases, you can use a regular teak, which has good wear-resistant qualities, is well washed, allows air to pass through and is a natural canvas. </p><p>  You will also need buttons or lightning for the product.  The latter option will be more convenient for the child.  But on the buttons the dressing gown for work looks more solid.  In addition, you will need such sewing materials as non-woven fabric and threads, and, of course, equipment with appropriate paws for sewing zippers or buttonhole stitches.  Tailor needles will not be superfluous when working with patch pockets and a belt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baby bathrobe for work" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1057560.jpg" width="600"></div>

And the girls will suit burgundy and green fabrics.  The main thing is that the color is not light, otherwise the product will often have to be washed. </p><h2>  Preparatory work </h2><p>  At first glance, it might seem that it is very difficult to sew a baby coat for work, because it has a lot of different cut details.  And sleeves cause particular difficulty for amateur craftsmen, however, knowing the basic techniques for constructing a drawing, there will be no difficulties. </p><p>  First you need to take measurements from the figure: girth of the chest, waist and hips, width of the back, length of the back from the shoulder to the waist, length of the front from the shoulder to the center of the chest and to the waist, shoulder width, sleeve length and length of the product. </p><p>  Also, before cutting, iron the fabric and prepare the paper by gluing A4 sheets or polyethylene construction film for the drawing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="work dressing gown for boys" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1057551.jpg" width="281"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Building a base pattern </h2><p>  <span>The dressing gown pattern</span> for labor lessons is built on the basis of measurements taken.  The first step is to draw a rectangle with a vertical side equal to the length of the product and a horizontal side equal to half the chest circumference + 7 cm for a loose fit.  This increase will make it easy to put on a bathrobe even on a warm sweater.  After from the top of the rectangle, horizontals such as the line of the chest, waist and hips are noted. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next, they begin to work with individual zones of the pattern.  First draw the neck.  To do this, lay 7 cm in the upper left corner of the drawing and draw a half of the neckline of the back, deepening it from the corner by about 1‚Äì1.5 cm. After this, the same procedure should be performed from the upper right corner, but here should be put down about 5 cm, because the front neck is always deeper. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dressing gown pattern for labor lessons" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1057578.jpg" width="515"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Next, determine the length of the shoulder seams and draw a line, lowering the edge by 1 cm from the upper side of the rectangle.  The next stage is the construction of armholes.  Here it should be on the line of the chest to defer from the left side of the width of the back, and from the right side the width of the front.  The remaining gap will be the armhole zone, which is divided in half and marked with a point offset from the center by 2 cm towards the rear shelf.  After that, you should draw verticals from the edge of the shoulder section to the chest line and draw armholes, rounded corners, reducing the lines to the center. </p><p>  On this, the foundation can be completed by lowering and slightly ‚Äúflaring‚Äù the side sections from the center point of the armhole to the bottom of the product.  On the waist line should make marks for sewing on the belt.  On the thigh line, it is necessary to set aside the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the thigh circumference on both sides of the verticals in half to determine the size of the tick. </p><h2>  Sleeve construction </h2><p>  A children's bathrobe for work is done with a long sleeve.  To build a template for this cut element, you should use the only rule: the ridge should be equal to the perimeter of the base armhole.  To make a drawing of this part, it is necessary to re-cut the sections of the armholes by comparing the shoulder seams of the shelves and outlining the chest line with the center of the armhole on a separate sheet of paper. </p><p>  Along the chest line, it is necessary to postpone the measurement of the upper part of the arm + 5 cm to a loose fit, shifting the center by 2 cm towards the back.  Next, draw a sleeve ridge, which runs 1.5 cm above the planned upper lines, smoothly descends along the sections of the armhole to the middle of the back and front and is rounded to the bases at the chest line.  After that, measure the length of the sleeve, measure the wrist + 5 cm and draw sections of the sleeve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY lab coat" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1057581.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cut </h2><p>  A dressing gown made of cotton fabric will need to be treated with an overlock or just tuck seams.  For the first option, 0.7 cm allowance will be sufficient for processing, and for the second 1.5 cm, about 5 cm will be required to process the lower sections. </p><p>  Cut details are cut from the drawing and transferred to fabric, cut with allowance for allowances.  At this stage, the cutting is considered complete.  It should be noted that in the dressing gown you need to make picks.  That is, an internal edging that repeats the part 10-15 cm inside the product. </p><h2>  Work with pockets and collar </h2><p>  A work dressing gown for boys and girls is best done with pockets.  Firstly, it is practical, and secondly, due to such elements, the appearance of the product improves.  Pockets should be placed just above the hips.  The easiest way to make them is rectangular in shape, bending the slices inward, and you only need to scribble on the shelves. </p><p>  The collar of the product is also considered a decorative element.  Cut it out in the form of a strip of fabric with a length at the base equal to the length of the neckline on the basis of the product. </p><h2>  Part processing </h2><p>  Then it remains to sew a dressing gown for labor from the resulting parts.  First, the shoulder seams of the base and the rebounds are connected, then the collar is sewn to the neck of the base and connected along the cuts of the shelf with the rebounds.  Next, the lab coat for work is connected along the side seams, sections are processed.  After it remains to tuck the bottom of the sleeves and hem and stitch.  Be sure to sew a belt in the side seams in the designated places.  Next, sew buttons and sweep the buttonhole. </p>

    <h2>  Practical tips </h2><p>  For a bathrobe, you must definitely choose a dense fabric made from natural or mixed fibers.  Otherwise, the product will be impractical.  After the parts are connected in stages, the seams with steam should be ironed well.  When sewing pockets, they should be swept or pinned with tailor needles.  Be sure to use gauze or iron with a surface that does not leave marks on the fabric. </p><p>  Making a dressing gown for labor with your own hands is not difficult, a skilled worker with minimal experience in sewing clothes will cope with the work.  The minimum number of small parts and an easy version of the cut, a little perseverance - and the dressing gown is ready for work. </p>
