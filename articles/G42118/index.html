The state of Arkansas was nicknamed the "natural state."  Once it was just an advertising move designed to attract investors and tourists.  The move was successful, but the name stuck, but it remained.  Well, the motto, of course, is unofficial, says: ‚ÄúWhy do we need this literacy?‚Äù.  Yes, self-irony is held in high esteem even at the national level.  The fact is that it is the Arkansas schools that are recognized as the worst schools in the states. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arkansas" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/1491416.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Like other lands across the American continent, before the arrival of white people, Indians lived in the territory where Arkansas is today located.  They hunted, fought among themselves, made agreements.  In general, they behaved as Indians should conduct.  While in the sixteenth century the Spaniards did not come.  The Spaniards said that now they are the owners.  However, not everyone agreed with this.  And for some reason, the French most disagreed.  The French said that they liked these lands, and they will live here. </p><p>  And while the Spaniards and the French were scolding, the native Indians lived quite calmly on their land.  Indeed, because of disputes over the territory and the question that is not completely clarified, who is in charge here, in reality, only hunters and traders came from Europeans who did not offend Indians especially. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But finally, as always, money decided everything.  In 1803, they took and bought the US state of Arkansas (which no one had called a state then, of course) from France.  They decided on that. </p><h2>  Capital of arkansas </h2><p>  The largest and most famous city in Arkansas is Little Rock, which translates as ‚Äúlittle rock‚Äù or ‚Äúlittle rock‚Äù.  It is a modern city with a well-developed economy.  Little Rock is located at the foot of a ridge of rocks on the banks of a wide river.  The city has many interesting museums and exhibitions.  With particular pride, locals will show the <span>Bill Clinton</span> Presidential Library <span>.</span>  And at the same time they will tell about the history of its occurrence. </p><p>  The attraction is the local Capitol.  On its territory there are many interesting sculptures that embody the history of the city.  Arkansas is a state known for a high-profile struggle for the rights of black citizens.  One of the architectural compositions is dedicated to the first nine black students who entered the local school.  Other beautiful architectural ensembles can be seen just by walking along the streets of the city. </p><h2>  Arkansas Natural Heritage </h2><p>  But Arkansas is primarily not famous for architecture.  Cities on this list are not important at all.  There are literally dozens of nature reserves in the state.  Due to the fact that it is forbidden to use any kind of transport in the conservation area, only natural sounds reign around.  Among the forests, valleys and rocks you can truly feel like a pioneer. </p><p>  Still in the territory of this cozy and truly natural state there are many caves.  Really a lot.  Forty three thousand!  Plus minus a couple of hundred.  In many of them Indians lived at one time.  Today, access to them is open to adventure and caving enthusiasts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arkansas state" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/1491417.jpg" width="600"></div>

They are located in the Hot Springs National Park.  Nearly fifty hot springs (the temperature of the water coming to the surface - +61 degrees Celsius) daily bring healing water from the bowels of the mountains.  These sources, however, are cultivated, but this was done with skill.  And the mineralogical hospitals themselves, and separate bathrooms simply delight the eye with beauty and elegance. </p><h2>  Diamond crater </h2>

I found a diamond.  Further, the script is somewhat similar to how the state of Arkansas was ‚Äúborn‚Äù.  The owners changed, the production of diamonds began (and on an industrial scale), something fell apart, someone bribed someone, someone set fire to something ... The confusion is utter.  While the state authorities did not take, and did not redeem the coveted site.  We bought and made the Crater of Diamonds State Park out of it.

    <p>  On the territory, all the more or less interesting historical buildings have been preserved.  Here you can see the old facilities for washing rocks and even some mining equipment.  Although they do not come here for this.  The fact is that any diamond found can be taken with you completely legally and for free.  You will also be weighed, and a certificate will be issued.  And they find it!  Not often and not big, but they find.  And some were really lucky, and the diamonds they found turned into luxurious faceted diamonds. </p><h2>  St. Francis National Forest </h2>

On the plateau lies one of the most beautiful reserves - the National Forest of St. Francis.  It was founded in 1908 by <span>Theodore Roosevelt,</span> known for his love of forests.  It is especially beautiful here in the fall, when the trees dress in bright outfits of colorful leaves.
