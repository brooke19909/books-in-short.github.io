It conditionally consists of two parts, one of which is intended for elite relaxation, and the second for budget.  It used to be called Oludeniz, but now this name remains only for the surrounding area.  The modern city is named after the famous Turkish pilot.  But not only to visit the beaches it is worth going to these places.  The sights of Fethiye are also worthy to devote time to them.  In this article, we will introduce you to where you can go and what to see. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Fethiye" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1806681.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To come to Fethiye, you must first fly to the airport closest to this city.  International hubs are located in Dalaman and Antalya.  Next you need to move on buses.  Flights run from Antalya every hour, and you need to drive about two hundred kilometers to Fethiye.  The road is very picturesque, runs along the coast and the Lycian mountains, but is extremely long.  You need to spend more than five hours on it.  But the attractions of Fethiye and the beaches of this resort are worth it.  Regular buses also run from Dalaman, and it takes about three hours to travel less. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fethiye attractions" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1806673.jpg" width="600"></div>

It was in the fifth century BC.  Here were the troops of Alexander the Great.  In 43 AD, this area was declared a Roman province, and since 1390 it became part of the Ottoman Empire.  Therefore, in the vicinity of the city, as in many parts of Turkey, there are ruins of the ancient era.  Above the city bazaar, right on the slopes of the mountains, you can see the ancient Lycian cemetery with tombs decorated with numerous reliefs.  There is a mysterious "Amintas grave" where tourists are allowed to go before sunset.  This is the tomb of the ancient ruler of Lycia, which can be seen even from the sea.  In addition, the attractions of Fethiye, whose photos look very representative - this is an antique amphitheater of the first centuries of our era, the remains of Roman terms and the ‚Äúgymnasium‚Äù - places for sports.  The castle of the fifteenth century, the so-called ‚ÄúBloodthirsty Ali‚Äù fortress, which stands on the site of Roman ruins, is very impressive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fethiye Turkey Attractions" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1806674.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  City Museum </h2><p>  Many of Fethiye's sights recovered by archaeologists into the light of God are exhibited here.  Telmessos port, on the territory of which the modern city was founded, was one of the most famous among the six shopping centers of the ancient state of Lycia in Asia Minor, which existed between 2000 and the eighth century BC.  Many fragments of buildings and tombs that were found during excavations fell into this museum.  Artifacts from other Lycian cities - Tlos and Leonton, which were not far from Telmessos, were also brought here.  These are the remains of mosaics and fragments of <span>ancient temples.</span>  Tlos, which gave the largest number of exhibits, was the capital of Lycia and is considered the legendary homeland of Bellerophon, who mounted the winged horse of Pegasus.  In addition, the museum houses countless cultural masterpieces from different eras - Persian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman.  These are marble busts, amphorae, sculptures, the remains of columns.  The most amazing exhibit in the museum is the so-called Liton stela, where there are inscriptions in three languages, including ancient Greek.  Thanks to her, scientists were able to decipher the Lycian script. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fethiye attractions photo" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1806676.jpg" width="600"></div>

You can just roam it in different directions.  Old shopping areas are very interesting - especially the bazaar, <span>fish market</span> and the Paspatur quarter.  From there, it is very close to the port with yacht parking, a marina and an amazingly beautiful promenade.  Everything here is so compact that a walk will not tire you at all.  If you got to the port, then we advise you to take a trip on a multi-colored boat on the bay of Fethiye.  First you swim along the canal among the reeds, and then go out into the wide bay with amazing views.  Popular among tourists - especially those who come not in season but in cooler times - and mountain trekking.  After all, the surrounding rocks are full of marked groomed trails, and very picturesque panoramas open from each slope. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Fethiye and surroundings" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1806675.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to see in the surroundings </h2><p>  If you want to independently go from the center of Fethiye to the outskirts, then go to the end of Ataturk Avenue.  Five hundred meters from the city center there is a local bus station.  From there, buses and minibuses (dolmushi) can reach the most remote bays and the nearest villages.  The natural attractions of Fethiye and the surrounding area are paradise beach corners.  First of all, it is the shore of Cleopatra or Turtle Island.  This is a bay closed from the winds with warm water, where you can swim even in winter.  Tortoise eggs are laid there, hence the name.  Pebble beach alysh, five kilometers from the city and the island of Gemile, are also popular with tourists.  And the <span>azure bay of</span> Oludeniz 10 km from Fethiye has the same healing properties as the water of the Dead Sea.  This is a famous nature reserve.  Dolmushi go there literally every five minutes, and the road to Oludeniz itself is so picturesque that many consider it an independent excursion.  You can also go on a boat trip "12 islands of the bay." </p><h2>  Fethiye Reviews: Attractions </h2><p>  Tourists vacationing in this resort, discover a completely different Turkey than the regulars of the Antalya palaces with "all inclusive".  Excursions here are unusual and very informative.  It has beautiful nature, picturesque bays and fresh air.  Even the road to this resort is so good that tourists feel like on an additional excursion.
