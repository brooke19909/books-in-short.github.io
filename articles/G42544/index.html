    <p>  The climate in Gelendzhik is mild, summers are very hot, not rainy, the swimming season lasts from May to the very end of September, autumn is warm and incredibly beautiful, winter does not have severe frosts, and spring is quite early.  A comfortable vacation in Gelendzhik will be at any time of the year, but the velvet season is considered the most chic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Gelendzhik in September is something.  The beaches are much freer than in summer, the sea is still gentle and warm, the sun is no longer so aggressive, it gives warmth, not heat.  Tanning at this time is the safest and longest lasting.  The velvet season gives vacationers peace and enjoyment of the delights of the resort.  Excursions at this time bring only pleasure, the heat does not oppress, there are no crowds of tourists.  In addition, holiday prices in September are lower than in summer.  Unfortunately, in September, not everyone can afford Gelendzhik, mainly in connection with the beginning of the school year. </p>
