    <p>  Apple's third generation smartwatch is water resistant.  And not only from splashes, as it was in Series 1. The presented watches can not be removed from the hands during training in the pool.  With them you can dive to a depth of 50 m. However, this device is not intended for diving.  Also, do not expose it to contact with water at high speed.  For normal swimming in the sea or pool, this device is quite suitable. </p><p>  After water procedures, it is necessary to activate the corresponding function.  The system will push the remaining moisture out of the speaker.  Also, after taking a shower, you need to wash the device with clean water. </p><p>  In addition, the difference of the presented series is the presence of voice messages Siri.  This allows you to receive information in the most convenient way for the user. </p><h2>  Main functions </h2><p>  Considering the <span>review of</span> <span>Apple</span> <span>Watch</span> <span>Series 3,</span> it is necessary to consider the main functions that remained in the software of the device from the first series.  This primarily includes the gyroscope and accelerometer.  The company also uses a cardiac activity sensor in the design of its devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Watch Series 3 Cellular" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/2083054.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It should be said that the heart rate monitor in the new version has a number of improved characteristics.  This application is not only capable of controlling the heartbeat of its owner.  In Series 3, the program determines the acceleration of the heart rate when a person is not engaged in training.  This is a very useful feature for people with heart disease. </p><p>  Also in the third generation of smart watches from Apple, as in the first model, there is a sensor that detects ambient light.  The memory capacity is 8 GB in both generations of devices.  The back panel of the device is made of composite. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  Before buying a smart watch, you should definitely consider the <span>review of the</span> <span>Apple</span> <span>Watch</span> <span>Series 3</span> .  This will assess the comfort of management and use of the new gadget.  To make the settings, you need a free hand.  In the new version, many functions allow you to configure the <span>virtual assistant</span> Siri.  However, the full configuration of all systems will have to be done manually by touching the buttons or display. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Watch Series 3 review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/2083055.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Users claim that the first setup and mastering of the basic functions can be completed in about an hour.  In this case, all functions are logical.  Set the necessary parameters is not difficult. </p><p>  Using the wheel, you can scroll up or down.  With it, you can zoom in or out on pictures, such as a photo, application screen, and more.  Pressing the wheel closes open programs, transfers the dials.  This button can double-click to open the previous application.  Other settings can be made by touching the display. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  <span>Apple</span> <span>Watch</span> <span>Series 3 (42 mm or 38 mm)</span> received the watchOS operating system.  In the presented model, it has already reached the 4th integration.  The presented operating system has not received global changes.  Some new dials have been added to it.  One of them is controlled by the Siri voice assistant. </p><p>  The developers have improved the capabilities of the music application, as well as the Workout program.  They got a new design.  Smart watches can be synchronized with exercise machines (including cardio). </p><p>  Cards stored in the device‚Äôs memory are distinguished by good details.  The Apple Maps app offers up-to-date routes.  If you set the direction of movement, the watch will warn you about a turn with a slight vibration. </p><p>  Almost all updates orient the user to sports.  Relevant applications monitor the health of the owner of a smart watch. </p><h2>  Integrated communication module </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the presented model has a built-in LTE module.  <span>Apple</span> <span>Watch</span> <span>Series 3,</span> as conceived by its creators, was supposed to be a standalone version that does not depend on the iPhone.  However, in our country such a function will not be available yet. </p><p>  In order to be able to use the cellular services using smart watches, they have a non-recoverable chip built in, which is a SIM card.  However, it is smaller.  It is called eSIM, it supports the same network number as the iPhone. </p><p>  According to forecasts, when the presented feature of <span>Apple</span> <span>Watch</span> <span>Series 3 in Russia</span> will be available, the cost of communication will be much higher than the usual level.  Using a smartwatch without an iPhone will still be impossible.  It will be required at least in order to activate eSIM. </p><h2>  Technical features </h2><p>  When describing the <span>Apple</span> <span>Watch</span> <span>Series 3 (42 mm)</span> , attention should be paid to some technical features.  In the third generation of smart watches of the presented brand, a barometric height meter has been added.  This will allow the device to determine whether its owner rises to a height (stairs, in the mountains, etc.).  This is a useful feature for snowboarding enthusiasts. </p><p>  Siri virtual assistant voice messages are made possible by the use of a new powerful processor.  It has 2 cores.  This is an S3 processor.  In normal use, the device is able to operate on a single charge for approximately 2 days.  If the device receives a large number of notifications, energy is consumed faster.  Charging will need to be done every day. </p><p>  Among the additional features that the new model received was the possibility of wireless charging using the AirPower station.  Connection is via Bluetooth 4.2 or Wi-Fi 2.4 Hz. </p><h2>  Design and cost </h2><p>  According to <span>reviews, the</span> <span>Apple</span> <span>Watch</span> <span>Series 3</span> has many different design options.  The cost of the new items is at least 25 thousand rubles.  For this price you can purchase a device with a 38 mm display.  Color can be black, silver or gold.  If the display is 42 mm, the price will increase by 2 thousand rubles. </p><p>  If the user wants to buy a new strap, a Velcro nylon product costs about 4 thousand rubles.  You can pick up any strap, depending on the mood, style of clothing. </p><p>  But the model of the first series has become somewhat cheaper.  It can be purchased at a price of about 18.5-19 thousand rubles.  Some models that have a built-in chip for cellular communications will not be sold in our country yet.  This category presents a wide variety of models that differ in a number of parameters and, accordingly, in price. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  <span>Reviews on the</span> <span>Apple</span> <span>Watch</span> <span>Series 3 are</span> mostly positive.  Despite the fact that the design of the third generation of smart watches has remained unchanged, they have many new interesting features.  Users highlight a number of programs that they liked the most. </p><p>  Watches actively set up a person to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  The tunes that the user listens to in everyday life can be transmitted to wireless headphones.  During training, this significantly increases the comfort of using the device. </p><p>  Since in our country the gadget will definitely have to be tied to a smartphone, using the clock you can control the settings on both devices.  For example, you can turn off the sound, get a call on your smartphone, and a notification on your watch, etc. </p><p>  The third generation model is much faster.  Moreover, the presented device consumes less electricity.  This is made possible through the use of wireless modules.  Users are satisfied with their purchase.  This is a high-quality, reliable and versatile device that will become a real helper in adjusting your lifestyle. </p><p>  Having considered the features of the <span>Apple</span> <span>Watch</span> <span>Series 3, reviews</span> about the presented device of buyers and experts, you can make the right decision on the feasibility of acquiring this model of smart watches.  Many useful features that have been added by the developer have simplified the use of the gadget, as well as expanded the user‚Äôs capabilities during operation. </p>
