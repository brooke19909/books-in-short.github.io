  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jumeirah hotels are prestigious luxury, as well as the rest in Jumeirah.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The resort area of <span>Jumeirah</span> is located along the coast in the second largest emirate of the state of the UAE.  In recent years, the popularity of the beach in the suburbs of Dubai has been steadily growing, Jumeirah has become one of the most prestigious holiday destinations with literally worldwide fame.  This even led to the creation of a kind of brand, and vacation in Jumeirah is strongly associated in the minds of many tourists with quality, comfort and special chic, that is, with elite relaxation. For example, in the seventies, after gaining independence, the authorities created the most favorable trade regime in this area. and the capital city of Dubai, having made a gigantic economic leap, from a small local settlement turned into a gigantic metropolis, built up with skyscrapers rushing upwards of the most exotic design.  The construction boom continues to this day and every year more and more new skyscrapers are commissioned.  For the most part, these buildings are home to fashionable Jumeirah hotels and shopping centers, the flow of customers to which, due to the extraordinary popularity of the resort, is increasing annually. </p><p>  The very expanse of the gulf, where excitement is extremely rare, and even that is small, literally beckons you to plunge into the blue waters of the sea, the temperature of which does not drop below 20 degrees Celsius.  This is one of the ideal places for practicing all possible types of water recreation - surfing, <span>water skiing</span> and riding a jet ski.  Sandy <span>gently sloping beach</span> with amazingly beautiful yellow sand is just a paradise for sunbathing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Numerous hotels in Jumeirah are focused on providing the highest level of service, and are overwhelmingly represented by deluxe class, which corresponds to the level of <span>4-5 stars.</span>  Most of the buildings in which they are located have their own unique look.  For example, the luxurious hotel ‚ÄúJUMEIRAH BEACH‚Äù (JUMEIRA BEACH) has the shape of a rising wave and is located next to the hotel building in the form of the sail BURJ AL ARAB ‚ÄúBURJ AL ARAB‚Äù.  And numerous reviews of Jumeirah hotels characterize JUMEYRA BEACH as the most suitable for families.  The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated in hi-tech style with elements of oriental luxury.  The view from the window to the open sea caresses the eye.  Literally a stone's throw away is the territory of the WILD WADI water park (Wild Wadi), where children, and adults too, are given a unique opportunity to swim along the "river" against the tide, tickle their nerves with a fast descent of the combined slides and even experience a real "storm", altitude waves in which reaches 2.5 meters.  Access to the water park for guests of this hotel is included in the price. </p><p>  The aforementioned BURJ AL ARAB is worthy of a separate mention. In terms of comfort, it is an order of magnitude higher even among local luxury hotels.  There are very few such complexes in the world and it draws to the highest category of 7 (seven) stars.  A vacation in such a hotel is already a significant event in itself, and if you add here your own beach and your own attractions from simple <span>water slides</span> to high-speed scooters, the presence of several pools besides the coast, and apartments in several rooms, it becomes clear why enthusiastic reviews about Jumeirah's hotels speak of him as a "paradise on earth" ... </p><p>  An interesting feature that distinguishes Jumeirah hotels is that in most cases at other resorts the "star" of hotels is often exaggerated, but here it happens the other way around.  Hotel REGENT BEACH RESORT, for example, is classified as a 3-star, but according to the level of service it is quite ‚Äúpulling‚Äù by four stars.  The category of three stars is assigned to him only by the fact that he does not have his own beach.  But <span>this is offset by the</span> fact that the general is literally across the road. </p><p>  In general, it can be noted that Jumeirah hotels are in full compliance with the prestige level of the resort itself and the service in them is truly at the level of world standards. </p>
