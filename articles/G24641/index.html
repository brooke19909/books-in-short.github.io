Therefore, when choosing a hotel, tourists are guided by the amenities, the comfort of the rooms and the availability of a free transfer to the coast.  And how then not to remember about network hotels?  After all, they have the same level of service, regardless of where the representative office is located - in Dusseldorf, Kiev or Dubai. </p><p>  The Marriott Network is well established.  It is also popular with wealthy tourists.  In cities, its hotels are located in the center, and in resorts - in excellent green areas.  In this article we will consider the hotel Dubai Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 * in the city of Dubai (UAE).  In our description of rooms and infrastructure, we took into account the reviews of tourists who have recently visited this hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="marriott-hotel-al-jaddaf-dubai.hotels-in-dubai.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 * (Dubai)" class="if uuid-3235165" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3235165.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  This Marriott office is located far from the sea, in the Al Jaddaf area, as the name implies.  The first guests (the Dubai Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 * opened in 2014) complained that there was nothing outside - no shops, no cafes.  But Dubai is a rapidly developing metropolis.  Nearby lay the city‚Äôs largest motorway, Sheikh Zayed Road.  A lot of public transport runs along this traffic intersection, so taxis are no longer the only way to travel around the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the Marriott representative office in Dubai, there are such iconic sights as the Burj Khalifa Tower, Sheikh Zabila Residence, Golden Souk Market and Dubai Mall.  Tourists claim that the city center is a 10-minute drive away.  Dubai Airport from the hotel is only 8 kilometers, therefore, with a collective transfer, they are brought here one of the first.  The exact address of Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 * is Bur Dubai, Oud Metha Road.  A five minute drive away is the International Financial Center.  Therefore, businessmen of high rank often stay at the hotel. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="25.2113187" data-lng="55.31551300000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/8/6/6/17866.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Since the Marriott office is located almost in the center of the metropolis, surrounded by urban development, it does not have its own territory.  All infrastructure is concentrated in a wide and impressive eight-story building.  Parking in the basement, a rooftop pool - this is how you can briefly describe the territory of the hotel.  But guests do not blame for the lack of a park and spacious green lawns.  A charming panorama of the Bourj Khalifa skyscraper opens from the pool terrace. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In a wide building, 4 elevators work to prevent lines.  On different floors there are restaurants, bars, a spa, gym and beauty salon.  Tourists mention that the specific needs of people with disabilities are taken into account in the new building: there are ramps and wide doors for strollers.  And 11 rooms from the hotel rooms are reserved to accommodate such guests.  But in the Dubai Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 * pets are not allowed, which tourists consider a disadvantage.  In addition, a deposit is required upon check-in, which for some reason depends on the length of stay in the hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 * (Dubai, United Arab Emirates)" class="if uuid-3235313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3235313.jpg"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has 351 rooms for guests.  The rooms are divided into categories.  The cheapest is considered a guest room.  They have no balconies, but there is a wide king size bed.  We'll talk about filling numbers a bit later.  Standards at the hotel are called Dubai Skyline View.  They are also without balconies, but are located on the upper floors of the building, so they offer a wonderful view. </p><p>  Most rooms are deluxe.  Their area is 40 square meters, there are small balconies.  Guests of the executive rooms, in addition to the additional amenities in the room, enjoy the privileges of club members.  They can visit the living room, where breakfast is served for them, and in the evenings they are served snacks, tea and coffee.  Executive Suite consists of two rooms.  Guests are also owners of a club card.  The pride of the hotel is its suites.  They bear their own names: ‚ÄúPresidential,‚Äù ‚ÄúSheikh Scored,‚Äù and so on.  These rooms are full of oriental luxury and high-tech appliances. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 * - Nrmera" class="if uuid-3235163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3235163.jpg"></div><h2>  What is in the rooms of Dubai Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 * (Dubai, United Arab Emirates) </h2><p>  Even in the budget room the guest room has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Air conditioning will leave 40-degree summer heat outside the window, and a flat-screen cable TV will fill the evening.  Tourists claim that the room has a jack for connecting a laptop to wired Internet.  In the bathroom, guests will find a hairdryer and daily replenishing toiletries.  The bedroom has a safe (free use), as well as a mini fridge. </p><p>  Tourists noted such pleasant things as an ironing board with an iron and a tea set.  Every day, maids put two bottles of drinking water.  The standards have approximately the same set of services.  But upon request, slippers and bathrobes will be delivered to your room for free.  This service is necessarily present in rooms of a higher category.  The suites feature free Wi-Fi.  Cleaning is done daily, and bed linen is changed every other day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="marriott-hotel-al-jaddaf-dubai.hotels-in-dubai.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 * - Bur Dubai" class="if uuid-3235164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3235164.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Most Russian tourists vacationing in Dubai at the Dubai Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 * paid for breakfast only.  But if you study all the reviews, it becomes clear that the hotel can be booked full or half board.  Moreover, with the last option there is the opportunity to choose between lunch and dinner.  The morning meal for guests of the rooms of the lower price segment is served in the main restaurant ‚ÄúThe Market Place‚Äù.  VIP guests from the suites have breakfast in the club lounge. </p><p>  The main restaurant opens its doors to first visitors at 6:30.  You can have dinner there until 11 pm.  All meals in this restaurant are buffet style.  But there is another restaurant in the hotel building - the Scotts-American Grill, which serves an √† la carte menu.  From the morning (until midnight), the Aqua Chill bar is open by the pool (on the roof).  In it you can order not only cocktails, soft drinks and snacks, but also a hookah.  On one of the floors of the hotel building there is an evening (17:00 - 2:00) Shanghai bar. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marriott.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 * (United Arab Emirates)" class="if uuid-3235166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3235166.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach and Pool </h2><p>  Dubai Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 * is located far from the sea.  Therefore, for his guests, he provides a free shuttle service to two public beaches - Kite and Jumeirah.  Bus schedules vary depending on the season.  It must be recognized at the reception.  Registering for boarding a bus is not required.  Tourists say that it‚Äôs longer to go to Jumeirah beach, 20 kilometers, but the conditions are better there. </p><p>  Travelers recommend taking towels from home.  Since both Jumeirah and Kite are public beaches, sunbeds and umbrellas are paid there.  Unlike those that surround the hotel rooftop pool.  This freshwater tank is small but spotlessly clean.  Only winter tourists call it.  After all, the water in the pool is unheated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marriott.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Dubai Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 * - pool" class="if uuid-3235309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3235309.jpg"></div><h2>  Services </h2><p>  Dubai Marriott Hotel Al Jaddaf 5 *, in addition to transfer to the beach, provides free trips to the Dubai Mall and to the nearest metro station.
