  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smolensk: attractions, interesting places, excursions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Smolensk is an ancient Russian city, the first mention of which in the "Tale of Bygone Years" dates from 862.  Then he was listed as the Principality of Krivichi.  Since 1513, the city became part of the Moscow principality.  Today, Smolensk is endowed with the status of a hero city, and is also awarded the Order of the Patriotic War and the Order of Lenin.  Today we will get acquainted with the sights of Smolensk. </p><h2>  Garden Blonie </h2><p>  One of the historical attractions of Smolensk is <span>Blonie Garden.</span>  It was laid on the site of the old parade ground.  The official opening of the garden took place in the first half of the 19th century.  The park gained fame in 1885, when a monument to the famous Russian composer M. I. Glinka was erected on its territory.  After the end of the Second World War, a statue of a deer, brought from Germany as a trophy, also appeared in the garden.  In the late 1970s, speakers were installed near the <span>Glinka Monument</span> , of which his compositions play. </p><p>  The new history of the park, according to many local residents, is rather sad - because of the forged gratings installed in 2009, the historical appearance of the attraction has changed.  In addition, in 2011-2012, there was a massive felling of trees aged 100 to 170 years.  However, many of them were in excellent condition.  Nevertheless, this garden is still remembered, talking about interesting places in Smolensk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitsmolensk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blonie Garden in Smolensk" class="if uuid-2278959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2278959.jpg"></div><h2>  WWII Museum </h2><p>  The Museum of the Great Patriotic War in Smolensk is one of the most visited museums.  It is interesting for both the older generation and youth.  It presents genuine photographs and documents of the first months of the Second World War, the period of the occupation of Smolensk, the partisan movement and the underground, the liberation of the city, as well as the participation of local residents in the liberation of Eastern Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Here you can see unique samples of weapons of those times, orders, personal belongings of soldiers fighting for Smolensk, Yelnya and Vyazma, clothes and awards of the French pilots of the Normandie-Niemen regiment, combat banners, trophies and much more. </p><h2>  Monument to Fedor Kon </h2><p>  The Russian architect Fedor Savelyevich Kon was the creator of one of the main attractions of Smolensk - the fortress wall.  The monument in his honor was built in 1991 near the Thunder Tower - the first of the restored towers of the wall.  The architect A.K. Anipko and sculptor O.N. Komov worked on the creation of this monument. </p><p>  Fedor Savelievich became famous not only due to the construction of Smolensk fortifications, which took place from 1596 to 1602.  It was he who designed the stone walls and the tower of the Moscow "White City", built in 1585-1593 and demolished in the 18th century.  And these are only the most outstanding works of the architect. </p><h2>  Church of Michael the Archangel </h2><p>  The stone tower-shaped church of Michael the Archangel was built in the distant 12th century.  Until the first half of the twentieth century, it contained the tomb of Prince David, who founded the temple.  There was a time when a monastery was operating at the church. </p><p>  In 1611, the Orthodox parish was replaced by a Catholic one.  At the beginning of the XVIII century, everything returned to its place.  The last major restoration of the temple took place in 1963.  Restorers changed some details of the 19th century to architectural forms of the period when the church was built in its original form. </p><h2>  Fortress wall </h2><p>  The Smolensk fortress wall, which is also called the Kremlin or the fortress, is a defensive structure built during the reign of Fedor Ioannovich and Boris Godunov.  Today it is a valuable architectural monument of the turn of the 16-17th centuries and an outstanding landmark of the city.  The length of the wall is 6.5 kilometers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": Igor Baidov, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smolensk fortress wall" class="if uuid-2278982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2278982.jpg"></div><p>  <span>The Smolensk fortress wall</span> was more powerful and higher than similar buildings in other cities.  It had three tiers of battle, while two tiers were considered the standard.  In addition, she had a large number of towers, each of which was different from the others.  Unfortunately, only 18 of 38 towers have survived to the present day, the rest were destroyed during the attacks on the city. </p><h2>  Cathedral Mountain </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of Smolensk is the Cathedral Mountain, which largely determines the silhouette of the city.  It is noteworthy that it is not the highest part of Smolensk, but only the lateral top of the hill on which the Old Town is located.  However, the Assumption Cathedral, built on this hill, as well as the buildings adjacent to it, are visible from almost any corner of the city. </p><p>  A staircase, which was built in 1767, leads to the entrance to the Assumption Cathedral.  The architectural ensemble of the church includes belfries, designed in the same style of the Epiphany Cathedral and fences.  Next to this complex is the Bishop‚Äôs Palace and the Church of St. John the Baptist. </p><p>  The Cathedral Mountain offers excellent views of the entire center and the main attractions of the city. </p><h2>  Exhibition Complex "Smolensk Fortress" </h2><p>  This institution is located in the Pyatnitskaya tower of the fortress wall and is a museum of Russian vodka, which is adjacent to the theme club-restaurant.  It was organized by the leading local producer of alcoholic beverages, the Bacchus company.  The exposition of the museum has incorporated the main stages of the formation and prosperity of distillery in Russia.  The most valuable exhibits are bottles of drinks produced at the Machulsky factory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The Forge </h2><p>  The small but interesting museum ‚ÄúForge‚Äù is located in the oldest civil building of the city, preserved from the time of Peter the Great.  Presumably, the building was erected at the turn of the 17-18 centuries. </p><p>  In the years when Smolensk was part of the Commonwealth, the brick house served as the city archive.  Since 1785, it began to be used as a forge of the Engineering House, which was later destroyed.  Today, a tiny building is hiding behind the houses of one of the relatively modern city blocks.  In 1982, a blacksmith craft museum was opened here.  Its composition includes numerous blacksmithing tools from different times.  Here you can see the old anvil, furs and all kinds of metal products created by talented blacksmiths from the 18th to the 19th century. </p><h2>  Historical Museum </h2><div class="photo" data-original="smolensk.glavny.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History Museum of Smolensk" class="if uuid-2278988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2278988.jpg"></div><p>  Talking about what to see in Smolensk, one cannot but mention the historical museum.  The history of this institution began in 1888.  Then, in the building of the City Council, a historical and archaeological museum was opened.  Over time, the exposure expanded.  Until now, it has not become permanent - the institution presents its guests long-term exhibitions.  The building of the Smolensk Historical Museum is also of interest.  The three-story brick building was erected at the end of the 19th century in the style of classicism.  Initially, it was used as a residential building with shops.  During the reconstruction of the building, and its adaptation to the museum, the interior interiors were changed.  Today the building is considered one of the architectural monuments of Smolensk. </p><h2>  Heroes Square </h2><p>  Excursions in Smolensk often begin with this attraction, as it is located in the very center of the city.  Here, near the fortress wall, there are people who sacrificed their lives defending the Fatherland.  The ennobling of the square was started in 1911, and the first burial place in this place appeared on October 18, 1943.  The first to be buried was Colonel Vladimir Stolyarov, head of the political department of the 21st Army.  In total, 39 people who died during the Second World War are buried in the park.  Heroes Memory Square is one of two such memorials in Russia.  The second is located in Moscow, on Red Square. </p><h2>  Monument to the Sofia regiment </h2><p>  On the Royal Bastion, not far from the Spartak Stadium, there is a monument to the Sofia regiment, created by local artist Boris Tsapenko.  The opening of the attraction was dedicated to the centenary of the city‚Äôs defense and took place in August 1912.  Rumor has it that a few weeks later Nicholas II visited the city, but did not approach the monument, expressing dissatisfaction with the discipline of the regiment in whose honor he was erected. </p><p>  The place for the monument was chosen for a reason.  It was at the Royal Bastion that the soldiers of the Sofia regiment were buried, who fell during the defense of the city in a terrible battle on August 4-5, 1812. </p><p>  The monument is a tetrahedral obelisk mounted on a pedestal, on top of which there is a figure of an eagle spreading its wings.  The lower part of the pedestal consists of six half-columns with rectangular niches.  Initially, in these niches it was supposed to place bronze tablets with inscriptions on the history of the famous regiment.  However, during the Second World War they were destroyed and restored only in our days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="panevin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the Sofia regiment in Smolensk" class="if uuid-2278991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2278991.jpg"></div><h2>  Lakeside </h2><p>  Those who are wondering what to see in Smolensk, but still not get tired of the bustle of the city, should pay attention to this attraction.  Smolensk Lake District is called a national park, which was created to study and preserve the unique fauna and flora of the region.  Due to its biological diversity and archaeological significance, the park is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><p>  A significant part of the territory is occupied by water bodies, among which there are 35 glacial lakes surrounded by virgin forests.  65 species of plants grow in the park, many of which are listed in the Red Book.  Among the representatives of the animal world here are represented: 57 species of mammals, more than 200 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians, and 5 species of reptiles.  In addition, the park has more than 70 archaeological sites.  Some of them were created in the 9th century. </p><h2>  Train Station </h2><p>  Today, Smolensk is a major railway junction.  Direct railway connections connect it with both capitals of the Russian Federation, Minsk, Riga, Warsaw, Voronezh, Berlin and many other large cities.  Arriving here by train, it is recommended not to rush to get into the city, but to start getting to know him from the Smolensk Central station and the station building. </p><p>  The first railway connection through the city was opened in 1868.  It connected the Eagle and Riga.  Two years later, traffic was opened in the direction of Smolensk-Moscow, which a year later was extended to Brest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="periskop.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Station &quot;Smolensk Central&quot;" class="if uuid-2278996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2278996.jpg"></div><p>  The first station building was erected at the end of the 19th century.  It was destroyed in 1941, after a raid on the city of fascist aviation.  In the period from 1949 to 1951, according to the project of S. B. Mezentsev and M. A. Shpotov, a railway station was built, which welcomes city guests to this day.  It is an excellent example of the Stalinist empire and is a majestic beautiful building with a rich set of decorative elements.  In 2005, the building was restored.  After the reconstruction, it became not only more magnificent, but also more comfortable for passengers. </p><h2>  Ascension Monastery </h2><p>  In 1515, on the initiative of Tsar Basil the Third, the Ascension Monastery was founded in Smolensk.  In accordance with the architectural traditions of the time, it was built of wood.  During the years of Polish intervention in the monastery was a Jesuit monastery.  After the liberation of Smolensk, she again became Orthodox. </p><p>  In 1693-1700, the first stone temple was built on the territory of the monastery.  The design of the Ascension Cathedral was entrusted to the Moscow architect Osip Startsev.  The construction process was led by another, no less eminent architect from the capital - Danila Kalinin.  A rich carved iconostasis made in the Baroque style was used to decorate the cathedral.  In 1787, a small Catherine‚Äôs church was added to the cathedral, and in 1830 the Akhtyr Gate Church was erected. </p><p>  Today, monastery buildings, in addition to its direct function, play the role of a museum.  Various exhibitions are often held here. </p><h2>  Monument to the defenders of Smolensk in 1812 </h2><p>  The monument is located on the main avenue of the local park of culture and rest.  The second name of this park is ‚ÄúLopatinsky Garden‚Äù.  The grand opening of the monument, created by the famous architect Antonio Adamini, took place in 1841.  On the basement of the monument is the image of the Smolensk battle and commemorative inscriptions associated with it.  On one of the sides is a list with the <span>icon of the Smolensk Mother of God of Hodegetria.</span>  It is a copy created in 1818 at the request of the company commander of the gunners who guarded the miraculous image during the Battle of Borodino. </p><div class="photo" data-original="own-way.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the defenders of Smolensk in 1812" class="if uuid-2279075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2279075.jpg"></div><p>  A cast-iron monument weighing 30 tons and 26 meters long was cast in St. Petersburg.  In 1873, two French cannons were installed on cast fire carriages on both sides of the monument, which were accidentally found by excavators during the preparation of the foundation of the male gymnasium. </p><p>  Other historical sights are located in the Lopatinsky garden, in particular the remains of the royal bastion, the monument to the Sofia regiment mentioned above, a section of the fortress wall also mentioned, the Lithuanian rampart and the monument to General Skalon. </p><h2>  Monument to A. Twardowski and V. Terkin </h2><p>  This monument is located in the city center, on Victory Square.  The talented local sculptor A. Sergeev captured the front-line poet Twardowski and the cheerful soldier Terkin sung by him for a friendly conversation.  The monument is about 5 meters high and is cast from bronze.  It was officially opened in 1995.  This is the only monument in Russia that depicts the writer along with a fictional hero. </p><h2>  Griboedov Theater </h2><p>  In 1780, the first secular theater was built in Smolensk.  Its discovery was timed to coincide with the arrival of Catherine the Second in the company of the Austrian Emperor Joseph II.  With the beginning of the Second World War, the institution became the first "Theater of the Western Front."  In 1991, P. D. Shumeyko became the main director of the theater, and the institution itself was renamed the "Experimental Drama Theater."  Over time, small scenes were opened in the building, an orchestra and a ballet group were created.  The repertoire of the theater was constantly expanding. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smolensk-i.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smolensk State Drama Theater named after A.S. Griboedova" class="if uuid-2279079" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27428/2279079.jpg"></div><p>  In 1999, P.D. Shumeyko died, and I.G. Voitulevich received his post.  After his arrival, the theater was secretly called intellectual.  In 2004, the official name was changed to Smolensk State Drama Theater named after A. S. Griboedov. </p><p>  Today, the institution is a regular participant in theater festivals and offers its visitors a diverse repertoire. </p><h2>  Sights of Smolensk region </h2><p>  Excursions around Smolensk are fascinating, but there are several interesting places outside the city: </p><ul><li>  <em>"Teremok".</em>  This is the name of the historical and architectural complex, which is located in the village of Flenovo (formerly Talashkino).  Two expositions work for visitors, with the help of which you can get acquainted with the history of local workshops and educational activities of Maria Tanysheva - the former owner of the village. </li><li>  <em>Vyazemsky Museum of Local Lore.</em>  In the chapel of the Bogoroditsky temple of the town of Vyazma, the Museum of Local History is located.  There are exhibits that illuminate the life of the area from ancient times to the mid-twentieth century.  Today, the museum stores about a thousand exhibits. </li><li>  <em>Gnezdovo mounds.</em>  They are an archaeological reserve, which is located near the village of Gnezdovo.  Today it is one of the main archaeological sites in all of Russia.  The complex was opened in 1867 during the construction of the Moscow-Warsaw railway line.  Researchers agree that the settlement found here was built at the beginning of the tenth century. </li></ul>
