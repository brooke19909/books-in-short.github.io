Due to linguistic features, the name was somewhat modified.

    <p>  The currency of the Maldives was officially put into circulation at the end of the winter of 1966, replacing the British pounds. </p><h2>  Face value </h2><p>  Today, in the <span>Republic of Maldives,</span> all monetary and financial issues are resolved by the national bank, which introduced paper money denominations on the islands of denominations of five, ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred, five hundred and a thousand Maldives. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the currency in the maldives" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/1706108.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are also metal coins in denominations of one and two rufii. </p><h2>  The appearance of the Maldivian currency </h2><p>  Absolutely all banknotes on the islands have the image of a sailing brig, which symbolizes the huge role of the sea for the state and population.  On paper notes of small denomination scenes from the life of the common population of the country, the way of life of people and fishing are depicted.  Banknotes of higher denomination depict architectural monuments of the islands and elements of modern architecture of the state. </p><p>  An interesting feature of Maldivian rufia is that it is still printed by the royal printing houses of Great Britain, where it was originally printed.  By the way, the British pound is also issued there. </p>

    <p>  Unlike paper notes, metal coins of the islands have a much more diverse appearance.  The smallest coin in denominations of 1 laari is made of aluminum, has the shape of a circle familiar to a European person.  Larger coins in denominations of five and ten laari are made of the same material, but have a slightly different shape, which is more reminiscent of the shape of a flower.  Coins of twenty-five, fifty laari and one ruffia, having a rounded shape, are made of an alloy of bronze, copper and nickel.  The coin in denomination two rufii is made of a copper-zinc alloy in the form of a square with rounded corners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The coins show the face value and name of the country on the front side, and the state symbols on the back: palm tree, sailing vessel, fish and turtle, coat of arms and mollusk shell, as well as the president‚Äôs palace in the capital. </p><h2>  Maldives.  Exchange rate and exchange </h2><p>  Maldivian rufia is a relatively inexpensive currency, its rate is approximately $ 0.067, that is, about $ 15 in Malaysian rupees at $ 1.  One British pound contains about twenty rufii.  These courses are approximate, as they change daily. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the above monetary units, it is quite easy to exchange Russian rubles on the islands. </p><h2>  Maldives.  Currency.  The course to the ruble </h2><p>  The islands today are very popular among Russian tourists, so travel agencies, banks and other service organizations have long adapted to our tourists.  Rufiya is a currency (Maldives), to the ruble its rate fluctuates at the level of 3-4 rubles.  Today, one Maldivian rufiya contains approximately 0.27 Russian rubles, that is, a little more than three and a half rubles in one rufia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Maldives currency to ruble" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/1706110.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As mentioned above, there are no problems with the exchange of the Russian ruble to the Maldivian currency.  Due to the large flow of Russian tourists to the islands, all financial institutions and exchange offices are happy to work with the currency of the Russian Federation.  Some problems can arise only if you decide to exchange your money not in the capital, Male.  On other islands, rubles also change, but at an overvalued rate and not everywhere, so it is better to take care of acquiring local currency in advance. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Before any trip abroad, it is better to find out in advance which currency is in the destination country, because this is one of the key points.  It is also worthwhile to find out in advance about the situation with the currency exchange, and which is better to take with you.  Not everywhere it will be profitable and convenient to come with the Russian ruble, it is better to bring dollars or other currency to some countries. </p><p>  Traveling to the Maldives for a Russian tourist is attractive not only for its climate, the azure ocean and sandy beaches, but also because here you can easily exchange rubles at a fairly favorable rate, so there is no reason to worry about it. </p>
