Relatives, friends and acquaintances cannot always help.  One way out is to apply for a loan in the Maniveo service.  What conditions does he offer his customers?  Is the service fraudulent?  To answer these questions, let's look at what ‚ÄúManiveo‚Äù is and what kind of feedback users leave about it. </p><h2>  Acquaintance with the service </h2><p>  Maniveo: Emergency Financial Aid Limited Liability Company is a company that provides loans to Ukrainian citizens.  It has a special online service where you can fill out applications for cash.  The Internet resource allows you to get a loan at any time - day and night, and on weekdays, and on holidays, and on weekends.  To do this, you only need to fill out an application on the Internet by filling out a special form and indicating the bank card number. </p><p>  New customers who decide to use the loan for the first time can be issued a maximum of 3.5 thousand hryvnia.  The online service provides loans to regular users up to 15 thousand hryvnias.  However, not all new and old customers receive approval of the application.  For some users, the online service fails.  If you receive a negative decision, you should not be upset, because the application can be submitted after a while.  It is possible that a second decision will be different. </p>

    <h2>  Service benefits </h2><p>  The Maniveo company states that it has several important advantages that distinguish it from other microfinance organizations.  These include: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Service work all day and night.

Such a quick service is possible thanks to the developed automated application processing system. </li><li>  Issuance of loans with a low interest rate.  The company strives to be loyal to new customers.  She gives <span>loans with a low interest rate to</span> those people who first decided to use the services of an online service.  The company says that for the first loan the interest rate is only 0.01% per day. </li><li>  Providing discounts and bonuses.  The company regularly holds various promotions in which any client can take part. </li><li>  The possibility of prolonging a loan.  Every person in life can experience events due to which he will not be able to fully repay his debt.  In such situations, the company "Maniveo" offers to use the extension.  The essence of this procedure is to extend the period and pay only the accrued interest. </li></ol><h2>  What do you need to get a loan? </h2><p>  Not all people can take out a loan at Maniveo.  It is necessary to meet several conditions that are established by the microfinance organization.  Firstly, a loan can be issued only to adults.  Minors who are under the age of 18 are not entitled to send an application. </p><p>  Secondly, you need to have a passport and TIN.  Information from these documents will need to be entered in a special form when applying for a loan.  Be sure to need a bank card.  If the decision is positive, money will be credited to it within a few minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thirdly, you must have a phone and email.  The number and address will also need to be entered in the corresponding fields of the online application.  The company‚Äôs telephone and e-mail address is required for the company to notify of the decision made, to remind it of the need to make the next payment, and the delay. </p>

    <h2>  Loan Procedure </h2><p>  To obtain a loan at Maniveo, you must first determine the amount and term.  It is very easy to do this, because on the main page of the microfinance organization there is an online calculator.  If you specify the required amount and the most suitable period, the amount that will need to be returned will be calculated.  If the final result is inappropriate, then you can change the amount and term.  In this way, the most suitable loan conditions are selected. </p><p>  After specifying the amount and term on the main page, you will need to click the "Get a loan" button.  From the online calculator, you will be redirected to the page where the online application form for filling out will be presented.  Each new user here indicates his last name, first name, middle name, passport details, TIN and bank card numbers, and some social information.  After filling out the form, the application is sent and awaiting a decision. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Providing a photograph with a passport in hand </h2><p>  The procedure for obtaining a loan at Maniveo includes providing photographs with a passport in hand.  This is necessary in order for the company to be able to find out if the documents are available from scammers who want to apply for a loan to another person, and to receive money instead. </p><p>  Before taking a photo, you still need to know the passphrase.  She will need to be written on a piece of paper and photographed with her and her passport.  The code word is announced in advance by a support specialist. </p><h2>  Card Verification Procedure </h2><p>  Filling out an application is not the only step in the procedure for obtaining a loan, as evidenced by the reviews on the loan "Maniveo".  To transfer money, verification of the card is carried out.  The essence of this procedure is to block on the card a small amount not exceeding 1 hryvnia.  To prove that the card does not belong to an outsider, you will need to indicate the blocked amount on the microfinance organization's website.  The combination of numbers will be a verification code. </p><p>  Finding out the amount of the blocked amount is very simple.  There are several ways: </p><ul><li>  call the bank hotline number; </li><li>  use online banking; </li><li>  look in the SMS message (if the alert service is connected). </li></ul>

    <h2>  Receiving the money </h2><p>  On the procedure for verifying a bank card, a loan is completed.  After entering the verification code, you will only have to wait for a decision on the submitted application.  In case of refusal, customer information is stored in your account.  After some time, it will be possible to resend the application for consideration. </p><p>  With a positive decision, customers are invited to familiarize themselves with the terms of the contract.  You can read them either in your personal account or in an email sent to the specified mail address.  When accepting the terms of the contract, the money is immediately transferred to a bank card.  In some cases, slight delays occur.  They have nothing to do with the operation of the online service.  The reason for the delays is the regulation of the bank in which the card was opened. </p>

    <h2>  Loan repayment </h2><p>  Maniveo company disburses cash for a period of 1 day to 30 days.  At the end of the term, it is required to pay the entire amount taken with accrued interest.  If you have money, you can repay a loan at Maniveo in several ways: </p><ol><li>  With a bank card.  You can choose this payment method in your account.  Money is deducted from the balance sheet.  The corresponding notification of the financial transaction is received by phone and email address. </li><li>  Through the Privat24 application.  To pay, you must enter Internet banking. </li><li>  Through payment terminals belonging to the networks of PrivatBank, EasyPay, City 24, etc. </li><li>  With a bank transfer made from any branch of a Ukrainian bank.  But it‚Äôs best to contact PrivatBank.  He greatly simplified the procedure for accepting payments. </li></ol><h2>  Delay and consequences of non-payment </h2><p>  Delay in payment entails negative consequences for the client.  Here's what happens if you don‚Äôt pay Maniveo: </p><ul><li>  firstly, the interest rate on the loan will increase to 3% per day; </li><li>  secondly, the credit history will deteriorate (in the future, due to overdue loans and loans will be refused); </li><li>  thirdly, the collection process will begin (the company constantly calls the number indicated by the client; if the client ignores the requirements put forward, then the right to collect debts is transferred to third parties). </li></ul>

    <h2>  Partial repayment, extension, restructuring </h2><p>  If you can‚Äôt repay the loan, but you want to avoid negative consequences, it is recommended to use the prolongation on the Maniveo service.  For its execution, one important condition must be met - the interest calculated at the time of depositing funds must be paid. </p><p>  The extension of the loan taken, as evidenced by the reviews of "Maniveo", is made out in your personal account.  Also, this service is available in branches of "PrivatBank", self-service terminals.  When rolling through third-party services, the loan is automatically extended for 30 days.  But in the personal account, the duration of the period can be determined by the user - from 1 to 30 days. </p><p>  When the delay occurs, the online service offers users to take advantage of the restructuring.  Maniveo splits the existing debt into small amounts, each of which the client needs to pay on time. </p><h2>  Grace period at Maniveo </h2><p>  For people who find themselves in a difficult financial situation and unable to repay the loan on time, Maniveo offers another opportunity (in addition to prolongation).  This is a grace period.  This term refers to the additional time provided to the borrower in case of non-return of money within the specified period.  In Maniveo, this period is 3 days.  If you have time to pay the debt during this period, then interest on arrears will not be charged. </p><p>  You can not use the grace period to increase the loan term.  A three-day period is still considered a delay in Maniveo, although interest is not charged for it.  Information about the grace period is transmitted to the credit bureau.  In the future, this may affect decisions on the issuance of new loans both at Maniveo and other microfinance organizations and banks. </p>

    <h2>  Positive feedback about Maniveo </h2><p>  Some of the reviews left by customers about the company contain positive opinions and ratings.  Users note the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  loan availability; </li><li>  speed of execution; </li><li>  lack of serious requirements for documents. </li></ul><p>  For some people, a very important advantage is the quick review of the application in automatic mode and the transfer of money.  This distinguishes Maniveo from other similar organizations, in which the duration of the transfer of funds can drag on for several hours or days. </p><p>  Positive feedback about Maniveo is also left by those customers who like existing programs.  For example, the company has a loyalty program.  Its essence is to reduce the interest rate for users who become regular customers.  There is also a program ‚ÄúInvolve a friend‚Äù.  For each person who decides to use the service on the recommendation, cash bonuses are awarded. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews about "Maniveo" </h2><p>  There are negative opinions about the company.  Dissatisfied customers complain about high interest rates.  Tight penalties are especially scary.  Loan arrears lead to a significant increase in the total amount payable.  Some users also complain that after a delay they paid a loan, but after some time they again began to receive messages about the need to make payments.  Customers were later informed that their debt had been sold to another company.  No calls to Maniveo made it possible to clarify the situation.  They managed to get rid of calls, threats and extortion only after contacting the police and prosecutors. </p><p>  In conclusion, it is worth noting that the decision to take a loan at Maniveo is a rather responsible step.  Before contacting this company, it is recommended to think carefully about whether it will turn out to repay the debt.  If there are or are expected serious financial difficulties, it is best not to take a loan. </p>
