    <p>  The leading sector of the economy of Corfu is the tourism business.  British travel companies have launched a large construction project on its northeast coast: soon there will be impressive rich holiday villas. </p><p>  In fact, the entire coast of the island is built up with hotels.  Tourists are very fond of visiting the town of Kavos, located in its southeastern part.  It is focused on youth recreation.  Paleokastritsa, located in the northwest, and Perama, built a couple of kilometers south of the capital, are also popular with visitors.  It is from Perama that one of the most famous views of the coastal zone opens - the islet of Pontikonisi and the Blachernae Monastery. </p><p>  Both Orthodox and Catholics love to make pilgrimages to Corfu: the relics of the blessed Theodora and Spyridon of Trimyphuntos, the apostles of Sosipater and Jason are stored in the temples of the island.  Easter is celebrated on the island with exceptional grandeur: religious processions, grand parades of orchestras, nightly pyrotechnic performances and so on are organized. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Island Attractions </h2><p>  The amazing landscape of Corfu is diverse and consists of mountains and plains, secluded bays and long beaches, monuments of ancient and modern architecture. </p><p>  At the entrance to the Adriatic on this island, East and West intersect.  In general, Corfu has always been given increased attention.  The Romans and Normans trampled its lands, the French and Venetians, the Russians and Goths, the Turks and the British - all of them influenced the creation of the island's cultural traditions. </p><p>  It rarely rains in Corfu in the summer - the Mediterranean climate dominates here.  The best time to relax is March-June or September-October.  The capital of the island is the city of Corfu of the same name.  The unique beauty is given to it by magnificent architectural details in its difference, the remains of several cultures, combined into one work of art.  The old city is called the most impressive medieval monument of Greece, therefore it is protected by the state.  The streets are randomly located.  You can only walk along picturesque narrow lanes: they all lead to Byzantine churches, monuments, stone-clad springs and Venetian stairs. </p>

    <p>  Corfu was called the city of two fortresses.  And indeed: on one side is the Sea or Old Fortress.  It was built and fortified by the Venetians in 1546.  At the Old Port on the opposite side is the New or Coastal Fortress.  It was built around 1588 to protect the settlement from Turkish raids. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Along the medieval wall stretches the sea promenade of Murai with lanterns.

    <h2>  Local kitchen </h2><p>  Upscale restaurants, traditional taverns, bars, and fish restaurants called dog houses are located in and around the city.  Here, tourists are served unique Kerkerian and international dishes.  The traditional dishes are Cocoras Krasatos - a cock soaked in wine, and Stifado - a rabbit stewed with onions.  On this beautiful island you can taste products that you will not find anywhere else in Greece, such as kumquat, as well as liquors made from it, liquors, jams and preserves, tsitsibira (ginger beer), madoles and madolata (nougat), sycomaida (dried pie figs). </p><h2>  Easter in Corfu </h2><p>  All believers on Easter days strive to get to Corfu.  After all, such a celebration, as on this island, you will not meet anywhere in Greece on Easter.  The most desirable moment is considered the morning of Great Saturday, when a lot of people gather on Spinada Square.  They all want to admire the famous show: from the windows onto the pavement they drop a botidon painted with good wishes (clay jugs with narrow handles and a nose).  Many people believe that if you pick up and keep the shard, it will bring good luck.  The holiday is accompanied by a game of numerous orchestras and philharmonic.  Musicians at Easter perform the works of great composers. </p><p>  By the way, Corfu is called the house of kings, aristocracy, pop stars and screen.  This island is preferred by representatives of <span>blue bloods</span> and royalty.  Every year the princess and first lady of Morocco come here to relax.  She is accompanied by royal escorts, sheikhs and emirs of Qatar, outstanding singers, actors, musicians and athletes. </p><p>  So, pay attention to the hotels of Corfu.  The prices here are quite reasonable and will appeal to any tourist.  For example, staying in a double room of the Primasol Louis Ionian Sun 4 * hotel for three days will cost you only $ 460.  In general, in Corfu, everyone will be able to find a place to relax for everyone and afford. </p>
