The company Street Storm has collected in this model all the best practices.  It has wide functionality that can satisfy even the most picky user. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Street Storm STR-9540EX is a new generation radar.  Its main difference from devices of this purpose is the built-in <span>GPS module</span> with pre-installed base locations of the position of road video cameras, and it is able to monitor the Strelka ST system thanks to its radar antenna even when the GPS connection is turned off.  Before the creation of Street Storm STR-9540EX GPS, there were no such systems in the world.  This is an absolute novelty of the past, 2013, it is rightfully considered to be by far the best of radar detectors.  The warning range for the Strelka, Robot and Avtodoriya road video cameras is up to one and a half kilometers, which is a record among modern radar systems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Street Storm STR-9540EX" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/484999.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Informational signaling is carried out by sound signals with different tonality, voice prompts and text information placed on the multifunction display (in Russian).  The Street Storm radar detector detects the type of police system that is installed in your path.  So, when reporting traffic police radars, an individual signal is issued for each type of device, and its name is displayed on the monitor.  The driver will know for sure that there is a video camera ahead, and how far it is installed.  Stationary facilities databases can be updated periodically by connecting the device to a computer.  In addition, the anti-radar feature provides automatic tagging with new cameras and radars directly in the process of movement.  The use of various operating modes "City-1", "City-2" and "Track" allows you to cut off false positives.  This makes the use of Street Storm STR-9540EX GPS convenient even in modern megacities, where, due to the abundance of interference, most radar detectors pass. </p><h2>  Functionality Features </h2><p>  This navigator with a radar detector is made on the basis of a powerful ESP processor, it has a reinforced <span>horn antenna</span> to increase the detection range.  The viewing angle of the sensor is 360 degrees.  The device has an advanced filter from impulse noise.  Voice and text alerts are provided in Russian.  Detection of the following types of radars: ‚ÄúRobot‚Äù and ‚ÄúStrelka-ST‚Äù (special warning signal), ‚ÄúVizir‚Äù, ‚ÄúFalcon‚Äù, ‚ÄúIskra‚Äù, ‚ÄúChris-P‚Äù, ‚ÄúBinar‚Äù, ‚ÄúRadis‚Äù, ‚ÄúAMATA‚Äù, "Arena" and "LISD".  Street Storm STR-9540EX has the ability to selectively turn off scan ranges to optimize performance, increase processor speed, and reduce the number of false positives. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The functional range of the radar detector has a brightness control and a frequency indication mode.  The device has a USB service port, designed to update software in case of new models of video cameras and police radars.  The settings include manual adjustment of the volume of the warning signal and the automatic volume reduction mode.  When the detector is turned off, all user settings are saved.  The Street Storm STR-9540EX radar detector has a unique mode for the maximum suppression of industrial interference in the K-band - City-3. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Specification: receiver - superheterodyne type with double frequency conversion;  antenna - linearly polarized, horn type;  detector - frequency discriminator.  The operating temperature range is from -20 to +70 degrees Celsius.  Power is supplied from a 12015 volt DC source.  The consumed current is 250 mA.  <span>Frequency ranges:</span> 33.4 - 36 GHz (Ka-band);  24.05 - 24.25 GHz (K-band);  10.525 - 10.55 GHz (X-band).  A photodiode with a convex lens is used as an optical sensor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The structure of the device.  EX module </h2><p>  The device consists of three main parts: ESP platform, EX module and GPS module.  Experts say that this <span>is the best radar detector,</span> its uniqueness lies in the combination of a GPS unit and a highly sensitive EX module.  This combination allows one hundred percent result to receive timely notification of drivers about the approach not only to the place of fixing the speed regime, but also control of the designated lane of public transport, access to prohibit signals of traffic lights, traffic on the oncoming lane, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="radar detector" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/485008.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The EX module is a unique technology that was developed by the engineers of the Korean company Street Storm to equip radar detectors on high-performance platforms with an additional unit designed to provide detection of the Robot and Strelka-ST / M radars at a distance of up to two kilometers.  Detectors without this module are also able to fix the "Arrow", but the distance will be too short.  In addition, such devices are characterized by low information content (indication in the K-band).  Street Storm STR-9540EX has a unique and, undoubtedly, very useful option - Geiger on Strelka.  This option is available only to devices of this company.  It works as follows: when the device detects a police radar, the detector shows, in addition to the type of complex, the gradation of the change in signal strength.  That is, as you approach or move away from the source, the signal level will also change.  This is why many drivers claim that this is the best radar detector.  In the software version dated June 28, 2013, a six-level ‚ÄúStrelka Geiger‚Äù is implemented. </p><h2>  GPS module </h2><p>  The built-in GPS module allows you to implement an alert of approaching in a stationary video camera fixing the speed mode from a predetermined distance.  And in addition to the EX module, it is also able to warn about those means of tracking order on the road that detect departure to the oncoming line, movement to a forbidding traffic light signal, etc. due to video or photo recording without a radar component, that is, from passive devices that do not emit anything ("Avtouragan", "Avtodoriya", "Arrow-video" and others).  After all, only GPS technology can provide guaranteed protection against these funds.  The module has a regularly updated database of coordinates and types of stationary radars.  In addition, the user will be able to independently add or remove their own tags.  The formation of the database and the installation of independent points takes into account the direction of movement, therefore, the device reports the presence of a trap only when moving in its direction and is silent when traveling in oncoming lanes.  This reduces the number of false positives. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best radar detector" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/485011.jpg" width="289"></div>

    <h2>  The nuances of using </h2><p>  At speeds of up to 120 km / h, GPS warning signals begin 800 meters from the object (the warning is turned on and a countdown in meters to the point is carried out).  In the event that the speed is higher, the notification begins for 1200 meters.  The Storm anti-radar against the Strelka system works much more effectively than similar ones, including premium-class devices. </p><h2>  Location in the car </h2><p>  The body of the device is made of special anti-vandal rubberized material in black.  The size and design of this model distinguishes it from detectors of other manufacturers.  The radar detector in its dimensions is almost two times smaller than its "classmates".  It is mounted on the windshield on a miniature bracket using suction cups, or mounted on a panel on a special anti-slip mat.  The device is powered from the on-board network through the cigarette lighter.  Installation is done on their own, a lot of time is not required for this.  Included with the device are power cords and coordination with a personal computer, as well as Russian-language instructions.  The radar detector is quite simple to operate, all functions are organized in such a way that the user is able to independently understand all of its capabilities. </p><h2>  Update base of coordinates and software </h2><p>  Street Storm STR-9540EX software is updated by the user on a personal PC through the official website (streetstorm.ru) in automatic mode, via the device‚Äôs USB connector and an approval cable.  This is another plus of this model, because many radar detectors to install new firmware owners have to give in service.  This option for Storm radars has so far been implemented only for a line of models with a GPS module.  With the release of a new version of software, manufacturers can expand and improve the functions of the device, adapt the radar detector to new police complexes, or change the functioning principles of existing ones.  This is constantly done by companies engaged in the production and development of devices designed to detect offenses on the roads.  Due to timely updates, the device will remain relevant for a long time. </p>

    <p>  In addition to software, you can update the database containing the coordinates of the alert points.  This procedure is free once every two months.  The database includes a complete list of known stationary cameras and police radars, their types, so the device is able to give the most informative message to the user. </p><h2>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãthreshold setting </h2><p>  Using the GPS module allows the driver to set the speed threshold, while an audio alert will not be issued if the vehicle‚Äôs speed is below a preset value.  After all, if this function is deactivated, the radar detector will constantly annoy the driver with warning messages about approaching the control point, even if the car is moving less than 5 km / h.  Therefore, the user can set the threshold, say 60 km / h.  In this case, the detector will emit only one warning signal.  If the car exceeds the speed threshold, the device will warn him about it. </p><h2>  Detector Algorithm Arrow </h2><p>  The device can record signals from the Strelka police complex earlier than the built-in GPS receiver will notify the user of the approach to a point recorded in the database.  In this case, the message ‚ÄúRADAR ARROW‚Äù appears on the display, and the level of the approaching signal will also be heard and increase.  When 800 meters remain to the point, a message from GPS appears and the remaining distance to the point begins to count.  If the car moves at a speed of more than 120 km / h, then the device notifies the driver earlier - at a distance of 1200 meters (so that there is time to reduce speed). </p><h2>  We will discuss reviews.  Street Storm STR-9540EX </h2><p>  Studying reviews about this device in various forums and on the social networks of the World Wide Web, you most often come across a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãemotions, mostly positive.  But very little objective information.  To get a more or less realistic assessment of this model, you will have to study a huge number of such messages and conduct their systematic analysis.  Well, we begin to study reviews. </p>

    <p>  Street Storm STR-9540EX, according to drivers, is the best detector and an indispensable assistant on the road.  Most users note that it operates at a distance of more than one and a half kilometers, and detects all types of radars with its detector, except for "Avtodoriya".  GPS is also beyond praise, it does not miss a single stationary complex.  The next plus is the possibility of free regular firmware and database updates.  There are a lot of positive reviews about the high information content of the device both in audio and in text form about the types of radars and their remoteness.  Many drivers note a stylish case and an abundance of settings that allow you to customize the device to your preferences. </p><h2>  We continue to discuss reviews.  Street Storm STR-9540EX and its shortcomings </h2><p>  Despite the fact that in general, most drivers characterize the device solely on the positive side, it, like any other device, has its drawbacks.  Let us dwell on them in more detail, but not because there are no more of them at all, but because, by acquiring such a technique, each of us hopes that the radar detector will not fail and will relieve unnecessary trouble on the road.  Therefore, it is necessary to study first of all the weak points of any device in order to protect itself in the future.  First of all, the range of this detector should be noted.  It would seem that this is one of its main advantages.  Nevertheless, this is a virtue turning into a disadvantage.  The radar detector ‚Äútakes‚Äù everything, even that which is not necessary, this is especially noticeable in the ‚ÄúTrack‚Äù mode.  He manages to respond to supermarkets and gas stations. </p><p>  To eliminate such triggers, you will have to tinker with the settings, or you are doomed to slow down even in a clean field, even where the traffic police officer‚Äôs foot never stepped.  Now let's move on to the GPS module.  Many users note its excessive activity, especially this applies to the operation of the device in megacities.  There are a lot of cameras installed, but not all of them work, being, in fact, dummies.  GPS reports everything in a row, which also creates a number of inconveniences.  In addition, drivers note that this module is quite hot and shows the wrong speed.  So, if on the speedometer the arrow indicates a mark of one hundred kilometers, then the device determines 93 km / h, which is unacceptable for such a technique.  As already mentioned above, the device heats up very much, this leads to the fact that in hot weather it is disconnected from overheating.  Developers should consider the ventilation system of the device, because there is not a single hole in it to remove warm air.  The last drawback is the high cost of the Street Storm STR-9540EX radar detector.  The price of such a detector is in the range of 10-12 thousand rubles, which is excessive for many motorists.  However, according to the lucky owners, the device pays for itself very quickly, saving the driver from numerous fines. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Despite these shortcomings, the STR-9540EX is the best premium detector to date in the price range up to 12 thousand rubles.  Despite the fact that you can buy even the best DVRs with a radar detector from Conqueror, Akenori, Highscreen for such money, many motorists prefer the Street Storm lineup, because these devices are considered the most reliable today.  And their main advantage is the ability to periodically update software and databases for finding stationary police complexes. </p>
