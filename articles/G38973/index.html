    <p>  Vacationers praised the landscaped hotel area.  She is buried in greenery.  Well-groomed paths abound in tropical flowers and vegetation.  The rooms are small but comfortable and clean.  Textiles are snow-white.  From the windows of the rooms you can see the sea.  It is worth noting that there are few positive opinions about the hotel.  All of them date back to 2011. </p><p>  At that time, the complex was just beginning to receive tourists from Russia.  Prior to that, he specialized in serving the European public.  At the moment, the responses of the Russians are negative. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  According to Russian tourists, hotel staff refuse to feed guests who arrive after 22:00.  They are not even offered sandwiches or fruits.  The family rooms have air conditioning, the power of which does not match the size of the apartment.  Therefore, the rooms are stuffy and hot.  In some suites, the windows were broken.  They did not close.  Travelers complained about broken mirrors. </p><p>  There were stains on the carpet.  Flakes of paint and plaster streamed from the ceiling.  The furniture was old and dilapidated.  Mattresses are squeezed and hard.  The food in the restaurant was terrible.  Potatoes and pasta were served.  To them are soy cutlets.  The vegetables had a sour taste.  There were no desserts.  For breakfast, fed eggs and bread. </p><p>  The beach was enjoyed not only by hotel guests, but also by guests of neighboring complexes.  Therefore, in the season, sunbeds and mattresses were not enough for everyone.  On this basis, there were quarrels, which sometimes turned into fights. </p><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  The Russians loved cafes and canteens concentrated in Alanya.  Travelers spoke warmly about the Olivia steakhouse, the Prima tavern, the Vintage diner, and the Panorama restaurant.  Tasty and inexpensively invited to eat numerous bistros.  Our compatriots liked “Ravza”, “Sultan”, “Keskin”, “Hakan”. </p>
