Beautiful paintings, bows and hairpins are made from thin or wide strips of fabric, and hoops or wreaths are made out.  One of the favorite flowers of any master is the rose.  From a ribbon, you can create such a lush and multi-layered flower in many ways.  Make it from a single strip of satin, from chopped identical segments.  Roses can be made separately, and only then sew on the main fabric, or you can embroider a rose right in place with a needle with a wide eye. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make a rose from satin ribbons.  The photos below will help you understand how to do the work step by step.  Explanation of individual fragments of the work will give a more accurate idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe upcoming task. </p><h2>  Easy option for embroidering roses with ribbons </h2><p>  For work, prepare the thinnest satin ribbon to create the base.  Its color should correspond to the shade of the future rose.  Some masters use floss thread to mark the contours of the flower.  A needle with a wide eye is tucked in with a prepared ribbon or thread, and the base is sewn with wide stitches in the fabric.  Its shape is similar to the rays of the sun emerging from a central point.  The length of all lines must be the same so that the rose from the ribbon is smooth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wonderfuldiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a rose fast" class="if uuid-2481793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2481793.jpg"></div><p>  To create the flower itself, the tape is selected wider and denser.  She also hangs in a needle with a wide hole.  A durable knot is tied at one end and a hole is drilled on the back of the fabric, leading the tape out.  Then begins alternately threading the twisted spiral of the tape under all the rays harvested in advance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When the work is completed and the rose from the ribbon is dense and magnificent, the needle is threaded again through the fabric, and a strip of satin is displayed again on the back side.  The edges of the tape can either be tied to knots, or sewn to the main fabric from the bottom.  Then the craft will be flat.  The central hole in the flower is decorated with beads. </p><h2>  Simple rose </h2><p>  A rose from a ribbon, as in the photo below, is also made with a thread and a needle.  Here, the presence of a wide eye is not required already, since the tape is sewn with a simple kapron thread, matched to match the atlas.  A strip of tape is cut off.  Its length and width depend on the wishes of the master.  The more tape and it is thicker, the more magnificent and wider the craft will look.  A piece of tape is sewn on one side with stitches from start to finish.  Some masters capture the sides, but most do not.  However, in this case, before work, you need to melt the edges of the satin with a candle or a lighter, so that over time the rose does not sprinkle with thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dress-making.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="easy craft option" class="if uuid-2481810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2481810.jpg"></div><p>  After stitching with stitches, the knot is not tied, and the tape on the thread is neatly pulled down.  After the flower is formed, you need to tie the thread with a knot several times and cut off the edge with scissors.  The petals are straightened with your fingers so that the layers of the frill are not curled.  Such simple and fast roses are often used in the manufacture of wreaths, hairpins and elastic bands for girls. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kansashi Technique </h2><p>  The rose from the ribbon in this technique is made from pre-prepared petals by stitching in the center.  Satin ribbon is bought wide.  You can use one color, but a multi-color craft will look beautiful.  A strip of fabric is cut into equal segments.  The longer the length, the larger the petal.  So think for yourself what kind of rose you decided to create.  Then prepare a thread and a thin needle for sewing a petal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rose from single petals" class="if uuid-2481753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2481753.jpg"></div><p>  Before starting work, you need to slightly bend the edge, then the petals will come out without sharp edges.  The corners of the strip are bent so that the edges form a straight line with the base.  Then a thin but strong nylon thread is inserted into the needle in the tone of the fabric, and the fabric is sewn along the bottom line.  Then the edge gently reaches for the thread and is gathered in small folds.  Next, the craft turns out on the back side, and the edge is beautifully straightened.  One petal is ready.  A knot is tied at the end of the thread, and the workpiece is laid aside.  Such petals need to perform 14-15 pieces.  Lower petals can be created from segments of a larger length. </p><h2>  Flower assembly </h2><p>  When all the prepared small elements are on the table in front of the master, the middle of the rose is twisted.  A section is cut a little larger than to create a petal.  The edge is gathered by twisting the fabric inward.  The lower part is stitched every couple of twists.  Then they begin to collect the flower from the petals.  To do this, they are sewn alternately, located at the bottom of the central part.  Each subsequent petal is attached with a lateral shift.  Parts should not overlap each other.  Each element needs to be placed equally.  The rose from the ribbon is ready.  It can be sewn from below on a felt circle. </p><h2>  Another Kanzashi Rose Option </h2><p>  The photo below shows that the crafts of the next version of the rose using the kanzashi technique is also made from individual segments of the tape of the same size.  Each petal collapses as shown in the frame-by-frame photograph below.  A piece of tape is bent first so that one half is at right angles to the second. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.usefuldiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="folding flower from individual elements" class="if uuid-2481837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2481837.jpg"></div><p>  Then the upper side bends a second time forward and down.  From above, the fabric forms a corner, and from below, the edges of the tape are connected at one point.  Before joining the parts in the flower, the workpieces are turned to the back side.  Stitched together in the center are seven petals.  It turns out the usual flower.  Such crafts need to do three pieces.  Each subsequent simple flower consists of longer segments folded according to the scheme.  The lower one is the largest flower.  All parts with petals are sewn together in threads.  The very center of the rose from the ribbon is decorated with beads so that the threads of the seams are not visible.  From below, the craft is attached to a circle of felt or any other dense fabric. </p><h2>  Pleated craft </h2><p>  This version of roses made of satin ribbons with step-by-step instructions for doing the work is made from a long section.  A strip of about 30 cm is taken and folded in half.  Having determined the middle, they begin folding the tissue of the same type at an angle of 90 degrees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="k4craft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pleated rose" class="if uuid-2481846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2481846.jpg"></div><p>  The photo shows how a strip of fabric is located.  When the small ends remain, they are held tightly in the hand, and the rest of the twist is released.  After the ribbon is freely deployed, one edge is held with your fingers, and the other must be gently pulled.  As a result of smooth contraction, we see the resulting flower.  The edges of the tape are tied on a tight knot. </p><h2>  Beautiful multi-color rose </h2><p>  Such a bright craft can be decorated with a pebble in the center and worn on a dress or blouse instead of a brooch.  For work, a satin ribbon is cut into pieces of the same length.  For each layer of roses from ribbons (see photo below), approximately 7-8 details are taken. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thinkbowtique.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful flower made of ribbons" class="if uuid-2481855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2481855.jpg"></div><p>  Each element before sewing is bent in half with a flip of fabric.  Some masters do not sew petals, but stick them with a glue gun to one another.  This method will take less time, so if you have this device, you can safely use it in any work in the kanzashi technique.  In the center of the top layer is placed a beautiful brooch of pebbles in the tone of the fabric.  You can replace it with beads, and half beads, and other decorative elements. </p><h2>  Original rose embroidered </h2><p>  For work, prepare the main fabric on which the work will be performed, scissors, a needle with a wide eye, nylon threads, it is advisable to pick them in tone with the flower.  It is better to buy a satin ribbon dense, then a rose embroidered with ribbons will be lush and more voluminous.  First, the center of the flower is twisted according to the method already described and the workpiece is sewn from below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wonderfuldiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery roses with ribbons" class="if uuid-2481788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2481788.jpg"></div><p>  Then the tape is mounted on the needle and the tape is pulled out from the back of the fabric.  Having bent the fabric with a loop, the tape is pulled down and sewn to the bottom of the central element.  You can use the knitting needle for easy alignment of the tape at the folds. </p><p>  The article gives the simplest options for beginners.  Roses made from satin ribbons are bright, shiny, lush.  Such crafts can also be sewn onto clothes as decorative elements. </p>
