    <p>  The most important advantage that Brand 6051 has is a top-level protection, which guarantees the safety of the whole family.  So, the pressure cooker lid is closed by turning the handle, there is also an opening for the release of steam, working after pressing the button. </p><p>  Unfortunately, this model does not have a special removable plate.  But the manufacturers came up with something more interesting, and now the cover can be removed completely and thoroughly cleaned from all sides. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Product Specifications </h2><p>  The Multicooker Brand 6051 has 14 cooking programs: </p><ul><li>  extinguishing / heating / warming up; </li><li>  steam / meat / frying / soup; </li><li>  porridge / cereals / rice; </li><li>  baking (bread can also be cooked) / baby food / yogurt; </li><li>  manual mode. </li></ul><p>  They, in turn, allow you to choose not only the time necessary for cooking, but also the level of pressure exerted on the products. </p><h2>  What is manual mode? </h2><p>  This feature should be discussed separately, because for the most part it was because of it that the Brand 6051 reviews on various sites were rave.  So, the "manual mode" allows you to create 3 programs on your own, in which you can choose the cooking time, where the minimum is 0 hours and the maximum is 24 hours. In addition, the temperature should also be set with your own hands from 25-130 degrees. </p><p>  And the most interesting functions are gradual heating or a rapid decrease in temperature during cooking. </p>

    <h2>  Snooze function </h2><p>  Brand 6051 is equipped with one of the most necessary functions - a delayed start or, as it is called by users, a delay.  This mode allows you to cook a dish for a certain time, for example, to the arrival of her husband from work or guests.  Start can be delayed for a certain time interval, where the maximum time is 24 hours.  But there is one catch, unfortunately, the program does not work in all modes, namely in the "manual", "yogurt" and "frying". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Heated Mode </h2><p>  Thanks to the "heating" function, the Brand 6051 multicooker retains the heat of the cooked food for 24 hours.  By the way, this function is turned on automatically, immediately after the end of any program, except for the mode of preparation of yogurt.  You can disable the "heating" in advance by clicking on the "start" button after turning on the selected program. </p><h2>  What is a complete set? </h2><p>  The main component of Brand 6051 is a bowl; without it, as you know, even the most multifunctional pressure cooker cannot cook anything.  The main attribute of the device is a teflon coating, which, according to user reviews, does not burn food.  Capacity is 5 liters. </p><p>  Also included in the kit: </p><ul><li>  measuring and soup spoons; </li><li>  plastic spatula; </li><li>  measuring cup; </li><li>  stand for multicooker; </li><li>  recipe book. </li></ul><p>  By the way, the Brand 6051 multicooker weighs less than 5 kg, and its dimensions are very compact - 31x33x29.5. </p><h2>  Delicious recipes </h2><p>  To cook something tasty in the Brand 6051 multicooker, just look into the cookbook, which is included.  However, in order to know what dishes can be prepared, it is better to familiarize yourself with a few of the recipes.  So, the <span>pear-apple pie</span> on kefir is simply excellent, if you add the ingredients exactly. </p><p>  What do you need?  A little flour (about 250 g), kefir (200 ml), a glass of sugar, a couple of eggs, a pinch of salt and soda, 1 pear / apples and a little butter (30 g), which must be melted at the very beginning and allowed to cool . <br>  Then beat the eggs with granulated sugar while adding kefir, butter and salt.  Then pour flour, soda and whisk again.  Peel the fruits / seeds and chop them into cubes. </p><p>  Then you should grease the container for baking with oil, pour in part of the resulting dough, pour the fruit on top and pour out the rest of the mixture.  The mode on the multicooker should be set to "Manual", time - 1 h. 10 min, temperature - 170 degrees. </p>

    <p>  And here's another recipe for chicken fillet with mustard, honey and curry.  To prepare this dish, you need to take chicken breasts (4 pcs.), Which should be cut into two parts.  In the bowl, mix mustard (1 tbsp), the same amount of honey, curry (1 tsp) and sprinkle with salt.  Breasts should be put in a container and marinated for 24 hours. </p><p>  After pouring a little oil into the container with the chicken, select the "Manual" mode, the time is 20 minutes and the temperature is 120 degrees. </p><p>  In a pressure cooker, you can cook not only the first dishes and desserts, but also cereals.  Here, by the way, is one recipe.  It is necessary to pour oatmeal (200 g) into the capacity of the multicooker and pour milk (4 tbsp.), Previously diluted 1: 1 with water.  Then you should choose the program "Porridge", set the pressure to 30 kPa, and set the timer for 6 minutes. </p><p>  On the Internet there are a lot of recipes for various dishes.  Some multicooker users even experiment and invent something of their own.  Therefore, it is not necessary to constantly look into the Brand 6051 cookbook. </p><h2>  Device advantages </h2><p>  A multicooker-pressure cooker, the price of which is small compared to other technical innovations, works for several appliances at once.  For example, this is a double boiler and a bread maker, which is an excellent cost savings.  The program "manual mode" allows you to select the necessary parameters, and the device adapts to the wishes of its mistress. </p>

    <p>  In the pressure cooker, special heating elements are installed on three sides: at the top, on each side and at the bottom, which allows you to evenly distribute the heat inside the oven.  Therefore, food does not burn and is steamed evenly. </p><p>  In addition, the user manual is written in simple language, without <span>abstruse phrases,</span> and its contents are very detailed.  The same can be said, based on user reviews, about the recipe book, which shows the exact dosages, the choice of the necessary program and the cooking time. </p><p>  Another plus is the ease of navigating the menu, which allows you to not get confused in the settings.  And the lid can be easily removed, so when washing it is not necessary to be afraid that water will get on the parts that are vital for the device and an unexpected breakdown will occur. </p>

    <p>  In addition to everything described above, in the Brand 6051 multicooker there is a container for collecting condensate-liquid formed during the preparation of dishes.  This thing is very convenient, because it protects food from the entry of fumes into it. </p><h2>  Cons Brand 6051 </h2><p>  There were not many negative reviews in Runet, mostly people are not satisfied with the following: </p><ul><li>  absorption of odors by a rubber sealing ring; </li><li>  small size of an electric cord; </li><li>  long set of pressure; </li><li>  lack of a shutdown button. </li></ul><p>  If you take into account all the pros and cons, then we can say with confidence that the first is much more.  So the manufacturer creates high-quality products that pleases the owners of this device.  At the same time, a multicooker-pressure cooker, the price of which varies within 7 thousand rubles, can serve for a long time and cook deliciously. </p>
