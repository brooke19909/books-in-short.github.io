Reviews of the new owners of such devices have focused on their advanced technical characteristics and high quality.  At the same time, the cost of such devices is quite affordable.  As a result, this brand dominates the Russian market among local cell phone manufacturers.  It is his lineup that this review will be devoted to. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mvideo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vertex Impress Smartphone" class="if uuid-3030161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3030161.jpg"></div><h2>  About Brand </h2><p>  As noted earlier, in 2010 sales of VERTEX smartphones began.  Reviews primarily focused on their improved quality.  The headquarters of this brand is located in St. Petersburg.  But in the manufacture of devices, production facilities are used in China, and there is also a representative office there. </p><p>  At the first stage, test samples are tested in the Middle Kingdom.  VERTEX specialists check the devices for defects and give recommendations regarding changes in smartphones.  Next, a second batch of test samples of mobile phones is manufactured, which is tested not only in China, but also at the main Vertex representative office in Russia.  If no problems were identified, then the device becomes serial.  Otherwise, the gadget is re-sent for revision and so on until a truly high-quality and reliable device is received. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, it should be noted separately that the moment that each digital device of this manufacturer has its own peculiarity.  For example, the Impress Grip device has a degree of protection IP68 and can be immersed in water to a depth of 1.5 meters.  But the Impress Saturn gadget, although it is a very low-cost device, is able to work with the most modern 4G cellular networks.  It is this approach that allows this manufacturer to successfully compete with Chinese counterparts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moscow.shop.megafon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smartphone review Vertex Impress" class="if uuid-3030164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3030164.jpg"></div><h2>  Device Impress Saturn </h2><p>  This is the most affordable VERTEX smartphone at the moment.  His characteristics indicate that he has a low speed.  This device is based on a quad-core chip with a nominal frequency of 1.3 GHz.  In addition to this, the device is equipped with 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal storage.  The key feature of this mobile phone is the ability to work with 4G networks.  If we add to this a very democratic cost of 3290 rubles, we get an affordable mobile device with high speed Internet access.  At the same time, this model of a cell phone can work with any SIM card, and is not tied to any particular operator.  It is these three advantages that its owners focus on: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Low cost. </li><li>  High speed internet connection. </li><li>  Ability to connect to any cellular network. </li></ol><h2>  Gadget Impress Ra and its characteristics </h2><p>  The VERTEX smartphone of the Impress Ra model by technical specifications is very similar to the younger model that was previously considered.  At the heart of this gadget is a single-chip MT 6735 chip. This chip is equipped with four poisonous ones for processing code and operates at a frequency of 1.25 GHz.  The amount of RAM in the mobile device is 1 GB, and the capacity of the internal information storage is 8 GB.  Even the screen size of this device is identical to -5 ''.  Its resolution is 1280 x 720. The type of matrix used is IPS. </p><p>  But this device also has significant differences from the most affordable device of this manufacturer.  The first of them is the battery capacity increased to 4000 mAh.  A more affordable device is equipped with a 2200 mAh battery.  Therefore, it can work on one charge for 3-4 days.  Another important feature of this smartphone is the dual camera.  Therefore, the photos on such a device are very, very high quality. </p><p>  The cost of this device is currently 5,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hi-tech.mail.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VERTEX Smartphone. Specifications" class="if uuid-3030165" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3030165.jpg"></div><h2>  Mobile Phone Impress Tor.  Technical specifications </h2><p>  There are several important features in every Vertex smartphone.  Reviews regarding this model indicate that it has a high degree of protection of the case, which corresponds to IP68.  That is, it can be immersed in water to a depth of not more than 1.5 meters lasting no more than 1 hour.  In this case, you can even take photos or record a memorable video.  In addition to this, the developers equipped this device with two cameras.  Therefore, the photos received on this device are of high quality. </p><p>  A review of the Vertex Impress smartphone of this model also indicates the presence of a battery with an increased capacity of 4400 mAh.  If you add to this a small diagonal of the device‚Äôs screen in 5 '' and a resolution of 1280 x 720, then the battery life of the device can be 5 days.  The disadvantages of the device include the fact that it has a small amount of memory (1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of integrated drive) and a low-performance Snapdragon 210 processor from Qualcomm. </p><p>  Now such a gadget can be purchased for 7500 rubles.  Given the previously given specifications, this cost of this mobile device is justified and justified.  Many models with similar characteristics have a higher price today. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dns-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VERTEX smartphones. Models" class="if uuid-3030168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3030168.jpg"></div><h2>  Smartphone Impress Grip.  Parameters and features </h2><p>  Vertex Impress smartphone of this modification is a lot in what reminds the Tor model considered earlier.  The degree of protection for the case is identical - IP68.  Only here the design of this gadget is much better.  In addition, the amount of memory he has increased.  The RAM in this device is 2 GB, and the capacity of the flash drive is 16 GB.  Also, the Snapdragon 410 microprocessor provides a higher level of phone performance. The main camera is based on two sensors, and the front camera is on a single.  The battery capacity has not changed and is 4400 mAh.  But here the autonomy of this smartphone is reduced and amount to three days.  The price of this device is 10,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="festima.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vertex smartphones. Reviews" class="if uuid-3030172" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3030172.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This review covered various Vertex smartphones.  Reviews mainly characterize this brand positively.  These are reliable devices with receiving technical specifications, parameters and affordable cost.  At the same time, in each model of the smartphone, the manufacturer has provided some special option.  It is through a combination of all these factors that Vertex is successful today.  Of course, this manufacturer does not have high-performance and expensive devices in its lineup.  But her budget devices are beyond praise. </p>
