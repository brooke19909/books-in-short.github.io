  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is oblique weaving</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Using oblique weaving to create various products, you can make beautiful and unique elements of decor, jewelry or household items.  To work with this method, both beads and birch bark or plain paper are suitable. </p><p>  Thus, weaving is the creation of highly artistic products by processing various materials (threads, bark, paper, beads, etc.) and a certain method of fastening them.  This method is widely used not only in the manufacture of dishes, furniture and jewelry, but also in the construction of houses.  Widespread oblique weaving from <strong> </strong>  birch bark, which came to us from the time of ancient Russia.  In those days, traditionally created baskets, boxes, hats, as well as bast shoes, wickers and many other household items. </p><p>  So, for weaving a large size of objects, wide ribbons of birch bark are used, for small items - narrow birch bark strips.  The birch bark itself is peeled and cut into strips.  For weaving, tools such as a knife, various types of awl and scissors are needed.  The work is based on the so-called "cell" (square).  Oblique weaving is an alternation of squares that are formed by weaving ribbons from birch bark at an angle of 45 degrees.  It should be noted that oblique weaving is a rather difficult task, so for beginner needlewomen, direct weaving is most suitable, allowing you to master the basics of this process.  Or you can learn the basics of weaving, using plain paper for this.  To do this, it is recommended to use tape from cardboard or newspaper.  In this case, over time, you can learn to more accurately and accurately weave products from a variety of materials.  Therefore oblique weaving from newspapers <strong> </strong>  is a good guide for beginners  Before you begin to work, you must decide on the product that will be created.  This can be both dishes, and various baskets or baskets. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Consider the example of weaving a simple square napkin from birch bark. </p><p>  First you need to prepare an even number of tapes;  Depending on the size of the napkin, all birch bark ribbons are bent in half to determine their center point.  The first four tapes are alternately interwoven with each other at right angles.  In addition, each cell must have a square shape.  Next, strips of birch bark are added on each side until the desired wipe size is reached. </p><p>  After weaving is finished, you need to create the edges of the napkin, starting from the bottom strip of the product.  It is bent under the nearest cell.  Thus, all the lower ribbons are bent, and the extreme ones are directed perpendicular to the braided stripes.  All remaining tapes are led up and woven under the cells of the second row. </p><p>  This example is the easiest to weave, and can become the basis for more complex work, for example, when oblique weaving is used, the patterns of which can be found in various needlework magazines. </p><p>  In addition to birch bark, beads are currently widely used to create various ornaments or decor items, since such products are quite attractive.  For work, round beads, a thread and a needle are used.  Beginning needlewomen are recommended to try their hand at weaving baubles, since such work is not difficult, and everyone can master it.  With the accumulation of experience, you can move on to more complex products, the manufacture of which uses oblique weaving, both mosaic and openwork. </p><p>  Thus, <span>arts and crafts</span> for many centuries has not lost its popularity and is used to create a variety of furniture, dishes, as well as decorative elements and decorations. </p>
