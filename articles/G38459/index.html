    <h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  Thousands of guests visit the <span>Park Inn</span> Hotel <span>.</span>  <span>Sochi,</span> Rosa Khutor is a popular tourist destination.  But, unfortunately, some of the shortcomings of the hotel can overshadow the rest.  The following negative comments should be especially noted: </p><ul><li>  ventilation is poor in the hotel corridors, which is why it is incredibly stuffy and has a stale smell; </li><li>  the first shuttle to the sea goes at a quarter past nine in the morning, which is quite late; </li><li>  on the beach there are very few sunbeds under sunshades; </li><li>  the bathroom in the room is very cramped (there is nowhere to turn around); </li><li>  hygiene products are provided only upon arrival, after which the maids do not report them (you have to call the reception desk and make a comment); </li><li>  the same menu is offered for breakfast every day; </li><li>  there are spots on the carpet in the room, and therefore it is unpleasant to walk on it barefoot (it‚Äôs good that slippers are provided); </li><li>  the number of towels in the bathroom is not up to standard; </li><li>  to achieve quality cleaning, you need to leave a tip. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The Park Inn Hotel belongs to the Radisson chain, which can be considered a guarantee of quality service and comfortable living conditions.  Particularly noteworthy is the signature interior of the rooms.  Guests are provided with a huge number of related services.  Particularly pleased with the free shuttle service to the sea, lift cards and entertainment tickets.  The hotel staff treats guests with respect and courtesy.  All requests and wishes are fulfilled at the first request.  Thus, the "Park Inn" will provide you with an unforgettable vacation, during which you will be surrounded by care and attention. </p>
