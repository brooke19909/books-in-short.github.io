    <h2>  Innovations </h2><p>  The difference between him and his predecessor is obvious and lies in a noticeable modernization of many elements of the icebreaker.  So, for example, for the first time in Russian practice, a nasal tip in the shape of a spoon was used, which turned out to be more effective than the previous design.  Automatic ship control is created using a new type of digital technology. </p><p>  When the 50 Years of Victory icebreaker was designed, the designers and engineers were faced with the task of re-equipping the nuclear power plant.  Innovations affected a special complex designed to protect the environment from a biological threat of such a development.  Especially for this, the Gostekhnadzor conducted a re-examination of the installation in accordance with the new rules and requirements.  The equipment responsible for the disposal of various crew waste was also updated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><caption>  Technical characteristics of the <span>nuclear icebreaker</span> "50 years of Victory" </caption><tbody><tr><td>  Ship length </td><td>  159 meters </td></tr><tr><td>  Vessel Width </td><td>  30 meters </td></tr><tr><td>  Volume </td><td>  25168 tons </td></tr><tr><td>  Propulsion power </td><td>  54 million watts </td></tr><tr><td>  Reactors and their power </td><td>  2x171 million watts </td></tr><tr><td>  Nuclear steam generating plant </td><td>  OK-900A </td></tr><tr><td>  Ship speed </td><td>  18 knots </td></tr><tr><td>  Autonomy Duration </td><td>  7.5 months </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Despite the recent start of operation, the design of this vessel existed in the USSR.  The icebreaker "50 Years of Victory" was laid in October 1989.  Then it received the name "Ural" and was supposed to be commissioned in a couple of years.  However, the economic crisis led to a delay.  As a result, the ship, which was only half ready, was launched in 1993, after which it was to be completed.  However, ongoing funding problems have caused the icebreaker to remain idle.  When 1995 came, it was solemnly renamed in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Victory Day in World War II. </p><p>  During a pointless downtime, an unfinished ship several times found itself on the verge of disposal, but at the last moment it was lucky, and the project was left in effect.  Due to delays, captain Yuri Kuchiev resigned in 1997.  He was a legendary specialist who led the first expedition to the <span>North Pole</span> (in 1971) on the Arctic, the first nuclear-powered icebreaker of the same class to which the 50 Years of Victory icebreaker belongs. </p><p>  The project was restored only in 2003, when funds from the federal budget were finally allocated to it.  In February 2007, the construction was completed, and the nuclear icebreaker "50 Years of Victory" conducted sea trials in the Baltic Sea.  They were successfully completed, after which the ship was assigned to the port in Murmansk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Driving performance </h2><p>  In order to move along ice water without problems, the ship received good maneuverability and controllability.  For reliability, a double case is thought out.  In those places where the ship breaks ice, the walls reach a thickness of 48 millimeters, which is one and a half times more than usual.  The case is made of alloy steel, which effectively protects against possible corrosion.  Another possible attack threatening the ship is friction.  In order to keep the ice drift safe, the hull during production was coated with a specialized polymer. </p><p>  The hollow space between the two walls is occupied by water ballast, which is necessary for advancement in difficult ice conditions.  The captain of the icebreaker ‚Äú50 Years of Victory‚Äù (Valentin Davydyants) can lead the ship in both forward and backward directions and be sure that the path will be laid. </p><p>  Effective breaking of ice allows the ship to regularly appear at the North Pole and without hassle return.  In 2013, a momentous event occurred - the route was repeated for the hundredth time. </p><p>  Even with the flooding of any two compartments, the nuclear-powered vessel will remain afloat, which is a prerequisite for operation by Rostec.  Particularly important compartments of the vessel are surrounded by a waterproof coating, which allows them to be kept intact even in case of emergency. </p>

    <h2>  Tourism on board </h2><p>  Today, even tourists can get to the icebreaker ‚Äú50 Years of Victory‚Äù.  Northern waters cruise is carried out on special vouchers, which can also be purchased online.  In this case, a helicopter is also taken to the ship, which can land on a special platform provided on all Arctic class ships.  It should be noted that it can also be used for reconnaissance purposes and navigation.  For operation and repair of the helicopter, there is immediately a hangar in the walls of which the vehicle is always safe from the vagaries of arctic weather. </p><p>  The crew always monitors the state of evacuation motor boats, which the icebreaker ‚Äú50 years of Victory‚Äù has on board.  The characteristics and methods of use are explained to all newcomers who first appeared on the ship.  In addition, in extreme cases, resort to inflatable liferafts, as well as a tow boat.  The schedule of tourist cruises depends on where the icebreaker ‚Äú50 years of Victory‚Äù is located. </p>

    <h2>  Travel comfort </h2><p>  Initially, it was estimated that the crew would only lay transport routes in the Arctic.  However, over time, the goals with which the atomic icebreaker ‚Äú50 Years of Victory‚Äù was used have changed.  A photo of the interior proves that there is everything necessary for a comfortable rest of tourists.  64 passenger cabins are available for them. </p><p>  Guests are free to move around certain spaces inside the ship.  This is a large dining room, which can accommodate everyone.  In addition, two bars, a library, a shop, halls for lectures and watching a movie, as well as platforms for sports and training, are open.  Those who wish to keep fit can visit the pool.  There is also a sauna.  Comfort of passengers is provided by a well-thought-out ventilation system.  In case of malaise, the staff of a small medical center will help.  Laundry allows you to store your things in frequency on a long trip. </p>

    <h2>  Security </h2><p>  Of course, it provides not only the possibility of emergencies, but also everything that should prevent emergency situations on the ship. </p><p>  To combat fires on the ship installed a specialized alarm system.  If possible, the crew only takes with them fireproof and non-combustible materials.  It has all the necessary fire fighting equipment - fire extinguishers, etc. Particular attention is paid to explosive rooms.  These are storages for jet fuel, rooms with batteries, a hangar, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Communication </h2><p>  For contact with the "big land" the cabin is equipped with many types of communication.  This radio, electro-radio navigation, satellite and navigation tracking systems.  On board, familiar gadgets also have a channel with their homeland.  Telephones, e-mail, etc. work. Specialists who work on the ice drift navigate in space using a variety of technically sophisticated devices: a gyrocompass, a direction finder, an electric log, an echo sounder, and portable boat radio stations.  Thus, communication is carried out constantly, and there is no difficulty from which the icebreaker ‚Äú50 years of Victory‚Äù would not have come out.  The photo of the cabin makes a strong impression - there are only modern devices that are constantly updated. </p>

    <h2>  Nuclear reactor </h2><p>  The main element of the ship is a <span>nuclear reactor.</span>  A chain reaction occurs in it, generating the necessary energy.  All processes are monitored and monitored by the ship's team every second.  The reactor can be divided into two parts.  This is a reflector and an active zone.  The latter is needed in order to store fuel in acceptable conditions in accordance with the necessary safety. </p><p>  In addition, the design of the ice drift includes a nuclear power plant, which in turn consists of two water reactors.  According to calculations, in order to maintain the vessel in working condition, enough power and one such installation, however, both work, while monitoring is carried out so that at least 50% of the resource is used. </p>
