  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Group of companies 'Detinets': reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Who among the townspeople did not want to live in nature, in their own cozy wooden house, in a separate area? </p><p>  The Detinets group of companies can fulfill the dream of urban residents who are tired of the constant bustle and noise of the ‚Äústone jungle‚Äù. </p><p>  Detinets is a construction company that offers wooden houses and other high-quality buildings at reasonable prices. </p><p>  The geography of the construction of houses is quite extensive: this is the central part of Russia, and the Rostov region, as well as the Krasnodar Territory. </p><p>  The Detinets company, reviews of which can be found not only on the Internet, but also in other mass media, has been operating for more than 15 years. </p><p>  For the construction of residential houses and cottages, as well as a variety of farm buildings, the company uses <span>logs,</span> profiled planed and glued beams. </p><p>  The scope of the company also includes the construction of wooden hotel complexes. </p><p>  Perhaps the best Detinets products are wooden houses or cottages made of logs or timber.  They are very conveniently designed and comfortable.  The customer can choose a typical house project or offer his own. </p><p>  In addition, this <span>construction company</span> offers its customers a variety of small log structures.  It produces amazingly beautiful arbors, various <span>extensions to the house.</span>  Porches and verandas made by the masters of this company give a fabulous look to the most ordinary houses. </p><p>  Due to the high level of work performed by the Detinets company, reviews about it are mostly positive.  Many praise the builders who work, trying to please the customer.  Although, of course, here, as elsewhere, the so-called human factor takes place. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many customers respond positively to the quality of building materials and the timing of the order.  Of course, there are also dissatisfied customers.  But some clients who collaborated with the Detinets company leave reviews ‚Äúin their hearts,‚Äù that is, under the influence of a momentary mood, without weighing objectively all the pros and cons.  So one cannot trust such opinions one hundred percent. </p><p>  In positive reviews, customers note reasonable prices for this company.  It is especially advantageous to apply in the winter, since at this time, significant discounts are provided to customers. </p><p>  The positive aspects include unobtrusive service.  And also the fact that company representatives never impose additional services that are not specified in the contract.  The company has almost no delay in delivering material, which has a positive effect on the quality of construction, as workers have enough time to finish work on the appointed date. </p><p>  Many clients note the courtesy and professionalism of the office staff, managers and employees who communicate with customers by phone; they always answer questions in detail. </p><p>  So, the Detinets construction company, the reviews of which we reviewed, is one of the most famous companies.  It is developing steadily, has regular customers. </p><p>  Summarizing the various opinions of customers about the company, we can say the following: </p><ul><li>  the company does not have failures with the deadlines for the completion of construction; </li><li>  in comparison with other companies in the same field of activity, the prices of this company are low; </li><li>  building material is always of high quality; </li><li>  the qualifications of the staff are diverse, mainly experienced builders work; </li><li>  office staff demonstrates a high level of service and attentiveness to customer needs. </li></ul><p>  If you are going to build a house, then based on the information provided, you can decide on cooperation with this company. </p>
