The zoo is one of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.italysbestrome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Giraffes in the zoo of Rome" class="if uuid-2552214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93772/2552214.jpg"></div><p>  Over the past few years has been updated and renamed the "biopark".  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã17,000 square meters.  The zoo in Rome has about 1,200 animals belonging to 150 different species, including mammals, reptiles, birds and amphibians, many of which are endangered in their natural habitats due to environmental changes, poaching and human activities of various species. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bioparco.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cockatoo in Rome Zoo" class="if uuid-2552216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93772/2552216.jpg"></div><h2>  Zoo history </h2><p>  Rome Zoo has a long history.  In 1908, the city allocated an area for him to organize an exhibition of exotic species of animals for educational purposes.  Opened on January 5, 1911 in the historic Villa Borghese Park, it is one of the oldest zoological gardens in Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The project was fully developed by Karl Hagenbeck, who has already opened a zoo in Hamburg.  In fact, the park was in the same style as the German one: canals, ditches and wide green spaces.  The first idea of ‚Äã‚Äãturning a zoo into a biopark was presented in 1994.  In 1997, a project was presented on how the park of the future should appear. </p><p>  According to numerous reviews of the zoo in Rome, visiting it is an immersion in the natural world, aimed at disseminating the importance of preserving animal species and the conditions from which they come.  The biopark is aimed at families with children and schools, offers many activities, animal exhibitions, thematic events and 26 training courses.  More than 600 thousand people visit it annually, as this is one of the main attractions of the city of Rome. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.romeinsiderguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lemur at the zoo of Rome" class="if uuid-2552250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93772/2552250.jpg"></div><h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  Since ancient Roman times, animals have played an important role in Italian culture.  The Roman Zoo continues this heritage, and here you can see the following animals: elephants, zebras, tigers, Iranian leopards and <span>Asian lions,</span> and among the rarest species - black lemur, dwarf hippo.  More common animals are also present, such as donkeys, goats, sheep, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bioparco.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Camels in the zoo of Rome" class="if uuid-2552249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93772/2552249.jpg"></div><p>  In accordance with the rules, a sign (in Italian and English) is described next to each living creature, describing not only its name and characteristics, but also the area inhabited by this species.  This information is a sad reminder of the dangers of animal extinction and the role of zoos such as a biopark. </p><h2>  What to do with young children? </h2><p>  For kids there are ‚Äúanimals‚Äù in the farmyard.  These are pigs, goats, lambs, donkeys, rabbits and chickens.  Children are encouraged to pet, feed and learn how to take care of them.  In addition, there is a playground designed in the shape of an ark with swings, seats in the shade and water fountains. </p><h2>  What about places to stay and eat? </h2><p>  There are many places to relax in the shade with comfortable chairs, including the beautiful Oasis Lake, where you can have a picnic.  There are also toilets, a souvenir shop, a small cafe at the entrance to the zoo and a rather expensive restaurant with great views.  In general, this place is one of the best to visit in Rome for children and adults, if you want to relax. </p><h2>  Where to find how to get to the zoo in Rome? </h2><p>  Biopark is a small zoo located at <span>Villa Borghese in Rome,</span> Italy.  This huge park is located north of the center of Rome and can be found by taking the metro to the Spagna station and then following the signs.  Once you leave the long <span>subway tunnel,</span> just keep going north around the block and into the park. </p><p>  The zoo is located close to tram lines 3 and 19. Alternatively, you can walk through the park with the <span>Spanish Steps.</span>  Another way to get to the zoo is from the Flaminio metro station + 10 minutes on foot, or by tram 19. Buses 3, 52, 53, 926, 217, 360, 910 pass by the zoo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rome-travel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to the Roman Zoo?" class="if uuid-2564646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93772/2564646.jpg"></div><p>  The zoo provides a pleasant pastime for tourists and entertainment for children.
