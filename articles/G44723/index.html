    <p>  The city of Yalta is rightfully proud of this ancient building.  The “Swallow's Nest” in the 19th century was the estate of a Russian general whose name is still unknown.  The cottage was built on the very slope of the 40-meter Ai-Todor mountain and previously was a wooden cottage. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many famous artists painted amazing paintings from him.  After the death of the general, the estate became the property of the court doctor Tobin, who later donated it to his beloved wife.  In 1903, the cottage was bought by an unknown merchant, and from that time the estate began to be called "Swallow's Nest." </p><p>  The whole story of this magnificent castle is real, it is very eloquently told to visiting tourists who, as if spellbound, listen to the guide.  Today, this miniature palace with a spacious panoramic platform and restaurant is a symbol of the coast.  From its height, a picturesque view of the Yalta Bay. </p><p>  The estate really bears a resemblance to a bird's nest.  The unique man-made structure is owned by the municipality of the city.  It is this architectural monument that is famous for Yalta.  “Swallow's Nest” is a real work of art that evokes vivid emotions among visitors.  Here once filmed the film "Ten Little Indians".  It is adjacent to the stone building "Captain's Bridge", near which there is a rugged rock Sail with a sculpture of an eagle.  Yachts, boats and motor ships moor in this bay. </p><h2>  Climb to the famous peak </h2>
