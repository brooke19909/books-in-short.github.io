A waterfall, rocks, mountains, rivers and forests - all this can be enjoyed in Beloretsk, breathing clean air and contemplating untouched nature.  There is also a nature reserve that cannot be deprived of attention.  But everything will be described in order in the description of the sights of Beloretsk. </p><h2>  Stalevar Mashevsky </h2><div class="photo" data-original="wp.ttreid.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stela Beloretsk" class="if uuid-2959135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2959135.jpg"></div><p>  Stalevar Mashevsky is a monument to the metallurgists of Beloretsk, which stands at the entrance to this wonderful city.  The metallurgical plant is what Beloretsk is famous for.  Metallurgy here has long reached a high level, in honor of which about forty years ago this monument was erected to Anatoly Mashevsky.  This attraction of the city of Beloretsk symbolizes the courage, firmness, strength and industriousness of the Ural people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Monument to Belarussian metallurgists </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bashinform.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Belorechans-Metallurgists" class="if uuid-2959137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2959137.jpg"></div><p>  Another significant place in the city is a monument to Belarussian metallurgists, which is part of the memorial complex.  A huge stele of metal stands in the center, on which heroes of metallurgists are glorified.  Here, on the marble wall, the names of almost a thousand engineers, workers, metallurgists, who fought and gave their lives for their homeland, for their families, for their city, are engraved. </p><h2>  Avenue of Heroes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nashural.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Heroes Alley in Beloretsk" class="if uuid-2959138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2959138.jpg"></div><p>  As in almost all cities of the former Soviet Union, in Beloretsk there is an <span>avenue of Heroes.</span>  Nobody is forgotten and nothing is forgotten by the citizens of this city.  People remember, respect and thank their ancestors for their victory in the Great Patriotic War.  The Eternal Flame has been burning in front of the memorial since May 9, 1985.  They lay flowers here, honor the memory of heroes.  On the plate are words of gratitude.  To be imbued with history, remember and thank the heroes, it is worth visiting this place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "This is our story." </h2><p>  Another attraction of Beloretsk is a monument that bears such a name.  ‚ÄúThis is our story‚Äù is dedicated to all those who went on a campaign ‚Äî the partisan army of the Urals, commanded by Vasily Konstantinovich Blucher.  The legend commander is depicted in a military uniform with a saber.  Behind the monument on marble slabs you can see episodes of the raid. </p><h2>  Water tower </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sony-club.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water tower in Beloretsk" class="if uuid-2959139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2959139.jpg"></div><p>  An amazing memorial site of this city is the water tower, built more than a hundred years ago.  For a very long time it was the tallest building in Beloretsk, from it you could even see the outskirts of the city and the villages surrounding it.  True, the height of this tower will not impress a modern person - it barely reaches twenty meters.  But a hundred years ago it was a significant indicator.  In the 1950s, the tower ceased to function.  The last time the water supply from this water tower was in 1956, and now it is only a attraction of Beloretsk, a memorable place for the inhabitants of this city. </p><h2>  Beloretsk Museum of History and Local Lore </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bashinform.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beloretsk Museum of History and Local Lore" class="if uuid-2959140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2959140.jpg"></div><p>  He began his activities about sixty years ago.

We single out the main ones. </p><p>  Nature in every corner of the planet is beautiful in itself.  And this city is no exception.  One of the most beautiful and amazing places in Beloretsk is considered a reserve, which can only be accessed as part of an excursion group.  But it will be possible to stay in it for the night, if you take tents with you.  Here you can enjoy not only flowers, trees, but also meet wild animals: bears, martens, squirrels, hares, foxes, wolves, deer, moose.  Inhaling clean air, you can enjoy the singing of rare birds.  The reserve is shocking in its size, so unfortunately it will not work to inspect everything.  To do this, you need to spend much more time than one day. </p><p>  Within Beloretsk you can swim in the rivers: </p><ul><li>  Small Inzer; </li><li>  Mindyak; </li><li>  Lemeza; </li><li>  White. </li></ul><p>  Natural attractions in Beloretsk (Bashkiria) are amazing, as you can see by looking at the photo of the Small Inzer River. </p><p>  Some rivers originate in the territory of the famous reserve.
