Unfortunately, expensive metropolitan apartments are a luxury for many, but outside the Moscow Ring Road you can find more affordable options.  What level of comfort do these complexes offer?  Are they worth the investment?  LCD "Lyubertsy" - a project that has attracted a lot of attention from potential buyers, and all because it combines a lot of advantages.  How justified are the expectations of future residents?  This is what we will talk about in this material. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  In Lyubertsy, just 7 km from MKAD, a large-scale project of the Lyubertsky residential complex is being implemented.  On a plot of 41 hectares, it is planned to erect 11 panel houses with a height of 9 to 25 floors, as well as all necessary social infrastructure facilities.  The comfort of metropolitan life, harmoniously combined with the delights of the suburban - this is how the developer describes his project.  And all this at a reasonable price.  By the way, it is affordable price and favorable conditions for the acquisition of real estate that have attracted the attention of potential buyers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zhk-liuberetskii.sob.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd lyubertsy peak reviews" class="if uuid-2973520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2973520.jpg"></div><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  Great attention in choosing a residential complex should be given to the company that leads the design and construction work.  The quality, reliability and reasonableness of buildings largely depend on its reliability, level of professionalism.  Until 2017, the project was led by Morton.  But after the merger of a number of construction organizations, the Peak Group began to act as a developer.  Currently, it is the largest <span>construction company in Moscow</span> and the region, on whose account dozens of successfully implemented projects.  Attention to detail, focus on the requirements of modern Muscovites, thoughtfulness and functionality of each project are what are characteristic of the Peak Group.  Those who live in commissioned complexes emphasize that they have never regretted the choice they made - all the houses are delivered on time, the finishing work was carried out efficiently, without any complaints, and the entire infrastructure has been functioning from the first day of delivery of the facilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At present, PIK Group is building new buildings in almost every district of the capital and the region.  This only emphasizes the importance of the company in the modern real estate market, the trust of potential buyers in it.  Even in the context of the financial crisis, management managed to keep the company afloat and hand over all their projects. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city of Lyubertsy near Moscow was chosen for the construction of the complex.  Only 7 km separate it from the Moscow Ring Road.  If you are familiar with this area, you will probably be confused by the building density and heavy traffic flow.  What makes the Lyubertsky LCD (PIK) so attractive?  Reviews of the first buyers focus on the green area of ‚Äã‚Äã17 hectares, tightly adjacent to the complex.  Thus, it is possible to protect residents of new buildings from noise, dust, while giving a zone for walking and recreation.  And all this is close to the Moscow Ring Road: you can get to the capital in just 20 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd lyubertsy peak customer reviews" class="if uuid-2973533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2973533.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, the complex is being built in an already developed and existing microdistrict, so residents of even the first buildings will not feel any inconvenience. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  If your family has a private car, you can not worry about the distance from the city center.  But what about those who have to get to work on public transport ?.  Most often, such categories of citizens prefer metropolitan new buildings, without even considering those that are outside the city.  In this case, the Lyubertsky residential complex was an exception.  Customer reviews emphasize that it is the transport accessibility of the area that largely affected its popularity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can go to the Moscow Ring Road along the Kosinskoye Shosse: currently, active road repair work is underway on this section, which will relieve congestion in the near future, including in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Lyubertsky residential complex (PIK).  Customer reviews could not ignore the proximity to public transport: just a 2-minute walk there is a stop where you can get not only to the metro, but also to other parts of the capital.  There are enough routes, they run with enviable regularity.  The area has a developed railway connection: an excellent alternative to buses and minibuses.  If you do not want to be late for work, having stood in a traffic jam, give preference to electric trains, which always leave according to the schedule. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  How comfortable was the LCD Lyuberetsky (PIK)?  Reviews of the first inhabitants - an objective assessment of reality.  The project is being built in an area with developed infrastructure, nevertheless, to ensure maximum comfort for each buyer, the developer has laid down the construction of two kindergartens for 500 children, a comprehensive school for 1,100 students, its own clinic and hospital, as well as an Orthodox church for parishioners and a sports complex for children and their parents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sanych-msk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd lyubertsy reviews" class="if uuid-2973517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2973517.jpg"></div><p>  In the area you will definitely not encounter a shortage of shops and entertainment: within walking distance are supermarkets, an entertainment center.  Landscaping was carried out, due to which there were walking areas, bike paths, sports and playgrounds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The first floors of the buildings will be reserved for commercial infrastructure: there will be shops, laundries, dry cleaners, cafes and restaurants, pharmacies. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  What do we pay attention to first when choosing an apartment?  Experts agree that the main criteria are price, location and layout of apartments.  We really miss the security issue.  So the developer has provided everything for you, equipped with a video surveillance system LCD "Lyubertsy".  Cameras are installed on the territory of the entire complex, which allows you to track everything that happens on it.  It is no longer scary to let children go to the playground, because they are always under supervision. </p><p>  To ensure the necessary safety, the yards were isolated from through traffic.  At the same time, terrestrial and multi-level parking lots are provided for residents, solving the problem inherent in most complexes of the Moscow Region. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  Housing LCD "Lyubertsy" are located in such a way that residents will never have a feeling of discomfort.  The developer managed to avoid the main problem of the Moscow Region - too dense development.  Space, lightness, an abundance of light and air are what the apartments in the Lyubertsky residential complex were able to fill. </p><div class="photo" data-original="flatory.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments in LCD Lyubertsy" class="if uuid-2973542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2973542.jpg"></div><p>  So, small studios are presented to customers, as well as one-, two-, three- and four-room options.  The large kitchen in each apartment is a gift from the developer, the opportunity to recreate the European version of the living-dining room, isolating the bedrooms.  It is now possible to store things, household utensils, tools and blanks in the pantry, which will also appear in each apartment of the Lyubertsky residential complex.  Reviews emphasize that every square meter is thought out, which allows rational organization of living space and provide comfort to every resident.  Each apartment has a loggia with panoramic glazing. </p><p>  All sections are equipped with modern elevators for passenger and freight transportation, there is a place for storing bicycles and prams.  A concierge room is also available. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  All buildings in the LCD "Lyubertsy" surrender with a turnkey finish.  You can relate to this fact in different ways, but this is rather an advantage, because right after receiving the keys you can bring furniture and equip yourself.  Work is carried out on time, without any complaints by qualified specialists.  And they didn‚Äôt have a big impact on the final cost, as before, an apartment can be purchased at a bargain price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novostroev.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Lyubertsy 1 building" class="if uuid-2973545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2973545.jpg"></div><p>  Each apartment has two-chamber double-glazed windows of European manufacture, modern heating radiators, as well as plumbing.  The decoration is represented by wallpaper on the walls, stretch ceilings, laminate on the floor, installed entrance and interior doors of excellent quality.  The apartments are completely ready for living, it remains only to bring furniture, so they will be an excellent option for those who are not ready to wait for repairs or simply can not afford such a big financial investment. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  Completion is scheduled for the 1st quarter of 2019.  At present, 1 building of the Lyubertsky residential complex has been commissioned and put into operation, by the way, without any delays.  The happy owners of the apartments have already received their keys, settled in and set about arranging their family nest. </p><h2>  Price of apartments </h2><p>  We have already mentioned several times the budget cost of real estate in the residential complex Lyubertsky, which is ensured by the rational approach of the developer.  So, you can buy an apartment here for 3 million rubles - a studio of 30 m2.  Spacious four-room apartment with decoration will cost 9 million rubles.  Amounts are rather big, but, believe me, in Moscow the living space is at least twice as expensive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lyubertsy.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcu lyuberetsky customer reviews" class="if uuid-2973525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2973525.jpg"></div><h2>  Terms of purchase </h2><p>  The developer offers preferential conditions for the purchase of apartments in the residential complex "Lyubertsky".  Reviews of the first buyers focus on installments until the end of the construction period. </p><p>  The developer holds promotions, discounts per square meter.  And cooperation with the largest banks allows you to issue a mortgage of 7% per annum.  You can learn more about the conditions of the acquisition at the sales office, where competent staff will advise you. </p><h2>  Benefits identified </h2><p>  The optimal price-to-location ratio is what many have fallen in love with for the project.  After wandering around new buildings near Moscow, having considered all the possible options, many settled on the Lyubertsky residential complex.  Mystery shopper reviews emphasize that this is the best option with such proximity to Moscow.  Yes, it‚Äôs still a long time before building our own infrastructure, but now you can use the benefits of the microdistrict.  There are enough shops, to "Mega" just 20 minutes.  Children can be easily accommodated in the local kindergarten and school. </p><p>  Getting to the capital according to the experience of the first tenants is more convenient on the train: quickly and economically.  In the short term, the opening of a new metro station, respectively, in new apartment buildings will be even more expensive.  That is why you should not miss your chance - sign up for an inspection of the complex right now and make your purchase as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="topnovostroek.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Lyuberetsky cameras" class="if uuid-2973556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2973556.jpg"></div><p>  Own closed territory is an undeniable advantage.  You can rest assured: no unauthorized persons, round-the-clock video surveillance system that provides the highest level of security.  And what is no less valuable is the absence of a problem with parking spaces, at least for today. </p><p>  The quality of construction is above all.  It is this principle that the builder adheres to; it was possible to implement it within the framework of this project.  All work was done efficiently, the materials and technologies used do not raise any questions. </p><p>  And, of course, the affordable price of apartments.  LCD "Lyubertsy" was a real salvation for those who are tired of renting a house, have long dreamed of buying their own square meters and, finally, fulfilled their dream. </p><h2>  Weaknesses </h2><p>  Location is an advantage of the project, but it has become its drawback.  The developer does not mention anywhere close to the city dump for completely objective reasons.  Indeed, it is present, but it does not cause any discomfort to residents.  Moreover, at the moment, residents are complaining about traffic jams, hours of traffic jams that impede movement in personal vehicles.  Many had to transfer to trains. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.7039548" data-lng="37.904850099999976" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/0/6/8/12068.png"></div><p>  In the rented apartments there are no water meters - something that the first tenants who checked in noted.  True, the developer promised in the shortest possible time period to eliminate the existing shortcomings. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Buying an apartment in the residential complex "Lyubertsky" is an excellent investment.  Spacious and bright apartments in buildings adjacent to the green zone are a dream for a modern Muscovite.  At the same time, residents are not deprived of the comfort of metropolitan life, they can enjoy all the benefits of humanity and the developed infrastructure of the microdistrict, including social.  If at the moment you have not had time to visit the complex, be sure to correct the situation, consult with the specialists of PIK Group of Companies.  Surely they will help you make the right choice and make a purchase on the most favorable terms. </p>
