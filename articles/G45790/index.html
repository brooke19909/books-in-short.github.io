    <h2>  Soldering spiral </h2><p>  If we consider conventional 20 W models, then the <span>repair of energy-saving lamps</span> with a burned-out spiral should begin with an inspection of the base.  Twisting it is quite simple.  After that, it is important to disconnect the starter.  In this case, it is important not to damage the luminograph. </p><p>  After disconnecting the element, it remains to remove the glass tube.  In order to remove the spiral from the lamp, you will have to use pliers.  After that, the output contacts are checked.  Pull the new spiral through the tube very carefully.  To fix the ends on the plate, you will have to use a blowtorch.  After this, it remains only to install the luminograph and base in the same place. </p>

    <h2>  Electrode Replacement </h2><p>  Electrodes very often cause model breakdown.  In this case, the repair of an energy <span>-</span> saving <span>lamp with your own hands</span> should begin with an inspection of the base.  Twisting it is not difficult.  After that, you need to remove the starter.

The next step is direct inspection of the electrodes.  If dark spots are visible on them, then they are the cause of the malfunction.  In this case, two small wiring is required.  However, it is important to clean the surface of the starter before soldering them.  Wiring to the electrodes should be soldered carefully.  After this, it remains only to replace the spiral. </p>

    <h2>  Malfunctions of luminographs </h2><p>  When overloaded on the network, luminographs often fail.  Without knowledge of the electrical circuit, repairing energy-saving lamps with your own hands is difficult to start.  Many experts primarily recommend unscrewing and inspecting the base.  Then it is important to disconnect the starter.  If his contacts are in order, you should examine the luminograph directly.  In many models, it is located next to the inductor. </p><p>  When the luminograph breaks, external damage is difficult to find.  In this case, the device is checked using a tester.  The resistance parameter on the contacts must be 33 ohms.  If the device shows a zero value, it means that the device simply burned out and caused the spiral to burn out.  It is quite difficult to fix the item yourself.  It is also important to consider its compactness.  In this case, you can simply purchase a similar luminograph.  The next step is to replace the spiral.  After that, the starter and the base are put in the same place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Base Contacts </h2><p>  Contacts most often burn out due to manufacturing defects.  After replacing the spiral, repair of an energy-saving lamp with your own hands should begin by disconnecting the base.  The next step is to disconnect the starter.  Only then can the contacts be checked on the underside of the plate. </p><p>  Quite often they look darkened.  However, to verify their malfunction, you should use a tester.  Resistance must be approximately 30 ohms.  In the event of a breakdown, changing the contacts on the lamp separately is very difficult.  In this situation, a new scheme is bought immediately.  After replacing it, it remains to solder the spiral. </p><h2>  Starter Repair </h2><p>  The starter of the model is the most expensive element, and it breaks down quite often.  Do-it-yourself repair of energy-saving lamps in this case, experts advise starting with an inspection of the basement.  After removing it, the resistance at the contacts is checked.  In order to disconnect the starter, you can use any sharp object.  To find out about the malfunction of the element, you will have to use a tester.  If the starter shows less than 10 ohms, it means that it does not pass current well.  In such a situation, the part will have to be changed.  Only after that it will be possible to solder the spirals. </p><h2>  Inductor Repair </h2><p>  Lamp inductors are very compact and inexpensive.  They break more often due to overvoltage.  In this case, the repair of energy-saving lamps with your own hands should begin by disconnecting the base and the protective plate.  The starter will also have to be cleaned.  When the inductor breaks, black spots are visible on it.  In this case, you won‚Äôt have to use a tester. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To replace a specified item, it is important to know its labeling.  Also in the workshop you can just name the brand of the lamp.  In order to install a new inductor, you need to use a soldering iron.  The element‚Äôs contacts are very small, so be careful.  After installing the inductor, you can proceed directly to the replacement of the spiral. </p><h2>  Lamps "Maxus" </h2><p>  At lamps of this company, as a rule, starters fail.  Also, problems may arise with contacts.  In any case, the repair of Maxus energy-saving lamps should begin with an inspection of the base.  Then it is important to twist the protective plate.  If we consider the standard model for 15 V, then to remove the starter, you can use any sharp object.  After that, the starter is first inspected.  For this, a tester is used.  If everything is in order, it means that the problem most likely lies in burnt contacts.  In this case, do-it-yourself DIY repair of energy-saving Maxus lamps begins by unscrewing the inductor.  It is also important to strip the plate.  After replacing the chip, you have to tackle the spiral.  To do this, use blowtorches. </p>

    <h2>  Problems with Navigator lamps </h2><p>  Lamps of this brand break quite rarely.  However, in some cases, it is the inductors that fail.  Repair of energy-saving Navigator lamps in this case should be started by disconnecting the base.  At this point, it is important not to damage the starter.  When examining the chip, it is important to pay attention to the output contacts.  Removing the inductor from the lamp is quite simple. </p><p>  If dark spots are visible on it, it means that the element is out of order and probably caused the spiral to burn out.  In order to replace the inductor, it is important to know the brand of the element.  A conventional <span>blowtorch is</span> used for installation <span>.</span>  After that, the output resistance in the circuit is immediately checked.  This parameter must be at least 30 ohms.  If the indicator is within normal limits, then you can begin to replace the spiral.  Lastly, a starter and a base are placed. </p>

Do-it-yourself repair of energy-saving Kamelion lamps in this case, experts advise starting with an inspection of the basement.  After that, it is important to disconnect the chip and check the contacts.  If dark spots are visible on them, the output impedance should be measured. </p><p>  You will have to use a tester for this.  Many experts advise buying only imported starters.  In the market they are quite expensive, but their quality is excellent.  In order to change the starter, a soldering iron is not required.

    <h2>  OEM lamps </h2><p>  Lamps of this company rarely break.  However, contact problems do happen.  In such a situation, the repair of energy-saving lamps with their own hands should begin with an inspection of the base and the starter.  To check the contacts of the model, twist the bottom cover and also disconnect the plate.  In many models, it is screwed in.  The next step on the tester is checking the starter.  If the resistance is within the normal range, then you should inspect the luminograph or inductor.  To do this, prepare a screwdriver in advance.  The luminograph in all models is located with the starter. </p><p>  Recognizing it on a chip is quite simple, since it is the biggest element.  In order not to damage the starter, you need to use the nippers and carefully disconnect the element.  At the bottom of the device is a small capacitor.  As a rule, the problem is in it.  In order to repair the luminograph, it is enough just to purchase a new capacitor in the workshop.  If we talk about the breakdown of the inductor, in this case it is more advisable to contact a service center. </p>

    <h2>  Problems with Philips Lamps </h2><p>  Lamps of this brand stand out for their excellent quality and are in great demand.  However, in some cases, the spiral burns out in them.  This can happen for several reasons.  First of all, experts note a weak inductor.  Also, the problem with models may be in the luminograph.  In this case, it is difficult to repair the device yourself. </p><p>  However, the user is able to replace the luminograph without the involvement of specialists.  First of all, the base and starter are removed.  If there is no tester, then the output contacts can always be checked visually.  If they do not have any defects, then the problem lies precisely in the inductor. </p>
