    <h2>  Opinion about the location of the hotel </h2><p>  This hotel, according to vacationers, is located near Rethymno.  So, by bus (the stop is a short walk from the hotel) you can get here in a quarter of an hour.  Near the hotel there are shops and taverns where you can buy everything you need and eat delicious food at very reasonable prices.  Ekavi Hotel 3 * is located in a calm and quiet place on the beach.

    <h2>  Reviews on beach vacations and activities </h2><p>  As for the beach, it is literally next to the hotel: you just have to go down the stairs from the terrace and you will find yourself a few meters from the water's edge.  According to travelers, entering the sea near the hotel is not very convenient.  So, there are a lot of sharp stones, and swimming without special shoes is not recommended.  However, the majority of vacationers, going ashore, turned left and went to the beach of the nearest five-star hotel.  Here the coast is sandy and pebble.  Water is warm and clear everywhere.  A big plus of local beaches, many guests considered the fact that due to the remoteness from large settlements, there are few people here. </p><p>  Speaking of entertainment, tourists note that you should not expect animations or any other entertainment events at Ekavi Hotel 3 *.  Most travelers choosing this hotel prefer to combine beach vacations and poolside activities with trips to interesting places of Crete.  To do this, you can either rent a car at one of the many rental points, or buy a tour. </p>
