The task of this frontier fort was to protect the Russian lands from robberies of small hordes that scurried along the vast expanses of the steppe.  Later, the city of Khvalynsk was formed opposite Sosnovka.  We will consider its sights in the article. </p><p>  Historically, these lands became a haven for Old Believers.  Nowadays, Khvalynsk is the district center of the Saratov region.  According to one version, the name of the city comes from the word "praises."  So in ancient times they called the people who lived, or rather roamed, in these parts.  Others argue that the city received this name due to its proximity to the Caspian Sea, which at that time was called Hwalis. </p><p>  Residents of Khvalynsk were engaged in fishing, chalk extraction, and farming, and the local gardens were especially famous for it. </p><h2>  Chalk mountains </h2><p>  What is interesting Khvalynsk?  Natural attractions are very beautiful here.  Among them stand out chalk mountains.  In addition to their slopes overgrown with pine forest, there are deposits of gypsum, quartz sand, various types of clay, mineral dyes, limestone, phosphorites.  On the territory of the chalk cliffs there are many springs. </p><h2>  Gallery </h2><p>  What is worth seeing for those who are interested in the city of Khvalynsk?  The attractions of this city are diverse.  In Khvalynsk there is a picture gallery named after Petrov-Vodkin.  Here are the works of the famous artist, as well as paintings belonging to the brush of his friends, artists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  However, over time, everything was destroyed.  Only the white stone elegant chapel that stands near the spring has survived.  According to legend, the water in it is sacred.  Therefore, near the chapel there is a font where you can take a bath.  Nearby is the resort "Solnechnaya Polyana". </p><h2>  Monk's cave </h2><p>  Not far from Khvalynsk, near the village of Podlesnoye, there is a monk's cave.  Monks lived here in solitude.  They equipped two rooms in the <span>chalk mountain</span> .  One was for prayers and rest, the other for other necessities.  Nowadays only distant rooms in which prayers were read have been preserved.  Old-timers remember the stories of the last monk Seraphim, who lived in these caves and helped the locals, since he was a skilled healer.  A sanatorium called the Monk's Cave is open not far from this place. </p><h2>  Ski resort </h2><p>  The city of Khvalynsk, the sights of which we are considering, is a wonderful place for lovers of outdoor activities.  Here is the ski resort of the same name.  This is one of the best resorts of the Volga region, built in 2004.
