Due to the fact that this state is too elongated from north to south, you can relax in it at any time of the year.  There is no so-called rainy season, as in Thailand and other tropical countries.  Rather, it is, but showers do not cover all of Vietnam.  When it rains in the south, beautiful and sunny weather reigns in the north.  Nha Trang is the number one resort in Vietnam, especially for Russian tourists.  This city has a lot of fun and beautiful beaches.  Already these two factors are enough for hotels of different stars to grow in the resort like mushrooms after rain.  The Fives in Vietnam are beyond praise.  Four-star hotels are not much inferior to them.  What about the triples?  What can a budget traveler in Vietnam expect?  We will consider all aspects of leisure on the example of La Mer Hotel 3 * <span>(Nha Trang).</span>  <span>Reviews of</span> tourists and their photos have become for us the main informative base. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="La Mer Hotel 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538906.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel "La Mer Hotel 3 *" </h2><p>  This hotel opened only last fifteenth year, so not all taxi drivers know where it is.  And it is located north of the center of Nha Trang.  But the remoteness from the noise and din of the Vietnamese resort only plays into the hands of La Mer Hotel 3 *.  Only the highway separating the hotel from the sea violates peace.  The hotel in the avenues is called the ‚Äúsecond line‚Äù.  This is actually not the case.  Nothing obscures the hotel from the beach, and the views from the rooms open are simply magnificent.  In addition, many tourists praise the location of the hotel.  Only three hundred meters (five minutes walk) - and you are in the Stone Garden Hong Chong, one of the attractions of Nha Trang.  Towers of Po-Nagar-Cham go a little over a kilometer.  And if you want to be in the midst of fun, then right at the gates of the hotel there is a bus stop.  Route number 4 takes you to the main avenues of Nha Trang in a quarter of an hour.  Camran International Airport is forty-two kilometers from the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="La Mer Hotel 3 Vietnam" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538908.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, everything around shines with novelty and purity.  The hotel is a nine-story building, located on the corner of the street.  It was designed so that of all one hundred percent of the rooms overlooking the sea.  The house is very beautiful, white and turquoise, designed in a modern style.  The hotel does not have territory as such.  Three-star <span>hotels in Vietnam,</span> and even in the city, do not have a park.  But there is a guarded parking lot, by the way, free for hotel guests.  Having crossed the threshold of the hotel, you find yourself in a beautiful and spacious lobby, where the reception is open 24 hours a day.  When checking in, ask for a room on the ninth or at least eighth floor.  At the height you can not hear the noise of the road, and the views open are simply gorgeous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="La Mer Hotel 3 (Nha Trang)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538872.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Despite the fact that La Mer Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang) occupies a nine-story building, it is a very small hotel.  It has only twenty-eight rooms.  As a rule, people travel together or as families.  Therefore, lonely travelers always experience inconvenience.  But this hotel takes into account their requests.  They will not need to pay for a double room.  For single tourists, the apartments are Superior and Deluxe.  Most rooms at the hotel are designed for two guests.  They are divided into the categories of "superior", "deluxe" and (the best) "senior deluxe".  All guest rooms have panoramic windows and balconies with amazing views of the sea.  Each room also has its own bathroom, equipped with new, well-functioning plumbing.  Reviews say that the soundproofing in the hotel is excellent, and there is no living creature.  The rooms are fully consistent with the photos on the site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="La Mer Hotel 3 Vietnam (Nha Trang)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538859.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the cozy bedroom there is a king-size bed (or two separate beds), a bedside table, a small wardrobe, a mirror with a dressing table and ottoman.  Reliable air conditioning, installed so that it does not blow.  A flat-screen TV with satellite channels.  There is also a refrigerator in the room, where the maid puts bottles of drinking water every day.  Tourists liked the presence of an electric kettle.  But this is not the whole service.  The maid puts tea bags, coffee, sugar.  There are glasses and spoons.  The bathroom deserves special mention.  It has a hairdryer, which is a big plus for a three-star hotel.  And every day they bring not only soap, shampoo and shower gel, but also toothpaste with a brush!  The cleaning is very thorough, with a change of towels.  Tourists say that they left valuables in a prominent place several times, but nothing was lost. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  La Mer Hotel 3 * <span>(Nha Trang)</span> positions itself as a B &amp; B. This abbreviation means that in this hotel you will be provided with not only a bed, but also breakfast.  It occurs in mixed mode.  Some dishes are displayed on a common table in a buffet format.  These are vegetable slices and fruits (pineapples, bananas, watermelons, "dragon's heart", etc.).  You can also drink coffee and tea in unlimited quantities.  And the rest of the dishes are on the menu.  You are offered a choice of two types of soup (and this is for breakfast!), Scrambled eggs or fried eggs.  Breakfasts are basically the same - fruits, vegetables, or soups can change.  Tourists rated the food at the hotel highly.  Many did not expect such a budget accommodation of free breakfasts.  It serves signature Pho soup, which tourists recommend tasting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="La Mer Hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538874.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Restaurants and cafes nearby </h2><p>  Hotel La Mer Hotel 3 * is located on the northern outskirts of Nha Trang, far from all entertainment (and, accordingly, noise).  But the disadvantage of this location is that there are no cafes and restaurants nearby.  The nearest catering points are eight hundred meters away.  These are restaurants specializing in Vietnamese cuisine An Ha and Nyat Fong Sefood (in the hotel of the same name).  For those who do not accept exotic foods, you can recommend the cafe "Lesha".  It is located near the VDB hotel.  There is a small grocery store within a five-minute walk of La Mer Hotel.  But if you go even further, you will get to the Northern <span>market of Nha Trang.</span>  There you can not only stock up on fruits, souvenirs, cheap clothes, but also eat authentic Vietnamese dishes at a cheap price.  In <span>restaurants of Nha Trang, the</span> average bill for two (with the order of alcohol) is three hundred thousand dongs (about fifteen US dollars). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="La Mer Hotel 3 vietnam reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538864.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Of course, tourists travel to Vietnam mainly over the warm sea.  And the name La Mer Hotel 3 * is very symbolic.  Indeed, in translation from French, it means "sea".  The beach is located immediately across the road.  The hotel administration claims that it has a designated area for guests, with a shower, free sunbeds and umbrellas.  By the way, beach towels are issued at the reception.  They are also free, feel free to ask.  As for the quality of the beach, tourists complain about the abundance of stones.  When the sea is worried, you can injure yourself or cut your leg on a sharp boulder.  But if you move a little to the left of the hotel, you find yourself on a very good coast, with sand and a smooth entry into the sea.  But for beach ammunition here already have to pay fifty thousand dongs.  The sea in this part of Nha Trang is clean.  But the central beaches of the resort can not be said.  If in the evening the guests of La Mer have to go to the city for amusements, then in the afternoon tourists from other hotels come to the northern outskirts to swim in the clear sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="La Mer Hotel 3 Nha Trang reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538871.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Most of the services in the La Mer Hotel 3 * hotel are praised by Wi-Fi.  He is free, very playful and catches in all rooms, including on the balconies.  An unusual service, especially for a three-star hotel, is a launderette.  The reception is open around the clock; its employees are fluent in English.  There you can put valuables in a safe or put things in a left-luggage office.  The hotel also has a currency exchange office with the same exchange rate as throughout the city.  Of the paid services, tourists mention the rental of bicycles, scooters and cars, transfers to and from the airport, room service, and a massage. </p><h2>  Things to do in Nha Trang </h2><p>  Tourists recommend not limited to one beach holiday near the hotel La Mer Hotel 3 * (Vietnam).  Nha Trang, whose name is pronounced Nha Trang, is a very interesting city.  You can reach the center by bus or walk in fifteen minutes.  In this part of Nha Trang, you should explore the European Quarter with the cathedral and Long Son Pagoda.  In the southern part of the resort is Villa Bao Dai.  And in the north, where, in fact, the hotel is located, there are such attractions as the Hong Chong Rock Garden, the ancient towers of Po Nagar Cham, the hydropathic at Thap Ba thermal springs.  The main place of children's entertainment in Nha Trang is Hong Che Island.  It is fully occupied by the gigantic amusement park Winperl and the water park.

Despite the fact that there is a road under the hotel building, the rooms are quite quiet.  Hotel service is very good.  The staff is kind and it‚Äôs clear that all the employees, from maids to top managers, are trying to please you.  As for a three-star hotel, La Mer provides a host of services.  Free Internet access, laundry, parking - this is not found in hotels of a higher class.  The hotel also has a private beach.  Thus, guests do not need to pay for sunbeds and umbrellas.
