Many users believe that after buying a phone, you don‚Äôt need to worry about anything else.  But actually it is not.  Sooner or later, the time will come when you want to learn how to reset your phone. </p><h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  Resetting is a function of each smartphone that allows you to reset all your settings and parameters in order to restore the previous appearance of the device, the one that was after the purchase.  In this case, all files, changes and settings are erased from the smartphone, so it is imperative that you understand that you can lose all your personal photos, music, videos and documents. </p><h2>  For what? </h2><p>  Why do I need to figure out how to reset my phone?  Unfortunately, few modern users understand the principle of the device and its operation.  Because of this, faults often begin due to the fault of the owner of the phone. </p><p>  They can occur due to the fact that the smartphone is overloaded with files.  Sometimes malicious files that just take up space can get into the system, but you cannot delete them yourself.  Often the problem may be in programs that do not work correctly.  There may be questions about compatibility.  All this in one way or another will lead to crashes and errors. </p><p>  The user will begin to notice that the phone lives its own life.  He begins to freeze, slow down, shut down abnormally.  Sometimes it starts or closes programs on its own.  Can call or send messages to your friends without your knowledge.  To avoid this, you will have to understand how to reset the settings on the phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to reset your smartphone" class="if uuid-3249756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3249756.jpg"></div><p>  But here you should immediately understand that this method of error correction is not a panacea for all problems.  Some of them may be due to irreversible system or hardware changes in the device.  Therefore, if returning to the factory settings did not help you, most likely you will have to contact a service center. </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  Before you figure out how to reset your phone, you need to prepare your device for this process.  Remember that with Hard Reset, all data is erased, including messages, contacts, calendar notes, etc. What should I do? </p><ol><li>  Remember the Google account on the device. </li><li>  Back up data. </li><li>  Connect your smartphone to a wall outlet and via Wi-Fi to the Internet. </li></ol><h2>  Account </h2><p>  After you reset to factory settings, you will have to restore the files, and for this you will need to enter your Google account information.  Therefore, before the process it is extremely important to see which account is used, since many of us may have several accounts. </p><p>  To do this, just go to the phone‚Äôs settings, select the ‚ÄúAccounts‚Äù section, and find the corresponding one in the list.  So you can check the username and make sure that all the saved files will be on this account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Google account" class="if uuid-3249759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3249759.jpg"></div><p>  You will also need to remember the password.  If you forgot it and were going to restore it, you will need to wait a day after that before doing a Hard Reset. </p><h2>  Backup copy </h2><p>  Before deciding how to reset the phone to the factory settings, you need to save the data.  The next step is to work with backups.  What is it for? </p><p>  It helps later recover data that will be deleted upon reset.  This refers to messages, contacts, calendar entries and certain settings.  In order to make a backup, you need to go to the phone settings.  It all depends on the version of the operating system and shell, but you need to find the ‚ÄúMemory and backups‚Äù section or something similar. </p><p>  In general, experts recommend backing up periodically so that in case of unforeseen system failures you already have a recovery file ready.  In the "Backup and Restore" section, you can select the "Backup" function.  Here you can save contacts, SMS and MMS, call log, calendar, system settings, applications and even photos in an album. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Backup" class="if uuid-3249763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3249763.jpg"></div><p>  Now you can start saving, and send the finished file even by mail to yourself or to the cloud.  Thanks to him, it will be possible to recover phone data. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Process start </h2><p>  How to make a complete reset of your phone?  It is imperative that the phone is fully charged.  Some even recommend that you do not unplug it so that it does not unplug at the most inopportune moment.  You also need to connect it to a Wi-Fi network.  But, in principle, after a reset, it may again require a connection, so it is only important that you have either mobile Internet or the ability to connect wirelessly to enter your Google account information. </p><p>  There are several ways to reset settings.  The simplest and most common are two: through the settings menu and using a combination of buttons. </p><h2>  Settings menu </h2><p>  How to reset the settings on the Samsung phone or any other?  If your phone lags and slows down but still works, you can do this through the settings menu.  All that is required of you is to find the appropriate section. </p><p>  So, go to "Settings" and look for the "Reset to factory settings" section.  Sometimes it can be in a submenu, so you have to look.  Here, the system offers you to completely delete data or clear internal memory.  In the first case, in addition to files and programs, settings and service information will also be deleted.  In the second, you just get rid of the data in the internal memory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Reset to factory settings" class="if uuid-3249761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3249761.jpg"></div><p>  Selecting "Reset to factory settings", you will start the deletion of all data from the phone.  It may take a certain amount of time.  The main thing - do not interfere in this process.  The phone usually turns off in this case, and then enters a special menu where it starts the deletion.  After rebooting - and now, before you is a brand new system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Hard reset" class="if uuid-3249762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3249762.jpg"></div><h2>  Using a combination of buttons </h2><p>  Sometimes it happens that the phone does not turn on or lags so much that it does not allow you to go to the settings and other menus of the system.  In this case, resetting to the factory settings is easier to do using special buttons. </p><p>  It is imperative that the phone is at least half charged.  Next, turn it off, and then use the volume down and power buttons.  They need to be clamped for a few seconds (usually until the device vibrates or a splash screen appears).  Next, immediately release the keys. </p><p>  Thus, you entered the special Recovery menu where you can launch the desired function.  To move on it, you need to use the volume rocker, and to select the desired command, press the power button.  What to look for here? </p><p>  Usually you need to find wipe data / factory reset or Clear eMMC.  Clear Flash can sometimes occur.  After that, the system will require confirmation of the start of data deletion.  Some phones themselves restart at the end of the process, some require you to select the Reboot System item. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.teamknowhow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reset to factory settings" class="if uuid-3249757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3249757.jpg"></div><h2>  Feature of some models </h2><p>  Some models may require a different combination, so it is extremely important to clarify this point in the instructions for the smartphone. </p><p>  How to reset the settings on a push-button telephone?  Typically, such devices require the use of a special code, which must be entered in the dialing menu.  There are also a large number of them, so you have to look at the instructions or find the relevant information on the Web. </p><p>  Also, some button phones have a special menu.  In this case, proceed as described in the ‚ÄúSettings menu‚Äù section.  The reset principle in this case is practically the same. </p><h2>  After reset </h2><p>  When you figured out how to reset your phone, after it you will need to start data recovery.  The device will reboot itself or with your help.  A welcome message will appear on the screen.  Now you need to select the language, time and connect to the Internet.  Next, the phone will require you to log in to your Google account.  Enter the user name and password. </p><p>  Next, go to the Settings menu and find a backup.  Then we restore the data and use the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Settings menu" class="if uuid-3249760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3249760.jpg"></div><h2>  Problems </h2><p>  But during removal some problems may occur.  For example, some users complain that they have reset, and the phone does not turn on.  In this case, some do not understand, in principle, what to do next, others flee to the service center, and still others begin to independently restore the device. </p><p>  What can be done in the first minutes after a reset when the phone does not turn on: </p><ul><li>  try rebooting; </li><li>  pull out the battery if possible; </li><li>  remove the memory card and SIM card; </li><li>  leave the phone on charge for several hours; </li><li>  reflash device; </li><li>  go to the service center. </li></ul><p>  Usually, nothing like this happens after a factory reset.  But after flashing anything can happen.  Some users do not check the firmware for quality, so after installation it may suffer.  And well, if the phone does not turn into a "brick".  Otherwise, you will have to turn to specialists. </p>
