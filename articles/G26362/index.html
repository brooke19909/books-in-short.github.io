But that is not all.  This is currently the only ski resort in Kiev.  It is located almost in the city center.  Protasov Yar opened in 1998 and has been working without interruption since then.  Here, Kievans and tourists like to ski, and professional athletes, including snowboarders, also prepare for competitions.  But the complex is also known for the fact that holidays and corporate parties are often held on its territory.  Let's get to know him in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Protasov Yar" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2218372.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Location, how to get, working hours </h2><p>  There is a ski complex near the metro station "Republican Stadium".  From there, you can get to the skiing places by trolleybus number 40 or by minibus, the final destination of which is called ‚ÄúVinogradar‚Äù.  The tracks are located on the eastern slope of the so-called Batyva Gora.  The Protasov Yar complex works seven days a week, but riding hours depend on the days of the week.  So, in the winter season on Monday, lifts are open from two in the afternoon until ten in the evening, from Tuesday to Sunday from 10 am to 10 pm.  But it should be borne in mind that these days from 15:40 to 18:00 athletes train on the slopes and slopes, so ordinary skiers are not allowed there at this time.  But on Saturdays, night skating is practiced.  Trails are open from ten in the morning until four o‚Äôclock the next day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Protasov jar Kiev" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2218364.jpg"></div>

Therefore, the ski complex "Protasov Yar" for a long time possessed only three slopes.  Two of them have a height difference of 70 meters.  But one track is steep, and the other is gentle.  They are different in length.  A steep track stretches for 500 meters, flat - for three hundred.  There is also a training descent designed for beginners.  Its length is 150 meters.  Recently opened a fourth - short track.  There is also a special park for snowboarders, with a complex of jumps and rails.  Lifts correspond to the tracks.  There are two of them, and they are all drag.  There are lifts for two and one person.  Their length is 650 and 350 meters.  Queues can form for the lifts.  But you don‚Äôt usually have to wait too long - a maximum of 15 minutes.  The track for athletes has an international certificate, and there members of the Olympic team train.  On the territory of this complex there are five ski schools. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Protasov jar prices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2218369.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Kievans love to ride in Protasov Yar.  True, some argue that the mountain is small, the snow cover is often mixed with ice floes, and the rental base for the most popular skis is rather small.  Nevertheless, a lot of people gather here on the weekend.  After all, this is the only place where you can get from anywhere in Kiev in almost half an hour.  Therefore, it is easy to get here on the weekend, and it does not take much time.  Good instructors work here, therefore, having learned to ride these slopes, you can already ride on tracks of any complexity, even in the Alps.  Well, those who knew how to ski would have a great opportunity to train and hone their skills.  An excellent bonus of the complex Kiev called night skating.  In the summer, here is a great place for walking, which is what the residents of the city use.  At the same time, zorbing also worked in Protasovo Yar. </p>
