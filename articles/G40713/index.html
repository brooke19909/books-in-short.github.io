The use of such an installation has a positive effect on the bite, as the feeder does not twitch.  Accordingly, the fish behaves calmer, not afraid. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Like any snap-in, the asymmetric loop for the feeder has its pros and cons.  Its advantages include very good sensitivity (which positively affects fishing efficiency), signal transmission about the bite to the very tip of the fishing rod, lack of a sense of resistance to the weight of the fish. </p><p>  The disadvantages of snap are that the asymmetric loop when using long and thin leashes can be confused.  The obvious "congestion" of the fishing line makes it too noticeable in the pond.  Fish may begin to behave too cautiously.  In addition, in reservoirs with a cluttered or overgrown bottom, installation of <span>feeder rigs is</span> also not recommended <span>.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Asymmetric loop or paternoster - what to choose? </h2><p>  Choosing equipment for the feeder, fishing enthusiasts may face the following problem.  Which is better: an asymmetric loop or a paternoster?  What to stop at?  What equipment should be used in which cases?  Very simple, according to many fishermen, is the Gardner loop, asymmetric, in turn, has a special sensitivity.  In fact, you just need to decide in what conditions the fish will be caught. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Do not forget that the paternoster is knitted on the main fishing line.  The swivel adapter is missing in the snap.  As a result, the main fishing line is often twisted. </p><p>  The asymmetric loop is a separate snap fit on a monofilament.  It connects to the main fishing line using a swivel.  Thanks to this, the tackle twists much less often. </p><h2>  Cooling principle </h2><p>  When the fish gets close to the bait and grabs it, there is not much difference between such snap-ins, such as an asymmetric loop and a paternoster.  The use of long leashes makes it easy to take prey.  The fish, not being afraid, catches the bait and moves aside to eat its find away from everyone.  But already after the victim crashes into the feeder, obvious differences between the snap-ins become noticeable. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mounting feeder accessories asymmetric loop" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22293/478769.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Using a Paternoster </h2><p>  So, the difference is "obvious."  When using a paternoster, fish need not be detected.  When a leash is hit by a feeder, a sharp hook sticks into her mouth, and the fisherman only needs to pull his victim ashore.  It is best to use a paternoster when catching a bream that moves quite abruptly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the fish is also more suspicious and shy, because it repeatedly grabs and spits out the bait again.  When tensioned, she begins to worry even more, that is, for such a bite longer leashes are needed.  In this case, the fish swallows the bait deeper in order to enjoy it in peace. </p>

    <h2>  Using an asymmetric loop </h2><p>  The situation at the bottom of the pond is completely different when the fisherman refuses the paternoster.  The asymmetric loop for the feeder is thrown, after which, for a good stretch, the braid is wound.  The feeder begins to move along the fishing line, resulting in a stop at the lowest point of the rig.  It remains only to wait when the fish grabs the nozzle.  After that, she drags her to the side all the way to the upper edge of the loop.  The feeder tip twitches noticeably at this time.  This suggests that it is time for the fisherman to make a cut so that his prey does not spit out the bait. </p><p>  Thus, when fishing for this equipment, the fish does not undercut, but actually bites.  Free movement of the hook allows the fisherman to receive the necessary signal in time.  The main thing is to use long leashes when fishing on an asymmetric loop.  Fish should swallow the bait as deep as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Accordingly, the asymmetric loop remains more sensitive than the paternoster.  She will show a particularly good result when catching small fish in still water. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asymmetric feeder loop" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22293/478760.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  What can be a loop? </h2><p>  The options for this snap are the most diverse.  The asymmetric loop, the photo of which can be seen in the article, is primarily distinguished by its length.  It is this criterion that gives the so-called ‚Äúfree run‚Äù of the equipment.  In a word, the longer the loop, the later the fish will run into the feeder.  Of course, an active bite will require a decrease in the length of this equipment, passive - on the contrary, an increase.  By the way, the choice of leash size is much more important than the choice between an asymmetric loop and a paternoster.  Every avid fisherman knows this. </p><p>  The leash length also depends on the location of the bait.  Fish behaves completely differently in different places of its habitat.  In a reservoir with a strong current, the bait spot is quite elongated, therefore it will be located at a distance of a meter from the feeder itself.  In this case, the leash length is determined directly on the spot.  Small fish, as a rule, feeds away from the feeder, large - close.  By the way, if you move the feeder slightly, the bite often increases.  Therefore, for greater freedom, the bait must immediately lengthen the leash. </p><p>  However, in any course and for different fish you have to choose the right size.  Each fisherman sets the necessary leash criteria independently, only relying on the main recommendations. </p><p>  In any case, it is worth noting that the asymmetric loop is no worse than the paternoster, despite the fact that the latter is not inferior to it in performance either.  That is, the preferences of fishing enthusiasts depend solely on the variety of fish, on the depth and course of the reservoir, etc. The most important thing is to try experimenting.  An excellent catch to the fisherman as a result will be provided. </p><h2>  How to knit? </h2><p>  Thus, if the angler wants to reduce overlaps and increase the elasticity of the leash, he needs an asymmetric loop.  How to knit it, everyone decides for himself.  There are several ways to achieve asymmetry. </p><p>  The easiest way to take a hard line is a half meter length of a small diameter (about 0.3 mm).  Fluorocarbon is best suited for knitting.  Although you can use another fishing line.  The main thing is that she be really tough.  A suitable fishing line will straighten up immediately after it is wound on the finger several times and released. </p>

One of its sides should be 10 centimeters shorter than the other.  After that, a small loop is knitted with the help of a double or triple knot.  A leash with a hook will be attached to it.

    <p>  The next knitting step is the most difficult.  It is necessary to make a tight and rigid leash.  It affects the tendency of the snap to entangle.  When casting, the feeder should fly forward, and the leash should deviate to the side.  Thanks to this, he does not get entangled in the loop. </p><p>  To make a leash, you will need a double fishing line about 15 cm long.  A double twist is made of it, after which a double knot is knitted at its end. </p><p>  A swivel is inserted through the long side of the line, designed to secure the feeder.  Next, the required length of the asymmetric loop (30-70 cm) is measured, and it is tightened using a double knot. </p>
