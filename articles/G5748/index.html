For iOS, it is the equivalent of formatting and reinstalling the operating system on the computer, and this must be considered before reflashing the iPad.  Therefore, the first recommendation of specialists is to pre-complete a full backup of the device.  Thus, in case of failure, you can always restore the data and configuration that were before the Recovery process. </p><h2>  Jailbreak process management </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yalujailbreak.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jailbreak Process Management" class="if uuid-3147580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3147580.jpg"></div><p>  Jailbreak (JB), which means ‚Äúhacking‚Äù, is a long and complicated process, since it involves breaking the original factory configuration and removing restrictions imposed by Apple, they must be taken into account before reflashing the iPad.  This should not frighten advanced users if they follow the instructions exactly and the iPad is not exposed to physical danger. </p><p>  After the process is completed, the owner will have full control over the device, Jailbreak will allow you to fully control the functions, similar to how it happens in Windows.  You can explore files, modify them, install any applications or programs, transfer music, videos, movies, photos and any other files from your tablet to your PC and vice versa.  ITunes on your PC or laptop is downloaded for free from the Apple website, and you need to do this before flashing the iPad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Download the application on the PC and make sure that this is the latest version.  You can use PwnageTool to check the most convenient version and understand that the downloaded version of Redsn0w in connected mode allows you to jailbreak on the desired model.  This means that the software will be placed permanently, even if the tablet is turned off. </p><h2>  Requirements and Files for Jailbreak </h2><div class="photo" data-original="appleinsider.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Requirements and Files for Jailbreak" class="if uuid-3147587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3147587.jpg"></div><p>  Many users are wondering if the iPad can be reflashed when the model is unknown and there is no access to its internal part due to blocking.  In this case, the best alternative is to read the tablet number indicated on the back of the case.  Sometimes you can find out this information by visiting special sites on the Internet to determine the technical data of the model, which is recommended to be done before reflashing the iPad.  The service will automatically detect and display the device model and installed firmware. </p><p>  If the tablet opens, preliminarily clarify all the technical characteristics of the device: Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Information.  For proper setup, record the following: </p><ol><li>  Installed firmware version (operating system). </li><li>  Serial number.  Contains the date of manufacture, for example, 861825GFJY7H indicates that the tablet was manufactured on the 25th week of 2018. </li></ol><p>  In order to make a backup, pre-synchronize the device with iTunes.  This will help keep personal files such as contacts, messages, calendars and installed applications safe, as music, photos and videos are not saved in the newly created copy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Before flashing iPad-2, use a USB cable, which must be in working condition. </p><p>  Walkthrough: </p><ol><li>  In the same folder or directory where Redsn0w is located, the installation file for the firmware version is placed, for example: iPhone3,1_4.3_8F190_Restore.ipsw. </li><li>  Run Redsn0w, click on the "Open Browse" button, and select the IPSW file.  If everything is done correctly, a message will be received: "IPSW successfully identified." </li><li>  Follow the instructions received before reflashing the mini iPad, and select - "Install". </li><li>  When a user asks to connect the phone in DFU mode, he will have to do it manually. </li></ol><h2>  System Recovery Modes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.techquark.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="System Recovery Modes" class="if uuid-3147594" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3147594.jpg"></div><p>  When installing iOS on the iPad, the user will fall into one of the following modes: </p><ol><li>  Normal mode is the case when the device remains controllable, everything works.  The reinstallation of iOS is caused by a software crash, synchronization problems, or some applications closing unexpectedly or not working after being turned on.  In this mode, you can make a backup copy of your device, which you must perform before flashing the iPad at home. </li><li>  Recovery mode - in this case, iOS is not ready for use on the phone.  ITunes will appear on the screen and an image of a cable offering to connect it to a PC and install software.  iMazing can also work with the device in this mode.  If the iPad is in recovery mode, use iMazing to exit the mode and make a backup.  To do this, click the "Exit Recovery Mode" button on the "Reinstall iOS" iMazing screen.  If you cannot exit the process, try reinstalling iOS, iMazing will save all the data. </li><li>  DFU mode, or device firmware update mode, is the last hope, if all the others have failed. </li></ol><h2>  Tablet Installation Sequence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="imazing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Type and installation sequence" class="if uuid-3147596" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3147596.jpg"></div><p>  iMazing offers two types of installation.  You can either download the latest version of iOS for the device from Apple servers and install it on the iPad, or install it from an image file or .ipsw. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Installation in recovery mode: </p><ol><li>  Before flashing the iPad, if it is blocked, install from the Apple server.  iMazing will check Apple servers and automatically download the latest device software. </li><li>  Click Install iOS to continue. </li><li>  Install the image file only if the user is sure that the computer has the latest version of the tablet OS. </li><li>  After selecting the installation from the image, iMazing will display a dialog box asking you to find this file. </li><li>  Make sure that the correct package for the model is selected, otherwise the installation will fail. </li><li>  Click ‚ÄúSelect‚Äù, then ‚ÄúReinstall iOS‚Äù to continue, iMazing will use the selected method to install the software. </li><li>  If the .ipsw file is selected, the installation will take several minutes.  However, if you select to download from Apple‚Äôs iMazing server, it will take a long time and will depend on Internet bandwidth. </li><li>  Before flashing the iPad, if it is blocked, take into account that the size of the iOS installation package is from 2 to 3 GB, so if the bandwidth on the PC is limited, it will take some time to download iMazing. </li></ol><h2>  Reinstalling iPad with iMazing </h2><p>  It so happens that the owner of the phone detects a black screen and can do nothing with the device, sometimes the iPad loops, rebooting again and again.  These are signs that iOS software requires reinstallation.  Such an operation can be performed before flashing the iPad via iTunes, in which all device data will be lost.  Unfortunately, there are situations when the tablet is in such a state that it is no longer possible to create a backup copy of it. </p><p>  With iMazing, you can reinstall the iOS iPad, which does not work, with saving data. </p><p>  Algorithm for reinstalling iOS on iPad: </p><ol><li>  Download and install iMazing. </li><li>  Before flashing the iPad through a PC, launch the application and connect the device to the computer. </li><li>  Wait until the device appears on the iMazing Reinstall iOS screen, and click Reinstall iOS. </li><li>  If the ‚ÄúReinstall iOS‚Äù screen does not appear, select the device in the left side panel and click ‚ÄúReinstall iOS‚Äù in iMazing.  If steps 2 and 3 do not work, enter the device in DFU mode (firmware update mode) and use iMazing to reinstall iOS. </li><li>  Upon completion, the software will display a screen asking you to unlock the iPad.  Enter the access code for it. </li><li>  iMazing will ask you to confirm trust this computer on your phone. </li><li>  Click "Trust" in the dialog box that appears on iOS so that the software can continue to work. </li></ol><h2>  DFU mode for PC download </h2><div class="photo" data-original="imazing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DFU mode for PC download" class="if uuid-3147602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3147602.jpg"></div><p>  This tablet recovery mode is selected when using a Mac or Windows computer.  The sequential procedure of how to upgrade iPad-2 through a PC: </p><ol><li>  Launch iMazing and connect the device to a Mac or PC. </li><li>  After connecting, they expect the device to appear in iMazing, and click the "Reinstall IOS in Recovery Mode" button. </li><li>  Before reinstalling iOS, make sure that there is the latest system backup created using iMazing, iTunes, or iCloud.  If you do not check the option ‚ÄúErase the device before installation‚Äù, iMazing will try to save the data, but this step does not give any guarantees of operability. </li><li>  To exit, click the "Exit Recovery Mode" button. </li><li>  Then back up using iMazing. </li><li>  If the iOS iMazing reinstallation screen does not appear, select the device on the side panel, then click "Reinstall iOS".  The function is located in the column to the left of the phone information panel.  You may have to scroll down in this column to see this feature. </li></ol><h2>  Mode input </h2><p>  As a rule, this special login is not required for users, since a rather closed operating system is protected from configuration errors caused by applications or lack of knowledge of users.  However, no operating system is 100% reliable, and for one reason or another it is possible that it will fail and the owner will not be able to turn on the tablet.  To do this, resort to recovery mode, for example, to reflash the iPad model mc959ll a. </p><p>  The main cases in which you have to resort to this method are: </p><ol><li>  When iTunes does not recognize the device. </li><li>  If the Apple logo does not appear for a long time and does not start. </li><li>  In case of bootloop crashes. </li><li>  When the "Connect to iTunes" window appears. </li><li>  When you need to completely restart the phone, for example, to restore a copy of the previous one in the new model. </li></ol><p>  The general way to enter this recovery option on the iPad is: </p><ol><li>  The smartphone is connected via cable to the PC and start iTunes. </li><li>  Forcedly restart by pressing the "Start" and "Power" buttons, and after restarting the phone continue to press them even after the appearance of the Apple sign.  After a couple of seconds, the ‚Äúrecovery mode‚Äù appears. </li><li>  iTunes is prepared in such a way that if an error is detected in the device or in this mode, it will automatically ask us what needs to be done. </li></ol><h2>  Firmware Update via iTunes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pt.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Firmware Update via iTunes" class="if uuid-3147612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3147612.jpg"></div><p>  The update method on the iPad is via iTunes, a procedure commonly referred to as flashing for mobile devices.  The process is quite simple because it is done from iTunes.  This type is the safest.  There are no serious risks during the process, the only common problem is ‚ÄúError 3194‚Äù, a consequence of installing the firmware older than the original. </p><p>  As a precaution, it is recommended that you use new USB cables that are not damaged and update the firmware to the latest version. </p><p>  Process execution algorithm: </p><ol><li>  Download and install the latest version of iTunes. </li><li>  Connect iPad to PC. </li><li>  Select "Restore or update" and the process will be performed automatically. </li><li>  Install firmware other than the one installed on the iPad ‚Äî equal or later. </li><li>  They download the software, save it to the PC and, before performing the last step, press the Shift key on the keyboard and find the loaded firmware. </li><li>  A very common problem is that the owner of the iPad forgets the lock code.  To fix this, you can restore the firmware. </li></ol><h2>  User reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="applesencia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="User reviews" class="if uuid-3147616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3147616.jpg"></div><p>  Users who have successfully completed the flashing of the iPad using software share their feedback on the Internet. </p><p>  Here is some of them: </p><ol><li>  You can scan data to restore your iPad without iTunes before flashing the iPad if it doesn't turn on. </li><li>  After all information has been synchronized and classified, you can view all documents.  If there is a specific file and a search engine that can be used for navigation and search.  Be sure to keep the connection to the computer using the USB cable to successfully restore the iPad without iTunes. </li><li>  You can perform selective iPad recovery without an iCloud backup.  When the scanner is ready, the software will show a preview of the various categories, which includes photos and videos, messages and a call log.  Select the desired files and then click the "Restore to computer" button.  At this point, the phone will be restored without iTunes, and all valuable information will be stored on the iPad. </li><li>  You can connect the device to a computer using a USB cable thanks to the wonderful Dr.  Fone, which allows you to restore your iPad without iTunes.  The process takes place in an absolutely safe background, which protects valuable information during the execution of the main work.  The software is free, the paid version provides access to much more features than simply restoring the device. </li><li>  You can easily make sure that the new version of iTunes is installed.  They put the iPad into ‚ÄúRecovery Mode‚Äù, connect the USB to the PC, then turn off the iPad by holding down the Home button until iTunes detects it. </li></ol><h2>  Bug Fixes </h2><p>  In some cases, when trying to upgrade the iPad to the latest version or simply restore its factory settings, users find errors in iTunes that prevent them from completing the process.  In most of these cases, such errors are due to the fact that the latest version of the required software is not used or there is no connection to the server. </p><p>  You can use the recommendations of experienced users to fix the most common update and recovery errors in iTunes: </p><ol><li>  Update iTunes to the latest version - this is important when troubleshooting update and recovery errors. </li><li>  Update your operating system and install all available Mac updates from the Mac App Store.  If you are using Windows, you can do this from the Microsoft website. </li><li>  Check computer security software; sometimes it blocks iTunes for updating or recovery.  In other cases, the same equipment directly blocks the device and cannot recognize it.  These crashes are usually more common on Windows; very rarely they happen on a Mac, which correctly configures the software and, if necessary, deletes proxies. </li><li>  Disconnect all USB that are not needed.  Other USB peripherals may sometimes conflict with the iTunes update or recovery process. </li></ol><p>  In most cases, these steps are enough to successfully complete the iTunes process. </p>
