    <h2>  Hotel Location Reviews </h2><p>  As for the location of Theo Bungalows 3 * (Kassandra), only those tourists who, when planning a trip, did not study the hotel description well were dissatisfied.

    <h2>  Impressions of tourists about food and staff </h2><p>  Our compatriots were generally satisfied with the quality of food at Theo Bungalows 3 * hotel (Kriopigi).  So, breakfasts were monotonous enough, but there was always plenty to choose from.  For lunch and dinner, every day the chef tried to cook something new.  Please note that drinks are chargeable during lunch and dinner.  Seasoned travelers still recommend taking breakfast only.  In this case, you will have the opportunity to taste the delicious dishes of national cuisine in taverns and restaurants of both Kriopigi and neighboring towns and cities.  In addition, the prices in the restaurants are quite comparable with the prices in the hotel. </p><p>  As for the staff of Theo Bungalos, our compatriots have only positive impressions of it.  So, according to tourists, all the staff here are very welcoming, friendly, attentive and always ready to help.  I was also pleased with the fact that some of the employees speak Russian.  Therefore, if you do not speak English at all, then, if necessary, you can also explain in your native language. </p>

    <h2>  Beach holidays and entertainment at Theo Bungalos: the opinion of tourists from Russia </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, the beaches in Kriopigi are very good.  There is clean sand everywhere.  When entering the water, almost no stones are found.  The beaches here are in municipal ownership, so if you want to soak up the sunbed and use an umbrella, you will have to pay extra (about 5 euros) for this.  However, you can always sit comfortably on a towel brought with you in the area where there are no sun loungers.  As for remoteness, from Theo Bungalows 3 * to the beach you can walk in 10 minutes.  In this case, the road goes from the hill.  On the way to the hotel you will have to climb the hill, which may require a little more time and effort.  Many tourists were not embarrassed by the need to perform such physical exercises, however, everyone can always get from the beach to the hotel and on a compact train that runs regularly in this direction (travel costs 1 euro). </p><p>  As for other entertainments, if for some reason you do not want to go down to the sea, you can always spend an hour or two at the outdoor pool in the territory of Theo Bungalos.  It features a sun terrace and a bar with a cheerful bartender and a large selection of drinks.  Wi-Fi is also available here.  Experienced travelers definitely recommend not to spend the whole vacation exclusively at the hotel and on the beach, but to travel around the country.  So, in the neighboring towns and settlements you can go by bus (the schedule is available at the reception) or taxi.  For longer trips, it is best to rent a car.  Moreover, this can be done directly at the hotel.  There is also a tour desk. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, we can safely say that most of our compatriots liked to relax in the Theo Bungalows 3 * hotel (Halkidiki).  In their opinion, this hotel offers guests an excellent combination of price and quality of accommodation and service.  Therefore, if you want to spend an unforgettable vacation in a calm place with a national touch on the beach, you should definitely go to Theo Bungalos. </p>
