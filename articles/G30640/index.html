    <h2>  Rodion Oslyabya: biography to ... </h2><p>  Rodion was a native of the Bryansk region.  Born supposedly in the city of Lubutsk.  He came from an ancient boyar clan and had a close relationship with another hero of the battle on <span>the Kulikovo field</span> - Alexander Peresvet.  It is believed that they were brothers.  The degree of relationship is indicated as blood.  But perhaps they were cousins.  Prior to being tonsured as a monk, Rodion, like his brother, served in the princely army and participated in battles against Lithuania.  However, it is believed that it was the failure in the battles with the Lithuanians that led the brothers to the decision to leave worldly life.  They took tonsure and went to the Trinity-Sergius Monastery. </p><p>  Studying the descriptions of Rodion Oslyaby's appearance, we find out that he was a middle-aged man with a "brown mustache and a lush beard."  In addition, some sources mention the presence of his son Jacob, who allegedly died with his father during the Kulikovo battle.  Both Peresvet and Oslyabya were not only very strong men, but also experienced warriors, including in the management of the army.  Sometimes they are even called generals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hero of the Battle of Kulikovo </h2><p>  Together with his brother <span>Alexander Peresvet,</span> Rodion Oslyabya was sent by the Monk Sergius of Radonezh to a righteous battle with the hordes of the Horde Khan Mamai, who usurped power in the western part of the split Golden Horde.  An unrecognized ruler who was not a <span>descendant of Genghis Khan,</span> Mamai decided with the help of military victories to strengthen his power among the Horde warriors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rodion Slumber Biography" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2221737.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Before leaving for the princely army, Sergius of Radonezh instead of armor put on his monks cloaks with embroidered crosses as a sign of God's protection and protection - the Great Schema.  In it, worn on a monastic dress, and they went to battle.  Sergius of Radonezh blessed Peresvet and Oslyabyu before the campaign with the miraculous icon of Our Lady of Tikhvin. </p><p>  After the famous duel between Alexander Peresvet and Chelubey and their deaths, two troops converged on the Kulikovo field in a hot battle.  From the first minute, Rodion Oslyabya fought valiantly in the front rows.  His contribution to the battle largely predetermined the result. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander overexposure and Rodion oslyabya" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2221731.jpg"></div>

However, after the accession of the <span>son of Dmitry Donskoy,</span> Vasily I was sent to the Byzantine emperor with an embassy that had a charity mission - delivering aid to the victim of the Turkish Sultan Bayazet Tsargrad.  He returned to Moscow with the icon of the Savior as a thank-you gift to the Moscow prince from the Byzantine emperor.  Perhaps for his services Rodion Oslyabya was awarded a plot of land in the Kolomna region, where the village of Oslebyatievskoe appeared, mentioned in the possessions acquired by the wife of Vasily I Evdokia Dmitrievna. </p><p>  Rodion Oslyabya, a warrior monk, was buried in Moscow‚Äôs Simonovsky Monastery after his death. </p><h2>  Was there a find? </h2><p>  In the XVIII century, in the Mother of God-Nativity Church of the monastery began to dismantle the bell tower.  The idea is expressed that during these works a brick crypt was discovered, the floor of which was covered with nameless tombstones, after removing which the builders found the sarcophagi of Alexander Peresvet and Rodion Oslyaby. </p><p>  Over time, tombstones were installed over them.  They were destroyed twice: in 1794 and 1928.  And only in 1989 were created for the third time - now at the initiative of the artist P. D. Korin.  A wooden tombstone was installed above the burial place of the heroes of the Kulikovo battle, exactly copying its first cast-iron version.  The proposed grave is open to all comers.  However, it is still unknown whether the remains of Peresvet and Oslyaby are actually resting here.  But next to the graves are set precious lamps, made at the expense of the Naval Department of Imperial Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rodion Fucking Monk Warrior" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2221733.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  In your name ... </h2><p>  In the middle of the XIX century, the Russian fleet included ships named after the heroic monks of the Kulikovo battle - ‚ÄúRelight‚Äù and ‚ÄúOslyabya‚Äù.  The latter was a 45-gun steam frigate built at one of the Baltic shipyards in 1860 and was in combat formation until 1874.  During the American Civil War, when the combined fleet of southerners and the British exerted strong pressure on the northerners, Abraham Lincoln turned to the Russian Emperor Alexander II for help.  September 24, 1863 the squadron under the command of Rear Admiral S. S. Lesovsky participated in the rescue of New York.  In 1864, Oslyabya took part in a campaign in the Mediterranean Sea. </p><p>  In 1901, the new screw ship Oslyabya descended from the stocks of the Baltic shipyards.  He fought heroically in the Tsushima battle during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, without losing the honor of the name he was named.  In battle, he led the left column of a military squadron, received holes and sank.  Together with the ship, 514 out of 899 crew members died. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="motor ship rodion oslyabya" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2221734.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Rodion Oslyabya is back in service </h2><p>  In 2005, by order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy, one of the multi-deck landing ships of the Pacific Fleet, designed to transport and land assault forces with military equipment, was named Oslyabya. </p><p>  From February to May 2017, the Rodion Oslyabya motor ship underwent scheduled repairs at the docks: all engines were brought into working condition, the pumps and pipelines were repaired, the propeller-driven complex was completely cleaned, the old sections were completely blasted and the new ones were painted, and the hull was repaired.  In addition, the ship was modernized: the hydraulic system of hatches and a superstructure with decks were refitted.  Technical support was carried out around the clock. </p>
