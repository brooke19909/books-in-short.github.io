    <p>  The territory has its own health center, where tourists can visit the sauna, wellness treatments, aromatherapy and massage.  The hotel offers guests a tennis court, bike rental.  Guests can play table tennis, volleyball, do water aerobics under the guidance of animators. </p><h2>  Coast and beach </h2><p>  A huge advantage of the complex is its location on the coast.  Hotel Europa Beach Hotel 4 * is located on the first line, to get to the beach, you just need to cross the road.  It is completely non-living, one might even say that it is deserted, and therefore its presence does not cause inconvenience at all. </p><p>  The complex does not have its own beach, which is typical for any European hotel.  Opposite the hotel there is a small stretch of coast, however it is not equipped and there are a lot of stones on it.  Much further lay a huge municipal beach with paid sunbeds and umbrellas, but taking them is not necessary.  You can sit in the shade of trees or in the sun.  The local sandy coast is very wide and beautiful with a gentle entry into the sea.  It is very comfortable to relax with the kids.  The sea is shallow enough to get to the depths, you need to go far.  But for the kids there‚Äôs no better place.  The beach is very huge and there is always a lot of space. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Crete is a beautiful island where you can relax and visit many excursions.  There is an incredibly beautiful sea, huge wide beaches, green palm trees, gorges, mountains and a lot of sun.  Locals are very friendly and always welcome guests.  Life on the island flows slowly ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="europa beach hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1539341.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Crete is rich in attractions.  There are so many of them that one vacation is not enough to see everything.  Tourists enjoy trips to the Palace of Knossos, to the <span>labyrinth of the Minotaur,</span> in <span>the Samaria gorge.</span>  Children will enjoy going to Anapolis water park.  No less interesting is the cave of Zeus and the cave of Melidoni, the Phaistos Palace. </p><p>  Shopping enthusiasts will appreciate the local products.  In Crete, wonderful things with handmade lace are sold, good woolen clothes, sheepskin blankets and carpets, leather shoes and accessories. </p><p>  You should definitely buy local natural cosmetics based on olive oil, seaweed and herbs.  Crete is famous for its gold jewelry.  An incredible amount is sold here.  In jewelry stores, you can sometimes buy exclusive items.  An interesting fact is that it is customary to bargain everywhere.  This applies not only to markets, but also to shops and stores.  The best souvenirs from Crete are <span>mountain tea,</span> oil, olives, honey, cognac and wine.  And in numerous shopping centers there are shops of all famous brands, sales in them happen twice a year (in July and January). </p><h2>  Europa Beach Hotel 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I certainly want to refer to the reviews of its guests in order to have a more complete picture of it.  According to tourists, the complex is designed for a very calm and measured rest.  Active youth here will certainly be bored.  The main contingent of vacationers is elderly (retired) tourists from France, Germany and Spain and few families with children, there are very few Russians.  The hotel is located far from the city, next to a small village in which there is everything that vacationers may need.  Hersonissos is considered the center of entertainment in Crete, so you can go there in search of something interesting.  The city is located just six kilometers from the hotel. </p><p>  There is a public transport stop near the complex, from where you can get to the nearest cities.  In addition, you can rent a car at the hotel to travel around the island, this is the most convenient way to move.  You can also take a taxi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="europa beach hotel 4 analipsis" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1539342.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a beautiful and well-groomed area, on which there are many picturesque palm trees and flowering plants.  The staff of the complex deserves special praise.  Accommodation in rooms is fast and efficient, regardless of when you arrived.  Even if you arrived earlier than the appointed hour, you will still be given the keys to the apartment. </p><p>  Tourists who visited the hotel, note the modest decoration of rooms.  All furniture is far from new, but in good condition.  The apartments are quite comfortable and made in Cretan style.  The complex consists of two- and three-story bungalows, so you can choose a room on the top floor with a beautiful view of the sea. </p><p>  The maids of the hotel do an excellent job, the apartments are cleaned daily, and there are no problems with the replacement of bed linen and towels.  In general, the rooms are very well maintained and clean, albeit simple. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  How are meals at the Europa Beach Hotel 4 * <span>(Crete)?</span>  <span>Reviews of</span> tourists regarding food - this is usually one of the most controversial issues.  However, our hotel in this sense can be considered an exception.  According to vacationers, the food in the restaurant is up to standard.  On the tables there are always several types of fish dishes, meat, a lot of vegetables and fruits.  Unfortunately, there are no soups, porridges and borscht familiar to us, but in Crete they simply are not cooked.  Local soups are more like broths.  Some guests note that there is not much variety on the menu, but most tourists are very pleased with the food.  Still, do not forget that the complex has four stars, not five. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="europa beach hotel 4 crete reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1539343.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Children and adults enjoy a good selection of delicious ice cream for lunch and breakfast.  The bartenders have great cocktails at the poolside bar.  The waiters of the main restaurant do an excellent job, quickly and efficiently serving customers.  They are always friendly, like the rest of the workers. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  Europa Beach Hotel 4 * can be a good place for a calm and measured beach holiday.  It is suitable for those tourists who are in search of a hotel near the coast.  The complex does not have chic interiors and luxurious rooms, but fully complies with its four star status, offering vacationers clean rooms and good food. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the coast, to get to the beach, you must cross the road.  The shore opposite the complex has a more rocky bottom, so many people prefer the municipal beach.  The coastal strip is so beautiful that there is always a lot of space and no crowds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="europa beach hotel analipsi hersonissos 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1539347.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the daytime, animators entertain guests with sports programs, a kids club works.  In the evenings, tourists become participants in the evening show, and for kids arrange a mini-disco.  Children's animation is conducted in English, but this does not stop young tourists from having fun. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Europa Beach Hotel 4 * is a budget hotel for families.  If you are tired of the bustle of the city and want to relax at sea, then you can safely choose this complex.  But active young people looking for active entertainment, it is better to pay attention to the hotels of Heraklion and Hersonissos. <strong></strong></p>
