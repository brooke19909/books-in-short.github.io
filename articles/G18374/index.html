  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Tallinn: photos with names and descriptions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The southern coast of the Gulf of Finland offers travelers one of the most beautiful cities in the Baltic States, the capital of Estonia - Tallinn.  Many tourists intend to lay their route through this wonderful city in order to enjoy its medieval streets, frosty freshness in winter and bright sunshine in season. </p><p>  By and large, Tallinn is a small village with a large number of monuments and museums.  The city has not only a well-equipped historical center, but also a developed modern part with popular shopping centers, food courts and parks. </p><p>  In today's article, we will talk about the main attractions of Tallinn, about where to go and where to spend time in this beautiful city.  You are ready?  Then welcome to a fascinating journey through the capital of the Estonian state.  And our review of the photo of the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Tallinn</span> begins <span>!</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="utazok-nade.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panorama of Tallinn" class="if uuid-2332176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2332176.jpg"></div><h2>  Visa </h2><p>  A visit to any country in the European Union should begin with the registration of the relevant document called a visa.  As everyone knows, Estonia is included in the list of Schengen countries, therefore, to visit this state, it is enough to provide any Schengen tourist visa.  For example, the residents of St. Petersburg need a Finnish stamp in their passport. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  More detailed information on the main aspects and the necessary documents for registration can always be obtained at the consulate of the country or the visa center. </p><p>  Having dealt with the visa issue, you should go directly to the topic of the article - the sights of Tallinn.  With photos, names and descriptions of the most interesting and valuable, from a historical point of view, objects, we will introduce you in more detail.  Go! </p><h2>  The main attraction of Tallinn </h2><p>  All guides to the capital of Estonia familiarize tourists with photos and descriptions of this object.  Traditionally, the inspection of the city should begin with its zest, in our case it is the Old Town.  How can I describe it?  It is a medieval-saturated urban area on the UNESCO World Heritage List.  The sights of the Old Town in Tallinn can impress even the most experienced travelers.  It creates the feeling that you were on the set of a film about Richard the Lionheart.  All stone paths lead tourists to the central square, where the city hall is located.  In the summer, a large number of street restaurants open in the Old Town, and in winter Christmas markets prevail here.  We offer you to familiarize yourself with a photo of Old Tallinn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drinkteatravel.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.drinkteatravel.com/sustainable-guide-what-to-do-tallinn-estonia/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Town in Tallinn" class="if uuid-2332128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2332128.jpg"></div><p>  Geographically, the Old Town is divided into two parts: upper and lower.  Previously, Vyshgorod (the upper part of the city) served as a settlement for aristocrats and representatives of other wealthy sections of society. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tallinn Town Hall </h2><p>  The main attraction of the Old Town in Tallinn is the local Town Hall and the central square.  A large flow of tourists flocking here every day, dreaming to capture unique architecture uncharacteristic for their country in the pictures.  It is generally accepted that the city square with a tower is the very center of Tallinn.  Sometimes the Town Hall serves as a venue for various receptions at the state level and other events; on all other days, anyone can get here for a nominal fee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timetravelturtle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Town Hall Square in Tallinn" class="if uuid-2332095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2332095.jpg"></div><h2>  Town Hall Pharmacy </h2><p>  Another attraction of Tallinn, belonging to the category of must see, is the oldest European pharmacy.  For the first time, the hospital‚Äôs doors opened in the first half of the 15th century. </p><p>  The history of the pharmacy is quite interesting.  At the end of the XVI century, the building was leased to Johann Burhard, who laid the foundation for the dynasty of pharmacists.  A generation of Burkhards managed the establishment for over 300 years, at present the sale of medicines continues in this building, some went to the museum, and the other half remained a pharmacy. </p><h2>  City wall </h2><p>  If you are wondering: ‚ÄúWhat to see in Tallinn in one day?‚Äù, Then you can give an unambiguous answer: all of the above attractions, including the Tallinn City Wall.  Of course, this can be said on condition of a measured rest, and not, as they say, ‚Äúat a gallop across Europe‚Äù. </p><p>  The city wall acts as an important local attraction in Tallinn (photo below), which absolutely any Estonian will recommend visiting.  Unfortunately, only some sections of the structure that defended the city in the Middle Ages have survived to our days.  The Tallinn fortress was then considered one of the most reliable in Europe, in addition, some sections of the wall acted as a prison. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nomadicmatt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City wall" class="if uuid-2332189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2332189.jpg"></div><h2>  Freedom Square </h2><p>  Freedom Square affects the patriotic feelings of the townspeople and causes pride for their country, since the monument rises in the center, which represents the victory of the Estonian troops in the Liberation War of 1918-1920.  In everyday life, the square serves as a venue for various events, concerts and celebrations. </p><h2>  Maiden's Tower </h2><p>  The tower belongs to the fortress wall and previously served as a prison for girls of easy virtue, unfaithful and naughty brides.  This is one of the main attractions of Old Tallinn.  Despite the fact that the Maiden‚Äôs Tower was repeatedly damaged seriously, the city authorities managed to reconstruct the building and give it a modern appearance.  Today inside the building there is a museum and cafe with a picturesque view of the Old Town. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitestonia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maiden's Tower" class="if uuid-2332201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2332201.jpg"></div><h2>  Fat Margarita and Kick-in-de-Kek </h2><p>  Tallinn can be called a city of towers and towering medieval buildings.  "Fat Margarita" is the most impressive tower that is part of the complex of the city fortress, the wall thickness of which reaches 5.5 meters.  This structure acted as a defense structure for the city treasury and the entrance to the harbor.  Today, the Maritime Museum is located inside the tower, where you can learn about the history of navigation and fishing in Estonia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="meremuuseum.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fat Margarita" class="if uuid-2332209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2332209.jpg"></div><p>  Kik-in-de-Kek is another defensive <span>tower of the Tallinn</span> Fortress Wall.  The name of the building in Saxon means "Look into the kitchen."  This name was given to the tower, since from the top where the guard was, a wonderful view of the kitchens in city houses was opened.  To date, Kik-in-de-Kek is no more than a museum, although it is from this place that the journey through the local dungeon begins. </p><h2>  Viru Gate </h2><p>  This is a kind of gate to Old Tallinn.  Here begins the famous Viru Street, which extends along the medieval houses up to the Town Hall Square.  The gate is located in the eastern part of the fortress wall.  In addition, the Viru Gate serves as a symbol for the locals, separating the modern part of the city from the medieval one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Viru Gate" class="if uuid-2332214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2332214.jpg"></div><h2>  Katarina Lane </h2><p>  You might think, quite an ordinary European street in the Old Town, but no.  Katarina Lane is a full-fledged museum, which previously housed numerous workshops for making souvenirs from leather, ceramics and glass.  This is where a tourist who wants to buy a quality souvenir in Tallinn should drop in.  Also, along the entire street in the summer, there are many cafes with exquisite dishes prepared according to old recipes. </p><h2>  The Dome Cathedral </h2><p>  The main Lutheran temple in Estonia, fascinating many tourists.  If you have not visited this wonderful building of the XIII century, then we can assume that you have not been to Estonia.  Locals are used to calling the cathedral ‚ÄúToomkirik‚Äù, but its official name is St. Mary's Church. </p><p>  One of the main attractions of the church is the tomb of navigator Ivan Kruzenshtern.  In addition, the Dome Cathedral is exactly the place where you can listen to organ music for free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitestonia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Dome Cathedral" class="if uuid-2332222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2332222.jpg"></div><h2>  Alexander Nevsky Cathedral </h2><p>  If the church, which was discussed in the previous paragraph, is Lutheran, then the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral is an original Russian building, erected in the XIX century.  Estonians still perceive the temple as a symbol of the Russification of the people.  In the twenties, the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral was planned to be destroyed, but after the collapse of the USSR, it passed to the Estonian authorities.  At the moment, services are periodically arranged here. </p><p>  An object in the Orthodox style was erected.  And it is impossible for a domestic tourist to miss him, because the temple stands out so much from the usual European architecture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="richedwardsimagery.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander Nevsky Cathedral" class="if uuid-2332108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2332108.jpg"></div><h2>  Kaarli church </h2><p>  Continuing the theme of cathedrals, one cannot fail to mention the Kaarli church.  Earlier on this very spot stood the chapel of St. Anthony, completely made of wood.  Unfortunately, it has not survived to this day, as it was destroyed by a fire during the Northern War. </p><p>  Today, Kaarli is acting as a neo-Gothic Lutheran church.  Divine services are regularly held here and crowds of tourists gather in order to personally see all the luxury of the building.  A separate decoration of the facade of the building are German watches of the 20th century.  Many visitors to the Kaarli Church are true music lovers, as classical instrumental music concerts are often held inside the building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaarli church" class="if uuid-2332227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2332227.jpg"></div><h2>  Lennusadam </h2><p>  What is hiding under this mysterious name - "Lennusad"?  In fact, this is a naval museum, the location of which are real aircraft hangars.  If you are tired of the usual European architecture, parks and restaurants, then the Lennusadam Hydro-Airport Museum is a great place to get a little distracted.  Inside the hangars, real military equipment is presented, especially this place will be interesting to children.  Submarines, planes, ships - all this can be seen and even photographed or shot on camera.  The museum even has a specialized playground for children and a cinema. </p><h2>  Monument "Mermaid" </h2><p>  The final item in the list of ‚ÄúWhat to see in Tallinn in 2 days‚Äù can be considered the ‚ÄúMermaid‚Äù monument, erected in memory of the lost crew of a warship in 1893, which sank as a result of a storm.  The search for the ship continued for as long as forty years, and the monument to the battleship Rusalka was erected for the amount collected as a result of the donation.  By the way, Adamson acted as a sculptor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.myworldshots.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument Mermaid" class="if uuid-2332242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2332242.jpg"></div><h2>  Glen Castle </h2><p>  The castle got its name in honor of Baron von Glen, whose design was built as a result.  This is a very picturesque place located in a quiet urban area of ‚Äã‚ÄãN√µmme, surrounded by trees.  In particular, Glen Castle acquires an unusual image in the fall, when the foliage turns yellow and a fabulous atmosphere hovers everywhere.  It is also worth noting that the castle walls were erected by the hands of Tallinn prisoners who underwent correctional labor.  Initially, it was planned to build a town hall, a church and a couple of buildings on this site.  Perhaps Glen's castle was supposed to grow into a whole city.  Alas, it remains to be content with what we have.  In this section, ‚ÄúWhat to see in Tallinn in two days‚Äù can be completely completed, since then you need to go a little outside the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visittallinn.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Glen Castle in Tallinn" class="if uuid-2332112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2332112.jpg"></div><h2>  Maaryam√§gi Castle </h2><p>  Maaryam√§gi Castle is the former summer residence of the Orlov-Davydov family, located a few kilometers from the city.  The name comes from the word "Marienberg" - in honor of the count‚Äôs wife, Mary.  As a result of the revolutionary movement of 1917, the Orlov-Davydov family left their residence and migrated to Europe, and the building began to serve as the seat of the Dutch consul.  Today, a branch of the Historical Museum of Estonia, one of the main attractions of Tallinn, is located on the estate of Maaryam√§gi. </p><h2>  Toompea Castle </h2><p>  An ancient fortress located on a hill in the central part of Tallinn.  The history of the object dates back several centuries, and today it acts as the place where the Estonian parliament sits.  <span>Toompea Castle</span> from above resembles a full-fledged urban complex, and one of its towers reaches almost 100 meters in height.  At the top, the state flag proudly flutters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitestonia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Toompea Castle" class="if uuid-2332260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2332260.jpg"></div><h2>  Singing field </h2><p>  An important city attraction.  At first glance it may seem - nothing unusual: in the distance there are pop-shells in the form of a shell, and at the opposite end there is a sculpture by the famous composer Gustav Ernesaks.  In fact, music concerts and even rock festivals are often held here, and in the winter, the Singing Field acts as a full-fledged ski resort. </p><h2>  Tallinn Zoo </h2><p>  An interesting place for family leisure is the city zoo.  In particular, travelers with young children will be interested here, since the diversity of the world fauna is quite wide.  <span>Tallinn Zoo</span> is one of the attractions of the city, and crowds of tourists come here daily.  Geographically, the zoo is divided into zones: bird park, tropical zone, Arctic zone and elephant.  The best conditions have been created for children here: there are rides and a contact zoo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ikeathegiraffe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tallinn Zoo" class="if uuid-2332115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2332115.jpg"></div><h2>  Tv tower </h2><p>  This, of course, is not Toronto or Berlin, but the Tallinn TV Tower also deserves special attention.  At the moment, the construction is the highest in the whole country - 344 meters.  On the upper floors of the tower there is an observation deck with magnificent views of the city, as well as an elite restaurant and interactive installations telling about the history of the state.  <span>The Tallinn TV Tower was</span> at one time closed for visiting for reconstruction.  The reopening took place in 2012. </p><h2>  Quarter Rotermann </h2><p>  Previously, it was an ordinary working district in Tallinn, but after the city authorities hired leading European architects, the factory quarter completely changed its appearance.  Today it is a newfangled place with an interesting design.  Industrial enterprises and warehouses were replaced by offices of large international companies, hotels and art galleries. </p><h2>  Winter season </h2><p>  Winter holidays in Estonia are fundamentally different from summer holidays.  The whole country, and especially the capital, is acquiring a completely new look.  Tourists say that the sights of Tallinn in winter have some kind of magical power.  What is a train ride around the Old Town or Christmas markets in the center of Town Hall Square!  The capital of Estonia is perfect for active winter holidays.  For example, the Singing Field, which in the summer looks quite deserted, in the winter attracts tourists to slide downhill, as in childhood.  Nearby is a complete ski run, ice rink and a separate slope for snowboarders.  Equipment can be easily rented.  And how beautiful Old Tallinn is in winter!  You can see the sights photo below.  The main symbol of the capital of Estonia - the Old Town - as if frozen in a snowy tale ... </p><div class="photo" data-original="iamaileen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter Tallinn from the side" class="if uuid-2332093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2332093.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Guests of Tallinn can be absolutely sure that this city will not disappoint at any time of the year.  The capital of Estonia is able to offer travelers the exact vacation they have been dreaming of for so long.  What is there to think?  Try it yourself! </p><p>  Concluding our detailed virtual tour of Tallinn, we note: the capital of Estonia is a full-fledged open-air museum.  Many travelers who have already managed to enjoy all the charms of the city, assure in their reviews that Tallinn is the most beautiful city in the Baltics. </p><p>  We hope that our article has provided you with new and useful information, and also served as a source of inspiration for visiting this wonderful city and the country as a whole.
