    <p>  The city was founded at the beginning of the XI century.  The toponym comes from the ancient Bulgarian word "cauldron", which translates as "cauldron".  Today, over 1 million people live in Kazan.  The city is especially beautiful in summer: at this time fountains begin to work here, and in the evenings, numerous cultural and jazz events are held. </p><p>  Key sights of the <span>capital of Tatarstan</span> can be seen in 2-3 days.  Where to go to Kazan in the first place?  This will be discussed in the next section. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to go in Kazan: overview of the main attractions </h2><p>  First of all, you should definitely take a walk through the historic center of the city.  It is located on the left bank of the Volga, within the Vakhitovsky district.  The most beautiful streets are Bauman, Pushkin, Kremlin, Petersburg and Dzerzhinsky. </p><p>  It is incredibly difficult to imagine a voyage to this city without visiting the white-stone <span>Kazan Kremlin!</span>  Moreover, the entrance to the territory of the architectural complex included in the UNESCO conservation list is absolutely free.  For many tourists, the local Kremlin resembles a fabulous Disney castle. </p><p>  There are many other expressive and valuable architectural structures in Kazan.  This is the mansion of Shamil, the Alexander Passage, the Epiphany bell tower, the Palace of Farmers and many other monuments.  Separately, it is worth mentioning about mosques, of which there are about fifty in Kazan.  Among them is the largest <span>Kul Sharif</span> mosque in Russia and Asia, 58 meters high.  The religious building was built in the mid-90s and is one of the main business cards of the city. </p><p>  Another interesting object of Kazan is the so-called temple of all religions.  The author of the unique building project was the artist <span>Ildar Khanov.</span>  It is very difficult to describe the structure in words.  It's easier to come to Kazan and see it with your own eyes. </p>

Where is this facility located? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kazan: <span>Black Lake.</span>  Location and current status of the park </h2><p>  Black Lake is a popular pastime for locals.  Especially a lot of young people here - the proximity of the location of several universities affects.

    <p>  Black Lake Park is located in the city center and is limited by three streets: Dzerzhinsky, Lobachevsky and Chernyshevsky.  The nearest metro station is the Kremlin. </p><p>  In the western part of the park there is a rectangular pond (all that remains of the historic Black Lake), which turns into a skating rink in the winter.  Within the recreation area there are also many swings and children's slides.  Almost all citywide holidays are traditionally held in the park - Kazan Day, Maslenitsa and other celebrations. </p><h2>  Legends and dark pages of the history of the Black Lake </h2><p>  At the entrance to the park there is an interesting object - the Arch of lovers.  The peculiarity of this structure is as follows: if you stand at one of its edges and whisper a word, the other person standing on the other end of the arch will certainly hear this word.  This phenomenon is particularly attracting the attention of children. </p><p>  This park in Kazan was not always a pleasant place to relax for citizens.  So, at the end of the 19th century, he enjoyed a rather poor reputation.  Thieves, pickpockets and prostitutes actively hunted here. </p><p>  In the 20s of the twentieth century, the regional NKVD department was located near the fence of the park.  Many residents of the city went through his prison.  Therefore, very soon the phrase "Black Lake" acquired a completely different, darker and eerie meaning from the townspeople. </p>
