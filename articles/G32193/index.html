Payment for electricity: how to transmit meter readings, calculate and pay?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Our dear and beloved parents and grandparents always always clearly knew what and where to pay.  They memorized it once and for a lifetime.  For example, in order to pay utility bills, they always fled to the nearest post office, lining up in kilometer queues and preventing other citizens who came to pick up the parcel or send a letter to wedge and get what they wanted.  Payment day, you know ... It is more important than any parcels with envelopes there!  And you can‚Äôt argue with this, because mostly people of retirement age pay for electricity in post offices.  They are used to doing it the way it was many decades ago.  Of course, they can be understood, since the Internet is a dark forest for them, it‚Äôs scary to go to banks, and the post office is always close. </p>

    <h2>  We use and pay! </h2><p>  This may seem like a joke to some, but even today there are people who, except for the nearby post office, do not know the places where you can still pay utility bills.  Meanwhile, in the courtyard of the XXI century!  Progress does not stand still.  Let's find out how they pay for electricity in civilized countries? </p><h2>  Several ways </h2><p>  Always - remember, always!  - There are several payment methods.  That is why it is quite possible to choose the method that you like and fit perfectly into your work schedule, will not violate the plans and will not make you lose precious time in endless exhausting lines.  Of course, you can understand some people of the age who continue to attack the nearest post offices during payment days, because they pay for electricity in the old way, they simply do not know any other way to solve the problem.  However, the modern man who values ‚Äã‚Äãhis time has nothing to do here! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  So, let's see how true the words of modern economists are about the number of <span>ways to pay</span> utility bills. </p><h2>  post office </h2><p>  Firstly, the notorious post offices are ready to accept your payment if you still arrived.  The advantage of this method is that it is the most popular, known to all, and the number of departments mentioned is simply huge.  It is not necessary to calculate anything yourself here.  You just need to take a <span>meter reading</span> before you pay for electricity.  By the way, at the same time you can send a postcard to a friend or receive a parcel (since you‚Äôve come anyway).  The disadvantages, of course, outweigh.  Imagine a long line that hardly progresses, a stuffy room, people who are trying to climb forward, tired and nervous postmen ... An unpleasant sight, right?  But these are the harsh realities of the country.  Therefore, you should choose another method for yourself! </p>

    <h2>  Financial organizations </h2><p>  The next on the list is the bank.  As in the post office, at ATMs and banking institutions, you can pay without commission.  Here, too, there is no need to independently carry out any calculations.  It is enough to pass the readings of the electricity meter to the bank employee so that he will enter them into the computer and give the final amount.  A modern person can choose absolutely any bank branch.  An ATM can also come to the rescue, however, in order to use it, you must have a plastic card with you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be noted that some financial organizations establish a commission for such a service. </p><h2>  Payment using modern technology </h2><p>  You can make a calculation using the world wide web.  True, here it will not be possible to simply transmit the readings of the electricity meter, you need to calculate everything yourself.  How to do this, we will tell a little below.  It should be noted that payment for electricity via the Internet involves visiting special sites.  Funds are withdrawn either from a bank card or are special electronic money.  Agree, this method is extremely convenient.  Without leaving your home, without leaving your computer, you can pay off all debts owed to utilities. </p>

    <h2>  A mobile phone is in a hurry to help! </h2><p>  If the payment time is running out, you can find a method that is always at hand.  Take a look around!  Look at your mobile phone - it will be your assistant.  All that is required is an Internet connection.  Where does the money come from in this case?  For example, you can remove them from the personal account of your mobile phone.  You can also set up bank account management and pay using the World Wide Web.  True, it is important that the funds go as intended. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Automatic machines </h2><p>  For several years now, experts have promised us that special machines will be installed, with which the payment for electricity will be calculated and billed.  That is, you can just go up and give money for the kilowatts used.  In this case, payment for electricity by the meter is carried out according to the standard scheme for the bank: indications are entered, the final amount is calculated. </p><h2>  Metering devices </h2><p>  According to current legislation, each of our compatriots living in an apartment of a multi-storey building is obliged to equip their housing with special appliances that take into account heating, the amount of water consumed, and electricity.  All fellow citizens were obliged to do this until July the year before last.  Those people who, for whatever reason, did not install such meters, were also supplied with metering devices until July last year.  Therefore, we can say with confidence that now payment for electricity is based on the accurate readings of the devices.  These numbers should be reported to the operator or entered independently when the payment is made. </p><p>  So, first you need to clarify the previous value of the counter, that is, data for the last month.  Then the digits of the current period are entered.  The difference between these values ‚Äã‚Äãis multiplied by the cost of one kilowatt per hour. </p>

    <h2>  Why so much? </h2><p>  Some of our fellow citizens complain that the tariffs are too high, we have to spend fabulous money for paying for utility bills.  Still, they complain in vain, since the electricity tariff is the same.  Often, people simply don‚Äôt know how much to pay for <span>electricity, where the</span> numbers <span>come from</span> .  But the amount of electricity consumed depends only on the owner and his tenants.  The average social norm in the country today is about seventy kW / h per month.  This is not much and not small, but according to statistics, approximately seventy percent of the population fits into these indicators.  That is, such an amount of electricity per month is quite enough. </p>

    <h2>  How to save? </h2><p>  If you do not fit into the aforementioned ‚Äústandards‚Äù, you should reconsider your behavior in relation to the use of the resource.  What does it mean?  Do you like the light to burn around the clock?  Prefer to constantly listen to music using a huge radio?  Have you got two refrigerators that work at the same time?  Well, then do not be surprised that you have to pay a lot of money.  Still, you need to compare your appetites with the possible consequences. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the tariffs vary, depending on the time of day.  For example, the use of electricity at night will cost an order of magnitude cheaper than during the day.  It is advisable to use this knowledge to save a certain amount of money.  In this case, payment for electricity will not hit the wallet so hard.  Also, the bonus in the form of chocolate will remain.  A joke, of course.  But complaining about the electricity tariff is rather stupid, because, according to economists, it is quite low.  With the right approach, you can generally save constantly and consume as much energy as you want. </p><p>  In order to use electricity mainly at night, you need to get a special meter.  Two-tariff metering today is extremely beneficial to night owls, that is, those citizens who lead a nocturnal lifestyle or who actively use energy-intensive devices. </p><p>  Perhaps you should give preference to energy-saving technology.  Fortunately, its assortment is very wide.  Try to cut back on your ‚Äúenergy‚Äù appetites.  In a word, everyone in this case does what is convenient for him.  If money allows, you can not focus on saving at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electricity bill" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20871/427393.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to use double rate accounting? </h2><p>  In order to use this form of accounting, it is imperative to install a two-rate meter in your home.  And how do they pay for electricity in this case?  It should be noted that the device together with the installation will cost about three thousand rubles.  Of this amount directly for the work will need to spend about two thousand rubles.  Based on the comments of modern power engineers, the costs associated with the acquisition and installation of a two-tariff meter will easily pay off within three years. </p><p>  It should be noted that on the board of these metering devices there is a special digital indicator or symbolic drawings in the form of the sun, as well as the moon.  It is quite possible to purchase such a counter yourself.  In addition, you can contact the competent authorities for advice.  They will definitely tell you which device is more profitable to purchase.  By the way, regardless of who installs it, it is imperative to send an application letter so that the device is accepted for operation, and also subsequently sealed. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that if a subscriber does not have any debts, he is either sent an energy supply agreement or presented with a receipt to pay the full cost of services, which includes the installation of a multi-tariff electricity meter.  Today, the transfer of subscribers to the so-called two-tariff settlement system is a paid service.  Funds are transferred directly by receipt to the bank account of the contractor. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electricity charge rate" class="if" height="183" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20871/427202.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Output rate </h2><p>  Soon, owners of apartments in the capital will be able to pay <span>utility bills,</span> including paying for electricity, according to the new rule - based on the new weekend tariff.  According to experts, the mentioned tariff will be calculated on average between night and day.  That is, something radically new awaits us.  Such a tariff will be preferential when compared with the daily.  This is a very interesting way to save. </p><p>  It is no secret to anyone that directly on Saturdays and Sundays, very many residents of our capital plan a huge number of business affairs.  Since modern household appliances are usually characterized by extremely high energy consumption, the introduction of a new tariff today will significantly save on utility bills.  It is assumed that it will operate around the clock, both on holidays and simply on weekends. </p><h2>  Force Majeure </h2><p>  It happens that the funds do not reach.  What does it mean?  Suppose you paid the required amount, but anyway, an electricity debt has formed.  That is, some kind of calculated error arose, offensive and undesirable.  In this case, it should be remembered that the receipt of payment for electricity must be kept.  This will save not only your money, but also the nervous system.  If you still could not save the notorious piece of paper, you need to get a duplicate of it or just paper confirming that the payment was nevertheless made.  This can be done at the place of payment. </p>
