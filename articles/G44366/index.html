  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Shade-loving plants</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Over a century and a half in biology, the classification division of all plants into shade-tolerant and photophilous has been firmly established.  These differences can be observed with a natural change in tree species or as a result of fires.  It was then that <span>light-loving plants</span> first appeared on the sun-exposed areas of the earth <span>,</span> and only later, when the necessary conditions were created, they were shade-tolerant.  Different species of trees, shrubs and grasses create an even more powerful natural dome.  As a result of this, there are very few conditions for growth for light-loving plants at the surface of the earth.  Moreover, their existence becomes impossible. </p><p>  Shade-loving plants prefer diffused light and live only in the absence of direct sunlight.  Otherwise, the growth of these representatives of the flora is extremely depressed.  In this case, it is likely that they will receive sunburn. </p><p>  Shade-loving plants are mainly trees or herbs that grow under their canopy.  The most prominent representatives of this species of flora are mosses, ferns, crowns and lichens.  They are ubiquitous in forests.  We all know the shady plants-algae, whose habitat are rivers, seas and lakes.  A thick layer of water protects them from sunlight. <br>  With age, in conditions of mountains, high latitudes, and also in the driest climate, plants experience a decrease in shade tolerance, and the ability to develop in direct sunlight also arises. </p><p>  Shade-loving plants from a physiological point of view have a low intensity of the <span>process of photosynthesis.</span>  The leaves of representatives of this species of flora have a number of anatomical and morphological features.  In these plants, the spongy and columnar parenchyma is minimally differentiated.  Moreover, their cellular structure contains a small amount of chloroplasts (from ten to forty), the surface area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is from two to six square centimeters per square centimeter of sheet. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Some plants growing under the forest canopy are photophilous in their physiological characteristics before the formation of a natural sun canopy.  To such representatives of the flora can be attributed to the dread and hoof.  After the growth of the forest canopy, these plants become shade-tolerant.  Thus, their growth is possible from early spring to late autumn. </p><p>  If on your site there are places where almost no sunlight falls, then the most beneficial solution will be the planting of shade-loving plants.  These representatives of the flora have a special charm, which finds its expression in the diversity and originality of the leaves.  This is what gives decorativeness to the territories they planted. </p><p>  Shade-loving plants for the garden with large leaves and the presence of a high peduncle are usually located in the <span>background of the plot</span> allocated for the flower garden.  If the flowerbed is open from all sides, then in its central part dominant plants for these purposes can serve as caterpillar buzzards, beautiful telecom, large-flowered and magnificent elecampane and others. </p><p>  Against the background of these <span>tall plants</span> , perennial varieties of medium growth are placed.  As such lovers of shade, you can specify an Asian and Chinese swimsuit, large hosts and others. </p><p>  The lower tier of a site planted with shade-loving plants is formed from ground cover and creeping species.  The most popular is the planting of evergreen <span>apical pachisander,</span> small periwinkle, and <span>moths.</span> </p><p>  Shade-loving home plants grow well on window sills overlooking the north side.  For places where there is a lack of lighting, well suited: </p><p>  Chinese abelia </p><p>  - violet flowering synpolia; </p><p>  Begonia of Lucerne; </p><p>  -aglonema variable, etc. </p>
