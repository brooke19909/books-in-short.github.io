The focal length for all ranges from 18 to 135 mm.  They are designed to work with crop matrix, so they are suitable only for cameras of this type.  The series includes three models.  Consider all Canon 18-135 mm lenses. </p><h2>  EF-S f / 3.5-5.6 IS </h2><p>  The first version that was released is dedicated to the release of the camera from the same manufacturer.  It's about the EOS 7D camera.  The lens is equipped with a special image stabilizer.  It has four levels of settings.  Other <span>Canon</span> 18-135 mm <span>lenses</span> got the same specifications.  For the focus to work, the minimum distance must be 0.45 m. The lens aperture has six blades. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenses canon 18 135" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1703627.jpg" width="434"></div>

    <h2>  Advantages of EF-S f / 3.5-5.6 IS </h2><p>  Many photographers call this lens universal.  In addition, it is inexpensive.  Due to the wide range of focal lengths, you can take good and wide pictures.  It is suitable for shooting landscapes, as well as for everyday photography.  Other Canon 18-135 mm lenses are also universal. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of EF-S f / 3.5-5.6 IS </h2><p>  Many consumers call the lens too dark.  According to some, he lacks sharpness.  This fact is noticeable only to professionals, beginners will not pay attention to it.  Aperture at a low level, but for a lens in this category, expect something more powerful is not worth it.  If the focus is long, then the optics begins to ‚Äúsoap‚Äù the frame a little.  Other Canon 18-135 mm lenses work the same way.  Unfortunately, optics for 10 thousand rubles is not capable of having the best characteristics.  It is also worth highlighting a lot of weight.  For some users, the device may seem heavy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon ef s 18 135 lens" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1703628.jpg" width="506"></div>

Many also advise it to beginners.  The average cost of optics is 10 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The first thing that catches the eye of the photographer is the material from which the <span>Canon EF-S 18-135</span> mm <span>lens is made</span> .  We are talking about not very expensive plastic, its quality also leaves much to be desired.  The mount is made of metal, so there are no complaints in this plan.  Moreover, the assembly is also of high quality.  There are two ‚Äúorgans‚Äù of control on the lens.  One of them is responsible for stabilization, while the second changes the focus mode from automatic to manual and vice versa.  In addition to the keys, two rings are built in.  They are responsible for focusing and enlarging the picture.  The first one is spinning a bit hard.  Zooming is good, double the magnification at a time. </p><p>  Together with the lens, the camera together may seem dimensional and heavy.  Fixation of optics is weak.  If you wear the equipment around your neck, then it can independently extend. </p><p>  According to many reviews, the device is good for beginners.  He perfectly "explains" exactly how it is necessary to deal with the lens. </p><h2>  EF-S f / 3.5-5.6 IS STM </h2><p>  The second version of the lens was released for the EOS 650D camera from the same manufacturer.  How does it differ from the first option?  Although all the optics described in this article are the best Canon 18-135 mm lenses, one of them stands out very much.  Here we used a step drive of the power element, which is responsible for focusing.  Due to this, the process of adjusting the lens to the exact distance to the part occurs as smoothly, quickly and quietly as possible.  Therefore, shooting a video with this optics will be convenient.  In addition to all this, the lens has a frame stabilizer.  The second difference from the above optics is the number of aperture blades.  There are seven in this lens.  The minimum distance for focusing has become smaller to 0.39 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best canon 18 135 lenses" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1703629.jpg" width="581"></div>

However, when choosing the right camera, there will be no such incidents in ready-made photographs.  Many would like to get sharper pictures, but no one considers this a serious minus. </p><p>  Another drawback is that the angle can hardly be called wide enough.  Add at least 0.5 mm and most of the photographers would be happy. </p><h2>  General impression of the EF-S f / 3.5-5.6 IS STM </h2><p>  This Canon 18-135 mm lens (good reviews) is bought by those who prefer to photograph distant objects.
