And the number of guests continues to grow.  Thanks to this, Cuba is becoming an increasingly popular tourist destination every year. </p><p>  Liberty Island is striking in its splendor of exotic nature, snow-white beaches, emerald warm waters of the sea, an unusually colorful underwater world and original revolutionary surroundings. </p><p>  Everything in this country is created for tourists and for their sake.  It is no secret that the tourism industry significantly replenishes the state treasury.  First-class restaurants, luxury hotels, plenty of entertainment and all the water sports known today - all this is designed to ensure that guests come back here again. </p><p>  Tourists who are just planning a trip to Liberty Island are interested in everything related to this country: location, climate, the best time to visit and, of course, reviews about holidays in Cuba.  We will try to give detailed answers to these and many other questions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nypost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Cuba, reviews of tourists" class="if uuid-2915601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2915601.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Republic of Cuba is located off the coast of North and South America.  It is separated from the mainland by the waters of the Strait of Florida.  The state occupies the islands of Huventud, Cuba, as well as about 1,600 small islands with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã110,860 km¬≤. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The southern coast of the island of Cuba is washed by the waters of the Caribbean Sea, and the northwestern and northeastern borders - the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="21.521757" data-lng="-77.78116699999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="5"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/5/2/9/10529.png"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Most travelers to the island leave rave reviews.  They can talk about rest in Cuba for hours, describing everything that struck them in a distant land.  Surely in such conversations an amazing and very comfortable climate is mentioned.  Cuba is warm, but not hot: the average temperature in January is +22.5 ¬∞ C, and in August +27.8 ¬∞ C.  Most precipitation falls from May to September - this is the rainy season. </p><p>  High humidity is maintained throughout the year.  Monsoon winds almost always blow on the island, and in one direction.  This can be seen on the inclined tree trunks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.savvytraveldecisions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Republic of Cuba" class="if uuid-2915596" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2915596.jpg"></div><h2>  Population </h2><p>  This is a multinational country where the blood and traditions of the peoples of Spain, Africa, Italy, Britain, Germany, American and Cuban Indian tribes, immigrants from France and China, as well as Jews resettled during the First and Second World Wars miraculously mixed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The population of the republic is 11.5 million people.  In their reviews of holidays in Cuba, travelers always note the benevolence of the local population.  Do not refuse the offer to play dominoes with them or share a meal.  This can offend them. </p><h2>  Popular cities of Cuba </h2><p>  Due to the small area, you can go around Cuba in a couple of weeks.  In order not to miss anything important and interesting, consider the reviews of tourists about holidays in Cuba.  Photos of local attractions are often accompanied by travel reports in special publications. </p><h2>  Havana - the capital of the country </h2><p>  Quite often it is called the city of opposites - modern skyscrapers here peacefully coexist with the colonial mansions in which ordinary people today live.  The city has many interesting places and architectural monuments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Havana - the capital of Cuba" class="if uuid-2915718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2915718.jpg"></div><p>  Havana impresses with its white beaches, gourmet cuisine and the incendiary sounds of salsa.  Bar El Floridita quite often appears in reviews of tourists about holidays in Cuba (photo is placed in the article below).  This is one of the great places of the great Ernest Hemingway.  The city also has a writer‚Äôs house-museum.  In the evening, Havana turns into one huge disco. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.lahabana.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bar El Floridita" class="if uuid-2915812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2915812.jpg"></div><p>  This is the best time to visit the Tropicana show cabaret, which has been known far beyond the borders of the country since 1939. </p><h2>  Santa clara </h2><p>  A memorable place for most Cubans is the place where Commander Che Guevara derailed the armored train of dictator Batista.  The wreckage of this train remains at the crash site today.  They are pride and one of the main attractions for residents of the country.  The mausoleum named after Ernesto Che Guevara was also built here.  Interestingly, American citizens are not allowed into it. </p><h2>  Santiago de Cuba </h2><p>  And this is the birthplace of street culture.  In Santiago de Cuba, music sounds on the streets of the town at every turn.  The city is considered to be the cradle of rum and Cuban melodies - Don Facundo Bacardi was born here. </p><h2>  Trinidad </h2><p>  Enthusiastic reviews about the rest in Cuba are left by history buffs.  If you want to know what the island was like in the 18th century, then the city of Trinidad is more suitable for this than other places.  The authentic atmosphere of this place is striking: paving roads, colonial-style houses, sugar plantations and houses for slaves - everything has been preserved in this city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.steppestravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cuba, Trinidad" class="if uuid-2915732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2915732.jpg"></div><h2>  Cuban Resorts: Varadero </h2><p>  The most famous resort in Cuba.  Holidays in Varadero, according to tourists, can satisfy the needs of the most demanding travelers.  It is located 120 km from the capital.  It can be reached from the nearest airport by taxi.  The city is famous for its snow-white beaches and the azure clear waters of the Atlantic Ocean. </p><p>  Local beaches are among the three cleanest in the world.  Sandy beaches, stretching over a 20-kilometer spit, are perfectly equipped.  Here luxury hotels from the most famous hotel chains are built.  The oldest of the resorts of the republic, no doubt, is a paradise.  Reading the reviews of tourists about holidays in Varadero in Cuba, we can conclude that the resort is a classic holiday in Russian: everything is always included here.  Tourists come here year-round.  The city has more than two hundred hotels of the highest level of comfort, almost the entire local population is engaged in serving tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mountainsoftravelphotos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Varadero" class="if uuid-2915737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2915737.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to beaches and many discos, in Varadero you can see many attractions.  Youth and children are attracted to the dolphinarium located on the outskirts of Varadero.  After a daily presentation, visitors can swim for at least 20 minutes and take memorable photos with dolphins.  In addition, you can take a walk in the Hosone Park, which has existed for more than half a century and is famous for its unique collection of tropical plants.  All visitors can get acquainted with the local inhabitants - Ara parrots. </p><h2>  Guardalavaca </h2><p>  The divers enjoy their holidays in Cuba.  Reviews and photos of scuba diving fans clearly indicate that Guardalavaca is one of the best diving resorts, famous for its unique coral reef. </p><h2>  Huventood </h2><p>  The resort, better known as the Island of Youth, is located 100 km from the island of Cuba.  It attracts tourists with nature reserves.  Locals claim that R. Stevenson wrote Treasure Island, inspired by the landscapes of Huventud. </p><p>  This is only a small fraction of the interesting places that can be visited in this country.  Experienced travelers claim that even if you come to Cuba 2-3 times a year for several years, this country will still surprise you again and again. </p><h2>  When is it better to come on vacation? </h2><p>  Today, many travelers choose holidays in Cuba.  Reviews and tips of experienced tourists will help you choose the season to visit this distant country.  They say that the most favorable time for a trip to Liberty Island is the period from November to April. </p><p>  In summer, it is very hot and humid due to the rainy season: torrential rains can go almost every day.  In winter there can be a lot of tourists from the northern countries.  But windsurfing enthusiasts should choose a summer vacation in Cuba.  Vacationers often publish reviews and photos of their success in this sport in tourism magazines.  In the rainy season, the biggest waves rise here.  Rest can overshadow only the dominance of hurricanes between October and November. </p><h2>  Rest in the winter </h2><p>  It was winter that was recognized as the best time to visit a distant republic.  In winter, precipitation is the least, the probability of hurricanes is minimal, and the average temperature in the winter months is +24 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  If you believe the reviews, a holiday in Cuba in winter is attractive due to the possibility of combining excursion programs and traditional pastime on the beach.  Winter is the most favorable and most expensive time in Cuba, because this season the ideal weather for a beach holiday reigns here: the air temperature during the day is around +26 ¬∞ C, and at night it drops only to +21 ¬∞ C. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidaypirates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Cuba in the winter" class="if uuid-2915745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2915745.jpg"></div><p>  Great pleasure in winter swimming.  On average, the water warms up to +25 ¬∞ C.  The sea is quite calm, little excitement is noted only in the northern regions of the island, on the shores washed by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean.  Quite often in winter the water is warmer than air.  This is the best time for a beach holiday in Cuba (reviews confirm this) also because the amount of rainfall during this period is minimal. </p><p>  In winter, short-term cooling is possible in Cuba - the temperature during the day can drop to +20 ¬∞ C.  This is due to northern air currents. </p><h2>  Cuba in December </h2><p>  A huge number of travelers from all over the world dream of getting out of the dull landscapes of winter and dank everyday life.  That is why millions of tourists annually fly to Cuba to celebrate the New Year and spend Christmas holidays in the shadow of majestic palm trees instead of spruce.  December, January and February are the most stressful times for the country's tourism industry.  During this period, prices for tours increase by almost 40%.  However, vouchers are still sold out long before the planned trip. </p><p>  Particular admiration at this time was expressed by guests of the country in their reviews.  Holidays in Cuba for the New Year are impressive and leave a lot of bright and pleasant memories.  The December holiday on Liberty Island can be divided into two parts - until December 22 and after.  In the period ‚Äúbefore‚Äù in hotels, prices correspond to November prices, and after this date, on the eve of Catholic Christmas and New Year, they take off at least three times. </p><p>  Cubans are very fond of the New Year and begin preparations for it long before the holiday.  It is very important for them to choose the right outfit: it should be new clothes, with preference given to yellow or red tones, which promise good luck and prosperity in the new year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.havana.embaixadaportugal.mne.pt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New Year in Cuba" class="if uuid-2915767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2915767.jpg"></div><p>  Instead of a Christmas tree, locals dress up Araucaria (decorative tree), and at the festive table there is always a roast pig, sweet potato and lots of fruits.  You can also try holiday lobsters.  They can‚Äôt afford ordinary Cubans, so the whole Mediterranean menu is intended for tourists. </p><p>  Exactly at midnight, all those present at the festive table, according to a long tradition, eat 12 grapes.  This has been the case since the days of the Spanish colonialists.  The more sweet berries caught, the better: a ‚Äúsweet‚Äù year awaits you.  And champagne, traditional for Europeans, replaces rum here, as well as cocktails based on it. </p><p>  On New Year's Eve, Cubans always open all doors in the house to spend the old year and let the new one enter the house.  Tourists are always surprised by the unusual New Year's tradition of the Cubans - a round around the house with a suitcase.  This promises in the coming year a lot of travel and enjoyable adventures.  And so that there is always enough money for these pleasures, they put a few coins in a suitcase. </p><h2>  Rest in January </h2><p>  And this month, Cuba does not experience a shortage of vacationers, since it is the rest in Cuba in January that is comfortable for Europeans.  In the reviews, many tourists note the weather that is favorable for beach and sightseeing holidays.  Daytime temperature is still around +25 ¬∞ C, and at night it does not fall below +16 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the water temperature in the ocean warms up to +24 ¬∞ C, strong winds do not allow swimming, you have to limit yourself to diving in hotel pools.  This is considered a slight lack of rest in Cuba in January.  Guest reviews suggest that this month the Cuban resort of Cayo Largo is especially popular. </p><p>  It is attractive because the winds are not so strong here, and therefore you can enjoy a beach holiday even this month.  On the first of January, guests of the republic can take part in the celebration of the country's liberation day.  There are festivals and military parades everywhere. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": JON12 / STOCKIMO / ALAMY STOCK PHOTO, " data-source="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/caribbean/articles/Caribbean-travel-guide/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Cuba in January" class="if uuid-2915787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2915787.jpg"></div><h2>  What to do in Cuba in February? </h2><p>  Most reviews of holidays in Cuba in February are enthusiastic.  This period falls on the high season.  Travelers especially appreciate the February beach tours.  The weather is very comfortable - during the day in the capital from +26 ¬∞ C, and in Trinidad - up to +29 ¬∞ C.  True, some lovers of the hot sun complain that with sunset, coolness rapidly sets in, and at night the temperature rarely rises above +16 ¬∞ C.  Therefore, going on a vacation to Cuba in February, it is worth taking warm clothes with you. </p><p>  During this period, many interesting events take place on Liberty Island.  First of all, it is worth mentioning the famous February carnivals.  On a special scale, they are held in Havana, where this tradition has recently begun to revive.  In addition, once every two years you can contemplate stunning shows - the International Festival of Cuban Guitars and the Jazz Festival.  Most of the tourists in February spend much time on sightseeing in Cuba. </p><h2>  The best beaches </h2><p>  There are many good reasons to visit Cuba.  For many travelers, one of the main arguments is the presence of beautiful beaches.  Huge sections of white pristine sand, turquoise water and comfortable weather delight tourists year-round.  Regardless of which part of Cuba you prefer to relax, you will like well-groomed and well-maintained beaches. </p><h2>  Beach "Varadero" </h2><p>  The most famous Cuban beach stretches over 19 kilometers.  It is located 140 km from the Cuban capital, on the Ikakos Peninsula.  In addition to length, Varadero is famous for its purity.  Fine white sand, turquoise clear water and magnificent palm trees - for this combination the beach is included in the ranking of the best in the world. </p><p>  The entrance to the water is gentle, therefore families with children prefer to relax here.  The beach is surrounded by magnificent all-inclusive resort complexes.  Tourists celebrate aerobics classes, games, dance classes, and the opportunity to engage in all water sports held by local specialists here. </p><h2>  Playa ancon </h2><p>  If you stayed in the colonial city of Trinidad, you can relax on the beach "Playa Ancon", which is recognized as one of the best on the south coast of Cuba.  It is a luxurious and very picturesque place with thatched umbrellas and golden sand.  Here you can go diving and snorkelling in the nearby reefs. </p><h2>  Guardalavaca </h2><p>  Classic Cuban beach: kilometers of white sand, clear azure sea, swaying palm trees.  The vast sandy beach, the sea, in which, according to vacationers, is much smaller than algae.  Tourists can walk here for several hours, not reaching the edge of the beach.  This is a great choice for those who are attracted to proximity to nature. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  It is natural that many parents are interested in reviews of tourists about holidays with children.  Cuba is a country in which a culture of family relations is developed.  Here is a pretty attractive environment for relaxing with your family.  Going on a trip with the children, you will be guaranteed a friendly welcome in any corner.  There are many places in Cuba that your children will love. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prworldtravel.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Family holidays in Cuba" class="if uuid-2915843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2915843.jpg"></div><p> Almost the entire island is a huge tropical garden with unique vegetation, caves, nature reserves, magnificent sea views.  In the suburbs of Varadero there is a crocodile nursery, in which interesting excursions are held daily.  In the province of Cayo Largo, a unique tortoise farm awaits guests.  In Cienfuegos, a huge dolphinarium has recently been opened, which hosts daily performances. </p><p>  Valle de la Prehistoria - Jurassic Park located in the vicinity of Santiago de Cuba.  Here the life of the prehistoric period was very accurately and thoroughly recreated: with saber-toothed tigers, dinosaurs, pterodactyls and other life-size animals.  Children are delighted when exciting scenes from the life of these ancient animals unfold before their eyes. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, a vacation with children in Cuba is interesting for young travelers of different ages.  In the province of Holguin, a historic meeting of Europeans with the indigenous people of Cuba took place.  This is reminiscent of the exposition of the Baryay National Park, the reconstruction of the Indian village of Taino.  The park has an open-air museum "Indian Village", in the territory of which is a copy of the Spanish fortress.  It is difficult to tear the boys from the exposure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="captivatingcuba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Cuba with children" class="if uuid-2915837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2915837.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the many advantages of having a holiday with children in Cuba, there are some drawbacks in the reviews of tourists.  This applies primarily to a long flight, which can be difficult to transfer not only to children, but also to adults.  A flight lasts an average of 11 hours, so you should carefully think out activities for kids so that they do not get bored and do not be capricious.  For this reason, quite often tourists with young children choose closer destinations. </p><p>  You should carefully choose a hotel, specifying all the details, since in Cuba, many of them are focused on youth recreation, and their children will not be very comfortable. </p><h2>  Cuban hotels </h2><p>  In Cuba, 4 * hotels are the most common, although if you do not plan to stay in four walls for a long time, you can opt for 2 and 3 star hotels: Club Karey (Varadero), Terral Hotel (Havana), Coral (Cayo Largo Island) ), Ancon (Trinidad). </p><p>  For lovers of luxury, the choice is not too large, since there are very few 5 * hotels.  Most of them are represented by world-famous networks operating on an all-inclusive system.  Holidays in Cuba (reviews indicate this) will be even more pleasant if you stay at the luxurious Winter Escapes in Havana, Playa Pesquero in Holguin, Melia Las Americas in Varadero. </p><h2>  How to get to Cuba </h2><p>  For a comfortable and convenient flight to Cuba, experienced tourists are advised to use the services of the Aeroflot company, which operates direct flights from Moscow to Havana. </p><p>  About 12 hours a direct flight from Moscow lasts, from 16 to 20 hours - a flight with transfers through Europe. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  A few recommendations that make life easier for tourists: </p><ul><li>  In Cuba, two currencies are used - CUP and CUC.  Both are not international.  Therefore, you will need to change money as soon as you find yourself in the country. </li><li>  In Cuba, gratuities are optional, but sometimes they are included in the bill.  They are equal to 10% of the total.  If they are not, you can leave 5%. </li><li>  Check your bills at restaurants and bars carefully.  Often, their amount is much larger than expected. </li><li>  Public transport in Cuba, despite its low cost, is not the most efficient way to travel.  In a taxi, the fare is inexpensive, and bargaining is also possible. </li><li>  English is not widely spoken in Cuba, so learn basic Spanish phrases before you travel. </li><li>  The sun on Liberty Island is much brighter and more intense than in Russia and the CIS countries.  To avoid sunburn, stock up on sunscreens. </li><li>  You will need protective creams and sprays against small insects that can ruin your evening beach vacation. </li><li>  You should not drink raw water in Cuba, and ask for alcoholic drinks to be served chilled without ice, since Cuban water contains many harmful bacteria that can be dangerous for tourists. </li></ul><p>  Now that everything has been studied, you can safely go to Cuba! </p>
