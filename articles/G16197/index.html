There you can devote time to various procedures.  Wraps using 100% local chocolate are especially popular.  This procedure nourishes the skin with vitamins, essential minerals and trace elements.  She is also accompanied by exfoliation of the body and moisturizing massage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you want relaxation, you should visit the Finnish sauna, steam bath or jacuzzi, located in the open air, right in the center of the fragrant tropical vegetation of the garden. </p><p>  There is a separate exfoliation, with which it is possible to remove dead cells from the body.  This procedure perfectly prepares the skin for tanning.  Many people sign up for a <span>hot stone massage,</span> which perfectly relieves muscle pain and tension.  Reflexology is also practiced here.  That is, massage with finger presses on special points on the feet.  And, of course, here you can sign up for lymphatic drainage.

    <h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  So, Gran Bahia Principe La Romana serves its guests according to their favorite all-inclusive system.  Accordingly, there are several restaurants where guests can enjoy fine dining. </p><p>  Orquidea is a restaurant serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  It serves international cuisine.  Le Gourmet serves traditional French flavors.  And il Capriccio will definitely appeal to lovers of Italian cuisine.  Mediterranean treats are served at El Pescador.  In each of these three restaurants, with the exception of the first, you need to book a table in advance. </p><p>  And by the way, the dress code must also be respected.  Beach clothes and shorts with t-shirts are strongly discouraged here.  For girls - dresses and sundresses, for guys - light shirts and trousers.  Institutions are presentable, so their level must be consistent. </p><p>  And the choice there, as the guests at the hotel say, will satisfy any gourmet.  There are a variety of juicy fruits, high-quality natural coffee, delicate pizza on thin crust, spaghetti, cheese and sausage slices, several types of meat and seafood (even served lobsters).  In the bars, which are several, a huge selection of alcohol and cocktails.  Many of them, by the way, include rum. </p><h2>  The most budget rooms </h2><p>  Grand Bahia Principe La Romana has several categories of apartments.  In total, the hotel has 400 rooms.  The budget category is the improved junior suites with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã30 square meters.  m </p><p>  The bright apartments, decorated in a cozy but modern style, have one 2-king-size bed.  Each junior suite has a private furnished balcony.  There is a telephone, a plasma TV with satellite channels, and a safe.  It also has air conditioning, ironing facilities, a comfortable desk, dressing room and even a coffee machine, alarm clock and fan.  In general, everything you need for comfort.  And, of course, a bathroom.  With hairdryer, shower, bath and toilet.  Free hygiene kits with luxury cosmetics are also included. </p><p>  There are no fixed prices.  We can say for sure that the cheapest apartments are if you book them a week or two before the trip.  There is a chance even to get a discount.  In this case, two guests will have to pay about 60-65 thousand rubles for a week in a junior suite.  For a 5-star all-inclusive complex, these are very low prices.  However, that is why the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana 5 * hotel is so popular. </p>

    <h2>  For staying with children </h2><p>  Many decide to travel with their child.  And some take two children with them at once.  However, it's okay, because the hotel has apartments for them. </p><p>  However, the conditions are the same.  Only the number of beds and the price of the stay differ.  For example, if 2 adults took two children with them, then a week of stay will have to pay a little less than 100 thousand rubles.  Is there only one child?  In this case, the price will drop to 80 thousand rubles.  If three adults with one child plan to move into the apartment, then 110 thousand rubles will have to be paid for the rest.  This is the most expensive option.  But for one adult and his child, the rest will cost 65 thousand rubles.  By the way, all prices are inclusive of 18 percent VAT. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Many tourists, leaving reviews about Grand Bahia Principe La Romana, pay special attention to the hotel workers.  Guests assure - the level of service is excellent.  The vast green area is superbly watched - always clean and tidy.  The same goes for pools. </p><p>  Room cleaning is daily.  Towels and linen are changed with the same regularity, constantly replenishing supplies of liquid soap, body lotions, shampoos, hair conditioners and other accessories. </p><p>  Very polite and nice receptionists.  As many say, they met them with cocktails at the reception, a smile and a quick check-in.  By the way, if you are interested in excursions and an entertainment program, you should contact the reception - they will tell you everything, help with the choice and order it.  It comes out cheaper than the services of a tour operator. </p>
