Unrecognizably, they changed the country in a little over ten years, turning it from an empire into a socialist republic.  Three Russian revolutions became decisive for several generations of Russians. </p><h2>  The first (1905-1907 gg.) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thoughtco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The revolution in Russia in 1905" class="if uuid-2554299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2554299.jpg"></div><p>  The table ‚ÄúRevolutions in Russia‚Äù below will help to understand the main events associated with this historical period, to build everything that happened in chronological order. </p><p>  During the first revolution, the strike movement was actively developing, uprisings and unrest occurred in the army and navy.  All this resulted in mass protests against the monarchy.  The result was the adoption of the 1905 Manifesto, which established the <span>State Duma</span> as a legislative body under the Russian monarch.  The empire managed to be preserved, but unrest and dissatisfaction with the situation prevailing in the country continued to persist. </p><h2>  Reasons for the revolution </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Emperor Nicholas II" class="if uuid-2554303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2554303.jpg"></div><p>  In the table, the Revolution of 1905-1907 in Russia is presented according to the chronology of events.  The reasons that led to it are also indicated.  Among the main historians are called: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  money circulation disorder; </li><li>  industrial decline; </li><li>  large public debt; </li><li>  a crop failure that only exacerbated the economic situation. </li></ul><p>  Public debt has grown since the Russo-Turkish war, and the situation has also escalated due to the urgent need for reforming public authorities. </p><p>  Moreover, at that time subsistence farming was of great importance in the Russian economy.  After the abolition of serfdom, a new institution of legislative power was required.  In addition, many were dissatisfied with the military setbacks in the Russian-Japanese war, the low standard of living in the country, poverty, and the almost complete absence of civil liberties. </p><p>  The table on the Revolution in Russia 1905-1907.  the land issue is separately mentioned.  At that time, the peasantry was the most numerous estate, it included 77% of the subjects of the king.  In the last decades of the 19th century, the population grew at such a rate that allotments decreased by almost half, and productivity did not grow so much.  The appearance in Europe of cheap grain from America, which made unprofitable Russian bread, also played a role.  All this caused discontent and social tension. </p><h2>  The beginning of the uprising </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Workers during the February Revolution" class="if uuid-2554295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2554295.jpg"></div><p>  In the table, the revolution in Russia (1905-1907) can be considered based on its main stages.  It all started with a strike at the <span>Putilov factory</span> on January 3, in which about 12 and a half thousand people took part.  The next day, other workers joined them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On January 5, the popular opposition leader pop Gapon introduced the idea to appeal to the emperor himself.  Soon the strike became a citywide strike.  Considering the Revolution of 1905-1907 in Russia, the table indicates which events took place at that time. </p><p>  A petition was drawn up in the name of Nicholas II, which contained political and economic demands.  In particular, the provision of universal suffrage, civil liberties, an 8-hour working day, and affordable education. </p><p>  On January 7, the government became aware of the petition.  Claims calling for an end to autocracy were declared unacceptable.  It was decided not to let the workers go to the Winter Palace, but to place troops on the main streets that would block their path.  In total, about 30 thousand soldiers entered the city. </p><p>  On the morning of January 9, approximately 150 thousand people went to the center of St. Petersburg.  When the columns of workers approached the outposts, they were required to stop, but the protesters continued to move.  Everyone was so sure of the king‚Äôs humanity that they did not even suggest bloodshed.  But as the crowd approached Zimny, the troops opened fire. </p><p>  According to official figures, only on January 9, 9 people were killed and 333 wounded.  Later, another 130 participants in the demonstration died of wounds.  This day in the history of Russia is known as Bloody Sunday, a mention of it can be found in any table about the Revolution of 1905-1907.  in Russia. </p><p>  The leader of the workers, Gapon, who managed to escape from the police, began to call for the overthrow of the Romanov dynasty and armed resistance.  Strikes began throughout the country.  It was then that the slogan "Down with the autocracy!" </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Events are developing rapidly </h2><p>  After Bloody Sunday, events began to develop rapidly.  Nicholas II created a commission, which included not only manufacturers and officials, but also representatives of the workers of St. Petersburg. </p><p>  It was immediately announced that the political demands declared by the revolutionaries were impracticable.  However, the workers, who were included in this group, began to demand freedom of the press, the restoration of the so-called Gapon assemblies, previously banned by the authorities, as well as the release of comrades who were arrested.  Members of the government recognized the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such a commission as unsuccessful, so they dismissed it. </p><p>  Meanwhile, strikes began throughout the country.  Students joined the workers.  The railway connection was almost completely stopped.  In May, a textile strike began in Ivanovo, which lasted about two months.  In large cities, the Soviets of Workers' Deputies arose.  Unrest in Russia was exacerbated by national conflicts.  For example, in the Caucasus there were clashes between Azerbaijanis and Armenians, which lasted until 1906.  These events of the revolution in Russia (1905-1907) are also mentioned in the table. </p><p>  On February 18, a manifesto came out that called for the strengthening of the autocracy in the country.  In addition, Nicholas II went to sign the law on the appearance of an elected representative body.  The manifesto played an important role in the development of the First Revolution in Russia (the table confirms this). </p><p>  All this laid the foundation for a large-scale social movement that tried to attract the population to lawmaking.  All kinds of petitions, resolutions, projects, notes were constantly compiled and adopted. </p><p>  Zemstvos independently organized congresses in April and May, influential figures participated in them.  Based on their results, a request for popular representation was sent to the emperor. </p><p>  April 17 issued a decree on religious tolerance, which allowed the transition from Orthodoxy to other faiths.  The restrictions that apply to Old Believers have been lifted. </p><h2>  Armadillo Riot </h2><p>  The rebellion of the team on the battleship "Potemkin" occurred during the First Revolution in Russia (this fact is noted in the table).  During the rebellion, seven people were immediately killed on the ship.  A cruel court of sailors sentenced the ship's commander and doctor to death.  After a short time, government troops blocked the battleship, but he still managed to break through and go into the open sea.  With virtually no food and coal reserves, he reached the Romanian shores, where sailors voluntarily surrendered to the will of local authorities. </p><p>  In June, the uprising in Lodz begins, which became one of the key events of the First Russian Revolution in Russia, and the table confirms this.  Riots here continued until 1907. </p><p>  In August 1905, Nicholas II signed a manifesto on the establishment of the State Duma in the country.  This was one of the significant results of the revolution in Russia.  In the table, this fact is reflected.  It was found that this body should meet no later than January next year. </p><p>  At the same time, the election clause came out.  True, out of the four democratic norms that existed at that time (they included direct, general, secret and equal elections), only one was observed - secret ballot. </p><p>  The half measures taken by the government to stabilize the situation could not calm the rebels.  In October, unrest resumed in Moscow, and soon they grew into an All-Russian political strike.  In total, about two million people went on strike. </p><p>  The authorities took decisive measures.  The governor-general of St. Petersburg, Trepov, even ordered sticking out proclamations in the streets, in which he ordered the police to decisively stop any unrest, and in case of resistance, spare no bullets. </p><p>  The general strike leads to a new round of revolution in Russia.  This fact is mentioned in the table.  Events nevertheless force the emperor to sign the famous Manifesto of October 17.  In the table section on the 1905 Revolution in Russia, a special place is given to him.  The manifesto granted civil liberties to the people, in particular, freedom of conscience, assembly, and personal integrity.  Thus, the basic requirements of the liberals were met.  The autocracy decided to create a parliament and start reforms, the first of which was the famous Stolypin agrarian reform. </p><p>  However, in reality, the government tried with all its might to organize an easily managed parliament, and if this did not succeed, it was immediately dissolved.  It is believed that the dissolution of the Second State Duma, along with which the electoral law was amended, marked the end of the First Russian Revolution. </p><h2>  Continuation of the struggle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="October Revolution" class="if uuid-2541025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2541025.jpg"></div><p>  In 1917, the country experienced two coups at once.  The comparative table of revolutions in Russia clearly demonstrates what events took place at that time.  They also influenced the course of World History. </p><p>  By that time, the situation in Russia was perhaps even worse than in 1905.  First of all, because of the First World War, which the country had been waging for years, it constantly suffered heavy losses and suffered defeat after defeat. </p><p>  The first stage was the February revolution in Russia.  The table shows its causes, goals and main events.  Its successes, namely the overthrow of the autocracy and the establishment of the republic, were enthusiastically received by many.  However, a large number of dissatisfied remained. </p><p>  As a result, on October 18, at a meeting of representatives of the regiments, Trotsky proposed to adopt a resolution on the disobedience of garrisons to the Provisional Government.  The day before, right-wing socialists submitted to the Petrograd Soviet a proposal to create a Committee of Revolutionary Defense in order to protect the capital from the Germans, who were already approaching Petrograd.  For this, the Bolsheviks created the Military Revolutionary Committee. </p><p>  The course of <span>armed insurrection</span> was adopted by the Bolsheviks at the congress held in August, but now they have put it into practice.  The main events of this 20th century revolution in Russia are set out in sufficient detail in the table. </p><p>  On October 25, the Provisional Government, decapitated after the departure of its leader Kerensky from the capital, settled in the Winter Palace.  It refused the proposal of the Bolsheviks to surrender.  Soon, the soldiers of the Petrograd garrison, along with the Baltic sailors, captured the palace and arrested members of the Provisional Government. </p><h2>  Towards the army </h2><p>  In the table on the 1917 Revolution in Russia, the leader of the Provisional Government Kerensky is mentioned, who left Petrograd in the car with the American flag on the eve of the Zimny ‚Äã‚ÄãWinter assault.  He went to meet the troops who were supposed to return from the front in order to protect Petrograd from the Bolsheviks. </p><p>  The main events of October 1917 </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  date </td><td>  Event </td><td>  Value </td></tr><tr><td>  October 10 and 16 </td><td>  Meeting of the Central Committee of the RSDLP (B.) </td><td>  Zinoviev and Kamenev‚Äôs line for peaceful development was rejected; instead, the plan of an armed uprising of Lenin was approved </td></tr><tr><td>  October 12th </td><td>  Creation of WRC </td><td>  Headquarters for preparing for an armed seizure of power is being created </td></tr><tr><td>  October 24th </td><td>  Red Guard units take to the streets of Petrograd </td><td>  Establishing control over the most important objects of the capital </td></tr><tr><td>  the 25th of October </td><td>  WRC Appeal Published </td><td>  The resignation of the Provisional Government and the transfer of power to the WRC </td></tr><tr><td><p>  the 25th of October </p></td><td>  The II Congress of Soviets of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies is open </td><td>  Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks boycott Congress, Bolsheviks seize power </td></tr><tr><td>  October 25-26 </td><td>  Storming the Winter Palace </td><td>  The arrest of ministers of the Provisional Government </td></tr><tr><td>  October 26th </td><td>  Congress Results </td><td>  Decrees adopted on peace and land </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The very next night, right-wing socialists set up the Committee for the Salvation of the Homeland, which, according to the plan of its organizers, was to become a counterweight to the Military Revolutionary Committee.  Eser Gotz began distributing anti-Bolshevik leaflets, supporting Kerensky and the sabotage of officials.  He called for his like-minded people in Moscow to active resistance. </p><p>  Kerensky found support from Krasnov, appointing him commander of the Petrograd Military District.  They undertook a campaign in Petersburg with the Cossacks.  At this time, the uprising of the junkers began in the capital itself, which was crushed on the same day.  At this time, in the Gatchina region, the Cossacks conspired with the sailors in order to betray Kerensky, who had to rush off in disguise as a sailor. </p><h2>  October revolution in Moscow </h2><div class="photo" data-original="histerl.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Political Parties at the Beginning of the 20th Century" class="if uuid-2541019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2541019.jpg"></div><p>  Regarding the 1917 Revolution in Russia, the table indicates that events in Moscow developed according to a completely different scenario.  On October 25, the Council of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies was formed, as a result of which virtually all power passed to it.  On the same night, the main strategic objects were taken under control: telegraph, arsenal, State Bank.  But here, in contrast to the forces of the Bolsheviks, the Committee for Public Security was created, which was headed by SR Rudnev.  He was supported by Cossacks and junkers. </p><p><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_127-0"></sup>  The fighting in Moscow itself continued until November 3, a truce was announced for only one day.  When the Public Security Committee did not receive the promised assistance from the front, it was decided to lay down their arms.  During these riots, several hundred people were killed. </p><p><sup class="reference"></sup>  Most government officials officially refused to acknowledge the coup.  In Petrograd alone, about 50,000 people ceased to fulfill their duties after <span>the Bolsheviks came to power.</span>  It was possible to break this sabotage of the new government only by the spring of next year.  Up to this point, the catastrophic shortage of employees had to be compensated by sending workers from large factories to enterprises. </p><h2>  Soviet power in the field </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bolsheviks in power" class="if uuid-2554306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2554306.jpg"></div><p>  At that time in Russia there still existed a multi-party political system, which shortly after the October Revolution was completely destroyed.  The political issue played an important role in Russia during the years of the revolution.  The parties in the table below are presented along with their respective political views. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  The consignment </td><td>  The leaders </td><td>  Year of creation </td><td>  Main characteristics </td></tr><tr><td>  Union of the Russian people </td><td>  Dubrovin, Markov </td><td>  1905 </td><td>  Black Hundred Organization, whose political views are based on monarchical and anti-Semitic ideas </td></tr><tr><td>  Russian monarchist party </td><td>  Gringmouth </td><td>  1905 </td><td>  Supporting the empire </td></tr><tr><td>  Union October 17 </td><td>  Guchkov </td><td>  1905 </td><td>  Moderate party of large landowners, entrepreneurs and officials </td></tr><tr><td>  Constitutional Democratic Party </td><td>  Milyukov </td><td>  1905 </td><td>  Centrist Political Party </td></tr><tr><td>  Party of Socialist Revolutionaries </td><td>  Gershuni, Chernov </td><td>  1902 </td><td>  Adhered to the methods of political terror </td></tr><tr><td>  Russian Social Democratic Labor Party.  The Bolsheviks </td><td>  Lenin, Zinoviev </td><td>  1898 </td><td rowspan="2">  Views were based on the socialist ideas and works of Marx and Lenin </td></tr><tr><td>  Russian Social Democratic Labor Party.  Mensheviks </td><td>  Axelrod, Dan, Martov </td><td>  1898 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Moreover, the initial positions of the Bolsheviks on the ground were extremely weak.  In only fifty provincial cities, they had about seven percent of the places, and in most provincial cities - no more than two percent.  Local authorities almost immediately began a confrontation between the Soviets of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies, but only in 15 large cities came to bloodshed, the rest did without armed uprisings. </p><p>  At the same time, the sprouts of anarchy began to show themselves more and more often, ethnic conflicts intensified.  For example, in the fall of 1917, a real battle took place in Grozny, in which soldiers from the Chechen equestrian regiment who had just returned from the front and the Cossacks took part.  Everything quickly grew into full-scale pogroms in Grozny itself.  As a reaction to these events, the Chechen National Committee was formed, which was headed by Sheikh Denis Arsanov.  Grozny began to look more like a fortress under siege, work in the oil fields was almost completely stopped overnight.  The Ingush and Chechens began to regularly attack the Cossack villages. </p> <h2>  The first steps of Soviet power </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sites.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bolsheviks in power" class="if uuid-2541026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2541026.jpg"></div><p>  Speaking briefly in the table about the revolutions in Russia (1917), it is worthwhile to dwell on the fact that the first tangible result of the October uprising was the adoption of famous decrees on peace and land.  The main thing that the people dreamed of at that time was to end the First World War and get the right to own a piece of land.  The last aspiration was especially strong among the peasants, who at that time in Russia were the vast majority of the population. </p><p>  An important milestone for the workers was the decree on the 8-hour working day, which many revolutionaries had sought since 1905.  The next bills that influenced the development of the whole country was the decree on the destruction of the estates, which meant that from now on all citizens of Russia are legally equal. </p><p>  Comparison Chart of Key Revolutionary Events </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  Reasons for the revolution </td><td>  the main goal </td><td>  Revolution Events </td><td>  Summary </td></tr><tr><td>  The revolution of 1905-1907 </td><td>  Industrial recession, crop failure, unresolved peasant issue </td><td>  Improving working conditions, liberalization, redistribution of land in favor of peasants, civil liberties </td><td><p>  Riot on the battleship "Potemkin" </p><p>  Bloody sunday </p><p>  National conflicts in the Caucasus </p><p>  General strike </p><p>  Publication of a manifesto on strengthening the autocracy </p><p>  Uprising in Poland, Lodz </p></td><td>  June 3 coup, the establishment of parliament, reforms, restriction of the autocracy, partial solution of the land issue, signing of the manifesto on October 17 </td></tr><tr><td>  February revolution </td><td>  <span>Social tension,</span> deplorable economic situation, protracted World War I </td><td>  The overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the republic </td><td><p>  Bread riots </p><p>  Armed uprising and coup </p><p>  Formation of the Provisional Government </p></td><td>  The abdication of the throne of Nicholas II, the establishment of the republican system, the fall of the monarchy </td></tr><tr><td>  October Revolution </td><td>  Unresolved land issue, unwillingness to continue the war </td><td>  The elimination of capitalism, the implementation of socialist reforms </td><td><p>  Kerensky's departure from Petrograd </p><p>  Storming the Winter Palace </p><p>  In Moscow, power passes to the Council </p></td><td>  The victory of the Bolsheviks, the beginning of the Civil War, the creation of the Soviet Republic, the adoption of decrees: on land, on peace, on the elimination of nightingales, etc. </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The decree on a monopoly on implements and agricultural machinery helped to establish work in agriculture, at least for the first time.  At the same time, the counterrevolutionary forces were so strong that it became necessary to create an All-Russian Extraordinary Commission to Combat Counter-Revolution, and it was also charged with the duty of resisting various crimes and speculations. </p><p>  The decree on the nationalization of banks significantly strengthened the position of the <span>Soviet government.</span>  According to this document, all gold that was in bullion and coins in bank vaults was subject to immediate confiscation with subsequent transfer to the national gold fund. </p><p>  Having issued a decree on the rights of servicemen, the Soviet authorities abolished ranks in the army, proclaiming all soldiers of the revolutionary army of the Russian Republic.  Opponents of the Bolsheviks fought for a long time.  Moreover, in the international arena, almost no one recognized the new government.  All this resulted in the Civil War, which ended only in 1922. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-141"></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-144"></sup></p>
