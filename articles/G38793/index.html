And in general what is this payment to the state treasury.  The thing is that it must be paid by all taxpayers who own a car.  So this is a pretty important point.  Let's find out what the transport tax is (in St. Petersburg and not only), how to calculate it, who has the right to benefits and how the state settles with respect to this issue.  It is not for nothing that citizens are so puzzled by the contributions for their car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg transport tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1221841.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Not the same everywhere </h2><p>  Transport tax (of organizations or individuals) is the payment of taxpayers.  They are annual, paid to the state treasury once a year.  Moreover, this tax is regional in nature.  That is, in each city it will be its own. </p><p>  In our case, St. Petersburg is considered.  The transport tax here will differ both in benefits and in the amount for the same transport, for example, compared with Moscow or Volgograd.  It is quite normal.  Only here taxpayers in each region will have to worry about the payment and size constantly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Privileges </h2><p>  Not everyone pays transport tax in St. Petersburg.  It is here that there is a small list of beneficiaries who are completely exempt from this contribution.  Moreover, under no circumstances will the listed citizens pay a fee for finding a vehicle in their property. </p><p>  We are talking about the Heroes of the Soviet Union, Labor, as well as veterans.  This also includes taxpayers who became victims of the events at the Chernobyl station, gentlemen of the Order of Glory, as well as the liquidators of the events at the Mayak PA.  It is these citizens who do not pay any taxes for their transport. </p><p>  At the same time, people with disabilities and pensioners are entitled to receive benefits.  From 10 to 90%.  It all depends on your specific situation.  So not many taxpayers have the right to full exemption from payment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petersburg transport tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1221844.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  By timing </h2><p>  What else is important to know?  For example, the transport tax to what date must be paid?  And what is the deadline for submitting the appropriate declaration?  These are fairly simple but very important questions.  It is not so difficult to answer them, if you follow all the amendments that are made in the tax system of the Russian Federation from year to year. </p><p>  So, for example, <span>transport tax</span> is paid until April 30 of each year.  Moreover, the calculation is for the previous period.  But you can pay the bills until October 1.  Such conditions are set for 2016.  And not only for residents of St. Petersburg, but throughout Russia as a whole. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As you can see, there is nothing special about this.  Most often, advance payments take place.  They are done before the end of the tax reporting period (until April 30) along with the submission of the appropriate declaration.  This approach saves citizens from a huge number of problems. </p><h2>  Calculation Rules </h2><p>  The transport tax in St. Petersburg and other regions is calculated according to a very interesting, but at the same time simple and understandable scheme.  In total, there are 4 formulas that will help solve the task before us.  Which ones? </p><p>  For starters, the standard - the tax rate is multiplied by the amount of horsepower in the transport engine.  There is nothing difficult or special about this.  If you have owned transport for less than a year, you need to multiply the work by the number of months of owning a car, previously divided by 12. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="public service transport tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1221842.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If we are talking about a luxury vehicle, you have to try a little.  The thing is that an upward factor appears here.  It is the same for all regions.  It is taken into account if passenger transport costs from 3 million rubles.  How to calculate the amount of tax in this case?  You need to multiply the standard formula by the increasing factor.  Have you owned transport for less than a year?  Then the second formula, which was proposed earlier, is multiplied by it. </p><p>  A bit of specificity about the <span>increasing factors.</span>  <span>The tax rate</span> for transport in St. Petersburg is better to look closer to paying it.  After all, it can still change.  But the coefficient for luxury cars such changes, as a rule, rarely gives in.  If the transport was released from 2 to 3 years ago, and its cost ranges from 3 to 5 million, the indicator is 1.1, from 12 to 24 months - 1.3, up to one year - 1.5.  If the cost of a car is from 5 to 10,000,000, if it was released no more than 5 years ago, you will have to accept 2 as a coefficient. Otherwise, 3 will be taken as that. </p><p>  On average, in 2016, <span>the tax rate for vehicles</span> in St. Petersburg for cars was 75 rubles per horsepower.  This indicator is relevant for cars with an engine up to 250 horsepower, but not less than 200. For low-power options, it is enough to pay 50 rubles (150-200 hp), 34 (from 101 to 150 inclusive hp) and 24 rubles for cars with a capacity of up to 100 liters.  from. </p><h2>  How to check </h2><p>  Transport tax can be checked easily and simply.  All debts now using the Internet and information technology can be detected without any problems.  It doesn‚Äôt matter which city in question.  After all, the options are universal.  They suit everyone and everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax to what date" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1221843.jpg"></div>
