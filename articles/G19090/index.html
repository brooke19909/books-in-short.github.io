  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Village Small Verevo, Leningrad region, Gatchinsky district</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The village of Maloe Verevo is located in the near suburbs of St. Petersburg near the Kiev highway.  It is the center of the <span>village of the</span> same name and administratively belongs to the Gatchina district of the Leningrad region.  Today, about 5,000 people live here. </p><h2>  Toponymy </h2><p>  Scientists are considering two versions of the origin of the name of the village of Maloe Verevo, Gatchina district.  According to one of them, in the Middle Ages the lands of Ingermanland were controlled by Swedes and Finns.  It is logical that in the name of the settlement there may be Scandinavian linguistic roots.  Indeed, in Swedish there is the word ver, which translates as ‚Äúfire‚Äù.  Perhaps the settlement was founded on the site of a forest fire. </p><p>  The second option is related to the topographic location.  The village of Maloe Verevo is conveniently located on the banks of the river, due to the winding channel called the Rope. </p><p>  However, the village also has another, historical name - Mylluk√ºl, which in Finnish means ‚Äúsettlement near the mill‚Äù.  And indeed, according to archival data, initially a mill with several yards was located on this site.  By the way, on one of the maps of the XVIII century indicated an alternative name - Sacred. </p><div class="photo" data-original="temples.ru" data-author=":   , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mass grave, d. M. Verevo" class="if uuid-2523735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2523735.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The village is located on the old highway leading from St. Petersburg to Pskov, halfway between the estate of the tsars - Gatchina - and the former capital of the Russian Empire.  The distance to the city of Pushkin is about 10 km, to the district center - half as much.  Fontanka, the Winter Palace and Nevsky Prospect can be reached in just 40-60 minutes by car, depending on the congestion of the tracks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Small Rope is located in a densely populated area.  In the north, it borders the Big Rope and in fact forms a single agglomeration.  In the south - with the settlements of Vaya and New Mozino, they are separated by the <span>river Izhora.</span>  To the north, at a distance of 1 km, is located Old Mozino.  In the west are agricultural land and a small forest.  The terrain is flat and significantly urbanized. </p><div class="photo" data-original="temples.ru" data-author=":   , "><img itemprop="image" alt="The temple chapel in the village of M. Verevo (near the highway St. Petersburg - Pskov)" class="if uuid-2523753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2523753.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Determining the exact date of the foundation of the village of Maloe Verevo is problematic.  Izhora land at the beginning of the 2nd millennium was the borderland between the possessions of the Swedish tribes and Veliky Novgorod.  Initially, the Vod tribe settled here, later the Izhora tribe.  From the X century, the Slavs began to come here, who peacefully coexisted with the Finno-Ugric tribes.  Witnesses of those distant times are the mounds located around the village. </p><p>  The subsequent wars of Russian princes and tsars with the Swedes did not contribute to the prosperity of the region.  Only under Peter I did peace reign on these lands.  According to data from 1817, a mill and several buildings where workers and the manager lived were located on the site of the 5000th village.  By 1831, a small brick factory was already built here, and the village itself belonged to Countess Samoilova.  The number of inhabitants in 1838 was already 101 people.  According to ethnographic data, most villagers were descendants of the Finnish Savakot people.  By 1917, the number of yards reached three dozen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="fototerra.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Small Verevo Gatchinsky district" class="if uuid-2523820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2523820.jpg"></div><h2>  Time for a change </h2><p>  According to data for 1931, there were 29 yards in Verevo.  Residents of the village organized the collective farm "Beginning".  Agricultural specialization has become fundamental to the local population.  In the 1960s, the Verevo state farm was established with a central estate in the village.  By the beginning of 1990, Maloe Verevo was the center of the village council of the same name, which included 19 settlements. </p><p>  In the troubled post-perestroika time, the number of inhabitants steadily decreased and at some point reached the mark of 3900 people.  Today, due to its proximity to St. Petersburg and excellent transport links, these lands have become interesting for suburban development.  According to estimates, from 4,200 to 5,000 people live in the village, depending on the season. </p><p>  In the village are located: </p><ul><li>  mass grave of soldiers of the 120th and 201st rifle divisions; </li><li>  chapel temple; </li><li>  educational institutions; </li><li>  bank branches; </li><li>  public bath; </li><li>  pharmacy; </li><li>  Gas station; </li><li>  construction and trade facilities; </li><li>  Cardboard and paper products factory. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Maly Verevo" class="if uuid-2523799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2523799.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to Maly Verevo </h2><p>  Residents of the village do not experience problems with transport accessibility.  A good road passes through Verevo leading to Gatchina.  Moreover, half a kilometer is the Kiev highway, connecting St. Petersburg with Pskov and then through Belarus to the capital of Ukraine. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.61637340000001" data-lng="30.17597539999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/0/5/8/4058.png"></div><p>  Parallel to the Kiev highway is the railway line S.-Petersburg-Baltic - Luga-1.  Those who wish to get to Verevo by electric train should go to the Old Mozino station, from which asphalt and dirt roads lead to the village.  The journey from the Baltic Station will take 45-50 minutes, the ticket price in 2018 is 120 rubles. </p>
