When a club, pool and sauna can coexist successfully</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The peak of popularity of clubs safely came to an end.  Today, young people do not really honor night hangouts with all the associated entertainment.  There are institutions that managed to change the format to attract youth, and there are those who decided not to change anything in the club, but only add some services.  It is such an institution that is Parnas in Voronezh. </p><h2>  Where is </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.6701401" data-lng="39.196679700000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="18"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/6/3/5/2635.png"></div><p>  Address of the institution: Voronezh, Karl Marx Street, 67B. </p><p>  It is impossible to reach the club door by public transport, it is better to get to any central stop and walk.  You can also drive your own car, but keep in mind that K. Marx Street is a pedestrian street.  Let the barrier at the club do not bother you - it is installed specifically so that only customers are parked at the Parnas club (Voronezh). </p><div class="photo" data-original="aquaparkgo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Parnassus Voronezh" class="if uuid-2425915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2425915.jpg"></div><h2>  Sauna </h2><p>  A Finnish sauna is available at the Parnas complex in Voronezh.  Guests can visit one of the three rooms.  Two of them are designed for 6-8 people, one - for 8-10 customers.  Prices here are below average in the city and range from 750 to 950 rubles per hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Institutional advantages: </p><ul><li>  located in the center of the city; </li><li>  large lounge; </li><li>  always clean; </li><li>  the sauna is dry and not very hot, which is very convenient for not the most experienced bath attendants. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  you can‚Äôt bring your own food and tea - everything needs to be ordered in the complex, which is quite expensive; </li><li>  it is forbidden to use a broom; </li><li>  missing font. </li></ul><p>  You can cool in the shared pool, but for this you have to run through the entire corridor. </p><h2>  Pool </h2><p>  The club "Parnassus" in Voronezh has a real water center.  It consists of a large pool with different depths and two slides.  This is a place where you can leisurely swim or sit in cool water.  Unfortunately, this is not a professional pool with paths and bridges for diving, but rather a huge font. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  low price (one visit for an adult costs 250 rubles, for a child - 150); </li><li>  The administration organizes various actions for pensioners and birthday people. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  Do not ask for any health certificates; </li><li>  visitors to the sauna run out to cool after the bath, causing the puzzled looks of parents with children; </li><li>  the appearance of the water slides suggests that they were installed a very long time ago and not the fact that they have ever been modernized. </li></ul><h2>  Bowling </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.voronezh.bowling1.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bowling at Parnassus" class="if uuid-2426632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2426632.jpg"></div><p>  In Parnassus (Voronezh), you can find a way to have fun and noisy youth companies.  20 tracks await visitors from Monday to Sunday. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The room is not much different from other similar ones.  If you believe the reviews of visitors, here they give out old and "tired" boots, disposable shoe covers.  Alcoholic drinks and light snacks are available.  Scoring is done on a special scoreboard.  In general, an unremarkable bowling alley in the very center of the city. </p><p>  The price for renting one track in the Parnas Voronezh bowling alley ranges from 450 to 750 rubles, depending on the day of the week and time of visit.  There are nice promotions for the birthday. </p><h2>  Night club </h2><p>  This is perhaps the weakest part of the entertainment center.  The place for night parties has not changed for many years.  While most of the city‚Äôs institutions went into a hipster format, as well as changing their musical repertoire and external design, the atmosphere of the rampant 2000s still reigns in Parnassus. </p><p>  There are several tables for which you can sit, having paid a serious deposit, as well as a small dance floor.  The musical repertoire is made up of typical club mixes.  A more adult audience comes here, while young people moved to other institutions.  Although the convenient location still allows the club to remain popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="localway.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Billiards in Parnassus" class="if uuid-2426631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2426631.jpg"></div><p>  All this is only part of the entertainment that Parnassus offers.  There is also a small cafe with white tablecloths and serious waiters, as well as billiards, where you can spend the evening, and on weekends - night.  In general, entertainment for any audience and for every taste is about Parnassus. </p>
