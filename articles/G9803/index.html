    <h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  Various surge protection devices are available on the market.  Their principle of operation is based on a change in conductivity.  For this, the device has contacts.  The threshold frequency is stabilized by a modulator.  The triode plays the role of a conductor.  When voltage is applied to the output contacts, the current conductivity parameter changes.  If we consider devices with an expander, then their contacts are installed on the plate.  Changing the position of the elements is due to the operation of the resistor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Scheme of connecting devices of the first degree </h2><p>  Surge protection devices of the first degree are suitable for panels of the PB series.  In this case, a transceiver is used to connect the models.  The output voltage must average 14 V. The conductivity parameter of the SPD depends on the <span>type of resistors.</span>  They are usually used with an amplifier.  Locks are used to connect the contacts.  The threshold conductivity parameter is on average 4.5 microns. </p><p>  Before connecting the SPD, the total resistance in the circuit is checked.  The specified parameter for devices of the first series is 50 Ohms.  Also, modifications of this type are suitable for CP type guards.  They are installed in many residential buildings.  Connection to the shield occurs through the transceiver.  The total resistance parameter in the circuit should not exceed 55 ohms.  The device is not suitable for PP series shields due to the high current conductivity. </p>

    <h2>  The use of modifications of the second degree </h2><p>  Second-degree surge protection devices are devices that connect to the PP series of shields.  In this case, the connection is due to the conductors.  If we consider modifications on expanders, then modulators are used with a lining.  Before connecting the equipment, the output voltage on the stabilizer is checked.  The specified parameter fluctuates around 13 V.

These elements are required for current conversion. </p><h2>  Third degree protection devices </h2><p>  Third-degree surge protection devices are suitable for shields that use a bushing type dynistor.  Receiving equipment is carried out through a damper.  Contacts for the connection are selected with a copper lining.  The total resistance parameter should be about 40 ohms.  If we consider the shields of the PP19 series, then the thyristor is used with an amplifier.  In some cases, modifications are available with capacitor resistors. </p><p>  Connecting elements of the specified type occurs with and without an adapter.  If we consider the first option, then varicaps are taken of a variable type.  The total resistance is on average 30 ohms.  If we consider the second option, then varicaps are allowed to use a variable type.  The threshold overload parameter of the devices is about 3 A. It is also important to note that the models use magnetic filters. </p>
