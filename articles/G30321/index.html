The consequences of the Troubles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The turmoil of the beginning of the 17th century is considered one of the most tragic historical eras of Russia.  This period had a huge impact on the further development of the state. </p><p>  Troubles.  Causes.  Brief Developments </p><p>  According to a number of authors, the events of that time can be characterized as both regular and random.  However, before this period in the history of the country it is difficult to find an era that would contain so many adverse factors. </p><p>  The Time of Troubles began after the death of John Vasilievich.  Boris Godunov, who had ties to the oprichnina, came to power, as you know.  With this comes crop failure.  In a country weakened in the <span>Livonian War</span> , hunger riots begin.  Godunov struggles to save the situation.  But all his attempts are futile.  Moreover, he is suspected of the murder of Dmitry (the son of Grozny), and society does not accept any evidence and investigations.  The authority of the new king in the conditions of poverty of the people falls completely.  All these circumstances lead to the appearance of impostors.  Desperate people are ready to stand up for those who promise improvements. </p><p>  Sweden and Poland, claiming to be Russian territory, use the Time of Troubles and the emerging impostors to their advantage.  So, for example, False Dmitry 1, supported by the Polish tsar, turned over the year into the king of Russia.  However, his excessive attention to the Kingdom of Poland caused discontent among the population.  This took advantage of Shuisky, who raised dissatisfied against the impostor.  As a result, the power changed again. </p><p>  The reign of Shuisky in 1606 did not correct the situation.  During the reign of the new king, a thieves movement is unfolding.  As a result, the <span>uprising of Bolotnikov</span> breaks <span>out.</span>  According to some authors, this uprising was the first civil war in the Russian state. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, <span>False Dmitry 2</span> appears <span>.</span> Bolotnikov unites with him.  The war is moving to a new stage.  The offensive on Russia begins.  Poles capture Smolensk. </p><p>  Shuisky, in a hopeless situation, turns to Sweden for help.  As a result, the allied Russian-Swedish army first defeats the Polish troops, and then is defeated in the Battle of Klushino. </p><p>  Failures in the battles completely undermined the authority of Shuisky.  The new stage of the Time of Troubles was marked by a conspiracy in Moscow.  As a result, Shuisky is being displaced.  Power passes to the boyars, who later swore allegiance to W≈Çadys≈Çaw (Polish royal).  In the fall of 1610, Poles entered Moscow. </p><p>  From 1610 to 1613  the period of "Seven Boyars" begins.  A major anti-Polish movement begins in the country.  Rebellions span many cities, a <span>militia is being formed.</span>  This movement is defeated.  However, by the next year, a second militia was formed, the leaders of which were Minin and Pozharsky.  Moscow was taken, and the Poles were forced to capitulate. </p><p>  At the <span>Zemsky Sobor</span> convened in 1613, a new king was elected.  The era of the reign of the Romanov dynasty began.  The first king of this dynasty was Michael, who at that time was sixteen years old. </p><p>  The consequences of the Troubles became dire for the entire state.  The events of that period led to impoverishment, undermining the economy, and economic ruin. </p><p>  The consequences of the Time of Troubles were expressed in the territorial losses of Russia.  The <span>Kola Peninsula,</span> Smolensk, Ukraine departed from the state. </p><p>  The consequences of the Troubles manifested themselves in the cultural sphere.  Some isolation of the country intensified.  The state was weakened.  Despite the victory, Russia was in very difficult conditions. </p><p>  The internal situation in the country was reflected, of course, in its external situation.  Russia began to occupy another place in the structure of economic and political ties.  Relations with some countries temporarily ceased, the country's military potential was in decline. </p><p>  The consequences of the Troubles had to overcome several generations of rulers. </p>
