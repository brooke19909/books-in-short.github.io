In recent years, many small guest houses, recreation centers and boarding houses for every taste have been built there, so those who come there have no problems with accommodation.  Of course, local entertainment is inferior to Yalta, Feodosia or Sudak, but the sights in the Solnechnogorsk district also deserve attention. </p><h2>  Resort Summary </h2><p>  The village of Solnechnogorsk is located 25 km from Big Alushta.  It is located at the foot of the mountains in the valley of the Ulu-Uzen River.  There are many vineyards and orchards in the village and its environs, so vacationers are happy to enjoy fresh cheap fruits. </p><p>  Due to its favorable location, Solnechnogorsk is a convenient starting point for car excursions to many famous architectural, natural and historical monuments of Crimea.  However, a significant portion of tourists prefer to spend more time in the village itself. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The main advantages of this main attraction of Solnechnogorsk are: </p><ul><li>  length (almost 1 km) and width (30 m); </li><li>  small pebble coating; </li><li>  comparative unloading; </li><li>  water on the coast is cleaner than in other resorts; </li><li>  the presence of such activities as riding a puck, pedalo, motorcycle, and banana, parachuting, etc. </li></ul><h2>  Jour-jour </h2><p>  Talking about the sights of Solnechnogorsk, first of all, they call it a waterfall of amazing beauty, located near the village.  Its name comes from the Armenian word "jur", which translates as "water".  The height of this natural monument is 15 meters and its width is 5 m. The Dzhur-Dzhur waterfall is not only the most powerful in Crimea, but also the most dangerous.  That is why tourists are not recommended to try to swim under its streams, along with which quite large stones are often thrown from a height. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An excursion to Dzhur-Dzhur allows, among other things, to see other attractions of Solnechnogorsk, which will be discussed later. </p>

    <h2>  Hapkhal Reserve </h2><p>  What else is interesting Solnechnogorsk?  Sights (photo see below) of it are unique natural objects.  They can be visited on their own or as part of organized tourist groups (price - about 700-750 rubles per person).  One of the noteworthy sites is the Hapkhalsky Reserve. </p><p>  By the way, the above-mentioned Jur-Jur waterfall is located just in the territory of this famous landmark of Solnechnogorsk.  The reserve has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã250 hectares, on which grow hornbeam, beech, linden, hazel, mountain ash and dogwood.  In some parts of the reserve you can see oaks and <span>Crimean pines,</span> which are more than two centuries old.  Entrance to the territory of the Hapkal reserve is paid.  The cost of visiting is 100 rubles. </p><h2>  "Forest Park of satire and humor" </h2><p>  Life would be uninteresting without cranks.  This idea occurs to anyone who learns the history of this most unusual attraction of <span>Solnechnogorsk (Crimea).</span>  Unfortunately, the person who created the ‚ÄúForest Park of Satire and Humor‚Äù is no longer alive, so tourists have to get acquainted with the ‚Äúworks of art‚Äù located there independently.  In addition, they are happy to take pictures against the backdrop of numerous gypsum-concrete sculptures dressed up in the costumes of a policeman, a convict, a grumpy housewife, collective farmers, drunks, etc. Some travelers note that the characters presented are reminiscent of the heroes of the stories of Yuz Aleshkovsky and the film about <span>Jack Vosmerkin.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Demerdzhi </h2><p>  This one of the most famous <span>mountains of Crimea</span> rises above Big Alushta and Solnechnogorsk, and it can be seen in many photographs taken by tourists who rested in these parts.  Jamerji is often called a chameleon, as its slopes are able to change color depending on the angle of incidence of sunlight.  The mountain range is divided into the Northern and Southern parts.  Although the second of them is 110 m lower than the first, it is more popular with tourists who want to visit the mysterious Ghost Valley.  There are rocks of bizarre shape.  Some of the locals call one of them Maria, while others prefer to consider her similar to Catherine the Second.  Mount Dzhemerzhi is also known for the fact that earthquakes are frequent in its vicinity.  The last most powerful tremors were recorded in 1927.  According to eyewitnesses, then the stones that fell from the top of the massif overwhelmed a small Tatar village lying at its foot. </p>

    <h2>  Karabi Yayla </h2><p>  The mountain range with this name is a great place for walking, especially those who are fond of geology have chosen it.  In particular, over 4,000 <span>karst funnels,</span> as well as 261 caves and a natural mine, can be seen on Karabi-Yail.  Amateur cavers love to study them, who want to unravel the secrets of the Crimean dungeons, many of which are inaccessible and decorated with mother nature with the help of various streak formations.  It is said that, with luck, in the caves you can find well-preserved bones of ancient animals that inhabited the peninsula many centuries ago. </p><h2>  Lighthouse temple </h2><p>  A unique monument to all those who died on the waters is located in the village of Malorechenskoye.  The temple was consecrated in the name of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker and is the highest religious building in the Crimea.  Under the main cross are electrically controlled bells that can trigger various tunes, and a large lantern. </p><p>  Near the temple is the Museum of Water Disasters (17 Dizha Street), the premises of which are decorated in the form of cabins of a sunken ship. </p>
