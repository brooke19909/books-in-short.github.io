We have already said that this task has many solutions.  Everyone is free to choose an algorithm of actions for translating ideas into reality. </p><p>  So far, you can find out the debt to the state: </p><ul><li>  by billing notifications; </li><li>  directly to the Federal Tax Service; </li><li>  through the official website of the tax service of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  through the "Personal Account" of the taxpayer; </li><li>  using electronic payment systems; </li><li>  through the "Russian Post"; </li><li>  through the service "Payment of public services"; </li><li>  on the website of the FSSP of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  on the service "State services" (there are 2 search options); </li><li>  through third-party data verification services; </li><li>  through online banking. </li></ul><p>  Below we consider all the possible options.  Step-by-step instructions and recommendations will help to cope with the task in the shortest possible time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What you need to know before searching </h2><p>  It is not difficult to find out tax debts by last name.  The main thing is to get some information about the taxpayer.  What is it about? </p><div class="photo" data-original="investingclub.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax return and personal income tax" class="if uuid-2383552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2383552.jpg"></div><p>  It is advisable to have: </p><ul><li>  Full name of a person; </li><li>  place of residence of a citizen; </li><li>  year of birth; </li><li>  passport data; </li><li>  TIN of the person. </li></ul><p>  In addition, it is advisable to know what kind of tax is involved.  Although this is not so important information.  Most often, a full name and a tax number are required.  You can work with this data in most cases. </p><h2>  Help notifications </h2><p>  How to find out tax debts?  Let's start with the simplest method for solving the problem.  It is about studying payment orders from the Federal Tax Service.  They are sent to the population about a month before the deadline for a particular payment. </p><p>  The payment details include information about the taxpayer (here you can see the TIN, last name, first name and patronymic of the person), tax, the object of taxation and the Federal Tax Service recipient. </p><p>  If the person did not pay on time, the local tax authority will send a second notice.  It will indicate the amount of debt.  Penalties accrued for late payment are also written here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="investingclub.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Website of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation" class="if uuid-2383554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2383554.jpg"></div><h2>  We go to the tax </h2><p>  How to find out tax debts of an individual?  The next trick is to contact your local tax authority. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A citizen will need: </p><ol><li>  Take along your passport or other identification card.  It is advisable to grab a TIN certificate. </li><li>  Contact your local tax office. </li><li>  Ask government agency employees to verify taxpayer information. </li><li>  Listen to the result of checking the database. </li></ol><p>  Typically, this option allows you to find out arrears of personal taxes or payments to upcoming relatives.  It is difficult to find out about third-party debts in this way. </p><p>  Important: taxes and debts are not distributed by telephone.  A call to the Federal Tax Service will not give any result. </p><h2>  "My Account" on the tax website </h2><p>  How to find out tax debts of an individual?  Another simple method is to apply for help from the "Personal Account" of the taxpayer.  It can be found on the website of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  In such circumstances, you must perform the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Register "My Account".  This service is usually provided by the IFC or the tax authorities.  You need to have an application for registration, passport, TIN with you. </li><li>  Get your hands on login information.  They can be sent by mail. </li><li>  Access the nalog.ru website in a browser. </li><li>  Log in to your account using the login and password received in advance. </li><li>  Go to the "Accrued" section. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Now it remains to examine the information on the screen.  Through the "My Account" you can form a payment order and see what the tax / penalty interest has been charged for.  Very convenient and absolutely free! </p><div class="photo" data-original="vsenaslednikam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Taxpayer Account" class="if uuid-2383549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2383549.jpg"></div><h2>  Bailiffs and verification </h2><p>  How to find out tax debts by last name?  You can use the appeal to the bailiff service.  For example, directly or through the official FSSP service.  We will stop at the second reception. </p><p>  The instruction will look like this: </p><ol><li>  Open the site of the FSSP of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Go to the "Services" block. </li><li>  Click on the "Bank of executive records management". </li><li>  Check the box next to "Individuals." </li><li>  Indicate the full name of the potential debtor.  It is advisable to fill in the other form fields. </li><li>  Click on the "Find" button. </li></ol><p>  If there is a debt, information about it will appear on the screen.  By choosing a specific payment, a person will be able to find out what the debt is charged for. </p><p>  Important: this technique often does not work.  Data on tax debt in the FSSP database appears only with significant amounts and with long-term ignoring of the Federal Tax Service.  That is, after applying to the court with a lawsuit to recover funds from a taxpayer. </p><h2>  Wallets and information verification </h2><p>  It is the easiest way to find out tax debts for the TIN of an individual.  The mentioned combination is a kind of identifier in the tax base.  With it, tax information will be discovered very quickly.  For example, through electronic wallets. </p><p>  Let's study the procedure using the example of Yandex.Money.  In this case, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Log in to your wallet.  In the electronic system you need to register in advance. </li><li>  Click on the line "Products, Services".  It is located on the left side of the window. </li><li>  Select the item "Taxes".  At the moment, the corresponding line is displayed as a popular option. </li><li>  Indicate the TIN of the person. </li><li>  Click on the control for finding information. </li></ol><p>  It is done.  Nothing more is needed.  The system will check the data of the Federal Tax Service and display all tax debts for a person.  You can immediately repay them if necessary. </p><p>  Important: similarly, it is proposed to act when using other electronic wallets.  The navigation menu may differ in signatures, but their meaning will remain the same. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kudavlozitdengi.adne.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="FSSP RF" class="if uuid-2383548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2383548.jpg"></div><h2>  "Payment of public services" and search </h2><p>  How to find out tax debts?  Another popular and simple method of solving the problem is working with the site "Payment of public services."  You do not need to register here, you can immediately begin active actions. </p><p>  The step-by-step process has the following form: </p><ol><li>  Login to oplatagosuslug.ru. </li><li>  Transition to the category "Tax debt".  The corresponding menu item is located at the top of the page. </li><li>  Choosing a payment search method.  In our case, it is "By TIN".  You can find the payment card "By receipt number". </li><li>  A set of requested information about a taxpayer in specially designated lines. </li><li>  Click on the "Find" button. </li></ol><p>  In just a few minutes, the user will see on the screen all the debts he has for certain taxes.  Having selected a specific payment, it can be repaid immediately.  For example, through an electronic wallet or by credit card. </p><h2>  Internet banking and taxes </h2><p>  Finding out tax debts by last name or TIN is quite simple.  Among the modern methods of solving the problem, information retrieval through Internet banking is singled out.  Say, using the Sberbank Online website. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kudavlozitdengi.adne.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Government services and tax audit" class="if uuid-2383547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2383547.jpg"></div><p>  Sberbank customers can act this way: </p><ol><li>  Log in to the Sberbank Online portal. </li><li>  Select the "Payments and Transfers" section. </li><li>  Click on the line "FTS" - "Search for taxes." </li><li>  Print taxpayer data in the windows that appear.

These actions will help not only to see the debt, but also to close it. </p><h2>  Registered at "Government Services" </h2><p>  It is proposed to search for tax debts on the TIN on the website of the State Service.  First, let's study the action algorithm for users registered in advance here.
