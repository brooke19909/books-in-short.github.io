  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure of water and its properties</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Water is a very complex and poorly studied system.  The structure of the water is dynamic.  Weak hydrogen bonds combine in chains.  In water, associates of molecules easily form, disintegrate, and pass into each other.  At the same time, they are exposed to many factors that were previously not taken into account or studied by traditional science at all. </p><p>  <strong>Memory of water</strong> </p><p>  Science has proved that the <span>physical properties of water</span> and the numerous short-term hydrogen bonds of neighboring oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a water molecule form special associate structures (clusters).  They are able to perceive, store and transmit all kinds of information. </p><p>  A cluster is a structural unit of water.  It consists of clathrates, the nature of which is determined by the distant Coulomb forces.  The water structure stores encoded information about the interactions that took place between water molecules.  Thus, water, the structure of which includes many heterogeneous clusters, forms a spatial hierarchical liquid crystal structure that can perceive and store significant amounts of information. </p><p>  <strong>Water structuring</strong> </p><p>  Being exposed to many factors, water is structured, acquiring a regular special structure, for example, in the process of freezing and thawing ordinary water, with the polarization of molecules, exposure to a constant electromagnetic and magnetic field.  The structure of water and its properties also change as a result of human bioenergetic effects, mechanical effects (mixing, shaking, flowing in various modes, etc.), including their various combinations.  It acquires new properties and becomes active.  Structured water can affect the body.  It is also called "living" water. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Melt water, in comparison with ordinary water, consists of a huge number of multi-molecular clusters that maintain a ‚Äúsnowflake-like‚Äù loose state for a long time. </p><p>  The structure of water, which was subjected to freezing, gives the liquid internal dynamics and the effect of a strong "biological effect".  It persists for a long time.  For example, the pH of melt water becomes 7.3, i.e.  the liquid becomes more alkaline, the electrical resistance decreases, <span>and the redox potential (oxidation-reduction potential)</span> decreases <span>.</span> </p><p>  Water is a source of weak and super-weak electromagnetic radiation.  Such radiation of structured water is the least chaotic, which sometimes leads to the induction of a certain electromagnetic field.  The field affects the structural and informational characteristics of ‚Äúliving‚Äù biological objects, spreading the charge along the molecular chain of water dipoles. </p><p>  The role of carriers of information can be physical fields of various nature.  Scientists have found that the structure of water is able to interact at the information level with the help of acoustic, electromagnetic and other fields with objects with different natural properties. </p><p>  The structure of water exposed to a magnetic field is improved.  It is becoming more structured.  The <span>reaction rate</span> increases in the liquid <span>, the</span> dissolved substances crystallize, the adsorption processes become more intense, and the precipitation of impurities improves.  Most likely, the beneficial biological effect that structured water exerts on the human body is due to the fact that pumps of <span>cell membranes of</span> tissues and organs pass molecules of ‚Äúliving‚Äù water at a higher speed, because the structure of water, in this case, resembles the structure of the cellular membranes, i.e.  highly structured organelle. </p>
