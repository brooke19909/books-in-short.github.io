But there is also the so-called low season ‚Äî this is October.  The prevailing tropical climate, rainy weather and rainfall scare tourists away.  Weather conditions can be unpredictable: at night the elements rage, and during the day there can be normal sunny weather.  Well, it's not so scary. </p><p>  Water temperature and ocean conditions are directly dependent on monsoons.  Those wishing to soak up the sun, lie on the beach, plunge into the ocean, you need to choose hotels in the eastern part of the island, while in the west at this time the monsoons are raging.  What is Sri Lanka in October? </p><h2>  Weather features </h2>

The change of seasons occurs twice under the influence of the ‚Äúwielding‚Äù monsoons on the island.  Of course, during this period it does not work without rains.  Equatorial, warm and humid regions are characterized by precipitation for several days in a row.  They are replaced by a series of clear, calm days.  The likelihood of such a development of "events" exists almost everywhere.  Rainy cloudy weather mainly in Colombo, thunderstorms and hurricanes are also frequent here.  So, a trip to this part of the island will have to be canceled.  If you want to relax, you can go to Trincomalee and Galle - October is sunny here.  Also worth a visit is Unawatuna.

    <p>  The view from some apartments is poor.  There can also be problems with sewers, which is why the rooms have far from the best aroma.  For a small surcharge of 20 euros, you can choose a suitable room, for example, with a view of the picturesque ocean.  The facilities in the rooms are excellent.  It has everything you need.  The only thing that can cause inconvenience is the lack of the proper number of outlets.  Fresh tea or coffee can be prepared at any time.  There are all accessories for this.  You can also not take a hairdryer with you. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>
