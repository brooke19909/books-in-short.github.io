But if you decide to use this number to make a call from another operator, you will have to pay.  How much exactly?  It directly depends on your tariff plan and the cost of communication in roaming. </p><h2>  Another operator </h2><p>  Often you can only call Megafon from the phone of another operator.  What to do in this case?  After all, the combination of 0505 will not work.  More precisely, she will require you to pay for the conversation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="operator megaphone operator number free" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1319219.jpg"></div>
