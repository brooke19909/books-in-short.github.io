    <h2>  Great stay </h2><p>  Vietnam is attractive for Russians by cheapness.

Nha Trang (or Nha Trang) is equally suitable for lovers of outdoor activities, including sightseeing, and for those who prefer a measured rest.  Including for travelers with young children.  That is why the hotel business in Nha Trang is at a fairly high level, developing so far. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are a lot of entertainments in the city: bars, restaurants, cafes, discos, there are excellent massage parlors and, of course, a huge selection of hotels, starting with one- and ending with five-star apartments.  Among them, the last place is occupied by the Hoa Lam Hotel.  The 2 stars this hotel is awarded fully correspond to the level of services that it offers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hoa Lam Hotel 2" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1569105.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Those who wish can go to the largest in Nha Trang and, accordingly, the most visited by tourists Cho Dam market.  Of course, it cannot be called cheap, since the prices here are designed specifically for visitors, but on this market you can buy almost everything, after bargaining and lowering the price. </p><p>  If twenty minutes to go north from the city center, then you can walk to Cape Hong Chong or Stone Garden.  Representing a huge heap of boulders of an unusual shape, this place has an unknown origin and is an amazing creation of mother nature. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  In the hotel Hoa Lam Hotel 2 * they are not due to lack of territory.  But within walking distance are <span>Nha Trang</span> Beach and Nha Trang Night Market.  Those who love diving can use the services of diving centers, which are oriented, among others, to beginners.  The main dive sites are around the island of Moon.  Here you can see not only stunning beautiful small fish and jellyfish, but also moray eels, armored and even barracudas.  Under the water, the island of Moon has more than four hundred species of coral - soft and hard, which form real gardens. </p><p>  A twenty-minute drive from Hoa Lam Hotel 2 * is the cable car, which runs directly above the sea, on which you can reach the huge water park "Winterland".  There are many water activities, including slides.  Many tourists specially come to Nha Trang to visit the "Winterland", which also has an aquarium and a large number of attractions. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  An inexpensive hotel that is suitable for those who are not going to spend the whole day in a room with a TV remote control ... That's how many of our compatriots speak of Hoa Lam Hotel 2 *.  Reviews of Russians in some issues vary, but one thing is common to all: a great price for the services provided. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hoa Lam Hotel 2 Vietnam" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1569102.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Of course, lovers of luxury and pathos will not like it here, but you need to understand that the affordable cost of living cannot correspond to the amenities that are available in local fashionable hotels. </p><p>  In all reviews, Russians warmly respond to the hotel owner and staff.  Always smiling and friendly, they readily solve all problems. </p><p>  And although the furniture in the rooms is not new, but they have everything you need for a comfortable pastime. </p><p>  Some did not like the small areas of standard rooms, as well as the lack of services designed for small children.  However, it is rather the fault of tour operators who do not warn their customers that the hotel is not suitable for families.  The lack of territory is also perceived differently by our compatriots.  Most Russians spent very little time at Hoa Lam Hotel 2 *, especially since tourists have to eat in a restaurant or cafe.  Most vacationers are either on the beach or visiting local attractions, which are abundant in Nha Trang. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha trang" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1569101.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for food, the hotel provides it only as a paid service "breakfast in the room."  But this is practically not upsetting for any of the Russians, since there are many places around where you can eat cheaply, having got acquainted with the dishes of Vietnamese and Asian cuisine. </p><p>  The beach did not cause any complaints, and although it is three hundred meters away, the road passes by local shops and cafes, and therefore does not create inconvenience. </p><p>  Having summarized the reviews, we can say that most Russians have remained quite a given hotel, moreover, they recommend choosing Hoa Lam Hotel 2 * in Nha Trang - convenient both in terms of price and location. </p>
