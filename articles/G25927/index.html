    <p>  The museum got its name in honor of the Roman gods, who were the guardians of the hearth.  Their images can be seen on the painted wooden gate of the estate. </p><h2>  How to get to the estate? </h2><p>  To get from the Peninsula Repin Museum from St. Petersburg, you need to take a shuttle bus No. 211 from the Chernaya Rechka metro station. You can also use minibuses No. 6890, 425 and 305. In addition, an electric train leaves from Finland Station Repino station.  From it you need to walk about thirty minutes along the Primorsky highway. </p><h2>  The history of the estate </h2><p>  As you know, Ilya Repin was a prominent representative of Russian art.  He managed to create real masterpieces in completely different genres.  The artist equally well created portraits, multi-figured canvases and religious paintings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1899, Repin acquired a plot with a house in an incredibly picturesque place in the <span>village of Kuokkala, now it is Repino.</span>  <span>After a while, the one-story house was very transformed.</span>  <span>Annexes appeared in it, as well as the second floor.</span> </p>

    <p>  The famous artist spent the last thirty years of his life in this estate.  In 1930, Repin died there at the age of 86.  He was buried in a park in his chosen place. </p><p>  In fairness, it is worth noting that the history of the estate is directly related not only to the life of the artist himself, but also to the history of Russian culture of that era. </p><p>  Ilya Efimovich moved to the estate in 1903.  But for another ten years, under his strict guidance and even with his participation, construction work was carried out in the estate.  As a result, the elements of wooden Art Nouveau and elements of Old Russian architecture were combined in the new building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="museum manor repin penates" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2122295.jpg"></div>

Moreover, he was known not only in Russia, but also far beyond its borders.  Many Academies in Europe have chosen Repin as an honorary member.  <span>The artist's paintings</span> have repeatedly received awards and gold medals at international and world exhibitions. </p><h2>  Works of the Penatov period </h2><p>  In "Penates" Repin wrote a series of excellent works on historical subjects, on contemporary topics.  Of particular value was a series of works entitled the Gospel cycle.  Many portraits were also painted.  Unfortunately, the works of this period are not as famous as the earlier ones, but they are of no less value. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manor and e repina penates" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2121684.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Most of them have spread around the world.  It is worth noting that the work is of interest in terms of changing the artist’s worldview, as well as in terms of artistic decision.  I. E. Repin in the estate "Penates" continued to work until old age. </p><h2>  Famous guests of the estate </h2><p>  Many famous personalities of that time visited Repin's Penates.  One of the first visitors was Andreev, Gunzburg, Gorky and Stasov.  Also, Kuprin, Annenkov, Bunin, Rozanov, Andreev and many others visited here.  He wrote a lot about Repin’s life in “Penates” by Chukovsky, who lived in the neighboring village of Ollila.  Repin and Chukovsky were very friendly despite the difference in age.  Korney Ivanovich often came to visit with his futurist friends: Sasha Cherny, Khlebnikov, Mayakovsky.  Repin also talked and made friends with such scientists as Morozov, Pavlov, Bechterov and Tarkhanov.  All of them have been to the Penates repeatedly.  Such foreign critics as Oggeti, Rosh and Briton also came to the artist.  Many visitors became models for artwork. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Museum idea </h2><p>  After the death of Repin, the artist’s wife bequeathed the estate of the Imperial Academy of Arts after Repin’s death so that a museum would be equipped in the future.  She really wanted everything in the rooms of her husband to remain the same as it was during his lifetime. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Penates Museum Manor and Repin" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2121706.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Repin announced his will in 1914 and even contributed 40 thousand rubles to the Academy for the future maintenance of the estate.  Of course, Nordman’s dream of creating I. E Repin’s museum in the Penates estate came true, but it didn’t happen right away and the journey was not easy. </p><h2>  Post-revolutionary years </h2><p>  Much has changed since the revolution.  So, for example, the Principality of Finland according to the “Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia” became independent.  In April 1918, the borders were closed and it so happened that without moving anywhere, Repin found himself abroad.  So the artist became a citizen of Finland.  He could not travel to his homeland.  The artist’s daughter Vera moved to him from St. Petersburg in 1922.  She helped her father manage the household and organized exhibitions.  The works of the great artist at that time were exhibited in Finland, Czechoslovakia, America, Sweden.  Levy helped in this.  It was he who supported Repin after the revolution, when he, due to the nationalization of money, was completely left without a livelihood.  Praise was the best incentive to work in his last years.  In 1930, the artist died.  The owner of Penat Ilya Efimovich Repin was Vera.  She left everything in the estate and in the rooms as was the case with her father.  Vera willingly showed his rooms to everyone.  She lived on the estate until 1939. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="museum and e repina penates" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2121709.jpg"></div>

    <p>  And then she had to leave the house and move to another place.  She settled in Helsinki.  And this happened for the reason that a conflict arose between Finland and Russia.  In history, it is known as the winter war.  It was then that the Finnish government invited people living in the border zone to move away, into the depths of the country.  So the “Penates” of Repin (St. Petersburg) were left unattended. </p><h2>  Museum Creation </h2><p>  After the end of hostilities, the Karelian Isthmus was annexed to Russia.  At this time, the news came to the art academy that the estate of the artist was left without owners, and Repin’s things are still stored in it.  According to the will of Repin and Nordman, a reasonable decision was made to create the Penates Museum of I. E. Repin. </p><p>  Employees from the Academy of Arts sent to the estate, who got acquainted with the condition of the estate.  During the Great Patriotic War, personal belongings, drawings and paintings of the artist were in the Academy in Leningrad.  In 1944, the estate itself fell into the epicenter of military events.  The newsreels of that period clearly show that all the houses in the Penates have been destroyed.  But in the same year, by decision of the government, Repin’s estate was included in the list of cultural monuments of the country that are to be restored.  In 1949, the village of Kuokkala was renamed Repino. </p><p>  Restoration work was carried out <span>by the Academy of Arts.</span>  <span>The estate museum has</span> become part of the Research Museum at the Academy of Art.  And to this day it is its branch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Repin Ilya Efimovich Penates" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2121710.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Not only the house was restored on the estate, but also the gate, several gazebos, the Shakherezada and Poseidon towers - an artesian well.  And on the grave there was a monument and a bust of the artist, created by the sculptor Andreev.  In 1994, the 150th birthday of Repin was celebrated.  On this occasion, the monument was replaced with the original version - the cross. </p><p>  After restoration work, the museum was opened in 1962. </p><h2>  Museum exposition </h2><p>  The museum’s exposition includes Repin’s memorial rooms.  The interiors of the premises recreate that period of the life of the great artist, which he spent in "Penates" - this is 1905-1914.  Repin’s office contains the memoirs written by him, “Far Close”.  On the walls of the rooms you can see books that the artist once read. </p><p>  The living room exhibited paintings of friends and students of the artist.  From it, doors lead to a bright veranda, which was the first extension to the house.  This room was very loved by the owners themselves.  Here they drank tea, arranged concerts and readings.  Veranda also served as a workshop immediately after moving to the estate.  Many portraits were painted in it. </p><p>  Repin's canvases hang on the walls in the dining room: a portrait of his wife, painted in Italy in 1905, portraits of the daughters of Nadia and Vera.  Also here you can see many other works of the great master. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg penins Repin" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2121719.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A new workshop was built in 1906.  Its log <span>walls, carved</span> windows and doors, as well as stairs and railings speak of stylization based on folk architecture.  The workshop occupied almost the entire second floor.  Currently, in the center of it is an easel with the last self-portrait of the artist, written in 1920.  Repin at the age of 76 is captured on the canvas.  Experts say that this work can be safely called the best in the late work of the artist. </p><p>  The museum also holds works related to the writing of the canvas "Solemn meeting of the State Council."  It was written in Petersburg.  But the estate turned out to be sketches.  Here are also stored sketches for portraits made by numerous artist's students - Kustodiev and Kulikov. </p><p>  According to Repin's friends, every morning the artist, barely awake, went to the workshop.  All his life he worked and worked. </p><h2>  Reviews about visiting the estate </h2><p>  The Repin Museum is a unique complex that is quite popular not only in Russia, but also abroad.  Over the years of its existence, more than five million people have visited it.  It is worth noting that 1099 exhibits are stored in the house.  The UNESCO Repin Museum is a World Heritage Site. </p><p>  According to guest reviews, the estate is very beautiful and interesting.  It is as if filled with the energy of its owner.  The house is surrounded by a beautiful park, it is not surprising that the artist created real masterpieces in such an atmosphere.  In the park you can also see the gazebo "Scheherazade".  Tourists highly recommend visiting the museum.  Especially the "Penates" will interest connoisseurs of the work of an amazing Russian artist. </p>
