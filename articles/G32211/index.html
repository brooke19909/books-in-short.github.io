In history, situations are known when a small child was raised by animals.  Even after they were returned, such children became unable to talk, smile, think and participate in communication with other people.  In the future, they could only master elementary skills and master a vocabulary of thirty words.  As a result, such ‚ÄúMowgli‚Äù children become ‚Äúisolates‚Äù in society.  Consequently, the process of socialization directly depends on human communication and the assimilation of cultural values.  Without this condition, children will be deprived of the formation of their own "I". </p><p>  The process of socialization is a two-way phenomenon, which includes the following points: </p><ul><li>  Mastering cultural experience by a child by entering the social environment and the communication system.  Important in this process is how society affects the individual. </li><li>  Active reproduction by him of a system of connections due <span>to active</span> inclusion in the interaction, when a person affects the environment through his activities. </li></ul><p>  The process of socialization of an individual is determined by two mechanisms. </p><p>  <em><strong>Typing</strong></em> is a way of assimilation by an individual of the forms of culture existing in the world.  It's about values ‚Äã‚Äãand norms.  As a result of this process, their gradual transformation into individual human experience takes place.  But for successful socialization this is not enough, the second mechanism must ‚Äúearn‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em><strong>Individualization</strong></em> is the transformation and transformation of personal experience into <span>cultural forms.</span>  Thanks to this, human progress is being made. </p><p>  The process of socialization has two basic stages.  They have different contents, age limits and basic mechanisms.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><p>  Primary socialization is due to the influence of the immediate immediate environment of a person.  We are talking about his parents, brothers, sisters, close and distant relatives.  Therefore, the initial process of socialization is carried out from the first day of life and ends at a <span>young age.</span>  It will be based on the relationship between the assimilation of cultural experience and the individual, through which he becomes a member of society. </p><p>  In addition, at this stage, gender socialization becomes important.  Moreover, it begins at the age of two or three years, when the child finally realizes his gender and gradually takes on the appropriate social roles and behavior patterns.  This process ends in adolescence. </p><p>  The secondary process of socialization will span adulthood.  As a result, a citizen makes a large number of friends who are married and have children.  The main activity will now be aimed at achieving life goals (career, high earnings, success, family life, organized leisure).  In addition, only strong and stable ties, both friendly and personal, become a priority. </p><p>  In old and old age, a person‚Äôs life begins to turn over.  Friendship and personal connections will gradually be lost.  But in order to feel comfortable, it is necessary to gradually change the direction of socialization.  A person will have to learn to enjoy every day. </p><p>  The process of socialization is a phenomenon by which an individual assimilates the basic elements of culture.  We are talking about symbols, values, meanings and norms. </p>
