Indeed, in this emirate, ‚Äúdry law‚Äù reigns, moreover, absolute.  Here you will not find not only a single alcohol shop, but even a cafe with a hookah.  And frank outfits of European ladies, who are favorably looked at in neighboring Dubai, are not welcome at all in Sharjah.  So does it make sense to spend a sober vacation, in a long skirt and shawl thrown over the shoulders?  The lack of alcohol finally allows you to choose alternative recreation options.  After all, Sharjah is the cultural capital of the <span>United Arab Emirates.</span>  If you want to taste the spirit of sultry Arabia, then here you are.  There are not so many hotels in this emirate as in Dubai, but they belong to different price sectors.  There are also modest deuces, and even motels.  But in this article we will talk about the chic five-star hotel Grand Excelsior Hotel Sharjah.  Its description is based entirely on reviews from tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand excelsior hotel sharjah 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1071246.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resort Features </h2><p>  First, let's say a few words about what constitutes the emirate of <span>Sharjah.</span>  Grand Excelsior Hotel Sharjah 5 * is located in the very center of its capital.  This emirate in the UAE is washed by the waters of two bays at once - the Persian and Omani.  In the city of Sharjah, several lagoons delve deeply into the coast.  Emirate of Sharjah is adjacent to Dubai, and it will be unforgivable not to take advantage of the proximity of this wonderful city and the world center of shopping.  True, the status of the ‚Äúspiritual capital‚Äù of the United Arab Emirates requires the population to keep high the bar of Muslim morality.  They don‚Äôt drink alcohol even in restaurants.  No in Sharjah and hookah institutions.  If you go outside the hotel, you need to dress modestly.  Topless sunbathing is prohibited even on the hotel‚Äôs own beach or by the pool.  The norms of Muslim morality do not prohibit bargaining, and indeed smartly do business.  In terms of shopping, Sharjah is not much inferior to Dubai. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel and what is it </h2><p>  The peculiarity of Sharjah as a resort is that only nine hotels are located on the beach.  All the rest are urban, standing on the avenues and in the maze of streets.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that taking beach tourists here has recently begun.  Or because of the fame of the "spiritual capital of the country" used by Sharjah.  Grand Excelsior Hotel Sharjah is just such a city hotel.  It is located on the third line from the beach.  It is about a kilometer to the sea, and a free bus runs from the hotel there constantly.  But the hotel is located very well for shopaholics - in fact, on one of the main shopping streets.  Also nearby is the Gold Market (Gold Souk).  I am pleased with the location of the hotel and those who came to the Emirates to see the sights of the spiritual capital.  Nearby is the Laguna Khalid and Sharjah National Park.  Like any city hotel, Grand Excelsior is a fourteen-story high-rise building with a rooftop pool.  Until April last year, the hotel had a different name - "Holiday Inn".  But now the hotel management belongs to this well-established chain.  You can get to the hotel both from <span>Sharjah Airport</span> and from Dubai. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand excelsior hotel sharjah 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1071242.jpg" width="600"></div>

The hotel rooms are divided into categories "standard" and "suites" with one or two bedrooms.  But even in the simplest guest room there is a small living room and a kitchenette.  Bathrooms are equipped with a bidet and everything that relies on the "five".  Individually controlled climate control will create a suitable room temperature.  A flat-screen TV, among others, also shows three Russian channels.  The room has a safe, which you can use for free.  Every day, guests are given two bottles of drinking water.  Do not be afraid that the nights will be sleepless due to the urban location of the hotel, because the windows are equipped with double-glazed windows.  Inhabitants of "suites" enjoy club privileges.  And they are expressed not only in bathrobes and slippers - these signs of luxury are in every room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sharjah Grand excelsior hotel sharjah" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1071243.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to feed </h2><p>  At the Grand Excelsior Hotel Sharjah you can choose the food system according to your tastes.  Usually tourists choose breakfast only, because the hotel is in the middle of the city and there are many temptations in the form of cafes, restaurants and eateries.  But there are people who choose a half or even full board power system.  There is no such all-inclusive program beloved by the Russians at the hotel.  Buffet breakfasts are served in the Al Dana restaurant on the third floor.  They also serve guests who have booked a boarding house, but already a la carte.  You will also be offered a menu with a variety of Indian dishes in the specialized Zaika restaurant.  It is located on the fourteenth floor and offers panoramic views of Sharjah.  The lounge bar is open around the clock.  Hot and cold drinks can be enjoyed there.  As we have already indicated, alcohol is not served at the hotel. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  The staff at the reception <span>of the Grand Excelsior Hotel</span> Sharjah 5 * speaks not only Arabic and English, but also Punjabi, Hindi and Russian.  These polyglots will not only tell you where to go and what to see in Sharjah, but also quickly solve all the possible problems that you have with accommodation.  Wi-Fi in free use in public areas of the hotel.  And the inhabitants of the ‚Äúsuites‚Äù, among other club services, have free access to the Internet in their rooms.  Those who carefully monitor their health and love sports will be able to work out in the gym.  An excellent spa is completely at the guests' disposal.  It has a sauna and Turkish hammam.  For a fee, you will be served in the room at any time of the day.  This hotel is often chosen by businessmen for business meetings.  Therefore, it has a conference room and several rooms of different capacities for negotiations and meetings.  There is also a business center with all the necessary equipment.  Tourists say that if you want to iron clothes, upon request at the reception you will receive an iron and a board in your room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sharjah sharjah Grand excelsior hotel sharjah 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1071245.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and Pool </h2><p>  Since the hotel is located in the heart of Sharjah, a bus runs to the sea.  The shuttle service is free if you agree to relax on Al Mamzar Municipal Beach.  On it, umbrellas and deck chairs need to be rented.  For forty dirhams per adult (25 - per child) you can come to the wonderful sandy beach of the Coral Beach Resort first-line hotel (1 dirham is about 20 rubles).  The price of entry and use of sun loungers and umbrellas is already included in the fare.  Of course, from the "five" in the Emirates you expect several pools, and not one on the roof.  But do not forget that in Sharjah the starryness of hotels is generally overstated.  Therefore, among European tour operators this hotel is listed as Grand Excelsior Hotel Sharjah 4 *.  The area around the pool does not allow you to put a lot of sunbeds, so most tourists prefer the sea. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  People come to the Emirates not only to swim, but also to shop.  Therefore, the Grand Excelsior Hotel Sharjah provides a free shuttle service not only to the beach, but also to Dubai City, to its famous malls.  But even in Sharjah, you can have a good rest.  Where do experienced shopaholics look to?  These are the Sahara Center, the Blue Souk market, Al Shaab Village, Joy Allyukas, Jift Market, KM Trading, Al Zahra, Safir Mall and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand excelsior hotel sharjah reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1071247.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to go in Sharjah </h2><p>  For shopping, do not forget about other <span>sights of the emirate.</span>  But there are a lot of them in Sharjah.  The city has more than one hundred years.  For the antiquities covered with dust of centuries, go to the Meredgia region and to Al Khan Bay, along which ancient watch towers rise.  The Grand Excelsior Hotel Sharjah 5 * hotel is located near the famous Emir Faisal Mosque - one of the largest in the Middle East.  In general, Sharjah is an amazing city.  Here the monument to the Holy Quran is adjacent to the monument to Progress.  And be sure - all tourists strongly recommend this - ride on the huge Ferris wheel "Eye of the Emirates."  This attraction is located in Al Majaz Park.  In the evening, the lack of bizarre entertainment with alcohol can be compensated for by an equally interesting cultural program in the Arab club. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand excelsior hotel sharjah 5 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1071248.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Grand Excelsior Hotel Sharjah 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Mostly tourists give the hotel the highest ratings.  Many conquered bright and spacious rooms with many amenities.  Others praise the hotel‚Äôs many services.  The only thing that people who want to come to Grand Excelsior Hotel Sharjah are warned about is that a deposit of one hundred US dollars is required upon check-in.  If they did not break anything and did not use paid services, this money is returned ... but in dirhams.  Tourists were also satisfied with the food.  Even those who took ‚Äúbreakfast only‚Äù write that they are just wonderful.  Everything is very tasty and so satisfying that you will want to eat only in the evening.  Ladies mention that the cosmetics in the bathrooms exceeded all their even bold expectations.  There were not only shampoos and shower gels, but also lotions for the body, sets for shaving and brushing your teeth. </p>
