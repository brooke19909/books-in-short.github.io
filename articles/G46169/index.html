    <h2>  Short story </h2><p>  The dynasty of Peter 1 originally belonged to the boyar clan.  It is documented that the ancestor of this genus was Andrei Ivanovich Kobyla, who lived in the middle of the XIV century.  The ancestor of the Romanovs is Nikita Zakharyin-Yuriev, who became the father of Fedor Nikitich.  The family was continued by <span>Mikhail Fedorovich</span> Romanov, who was the first to be elected to the throne at the Zemsky Sobor in 1613, becoming the founder of the new royal dynasty.  <span>Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov</span> marked his reign in 1645-1676.  significant transformations that affected the social and political fields.  The dynasty of Peter 1 continued by Fedor Alekseevich Romanov, who did not stay on the throne for long: from 1676 to 1682. After the death of the tsar, his brothers became co-rulers of the country: Ivan Alekseevich and Peter Alekseevich.  The first turned out to be incapable of governing the state, and the second brother was too small for this crucial task.  In this regard, the reins of government until 1689 took control of their sister - Sofya Alekseevna.  After the death of his elder brother in 1696, Peter 1 became the sole king. The Romanov dynasty acquired in his person a decisive reformer, who literally lifted Russia upright. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peter 1 Romanov Dynasty" class="if" height="202" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23608/680601.jpg" width="209"></div>

Old institutions broke and collapsed, and new ones were created on their ruins.  The period of his reign by all historians is unanimously assessed as a successful time for Russia.  It was this king who carried out a huge number of major reforms that positively affected the development of our country.  The dynasty of Peter 1 until 1721 was referred to as the royal.  However, the well-thought-out foreign and domestic policies of Pyotr Alekseevich turned Russia into the strongest country among Europeans, making it an empire.  The dynasty of the ruler in 1721 became known as the imperial. </p><h2>  Throne inheritance </h2><p>  Peter 1 left only one child who survived a small age.  He was the son of the emperor - Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich.  However, the only heir to the throne in 1718 was accused of confronting the reform of his father.  June 26, <span>Alexey Petrovich</span> was executed.  The family of Peter 1 was without a male heir, which forced the emperor to issue a decree on succession to the throne.  According to this document, Peter 1 had the right, at his discretion, to appoint a successor, who was supposed to be a bearer of the imperial family.  But the sovereign's plans did not have time to materialize: he died without ever appointing a new chapter.  After his death, the wife ascended the throne - Ekaterina Alekseevna, who ruled from 1725 to 1727. The son of Alexei Petrovich - Peter II Alekseevich became the new sovereign, but he died in 1730.  At this, the dynasty of Peter 1 in the male generation was interrupted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="family of Peter 1" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23608/680609.jpg" width="220"></div>

    <h2>  Procreation </h2><p>  After the death of <span>Peter II</span> Alekseevich began to rule the daughter of <span>Ivan V,</span> called Anna Ivanovna.  In 1740, she died, and the Braunschweig dynasty temporarily ascended the throne, who ruled on behalf of Ivan VI Antonovich, who was the nephew of the late duchess. </p><h2>  The last blood representative of the genus </h2><p>  In 1741, the rule passed to the daughter of <span>Peter I</span> - Elizaveta Petrovna Romanova, who sat on the throne until 1761.  With her death (1761), the dynasty of Peter 1 was suppressed along the female line.  Its further representatives were descendants of the Holstein-Gottorpsky clan, who adopted the loud and famous surname of the Romanovs. </p>
