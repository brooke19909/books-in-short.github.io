    <p>  During the course of preparation for space missions, Nikolaev showed himself as an amazingly efficient and purposeful person.  He never left the simulator until he was sure that today he did everything he could, until he realized that this part of the program was 100% assimilated. </p><p>  <strong>The first flight, in which Andrian Nikolaev participated</strong> </p><p>  The astronaut, whose biography began with the first in the history of a group space flight (Vostok-3 and Vostok-4 spacecraft) in 1962, was also a bold experimenter.  He was the first to take off the spacesuit in the ship. </p><p>  The flight lasted almost 4 days (3 days 22 hours).  The ship "Vostok-3", which was controlled by Nikolaev, made 64 turns around the planet Earth.  During the flight, the first experiments with radio communications in space were carried out, and a specially planned program of medical-biological and scientific-technical experiments was carried out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="andrian Nikolaev cosmonaut" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/247400.jpg" width="212"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Second flight (1970)</strong> </p><p>  Andrian Nikolaev is an astronaut whose biography is full of many significant moments, among them - the presentation of state awards, orders and medals, the discovery of the interesting effect of outer space on the human body.  He was later called the Nikolaev Effect. </p><p>  The fact is that the second flight, which Andrian Grigorievich made as a commander, was quite long (more than two weeks).  The astronauts did not perform any physical exercises throughout the flight, and therefore, after landing, they adapted for a long time to terrestrial conditions: they could not move, they felt bad.  This allowed us to conclude that the simulator is simply needed on the ship for sports during long trips through space. </p>
