Citizens have long been accustomed to the fact that in the tax system of the Russian Federation there are many features.  We will talk about them, but regarding transport purchase and sale transactions.  After all, it is always interesting what is worth preparing for.  Maybe it‚Äôs better to wait a while to complete the deal in a later period?  Of course, everyone decides for himself.  But it‚Äôs worth giving some useful tips.  They will definitely explain to you what tax is required for the sale of a car for less than 3 years, whether it is necessary to pay it at all, in what time frames should be met, and whether it is possible to avoid it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car sales tax less than 3 years" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1207532.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <h2>  Is it always </h2><p>  The first thing that interests citizens is whether it is always necessary to pay some kind of contribution to the state treasury when buying and selling something.  Fortunately, it is possible to answer here specifically - no.  There are some cases when the population has the opportunity to evade these penalties.  Unfortunately, they have nothing to do with our situation. </p><p>  The thing is that the tax is not paid for property that was received as a gift from close relatives.  Anyway, this is a car or an apartment.  In addition, speaking of transactions, it is not necessary to deposit money into the treasury of the state if you are selling property that has been with you for more than 3 years.  Up to this point you will have to pay.  True, different amounts.  It all depends on specific situations.  That is, in some cases you will pay more, once less.  But exempting from such a payment as a tax on the sale of a car for less than 3 years will not work.  This norm is spelled out in the law.  Failure to comply leads to liability and problems with the tax authorities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tax type </h2><p>  How to avoid problems?  Simply repay all debts to the state.  And then you can sleep peacefully.  No matter how strange this may sound, you will have to make at least two contributions to the state treasury when selling a car.  What is it about? </p><p>  For example, there is a transport tax.  When selling a car, it must be paid, because for some time in the tax reporting period you have disposed of this property.  There are a number of restrictions exempting from this payment in principle.  But it is not so common in practice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are the taxes when selling a car" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1207534.jpg"></div>

    <p>  That's not all.  What <span>taxes</span> will be <span>levied on the sale of a car</span> if the property has been with you for less than 3 years?  As we have already found out, the first payment is transport.  And the second is income.  It is paid by taxpayers for profit.  Again, this rule does not apply to those who sell the car after owning it for more than 36 months.  Now about each "contribution" in more detail. </p><h2>  Income tax </h2><p>  Well, let's start, perhaps, with the most important.  What tax is levied on the sale of a car, and indeed, any similar property transaction?  Of course, income.  Or, as it is also called, income tax. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This rule applies to individuals and organizations.  In addition, it does not matter if you are a resident of the country or not.  Everyone pays income tax.  But in different sizes.  It all depends on several factors.  Firstly, from the type of taxpayer (ordinary citizens pay less than companies), and secondly, from citizenship.  According to modern laws, if you are a non-resident foreign citizen, the transaction fee will be almost 2 times higher.  This is the rule that applies to the sale. </p><h2>  How much to pay </h2><p>  The amount of tax on the sale of a car in a fixed amount cannot be established.  That is, everything is purely individual.  It is impossible to say exactly how much citizens will pay the tax authorities.  You can only make the corresponding calculations yourself for each period and case. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what tax is the sale of a car" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1207535.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Income tax is charged at a fixed percentage of your profits.  But, as it is not difficult to guess, the income from the sale of real estate is always different.  So, the tax on the sale of a car less than 3 years will vary. </p><p>  Nevertheless, it is known for sure that the state will keep 13% of your profit from you.  This is the rule that is relevant for individuals.  In this amount, income tax is paid.  From the specified rate and you need to build on.  True, it is important to consider the cost of transport.  It is usually accepted to proceed from the cadastral value.  But the tax authorities believe that you need to build on the market price.  This is an eternal question that few people care about.  After all, citizens simply pay income tax on the amount received during the sale of vehicles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Non-residents and companies </h2><p>  What's next?  What to do if a car is sold by an individual?  Taxes, as we have already found out, pay 13% of the transaction amount.  In principle, there is nothing difficult in this.  But what about the situation with non-residents and companies? </p><p>  They will also pay income taxes.  But in different sizes.  For example, organizations charge 20% of profits as a standard, and 30% from non-residents.  It is these rules that are established for income tax in Russia.  That is, the higher the amount specified in the contract, the more you have to pay.  Therefore, most often car sales are made only by individuals.  It is more profitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car sales tax amount" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1207533.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Transport tax </h2><p>  But the transport tax is much more interesting.  After all, it is regional in nature.  This means that in each city, these payments to the state treasury will differ.  Much depends on engine power, the number of months of ownership and, of course, the tax rate. </p><p>  Calculating this installment is easy to madness.  Just pay attention to a few formulas.  More precisely, it is only one, but, depending on the situation, it changes.  Enough to multiply the amount of horsepower by the tax rate established in your area, and you will receive the amount of tax for the <span>vehicle.</span> </p><p>  If the car is owned for less than 1 year, then the figures are multiplied by the quotient of dividing the number of months of ownership by 12. Luxury cars also have their own characteristics.  By the way, we are talking about transport (passenger), which on average costs from 3 million rubles.  Then a multiplying factor appears.  If you own a vehicle for more than 12 months, the coefficient is multiplied by the horsepower in the engine and the tax rate established by the state.  And when you used the machine for less than a year, you need to multiply the second formula by a factor.  In fact, there is nothing difficult in this process. </p><h2>  Dates and order </h2><p>  A car was sold by an individual.  In this case, we found out that taxes will have to be paid.  Indeed, in our case, the transport was owned less than 3 years.  Exact amounts have already been calculated, what's next? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax after car sale" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1207536.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Now you need to understand what the payment procedure is, as well as the timing of the payment.  Typically, citizens are allowed to pay until July 15 of the year following the transaction.  But the report will have to be done earlier - by the end of the tax reporting period, that is, until April 30 of each year.  Most often, by this date all taxes are paid.  This technique is called an advance payment.  It is done at will, for the convenience of citizens. </p><p>  When making a car sale for less than 3 years, you need to provide a special tax report.  It is called 3-PIT.  It is filled extremely easy.  Especially if you had no transaction costs. </p><h2>  Documents for the report </h2><p>  What tax is levied on the sale of a car, we have already found out.  What's next?  Now you need to know what kind of documents are useful for the report.  After all, the declaration is an important point in the issue of payments to the state treasury. </p><p>  Do not be scared.  You need to cook mainly only a 3-personal income tax certificate.  This is the main source of <span>income declaration for individuals.</span>  <span>Filling</span> it is not difficult.  For this, the following documents will come in handy (it is better to present them when submitting a declaration): </p><ul><li>  information about the buyer (name, date of birth, indicated as a source of funds); </li><li>  your passport details; </li><li>  Title and technical passport for cars; </li><li>  contract of sale; </li><li>  certificate of ownership; </li><li>  SNILS and TIN (seller); </li><li>  statements of expenses (if any, for deduction). </li></ul>

    <p>  It's all.  With the help of simple electronic programs, the declaration is completed, after which documents (more precisely, copies of them) are attached to it, and then the reports are submitted to your tax office.  Nothing difficult or special.  Do not forget about the deadlines to be met.  It is advisable to complete the payment of all taxes along with the submission of the declaration.  Including transport.  By the way, it is usually paid until December 1.  The tax after the sale of the car is paid income tax, and in advance - the transport tax.  It‚Äôs better to pay off your debt to the state right away. </p><h2>  Base calculation </h2><p>  Also a very interesting point in the issue of income tax is the calculation of the so-called base.  She serves as the main source of our payment today.  The smaller the base, the lower the tax. </p><p>  In general, if a vehicle is being sold, it usually means that the transaction amount is taken as the base.  This is a standard scenario.  In some situations, the car includes some costs.  Then the base is calculated on the principle: income minus expenses.  And the costs can be covered by issuing the appropriate deduction when applying 3-personal income tax. </p><h2>  At a loss </h2><p>  Rarely, but it sometimes happens that a car is sold at a loss.  For example, he was bought for 600,000 rubles, and now it is sold for 500,000. Obviously, the seller does not receive any income at all.  Oddly enough, this fact does not completely exempt from tax. </p><p>  <span>Nevertheless, there is</span> no need to be scared.  You will not pay anyway.  But the declaration must be submitted to the tax authorities.  It is mandatory to attach in such a situation documents about your expenses, as well as this contract of sale.  This is not so difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vehicle sales tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1207538.jpg"></div>

    <p>  By the way, the tax on the sale of a car less than 3 years is not levied when the transaction amount does not exceed 250,000 rubles.  Nevertheless, reporting is still required to be submitted to the tax authorities.  As you can see, the amount of tax on the sale of a car is variable.  But you can always calculate it.  If you can not cope on your own, refer to the so-called calculators.  They will be able to give you the amount due for payment online according to the source data.  Income <span>tax on the sale of a car,</span> as you see, is almost always levied.  With rare exceptions.  Citizens are advised not to rush to register transactions with real estate and transport in order to free themselves from additional expenses. </p>
