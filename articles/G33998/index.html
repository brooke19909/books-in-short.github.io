This material has several varieties, among which stripe-satin occupies a special place.  What is it?  High quality cotton textiles, the hallmark of which is that both sides of the fabric have shiny stripes.  For premium bedding, it is most often used, and dyed with natural dyes in bright colors.  Also elegant clothes for women, men and children are sewn from it.  It is worthwhile to find out in more detail what kind of stripe satin fabric is and what advantages it has?  First you need to find out the technology of manufacturing satin fabric. </p><h2>  Manufacturing technology </h2><p>  In order for the fabric to be shiny and smooth, use various types of weft threads and warp, special types of weaves. </p><p>  The <span>satin weaving</span> refers to the predominance of warp on the front side, and to satin weft. </p><p>  The nature of the weave is a feature of jacquard that distinguishes it from printed fabrics.  It changes according to a given rapport, the result of this is the formation of patterns on the surface of the canvas.  These patterns may consist of alternating matte and shiny fragments or be colored. </p><p>  A very elegant and simple jacquard pattern includes a strip called stripe (hence the name stripe satin) in English.  The width of the strips may be different, sometimes they form simple geometric patterns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.neishclothing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satin pajamas" class="if uuid-2914751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2914751.jpg"></div><p>  Pre-dye the yarn for colored stripes, using durable pigments of the highest quality, which are harmless to the consumer and retain their durability even after many washes.  The threads are often dyed in a reactive way - this is when a dye is located throughout the depth of the fiber.  Colored or soft textured stripes, in spite of all simplicity, make stripe satin noble and refined, and bed linen made of it is very stylish and beautiful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eventrentalutah.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="purple satin" class="if uuid-2914753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2914753.jpg"></div><h2>  Features and Benefits </h2><p>  The main features and advantages of stripe satin: </p><ul><li>  The raw material used is high quality pure cotton. </li><li>  There is no electrification.  Unlike synthetics, natural cotton material does not accumulate static electricity.  Due to such a useful property of the material, during sleep, a person will be able to keep the energy balance even. </li><li>  The twist of the fibers is strong and thin. </li><li>  Mercerization of threads is a mandatory procedure in its manufacture. </li><li>  The density of the threads is 1 cm square.  - from 110 to 180. </li><li>  Breathability and hygroscopicity. </li><li>  Hypoallergenicity.  Cotton material, which does not cause itching and irritation on the body, is excellent for those who suffer from allergic rashes from contact with fabrics made from modern synthetics. </li><li>  The density of the canvas is 120 g / m <sup>2</sup> . </li><li>  The absence of stretching and shrinkage does not lose its luster and does not wear out. </li><li>  Pleasant and very soft stripe satin bedding promotes a healthy and restful sleep. </li><li>  It has the effect of thermoregulation - it removes heat in the heat, it keeps it in the cold. </li><li>  Simple geometric ornaments can form characteristic shiny stripes on the seamy and front side. </li><li>  When dyeing and bleaching, potent reagents are not used, therefore this type of fabric is safe for health. </li><li>  Printing technique - reactive. </li><li>  Ease of care. </li><li>  High quality harmless pigments are used. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.destinationevents.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satin tablecloth" class="if uuid-2914746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2914746.jpg"></div><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  From reviews of stripe satin, you can understand that this material does not have any shortcomings, the only caveat is pricing.  However, the material is premium, accordingly, the price will be high, but it is rather the truth of life, and not a disadvantage.  Practical good things cheap can not.  Therefore, prices for products from this material ‚Äúbite‚Äù, and, unfortunately, not everyone can afford to purchase, for example, bedding from stripe satin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What is made from this material </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.jcpenney.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="curtain in the bath" class="if uuid-2914749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2914749.jpg"></div><p>  Today, many products are made from stripe satin.  What exactly is it: </p><ul><li>  bedding (white, usually, or enough light shades); </li><li>  Underwear; </li><li>  Men's shirts; </li><li>  children's and women's dresses; </li><li>  natural expensive lining; </li><li>  curtains and tablecloths, other home textiles. </li></ul><p>  Striped satin products look very elegant, and they are comfortable to wear, especially in the summer, and are very durable.  High-density bleached stripe satin tolerates washing on industrial washing equipment and ironing with a steam roller.  Therefore, very often, in resorts, boarding houses, expensive hotels use such bedding. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.indiamart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stripe satin" class="if uuid-2914735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2914735.jpg"></div><h2>  Selection rules </h2><p>  When sewing and cutting, this fabric is quite simple, so they often acquire stripe satin in order to sew bedding or all kinds of products on their own.  It is worth remembering that the density of this textile is its main quality.  It will help determine that it is stripe satin, not its fake. </p><p>  A high-quality canvas has clearly defined homogeneous stripes, a pleasant shine, to the touch it is very soft and silky, and most importantly - it should have a sufficient density.  To evaluate this characteristic, you need to look through the fabric at the light.  If the density of matter is good enough, then only a bright blurry spot and obscure silhouettes of objects and people can be seen in the lumen.  If stripe satin shines through, this indicates one thing - bedding from it will not last long. </p><h2>  Care </h2><p>  To maintain an attractive appearance and durability, it is recommended to wash stripe-satin products separately, and turned inside out.  Although this textile tolerates boiling well, it is better if the water temperature does not exceed 40 degrees.  For colored products, do not use detergents with bleaches.  Ironed products in the "cotton" mode, slightly unfinished and only inside out. </p><h2>  Total </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gaos-textile.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="red stripe" class="if uuid-2914766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2914766.jpg"></div><p>  In this article, it turned out that it was stripe satin.  It also became clear that this material looks very elegant and stylish. </p><p>  The material is distinguished by its thinness and durability at the same time, it can tolerate a fairly large number of industrial washing cycles and ironing without loss of fabric strength and color brightness.  The excellent hygienic properties of cotton, its ability to cool in heat and warm in the cold, surface silkiness, which does not stick to the skin and does not slip, is the basis to consider striped sateen to be a very prestigious material. </p><p>  In addition, the environmental friendliness and naturalness of high-quality cotton fabric makes it an excellent choice for people who suffer from allergies or have increased skin sensitivity.  Continuity is a pleasant feature of this material, it is also easy to sew and cut, although in most cases ready-made products go on sale. </p>
