    <h2>  Medinat Makadi </h2><p>  This is a resort that was created "from scratch."  Unlike central Hurghada, Makadi did not even have a fishing village.  Around stretched the desert, and only tourist hotels laid the foundation for the prosperity of this region.  Rest here is considered calm, measured.  Hotels of this type, such as Iberotel Makadi Oasis Club 4 * (Egypt, Makadi), are mainly intended for couples or parents with children.  So far, these places are considered to belong to Hurghada, but in the future it is proposed to make a separate tourist area from Makadi with its own administration.  This resort is considered very prestigious and respectable, and in its reputation is not inferior to Sharm.  The hotels here are exclusively ‚Äúfours‚Äù and ‚Äúfives‚Äù, and in terms of level of service they resemble Turkish ones.  In a word, everything here, as in the rest of Egypt, is only better.  Luxurious fragrant gardens, stylish buildings, exclusive restaurants and expensive boutiques - so briefly describe local hotels.  And all this - against the backdrop of the endless desert, the bright sun and the fantastic Sinai Mountains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberotel makadi club oasis family 4" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1025151.jpg" width="546"></div>

    <h2>  Sea, Makadi Beach, Pools </h2><p>  The coast of Makadi Bay is known for its coral reefs.  To admire all this beauty of the Red Sea, it is enough to walk a couple of hundred meters (it depends on which building you live in) along a shady palm alley, cross the road, and you find yourself on a hotel beach.  It is equipped: there are many umbrellas, on the sunbeds - mattresses.  But if you want to stay comfortably right next to the water, it is recommended to arrive early.  In addition, there are showers, toilets, everything is cleaned.  Since the reefs are nearby, special slippers are highly recommended for swimming.  Although the water is clear and the bottom is very good, stones sometimes come across.  But the advantages of the local coast include the fact that the beaches of other hotels are not closed.  You can safely walk and choose your favorite place for swimming.  In addition, the ebbs on a hotel beach are almost invisible. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel has five pools.  One of them is the so-called "family".  In winter, two out of three adults warm up.  Children's pools are always warm.  Makadi Makadi has a huge water park with fifty slides.  Admission is free for hotel guests.  Before him, you need to go by bus "tuff-taf", which runs every quarter of an hour.  It is open, and children really like to ride it "with the breeze." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4 star resort" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1025164.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Iberotel Makadi Club Oasis Family 4 * has another interesting feature.  Excursions here you can buy without worrying about the family budget.  At local guides they cost the same as in street travel companies.  The most popular with hotel guests are boat trips, a trip to Paradise Island, to the dolphinarium.  You can visit the hamam in Hurghada.  Since Makadi Bay is located near Luxor, a vacation in these places is one of the best opportunities to visit the magic temples of this ancient city.  From long excursions, tourists are advised to go down the Nile, to Aswan and even Abu Simbel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="For family holidays" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1025165.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists believe that this is the best 4-star resort on the coast.  Here everything is for vacationers - and good rooms, and high-quality and tasty food, and helpful and friendly staff, and a quiet and relaxed atmosphere.  When you check in, your wishes are always taken into account, especially if you come with small children.  Hotel management, its managers are constantly in the hotel and check how tourists are served.  This complex is not only beautiful - in terms of service and comfort, it can give odds to many Egyptian ‚Äúfives‚Äù.  Most Europeans rest here.  Russians are not very many.  Perhaps the hotel would have been assigned the ‚Äúfive stars‚Äù if its buildings were closer to the sea.  And in everything else, as already mentioned, it far exceeds the status assigned to it.  Children can swim all day, and adults can swim to the coral reef.  Judging by the reviews, the rest here is even better than in Sharm El Sheikh, and the atmosphere is very comfortable. </p>
