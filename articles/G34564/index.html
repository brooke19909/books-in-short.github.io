However, men know how difficult it is to maintain <span>a beard shape</span> and look after it.  It is almost impossible to make a perfect contour with an ordinary razor.  Even the vaunted safe machines too, not to mention <span>electric razors.</span>  You can, of course, remember the grandfather's one-blade or try to use a dangerous razor.  But all these attempts are fraught with bad consequences. </p><p>  It is good that progress does not stand still.  For men, trimmers were invented.  They minimize undesirable effects when shaving and maintaining the shape of a beard.  One such device is the <span>Philips</span> OneBlade Pro QP6520-20 trimmer.  Reviews on the Internet about this device are so positive that they cause genuine interest in it.  So let's take a closer look at it.  But first, a small educational program. </p>

    <h2>  Company origins </h2><p>  Philips was founded in 1891 in the Netherlands.  Founder - Gerard Philips.  At the beginning of its glorious path, the manufacturer was engaged in the production of light bulbs.  He even supplied light bulbs to the monarchs of the Russian Empire in the Winter Palace.  Since that time, electronics has occupied a prominent place in the range of products of the manufacturer.  In 1917, the company became interested in medical devices.  So a new direction in production appeared.  Medical devices of this brand are well-known all over the world.  And the last stage is 1927.  It was this year that Philips released the first radio receiver.  This marked a new milestone in the history of the manufacturer - the emergence of the consumer goods industry.  By the way, the Philips OneBlade trimmer also belongs to them.  We will consider reviews about it a little later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Philips nowadays </h2><p>  The modern manufacturer Philips has three main areas of work: lighting solutions, medical equipment and consumer goods.  Most recently, the company announced the release of a revolutionary LED backlight, which is designed to replace conventional lamps (the Lighting Solutions industry).  In each hospital, you can find a tomograph from this manufacturer (branch "Medicine").  And on the shelves of stores there is a huge amount of various electronics: from smartphones to TVs (industry "Consumer goods").  Judging by the sales, we can safely say that the company is doing well, as they produce high-quality equipment.  An example is the Philips OneBlade styler.  User reviews about him confirm this idea. </p><h2>  What is a trimmer? </h2><p>  The trimmer is somewhat similar to an ordinary safety razor, but <span>it is fundamentally</span> different from it.  In fact, this is a device for <span>cutting a mustache</span> and beard.  Also, the trimmer can give the facial hair a certain shape and indicate clear contours.  The trimmer is used by those men who monitor their appearance and the condition of their beard in particular.  This device is often called a styler.  A very <span>useful invention.</span>  Now there is no need to suffer with machine tools.  It is enough just to turn on the device and align everything as we need.  One of the prominent representatives of devices of this class is the Philips OneBlade trimmer, reviews of which we will consider a little later.  And now, some more information. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  OneBlade Design </h2><p>  In appearance, the device resembles a normal safety razor.  But the handle is thicker and the structure of the shaving head is not at all like that.  A special motor is installed inside the device, which creates a vibration and helps the knife to move correctly.  The head has a floating design, which allows it to almost completely follow the contour of a person‚Äôs face.  But there is one feature: smoothing the beard and mustache on the face can only be against hair growth.  This is the design of the shaving head and knife.  Inside the device is a battery that allows the trimmer to work without stopping for 45 minutes.  True, then it needs to be recharged for eight hours.  The trimmer has several nozzles for different hair lengths.  But using it as a razor will not work.  He does not shave his hair clean.  There remains a "four-hour" bristle. </p><p>  The handle design is extremely convenient.  It fits perfectly in any hand, has rubberized inserts that prevent slipping, and allows you to grab the device exactly as you need.  This is important, because with this device you have to solve very important problems.  One wrong move can have the most sad consequences.  These are the main features of the Philips OneBlade Pro trimmer.  Reviews indicate the popularity of this device.  Now we pass to them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Owner reviews on shaving </h2><p>  Those who have purchased this device unanimously declare that it shaves not clean enough.  But it should be so.  This is a device for cutting a beard, but not for shaving.  At the same time, people with stiff bristles note that the trimmer cheers with their "thickets".  Even in cases where a conventional machine turns out to be powerless.  And if you take into account the Philips OneBlade Pro model, reviews about it are even more positive (if this can be).  It is understandable.  This device is from a completely different price segment.  The ‚ÄúPro‚Äù version is even equipped with a display that shows the battery charge level.  In addition, a full charge time is only an hour.  Users note that this trimmer can be used for both wet and dry shaving.  Only with the last hair fly in all directions.  However, let's move on to other characteristics of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Ergonomic Reviews </h2><p>  What do people say about the usability of the Philips OneBlade QP6510.  Reviews in this regard are purely positive.  Even though the 6510 is the youngest in the series.  According to the majority, the Philips designers did everything possible to make it comfortable to use the device: a rubberized handle of impressive size that fits perfectly in the hand, the absence of an always interfering wire and so on.  But especially users noted the low weight of the device.  Using it is very easy.  The hand does not hurt even after many hours of using the trimmer.  By the way, low weight is also important when transporting the gadget.  Speaking of the latter.  Many complain that there is no case or case for transporting a styler.  And this is not very good.  On the other hand, look at the price. </p>

    <h2>  Device reliability reviews </h2><p>  Here opinions are divided.  Some owners of this trimmer claim that it works for a long time and reliably.  And the blade does not need to be changed very often.  Others, with insane stubbornness, prove the opposite.  And whom to believe?  Let's just say: it all depends on the build quality of the device and the stiffness of the owner‚Äôs bristles.  If a person has soft hair on his face, then he has nothing to worry about.  The trimmer will last a long time.  But if the hair is more like emery, then all the flaws of this device are revealed.  The most serious of them is the flimsy design of the floating head and blade mounts.  If the hair is very hard, then the mount may well break.  This is especially true for devices made in China.  If you are lucky enough to find a styler of European assembly, then there will not be such a problem.  However, finding them is very difficult.  Almost impossible.  The Philips OneBlade Pro QP6510, which we are reviewing, is not extremely reliable.  Therefore, you need to use it carefully.  Like, in principle, any other device. </p>

    <h2>  Battery and Runtime Reviews </h2><p>  There is also a double impression.  The fact is that the styler uses ancient Ni-Mh rechargeable batteries.  They are morally obsolete.  But not even that.  Users note that such a battery should be charged a certain amount of time (in this case - 8 hours).  If this time is exceeded, the useful battery capacity is lost.  But the trouble is that there is no indicator of the charging process in the Philips OneBlade Pro QP6510-20.  Reviews are unambiguous: this is unacceptable.  As for battery life, almost all owners of this device consider it acceptable.  According to their calculations, one battery charge is enough for eight shaving procedures.  This is a completely normal result.  It is worth noting that most buyers have chosen this particular styler because of the decent battery life.  This parameter is very important when using the styler at home.  But when traveling, battery life is even more important, because it is not always possible to charge the device. </p><h2>  Build Quality Reviews </h2><p>  Not everything is clear here.  The owners of the trimmer were divided into two camps: some are completely satisfied with the build quality and materials, while others are horrified by such a clumsy performance.  Let's try to figure it out.  So, there are two options for the styler: the one that is made in China, and the one that is assembled in Europe.  Of course, the latter looks more appetizing.  However, most of the devices in our market are Chinese.  No exception and Philips OneBlade Pro.  Owner reviews suggest that devices manufactured in Europe have high-quality plastic.  Their design is not flimsy and quite reliable, which can not be said about the Chinese fellow trimmer.  Often, the goods from the Middle Kingdom are made of cheap plastic.  Parts of the case are poorly fitted, the mounts are loose, even though Philips has strict quality control.  What is the reason for this state of affairs is incomprehensible.  Probably the company focuses on European customers.  They get all the high-quality products.  And the rest are content with Chinese "consumer goods." </p><h2>  Ergonomic Reviews </h2><p>  How convenient is the Philips OneBlade QP2520-20 trimmer?  Ergonomics reviews are extremely positive.  According to the owners, the company managed to create the perfect form of the device.  Thanks to this, it fits perfectly into the hand.  A floating head that follows the contours of the face is also a very good solution.  You can shave as you like.  The main thing is against hair growth.  The weight of the device also plays an important role.  It is quite light.  Shaving movements are not constrained.  It feels like in the hands of a regular safety razor machine.  The pro version also has rubberized inserts that help grasp the device more tenaciously.  Also, these inserts prevent slipping when wet shaving.  In general, everything is in order with ergonomics in the styler.  The owners are satisfied.  And this is the most important thing. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we looked at the Philips OneBlade Pro line of beard and mustache care devices.  Reviews about the styler leave an indefinite impression.  On the one hand, the device copes with its task perfectly, has excellent ergonomics, looks stylish and beautiful.  But, on the other hand, frankly no assembly is frustrating, the ancient type of batteries, the lack of a charge indicator (in the normal version).  But there is one advantage that compensates for all these shortcomings - the price of the trimmer.  For such money, all of the above shortcomings are excusable.  However, do not forget that, as is the case with conventional razors, interchangeable blades are prohibitively expensive.  But this is a common situation in the modern world: manufacturers sell devices for nothing, recouping on consumables.  Should I buy a Philips OneBlade trimmer?  Owner reviews in this regard are unambiguous: definitely worth it. </p>
