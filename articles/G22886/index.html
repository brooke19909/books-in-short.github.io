    <h2>  General description of the model </h2><p>  This laptop is the youngest in the X52 series.  The model was created specifically for office workers and students.  Uncomplicated technical stuffing affected the low cost.  You can buy this laptop for an average of 20 thousand rubles.  The computer copes with office tasks, allows you to use the Internet quietly and even calmly performs all multimedia functions.  Of course, you will not be able to play the most modern games, but a laptop has not been created for this.  Its main goal is to be convenient and fast. </p>

    <p>  ASUS X52N can be described in one phrase - nothing more.  In it you will not find newfangled bells and whistles and technologies, as well as support for all sorts of modern devices and so on.  This laptop is primarily designed to work.  In addition to working functionality, multimedia capabilities are already coming.  It is this approach that captivates consumers.  Most models of this segment from other manufacturers are often overloaded with unnecessary upgrades and too powerful stuffing, for which the creators are asking for big bucks.  They have every right to do so.  But what about those who absolutely do not need all this?  People who need an "Office", a browser and an evening movie viewing on the road or at home?  It was for them that ASUS employees created this model of a laptop computer.  We turn to the description of the appearance and first impression. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance of ASUS X52N </h2><p>  Stylish and modern case - guys from ASUS have always been famous for this.  This model in many respects does not lag behind the more expensive laptops of the company.  The case design is strict and elegant.  It seems that this computer is much more expensive.  Only one classic version is available to customers.  But the laptop looks very representative in black, gray and brown.  The textured coating adds a twist and makes the laptop stand out from the gray mass of similar computers.  On the cover is a traditional engraving of the company name in chrome letters.  A special coating protects the cover from dirt and various scratches, which is another plus in the piggy bank ASUS.  In general, it is difficult or almost impossible to find fault with the appearance of a laptop. </p>

    <p>  Let's talk about build quality.  This question was asked at the very beginning of the article.  Now we can say with confidence that ASUS did not disappoint and did everything at the highest level. </p><p>  Firstly, even with a detailed examination of the laptop in the case, it is difficult to notice unsuitable details or large gaps.  There is no backlash at the cover, the hinges are set quite deeply, which makes them almost invisible to the eyes, creating the illusion of the integrity of the structure.  This technique is very effectively combined with a strict design of the case.  When the screen is open, the lid holds tight - no swaying or unauthorized changes in the angle of inclination when moving or shaking.  In short, the ASUS X52N is made to last.  This assembly can be set as an example to many manufacturers of laptops. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In terms of dimensions, the X52N is a regular and standard laptop with a 15-inch screen.  The thickness of 35.7 mm is somewhat disappointing, but these are just trifles, and it makes no sense to find fault with them.  This disadvantage is more than compensated by weight.  The mass of the laptop is only 2.6 kilograms, which allows you to use the computer not only on trips, but also on hiking, just throw it in a special bag or backpack. </p>

    <h2>  ASUS X52N: specifications </h2><p>  The heart of this office notebook is a platform from AMD.  The central processor V140 boasts a frequency of 2.3 GHz.  For office tasks and surfing the Internet, this single-core processor is enough.  The amount of RAM is 2GB, the volume of the hard drive is 320GB.  This will be enough to store a small library of films and work files and documents. </p><p>  The <span>integrated graphics card</span> AMD Radeon HD4200M is responsible for the graphic part.  Support for DirectX11 technology has become a pleasant bonus, although in this model it is not particularly needed - you still do not have to play modern games.  By default, the laptop is running Windows 7 64-bit. </p><h2>  Laptop screen and sound </h2><p>  Let's move on to <span>the output devices of the</span> ASUS X52N computer.  Display features are as follows: a 15.6-inch diagonal and a maximum resolution of 1366 by 768 pixels.  Everything is extremely standard for a laptop.  Color reproduction at a decent level, at an angle the image is distorted, but fairly tolerant.  In general, the laptop screen deserves a solid five, if you do not forget about the cheapness of the device. </p><p>  The sound system is represented by two stereo speakers with surround sound.  Even for such little money, the creators managed to achieve an acceptable sound in a budget laptop when watching movies and listening to music. </p><h2>  Input Devices </h2><p>  <span>The laptop keyboard is</span> full-sized, which allows the owner to conveniently use it.  The buttons are quiet and soft.  The keyboard is made completely solid, which prevents dirt and liquids from getting inside the laptop.  The touchpad also deserves attention.  It is located in a standard place - below the keyboard, in the middle of the case.  Its "field" is slightly recessed into the case, which allows you to use the touchpad in complete darkness.  Like any other similar device, it supports touch settings and responds to several simultaneous taps. </p><h2>  additional information </h2><p>  Let's move on to additional features of the ASUS X52N.  The 4400mAh laptop battery is capable of providing the laptop with energy for as long as 3 hours without additional recharging with a full load of iron. </p>

    <p>  <span>Notebook ASUS X52N</span> turned out to be quite successful.  Honestly, it is difficult for ASUS to find completely failed models.  X52N is suitable for both everyday work and multimedia tasks.  Due to the ease with him it will be convenient to go on business trips and travel.  And if you recall its cost, it turns out that the laptop is almost out of competition in terms of price and quality. </p>
