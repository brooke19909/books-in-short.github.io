Namely, the pioneer movement in the USSR.  Of course, within the framework of a short article, we are unlikely to be able to cover all aspects of this large-scale phenomenon.  But we will try to give the modern young reader ideas about the basic principles of the existence of a pioneer organization.  What was the pioneer movement like?  At what age did they accept pioneers?  What did they do? </p><p>  People of the age of ‚Äúfrom forty and older‚Äù are well aware of the answers to these questions - in which class were they accepted as pioneers, how were pioneer gatherings and rulers held, what were the same age as current schoolchildren during extracurricular hours.  And for the younger generation below - a small "educational program". </p><p>  The All-Union Pioneer Organization, which was named after V.I. Lenin, was known to everyone in the days of the USSR - it could not be otherwise.  This mass children's movement was one of the communist organizations that existed in the USSR.  A pioneer organization was formed by the decision of the All-Russian Komsomol Conference in 1922 (May 19).  Since then, this day has been celebrated as Pioneer Day. </p><p>  Initially, the organization was given the name Spartak.  In 1924, she received the name of Lenin - after his death.  The pioneers led their origin from the movement of scouts, but a number of aspects significantly distinguished these formations.  The pioneer organization had the character of universal state coverage with a clearly defined goal - the ideological education of children as loyal citizens of the Communist Party.  The organizational pioneer movement was an integral part of the structure of the Komsomol and was controlled centrally.  "Pioneers" in the countries of Western culture (in the USA and England) were called reconnaissance soldiers, pioneers who developed new lands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The scout movement in Russia at the time of the 1917 revolution was quite developed and consisted of a network of children's organizations.  The total number of scouts was about 50,000 people.  During the Civil War, scouts assisted in the search for street children, formed detachments of children's police and engaged in social assistance.  The motives of scout ideology were based on the postulates of play, labor and mutual assistance. </p><p>  The Bolsheviks decided to combine the principles of the scout movement with communist ideology.  Komsomol members, in turn, considered scoutism a bourgeois phenomenon, far from communist ideas.  Already in 1919, the congress of the RKSM issued a resolution to dissolve scout units. </p><p>  At the same time, the need to create their own communist organization for children was growing.  The idea was formulated by N.K. Krupskaya, who proposed to the Komsomol to arm himself with scout methods in creating a new children's organization.  Initially, this idea was taken very cautiously, but with the adoption of a positive decision in 1921, the search for suitable organizational forms began.  The new movement was called "pioneers", which was also borrowed from scout practice.  How many years were accepted into pioneers in those years?  Initially, the scout movement was decided to take as the basis for the Komsomol organization being created, but subsequently decided to combine younger children in a similar format. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Other symbolism </h2><p>  The symbols of the new children's movement were a somewhat modified version of the Scout ones.  Instead of a green tie, a red one appeared, and a white (and not green) blouse was also approved.  The scout motto ‚ÄúGet ready!‚Äù Remained unchanged.  and the answer is "Always ready!"  The organization of children in the form of detachments, campfire gatherings, game forms for working with pupils and the counselor institute went to the pioneer organization "inherited" from scoutism. </p><p>  During 1922, many pioneer detachments arose in a number of villages and towns.  The age when they were accepted as pioneers, and other formal moments in those years were not yet strictly regulated.  At the congress of the RKSM, it was decided to combine the scattered pioneer detachments into a children's organization of a communist orientation.  The last official name - the All-Union Pioneer Organization named after V.I. Lenin - received the movement in March 1926. </p>

    <h2>  About the structure of the pioneer organization </h2><p>  Initially, such organizations were created by RKSM cells in villages, institutions and enterprises.  In 1923, their formation ceased to depend on the place of residence and moved to schools.  At the same time they were called "bases" and "outposts".  In fact, communist control was established over the school.  Since 1929, the pioneer organization began to be rebuilt, focusing on school principles.  Units corresponded to classes, squads - to schools.  The age at which they were accepted as pioneers in the USSR in those years became one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The scale of the organization has grown to such an extent that after a couple of years they talked with condemnation of attempts to extinguish the pioneer movement by merging it with the school system.  In addition, there has been a tendency to transfer educational functions from school to the pioneer movement.  The school determined in which class they were accepted as pioneers, a system of rewards and punishments was established, etc. But the process nonetheless continued. </p><p>  Being a centralized link in the communist system, the All-Union Pioneer Movement in the USSR brought together organizations of different levels - republican, provincial, regional, district, city, district.  The formal basis of the organization at the school or the children's educational institution of the squad was the presence of three pioneers.  If the squad consisted of more than 20 people, it was divided into pioneer squads. </p><p>  The detachments existing at the pioneer camps or orphanages were of different ages.  If the detachment consisted of 15 or more people, it was divided into units, at the head of each of which was assigned a unit.  In fact, each detachment united students of a particular class, and the squad - students of a particular school. </p><h2>  About senior pioneers </h2><p>  The changes affected the structure of the organization in 1982 with the introduction of the concept of "senior pioneers."  In what class were these guys accepted as pioneers?  The senior pioneers included, as a rule, students in the seventh and eighth grades.  They were a kind of intermediate link between the pioneers and Komsomol members and wore badges combining the elements of both.  Theoretically, senior pioneers were ordered to continue wearing a red tie, but many tried their best to switch to a new uniform. </p>

    <h2>  Who led the organization </h2><p>  The direct leadership of the All-Union Pioneer Organization was entrusted to the Komsomol - Komsomol members.  Those, in turn, were controlled by the organs of the CPSU.  Any council of a pioneer organization worked under the leadership of the Komsomol committee.  Pioneer organization council reports were heard at Komsomol conferences and congresses.  The leadership of the pioneer organization at all levels was just as approved by the plenums of the Komsomol committees. </p><p>  Methodological and organizational-mass work with pioneer cadres was organized on the basis of numerous Pioneer Houses and Palaces, as well as other out-of-school institutions.  Personnel for work in these institutions in the person of senior counselors were "supplied" from the Komsomol committees, which were engaged in their selection, education and advanced training.  In a centralized manner, leadership was selected for circles, sections, clubs and candidates for the positions of detachment counselors. </p><p>  If we talk about the so-called pioneer self-government, the pioneer gathering served as the supreme body of the collective unit (detachment, unit, squad).  At the gathering of the detachment, schoolchildren were accepted into pioneers, and worthy of them were recommended to the Komsomol.  They evaluated the activities of the detachment and planned the forthcoming work as a whole (as well as the contribution of each pioneer to the common cause) on the advice of the squad.  The squad was selected by detachment, the unit was selected by the collection of the link.  Each of the councils, in turn, chose its own chairman. </p><p>  In pioneer organizations a level higher (All-Union, republican, regional, regional, etc.) as a form of self-government, a pioneer rally was held once every several years.  The most active and active elite of the pioneer organization gathered in the city headquarters created under the advice of the pioneer organization at the district or city level. </p>

    <h2>  In which class were they accepted as pioneers? </h2><p>  The answer to this question will be given to you by any representative of the older generation.  The age when they were accepted as pioneers in the <span>Soviet Union</span> ranged from 9 to 14 years.  A nine-year-old child was most often a third grader.  Here is the answer to the question: "In which class were formerly accepted as pioneers?" </p><p>  Formally, this action was carried out on a voluntary basis.  It was held individually in the form of an open vote held at the gathering of a squad or a pioneer squad.  The situation of the event, when they were accepted as pioneers, was always presented very pompously in the USSR. </p><p>  A schoolboy who joined the organization read out a solemn promise to senior comrades (Komsomol members, communists or other pioneers) on the line.  He was awarded a <span>pioneer badge</span> and tied a red tie.  Most often, the procedure for admission to pioneers was conducted in a festive atmosphere and was timed to coincide with communist holidays. </p><p>  Often it was held in some memorable historical and revolutionary place.  For example, there was a widespread practice of admission to pioneers near the monument to Lenin on April 22.  First of all, the reception of excellent students and good fellows was conducted. </p><h2>  A bit of ideology </h2><p>  Joining the ranks of this children's organization was obliged to know the laws of the pioneers by heart.  These postulates taught children the equality of the Communists, preparation for joining the Komsomol, good study and active work for the good of the Motherland, preparation for protecting it from enemies, the struggle for peace and the building of communism around the globe.  The pioneer was instructed to cherish the honor of the organization, to be a reliable friend, to respect the elders and take care of the kids, to act according to the concepts of duty and honor. </p>

    <p>  As a pioneer‚Äôs rights, it was proclaimed the opportunity to participate in the election of pioneer self-government bodies, to discuss the organization‚Äôs work at the rallies and in the press, criticizing the shortcomings and making proposals at any level, to ask for recommendations for the procedure for joining the Komsomol. </p><h2>  About Pioneer Camps </h2><p>  Most of the school holidays were pioneers in pioneer camps.  Their number in the USSR was huge - about 40,000 pioneer camps of summer and year-round regime.  About 10 million children were sent there every year to rest.  The most famous of them is the All-Union Pioneer Camp of International Status "Artek".  The second most prestigious place was occupied by the All-Russian camp "Eaglet", located in the Krasnodar Territory. </p><p>  The pioneer organization, of course, had its own motto and anthem, ideologically ‚Äútied‚Äù to the declared goal of educating young fighters for the ideas of the Communist Party.  The ‚ÄúMarch of Young Pioneers‚Äù, written back in 1922, was performed as the organization‚Äôs anthem.  Other attributes of pioneering symbolism were the red triangular tie and the pioneer badge of the approved form, known to any Soviet person.  Other elements of the organization‚Äôs attributes are the banner of the squad, squad flags, drums and horns.  Not one of the solemn pioneer rituals could do without them. </p><p>  Any squad had its own pioneer room in which all these attributes were to be stored.  The squad council met there.  More often than not, a ritual stand and a Leninist corner were decorated in such a room.  In each class, the pioneers were ordered to issue and hang out squad-written and retinue wall newspapers decorated in handwritten form. </p>

    <h2>  What did the pioneer uniform look like? </h2><p>  On weekdays, they wore the usual school uniform, along with pioneer symbols in the form of an icon and a red tie.  For ceremonial occasions, a formal uniform was provided, consisting of red caps with the same ties and badges, uniform white shirts with gold-plated buttons and emblems on the sleeves (for both boys and girls), blue trousers for boys or the same color skirts for girls.  In the banner group, the red ribbon worn over the shoulder, as well as white gloves, complemented the ceremonial form. </p><p>  Pioneer magazines and newspapers were published in the Soviet Union, in addition, many other children's literature.  Representatives of the older generation remember very well such publications as Pionerskaya Pravda (the main newspaper of the organization), Koster, Pioneer magazines, etc. Pioneer programs were broadcast daily on radio and television, even documentaries were broadcast in films before the film . </p><h2>  About the life of children in those years when they were accepted into pioneers </h2><p>  Many wonderful children's films created during the Soviet period were dedicated to pioneer children and showed the lives of schoolchildren in pioneer camps and squads.  Undoubtedly, these films, despite the ideological ‚Äúimpregnation‚Äù, contributed to a truly high-quality education of children and adolescents in the USSR.  In addition, filmed by real masters of their craft, they were genuine works of cinematographic art and it was far from accidental that they were loved by millions of viewers, both children and adults. </p>

    <p>  The Pioneer Palaces that existed in each city were reprofiled after the dissolution of the pioneer organization in DDT (children's art center) in 1991.  The children who visited them in those years were engaged in the collection of scrap metal and waste paper, participated in the <span>Timurov movement</span> and the military sports game "Zarnitsa", as well as in football and hockey yard teams organized at the all-Union level.  There was even a simplified version of the volleyball game - pionerball (team game with a soccer ball). </p><p>  Volunteer youth fire brigades were organized.  The pioneers were engaged in all kinds of patrols monitoring the protection of forest and water resources, or as young assistants to traffic inspectors.  In addition, many children were employed in sports sections and circles of a very different orientation. </p>
