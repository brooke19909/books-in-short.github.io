It is popular with tourists and diving enthusiasts. </p><h2>  Origin of the lake </h2><p>  Kaindy - the lake in the geological sense is very young, it is a little more than a hundred years old.  The fact is that it was formed at the beginning of the last century as a result of a strong earthquake.  Cliffs which collapsed as a result of tremors blocked the path of a swift mountain river, forming a natural dam in its channel.  This part of the gorge was gradually filled with crystal clear water, and a beautiful lake arose. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaindy Lake" class="if" height="238" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1116159.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Kaindy is a lake that reaches 400 meters in its longest part, not particularly deep.  Its greatest depth is 30 meters, which, together with clear water, makes it possible to see the bottom almost everywhere.  The second interesting feature is the flooded centuries-old spruce.  Despite a hundred years in the water, they did not rot.  But they even kept most of their needles.  True, the trees under water are entangled in mud.  Probably, the reason for such conservation of spruce was the very low water temperature. </p><h2>  Kainda Features </h2><p>  The pond is located at an altitude of about 2000 meters above sea level.  Kaindy - the lake is very picturesque.  The bare tops of the majestic centuries-old Tien Shan conifers sticking out of the water create a special, indescribable impression of a certain mystery, give a feeling of stopped time and eternity.  And clear water and a real fabulous underwater forest provide an opportunity for completely unique diving under the water.  True, the always low water temperature (about 3 degrees) makes scuba divers use insulated suits. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaindy lake in Kazakhstan" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1116158.jpg" width="550"></div>

This feature allows you to take a fresh look at the lake each time, revealing other facets of its beauty.  Additional charm is given by the “frame” of steep rocky slopes, which seem to emphasize the gentle suppleness of the water surface.  In the cold streams of the lake you can still see trout, which was bred in the 30s of the last century for the needs of the fishing industry. </p><h2>  Lake surroundings </h2><p>  The surroundings of the lake are no less picturesque.  Rocky slopes abound in diverse flora and fauna.  Mighty spruce trees interspersed with beautiful birches. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaindy Lake on the map" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1116149.jpg" width="550"></div>  Nearby (at a distance of 5 km) there is even a large birch grove, which, apparently, gave the name to the lake (“Kaindy” can be translated as “birch”).  In summer, strawberries and raspberries grow in large numbers here.

    <h2>  Lake problems </h2><p>  Occasionally, the highland Kaindy Lake in Kazakhstan is adversely affected by various natural factors.  Especially strong influence is exerted by collapsing mudflows, which for a long time make the water cloudy and unpleasant in appearance, and also reduce its depth.  In particular, according to the marks on the rocks, it can be understood that since its inception, the lake has become shallow by more than 2 meters.  Fortunately, catastrophic events such as mudflows do not occur so often in these places.  During the period of studying the lake, only two such cases were noted - in the eighties of the 20th century and at the beginning of this century. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photo kaindy lake" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1116200.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that before the <span>mudflow of</span> 1980, majestic trees were completely flooded.  After the tops were exposed, the wind and the sun dried them over time, giving a unique look to the old, protruding masts of <span>sunken ships.</span>  Their appearance becomes especially impressive when a thick fog creeps on the surface of the lake - the area immediately begins to resemble fantastic <span>films about pirates.</span> </p><h2>  Travel Recommendations </h2><p>  Kaindy Lake in Kazakhstan is located at a distance of about three hundred kilometers from the capital of this country.  The journey to it takes about five hours by car, so it is best to count on a 2-3-day trip, taking with you everything you need.  Despite the fact that there are no hotel complexes in the immediate vicinity of Kainda, tourist houses can be found in the village of Saty.  Particular attention must be paid to the fuel supply, because the last decent refueling is located 150 km from the end of the route - in Baysait. </p><p>  Since the lake is located on the territory of the natural park, a certain amount will have to be paid for staying on its territory (200 tenge for travel, 650 for each visitor, and another 750 for spending the night in a tent in the park). </p><h2>  Route </h2><p>  The Kaindy Lake on the map does not seem so far from Alma-Ata.  But it is impossible to get in a straight line, since the mountains surrounding Kaindy (the lake) block the path.  You can find out how to get to this reservoir by following the route described below on the map.  To achieve the goal you have to make a small hook.  Getting to this picturesque reservoir from the capital of the republic, first you need to get to the village of Zhalanash (250 km from Alma-Ata). <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaindy Lake how to get there" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1116150.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Then, focusing on road signs, turn to the village of Saty (in front of the Charyn River Bridge).  Before reaching Saty, in front of the cemetery, you should turn into the gorge, and through it get to the barrier of the natural park and then to the lake.  Since part of the road is not asphalted, you will have to cross the river twice, it is best to use off-road vehicles or other off-road vehicles. </p><p>  Kaindy is a lake that will not leave anyone indifferent.  Having been there once, you will definitely want to return.  It is worth a visit to lovers of beautiful views and mesmerizing photos.  Kaindy Lake will be impossible to forget. </p>
