Taba is the name of the city where the hotel is located.  Taba‚Äôs border status does not at all preclude its merits as a resort.  On the contrary, it makes it a great starting point for excursions in Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.  Taking into account the fact that many Russian tourists are now arriving in Egypt in a roundabout way, the Hilton Taba Resort 5 * border location is very advantageous.  From Israeli customs to the hotel reception stomp about two hundred meters.  And from the Egyptian one even closer.  And from the windows of the room (if it is located on the upper floors of the building), you can contemplate the Holy Land and Jordan.  From the airport of the Israeli city of Eilat to the hotel - about ten kilometers.  Those tourists who are already familiar with the high standards of services in the Hilton hotel chain were not disappointed with its representation in Taba. </p>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  In fact, the full name of the hotel is Hilton Taba Resort 5 * &amp; Taba Nelson Village.  It consists of two parts.  Hilton Taba Resort occupies a ten-story high-rise building with elevators.  And "Nelson Village" is a scattering of two-story nice cottages.  But all these buildings are located on a common territory, which is a huge well-groomed garden.  Beautiful winding paths trace green lawns, flickering between flowering bushes and trembling palm trees.  To prevent guests from getting lost in the vast territory, there are signs at the crossroads.  The large snow-white building is built in such a way that most of its windows face the amazingly blue Aqaba Bay in the Red Sea.  The building was erected in 2000, but still, thanks to constant renovations, shines with novelty.  Most rooms have balconies.  If you ordered the cheapest standard - suggest reviews - you can officially get a terrace for fifteen dollars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Where live </h2><p>  Four hundred and ten rooms in the Hilton Taba Resort 5 * (Taba, Egypt) are divided into categories with fancy names.  It's not so easy to figure out all of these king sunset suites and queen family hilton deluxe.  The reviews give us a little hint.  All numbers that have the word "nelson" in their name, refer to the bungalow.  In the building, guest rooms are oriented to the beach with pools, sunset and east.  By price category, rooms are divided into guest rooms (which corresponds to the standard), suites and deluxe.  But, as befits a five-star hotel, it gives coziness and comfort to all its guests.  All rooms have marble bathrooms with a bidet, hairdryer, bathrobe and slippers.  The bedrooms have quiet air conditioning, a TV with numerous channels (including one Russian).  In the queen guest room, in addition to the balcony, there is a desk and Wi-Fi.  Deluxe rooms have a minibar and a safe.  The suites are complemented by living rooms.  The last two categories have balconies or terraces with sea views. </p>

    <h2>  How to feed at Hilton Taba Resort 5 * (Taba, Egypt) </h2><p>  Like the vast majority of hotels in Egypt, the local Hilton operates on an all-inclusive basis.  And, as the reviews assure, this is an honest ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù, and not just one name.  For those who have a dimensionless stomach, you can never leave the bars, restaurants and cafes.  Alcohol begins to pour from ten in the morning, but since ninety percent of the hotel guests are Israelis, there were no drunken cries and debauches by tourists.  The main buffet meals are served in two restaurants - Palm Court and Kaza Taba.  The menu is served at the Marhab.  This restaurant specializes in Egyptian and Oriental cuisines.  You can soak your throat by the pool (Nelson Village Pub), on the beach (Pirates), in the lounge (Rainbow lobby bar) and in the disco. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  About the food in the Hilton Taba Resort 5 * reviews say a lot of good.  For example, juices are natural, not powder, as is common in Egypt.  The Palm Kurt Restaurant, which has a spacious outdoor terrace overlooking the pool, hosts themed dinners every night. </p>

    <h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  Many tourists choose <span>the Hilton</span> Taba Resort 5 * <span>hotel</span> as a convenient strategic point for traveling to Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.  But also the hotel is chosen by lovers of beach holidays.  The hotel has a private sandy beach.  Maybe the divers who visited the Ras Muhamed nature reserve will disappoint the underwater world near the shore of the hotel.  But compensation will serve as an excursion to the island of Pharaoh.  It is located only eight kilometers from the coast.  In addition to coral gardens on the island, you can see the medieval fortress of Saladdin.  Another seven kilometers away is a bay called the Fjord, which also has many underwater caves and interesting inhabitants.  On the beach of the hotel there is all the necessary infrastructure for recreation.  Water activities are offered.  An instructor will teach you how to curb a board with a sail.  The hotel itself has two outdoor pools.  One of them is filled with fresh, and the other with sea water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Hilton Taba Resort 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1110761.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to entertain </h2><p>  Many tourists look forward to a relaxing beach holiday in Taba.  And in this sense, the animation team at Hilton is fully consistent with the aspirations of the guests.  Guys and girls work, but so as not to impose their services on those who want to take a quiet nap or relax with beach reading.  In the evenings, animators arrange all kinds of shows, hold funny competitions and lotteries.  By the way, children also have a mini club.  There, special animators draw with them, conduct master classes and play.  Well, for curious tourists there is a tour desk at the hotel. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  Hotel Hilton Taba Resort <span>5 * (Taba, Egypt)</span> can provide a roomy room for conferences or celebrations.  If you come by car, you can put it in a free secure parking.  The vast territory of the hotel resembles a small town where there is literally everything: ATMs, currency exchange, a pharmacy kiosk, doctor‚Äôs office, hairdresser, spa, tennis courts, fitness room, shops and even a photo service.  Particular attention is paid to the youngest guests.  They have a children's menu and high chairs for feeding in the restaurant, cots, a playground, a mini club and a shallow pool. </p>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Reviews highly insistently recommend not to lie on the beach with a seal, but to go explore the sights that Taba (resort) generously gives.  Hilton Taba Resort is located door to door with an Israeli border, so when can you touch the relics of the Holy Land now?  Jordanian Petra is also waiting for her guests.  But in the Egyptian part of Sinai there are many attractions.  And the first of them is the already mentioned island of Pharaoh.  By the way, a jeep trip to the Colored Canyon or a pilgrimage to Mount Moses is much more convenient to make from Taba than from Sharm.  You can also book an excursion to the smallest diocese in the world - the monastery of St. Catherine.  Only need to dress more modestly.  The main attraction of this monastery is the indestructible dome.  Numerous early Christian texts are also kept here. </p><h2>  Hilton Taba Resort 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Most tourists are delighted with the Hilton in Taba.  Great location, comfortable and well-equipped rooms, polite and executive staff, excellent food and high quality service will remain in your memory for a long time.  Many guests have already been to the hotel several times and intend to continue to spend their holidays there.  These tourists claim that every year the hotel adds some new services.  So, recently opened a casino and a diving school.  On the beach, they ask for a fee only for motorized types of marine entertainment, but a kayak or mask with fins can be taken freely. </p>
