  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Utopia is a model of an ideal state</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are two versions of the origin of the word utopia.  This place, according to the first of them, which is not (u - no, topos - place, Greek.).  And in the second - a blissful country (eu - good, topos - place).  The term itself was first used in the title of the book T. Mora.  Subsequently, he became a household word, denoting various fictional countries with an ideal <span>social system</span> and unrealistic plans contained in writings and treatises on various social transformations. </p><p>  Utopia is an expression of the interests of certain social strata, who, as a rule, are not in power.  It performs important cognitive, educational and ideological functions.  Often served as a form of expression of revolutionary ideology. </p><p>  Utopia is also a peculiar <span>form of social consciousness</span> aimed at comprehending the social ideal, attempts to anticipate the future, and criticize the existing system.  In the Renaissance, it was expressed in the description of perfect states that seemed to exist somewhere or existed earlier.  It gained its distribution in ancient and <span>medieval China</span> (works of <span>Lao Tzu, Mo Tzu),</span> as well as among the peoples of the Middle and Near East (Ibn Baja, Al-Farabi). </p><p>  In the 17th and 18th centuries utopian tracts were distributed, as well as projects of political and social reforms.  And since the mid-19th century, utopia has become a specific genre of literature on the problem of <span>moral values</span> and the social ideal.  Many utopian works in the 20th century were written by G. Wells. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the broadest sense, utopia is a definite universal scheme that, according to its supporters, will help resolve the contradictions existing in society.  It is characterized by: anti-historicism, a penchant for formalism, separation from reality, the exaggerated role of education and legislation, the hope of support for those in power. </p><p>  As a contrast, there is a dystopia that calls for the rejection of the social ideal and reconciliation with the existing system in the state in order to avoid a worse future.  Often dystopia is expressed in that it depicts the social ideals of opponents (often in a caricature form). </p><p>  The social utopia of Plato is one of the first concepts of this kind.  According to his theory, the state is a conscious reinforcement, a concentration of justice and beauty.  In order to achieve this, people must perform strictly defined functions corresponding to the properties of their souls and natural abilities. </p><p>  The soul includes three components - volitional, rational and affective.  Depending on the predominance of certain parts, the distribution of state functions takes place.  The volitional part of the soul prevails among warriors who protect the population from enemies.  The reasonable part is with the philosophers who are in charge of government.  Affective - among peasants and artisans engaged in material production and providing the state with necessary products. </p><p>  According to Plato, social utopia is based on the fact that as a result of the consolidation of virtues for each estate (among soldiers ‚Äî courage, among rulers ‚Äî wisdom, among artisans and peasants ‚Äî moderation) and due to the existing rigid hierarchy, the highest virtue is realized in the state ‚Äî justice, leading to harmony.  Thus, the interests of the individual are sacrificed in the name of the common good. </p><p>  Currently, the concept of utopia carries a number of positive aspects.  In particular, it makes it possible to assume what will happen in the future, and also to avoid a number of negative social consequences of people's activities.  She has not lost its significance in many fantastic literary works. </p>
