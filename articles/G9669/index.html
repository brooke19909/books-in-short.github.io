    <h2>  Aquarium modifications </h2><p>  With powerful inductors, you can make an aquarium generator Kapanadze with your own hands.  The circuit of the device includes a block of capacitors and a switch.  On average, the sweep frequency does not exceed 12 Hz.  If we consider models with a conventional receiver, then the threshold resistance will fluctuate around 50 Ohms.  An inverter is used to form the starting point.  Fluctuations in the circuit in this case depend on the receiver.  If you are engaged in self-assembly of the device, then many experts recommend the use of high-voltage coils.  All this will solve the problem with a reduced signal transmission rate. </p><p>  It is also important to provide a place in the generator for a pressure sensor.  It should be rated at 3.5 kPa.  Some versions use centrifugal pumps.  The horizontal frequency of the models does not exceed 30 Hz.  If the output voltage drops quickly, then you need to replace the coil.  There may also be problems with threshold frequency variations.  In this case, the receiver is inspected directly. </p><h2>  <span>Homemade</span> 10 Watt <span>Generator</span> </h2><p>  Using a conventional transformer, you can make a Kapanadze generator.  The diagram with the description involves fixing the rack for the coil.  In this case, 10-turn models are suitable.  The reference frequency will not exceed 12 Hz.  Inductors are installed only after the switch.  It is more expedient to use ignition counters of a mechanical type. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The receiver is used with different current conductivity.  In this case, much depends on the parameters of the inductor.  As a rule, pumps are not used in such devices.  To solve the problem with a reduced frequency, you can use a thyristor.  It is also important to note that a pressure sensor is required for the device. </p><h2>  15 watt devices </h2><p>  The Kapanadze scheme of the 15 W generator involves the use of a powerful transformer.  Also, the model will require one electromagnet.  When assembling the device can not do without a receiver.  Install it next to the transformer.  In order to reduce the occurrence of short circuits, blockers are used.  After installing them, you should deal with the switch.  Most often, it is selected with the marking PP20. </p><p>  Counters for ignition are used low sensitivity.  The output voltage on the winding should be 120 V. The threshold resistance in this case depends on the power of the transformer.  If the receiver breaks down, the threshold frequency will drop sharply.  It is also important to note that generator malfunctions may be due to the use of a poor inductor.  In this case, it must be designed for high voltage. </p><h2>  20 W model circuit </h2><p>  With the help of a conventional block of capacitors, anyone is able to assemble a Kapanadze generator.  The working circuit of the device includes a transformer and an inductor.  For this purpose, it is selected with good conductivity.  The coil of the model is installed next to the transformer.  Some experts use output inverters when assembling.  First of all, they help to cope with frequency stabilization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Output inverters also help with overloading capacitor banks.  To supply voltage to the winding, you can not do without a coaxial cable.  The ignition counter in this case is installed behind the block of capacitors.  The sensitivity of the sensor depends not only on the brand of the device, but also on the output voltage parameter.  The threshold resistance at 20 W should not exceed 52 Ohms.  The Kapanadze installation is perfectly placed in a glass container. </p><h2>  Manual Switch Generator </h2><p>  Kapanadze generators rarely add up with a manual switch.  The scheme with the description involves the use of low-power inductors.  First of all, to build the model, a platform for the transformer is made.  Next, you need to use a coil.  Most often, it is selected for 10 turns.  The threshold resistance it must withstand at 30 ohms. </p><p>  Next, to make the Kapanadze generator with your own hands, a pressure sensor is installed.  The detector in this case is required with low current conductivity.  A block of capacitors is installed on the Kapanadze generator behind the inductor.  The electromagnet is used without a receiver.  It is also important to note that experts advise checking the transformer conductivity before turning on the generator. </p><h2>  Modification with electronic switch </h2><p>  The non-fuel generator circuit with an electronic switch includes a <span>step-down transformer.</span>  Capacitor blocks are used with inductors.  The transformer in this situation should be installed on the platform.  Next, to make a Kapanadze generator with your own hands, a good pressure sensor is selected.  Typically, it is set to 3.5 kPa. </p><p>  The reference frequency in this situation should not exceed 12 Hz.  The coil at the generator should be mounted next to the transformer.  A choke is used to connect it to the winding.  The output inverter applies low current conductivity.  The frame rate at 20 W does not exceed 35 Hz.  Sampling counters are typically used with low sensitivity. </p>

    <h2>  How to make a device with an expander? </h2><p>  The Kapanadze generator with an expander is made on the basis of a powerful electromagnet.  Also, an assembly of capacitors is required.  According to experts, an inductor is more appropriate to use a small conductivity.  The main problem of these generators is a sharp decrease in frequency. </p><p>  This can happen for several reasons.  This is primarily associated with improper selection of coils.  The output voltage on it must be no more than 120 V. It is also important to note that if the frequency is violated, the receiver is checked.  The threshold resistance in the circuit is considered normal at 35 ohms. </p>

    <h2>  Productivity increase </h2><p>  To improve the performance of the generator, experts recommend using inverters with converters.  They are sold in different conductivity, but differ in parameters.  As a rule, models with the K200 marking are presented on the market.  Their distinctive feature is a long service life.  It is also important to note that models are not afraid of high humidity.  Before installing an inverter with a converter, the working resistance in the circuit is checked.  If it does not exceed 40 Ohms, then you need to install a period skip counter. </p><p>  Also, before fixing the inverter with the converter, the operability of the switch is checked.  When it breaks, the load on the capacitor block is quite strong.  Install the inverter with the converter on a lining near the transformer.  Coaxial cable for connection is perfect. </p><h2>  Using Power Inductors </h2><p>  Kapanadze's fuel-free generator with a power inductor is assembled using a 12-coil coil.  First of all, a transformer is installed directly.  The next block of capacitors is selected.  The conductivity of the current should not exceed 4 microns.  The discretization counter in this case can be omitted.  The output impedance is mainly in the region of 35 ohms.  If this indicator is higher, then the inductor can not cope with its tasks.  Also, the reason may be the inverter.  In this case, you will need to use a blocker to protect the wear of the winding. </p><h2>  Pulse Inductors </h2><p>  The Kapanadze generator with a pulse inductor is characterized by increased productivity.  It is quite difficult to assemble the model yourself.  First of all, the problem is finding the right transformer.  In this case, only lowering modifications are suitable.  Their conductivity must be at least 4 m. It is also important to note that when assembling the generator, you can not do without a high-voltage coil.  However, the capacitor block will fit the usual. </p><p>  When assembling, it is important to make a platform for the transformer.  In order not to overload the unit, small rubber pads are used.  The coil in this case is installed behind the inverter.  In order to monitor the pressure, sensors are used.  The electromagnet in this case is installed next to the inductor.  To connect it to the generator, a coaxial cable is used. </p>

    <h2>  Operational inductor generator </h2><p>  The Kapanadze generator circuit with operational inductors includes a transformer and an 8-coil coil.  Directly the inductor is mounted through a block of capacitors.  For this, many use a coaxial cable.  The resistance parameter in the circuit must be at least 40 ohms.  Sensors are used to monitor the threshold frequency.  The output inverter must be installed with the expander.  The receiver is used low sensitivity.  Modifications with pumps are very rare. </p><h2>  Assembly of a device with two transformers </h2><p>  The Kapanadze generator with two transformers produces an average of about 230 V. The inductor is suitable for power models.  The capacitor block is used with an expander.  Before installing it, it is important to take care of the transformer.  The card is used for 8 or 10 turns.  The capacitor blocks are attached to the generator through a coaxial cable.  In this case, the reference frequency should be at least 13 Hz. </p><p>  The output inverter is installed behind the transformer.  The increase in frequency occurs due to the block of capacitors.  It is also important to note that in this case a lot depends on the winding throughput.  On average, this parameter is within 5 microns.  Counters are used to skip periods.  The threshold resistance of these generators is not more than 35 ohms. </p>

    <h2>  Resistor Model </h2><p>  The Kapanadze free energy generator with a resistor block is able to operate only on a step-down transformer.  A feature of these devices can be called frequency stability.  As a rule, the coil is used with a high voltage winding.  Inductor for models used pulse type.  It is important to install the transformer with a protective pad. </p><p>  A counter is used to track the frequency.  The resistor unit is connected to the generator only after the coil.  In this case, you need a good throttle.  Experts also recommend the use of sampling sensors.  The receiver is installed with an electromagnet. </p>

    <h2>  Amplifier Devices </h2><p>  The Kapanadze generator circuit with amplifiers includes a step-down transformer.  Switches for models are selected both mechanical and electronic type.  The capacitor block is installed only after the transformer.  Extenders in models are rare.  According to experts, it is important to select inductors of power type.  The coil in this case is mounted on a lining. </p><p>  The reference frequency of these generators does not exceed 10 Hz.  Output inverters are used with low current conductivity.  Directly lowering the voltage depends on the sensitivity of the sensors.  The frame rate in devices does not exceed 30 Hz.  The electromagnet is selected exclusively with the receiver.  Pressure sensors must be rated at least 3 kPa. </p>
