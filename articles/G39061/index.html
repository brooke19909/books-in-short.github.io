Users purchase millions of gadgets every day, leaving room for new models to meet their requirements.  Of course, devices released in the future become more technologically advanced and functional than those that came before them.  However, it is also impossible to say that the characteristics of devices change so significantly. </p><p>  As an example, we can give one interesting model - this is the Samsung 7562.  In many of its qualities, the device is not too far behind some modern phones, despite the fact that it was released in 2012. </p><p>  We will describe this device in this article.  Traditionally, its technical characteristics will be considered, the appearance and advantages (disadvantages) of the smartphone will be described. </p><h2>  Model positioning </h2>

    <p>  Of course, you should start by introducing the device, its position in the Samsung model line.  The phone did not belong to the flagship row at the time of its entry into the market - rather, the model could be distinguished within the ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù of all the company's devices.  Such a classification could be carried out both by the cost of the phone and by its capabilities (which we will discuss in more detail later on). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the characteristics of the smartphone can be called attractive, due to which it gained wide popularity.  Customer reviews on the Samsung S 7562 smartphone confirm this.  For a more objective description, we also give them. </p><p>  In general, the phone belongs to the category of inexpensive, but quite powerful smartphones that can successfully perform many everyday tasks.  It is complemented by an interesting appearance and device belonging to the product line of the largest electronics manufacturer in the world. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  Samsung will not offer anything new to the buyer - the device comes complete with a headset, a cord for connecting via USB, an adapter for charging from the network, and a battery.  This is actually the minimum necessary for the operation of the device. </p><p>  All accessories that the buyer wishes to receive for his model must be purchased separately.  So, in reviews, the first thing it is recommended to find is a film on the screen and a convenient case that can protect the surface of the back cover of the phone and the chrome side trim. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  In general, from the point of view of security, the Samsung 7562 phone is seriously inferior to its counterparts.  The reason for this is a simple plastic case, which, according to reviews, is not designed to carry blows, falls and withstand other adverse circumstances. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, even the plastic shell gives the device a nice <span>appearance.</span>  And the back cover, made in a matte texture, also conveniently lies in the hand. </p><p>  <span>The Samsung</span> 7562 <span>model</span> looks very much like the <span>Galaxy S3 mini</span> - they give out the characteristic features of the case and the oval Home button.  The placement of navigation elements is traditional here - there is a side ‚Äúrocker‚Äù for changing the volume, next to it is the power button.  Near the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù key there are side buttons ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù.  On the back cover is the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S Duos 7562 camera and flash. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The device cannot boast of screen protection - despite the ease in removing stains and fingerprints, minor scratches appear on the glass as it is used, making the model less comfortable to use. </p><p>  The display resolution of the Samsung Galaxy 7562 is 480 by 800 pixels.  With a diagonal size of 4 inches, the picture looks high-quality, and the graininess is practically absent.  The screen itself is quite bright, at least working in sunny weather with it is quite comfortable. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The device is dual-SIM, so the user can significantly save on mobile services.  Both are capable of receiving a signal in both 2G and 3G networks.  Due to this, you can also save on the Internet, which is very profitable.  In addition to the standard GSM-receiver in all phones, the smartphone also has a Bluetooth module for receiving and transferring files, as well as a Wi-Fi adapter.  The latter is responsible for receiving high-speed (wireless) Internet signal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, the Samsung 7562 is capable of becoming a portable access point itself, distributing a signal received via a 3G connection.  This is very convenient if you need to provide online access to multiple devices, such as a tablet and laptop. </p><h2>  CPU </h2>

    <p>  To be honest, in the reviews there are not the most flattering characteristics of the hardware of the phone - its processor.  Judging by the technical data, Qualcomm MSM7227A is used here.  In practice, it can be seen that the model behaves uncertainly with sudden loads.  For example, the phone can play bulky games and applications with slight delays.  You will not notice obvious ‚Äúhangs‚Äù in the menu - but this is only thanks to the 768 MB RAM. </p><p>  The filling capabilities are enough for basic work, for performing some basic tasks, but it‚Äôs not worth talking about reproducing something more demanding.  And for such purposes, no one "average", which is the "Samsung 7562", does not take. </p><h2>  Memory </h2>

    <p>  The device can please its users with 4 GB of physical memory, of which about 1.7 GB is allocated for downloading applications and games.  You can expand the space using a memory card.  So, the smartphone supports an increase in volume up to 32 GB.  This allows you to make a real media player out of the device if you upload your favorite movies, series and music to it.  In addition, of course, it can also be used as a portable storage medium. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  As you know, devices on Android, and in particular - Samsung phones, are experiencing problems with the duration of work.  This is due to the high power consumption of the battery, as well as the low level of processor optimization. </p>

    <p>  ‚ÄúSamsung 7562 S Duos‚Äù in this regard is slightly ahead of its ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù in the lineup - in constant play mode, the device can work up to 3 hours, and you can talk on a single battery charge up to 5 hours.  The performance for a 1500 mAh battery is pretty serious. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the phone is equipped with two cameras - front and main.  Of course, it would be naive to expect a high-quality gadget from a middle-class gadget - everyone understands this very well.  Camera resolutions are 5 and 0.3 megapixels, respectively.  The quality of the photos comes out average, similar to the pictures from other Samsung phones. </p><p>  The model is also capable of creating videos in a resolution of 640 by 480 pixels.  To stabilize the image there is an autofocus function. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The recommendations of those who have already managed to experience the "Samsung 7562 S Duos", can not be called unambiguous.  On the one hand, users in every possible way praise the model for its versatility, low cost and brand.  Still, buying Samsung, you can count on the device to at least show stable operation and be able to properly perform assigned tasks. </p><p>  On the other hand, there are many complaints about the performance of the model, its wear resistance and autonomy.  For example, the point of view according to which the paint located on the end side is very clambered very quickly is quite common, creating not the most presentable appearance for the phone.  The second important point is the periodic ‚Äúglitches‚Äù.  For example, buyers note that the phone could freeze if a call came in during the launch of the application.  The same applies to SMS messages.  Perhaps the reason lies in the weak processor. </p>

    <p>  Also among the reviews you can find those in which people complain about the device about the performance of its main functions - calls.  Some customers claim that their phone had a fuzzy sound, while others say that the device was ‚Äúbuggy‚Äù while dialing.  Perhaps this phenomenon was of a one-time nature, since there are few such reviews - but, you must admit, working with a device capable of this is very difficult. </p><p>  And finally, about the battery: as already mentioned, there are also certain problems with it.  If you want to take the device with you on the road, take care of the place where you could charge it, or take an extra battery. </p><h2>  Phone Conclusions </h2><p>  In fact, the Samsung Duos 7562 smartphone can be a convenient device capable of solving some basic tasks.  Playing the most advanced games or surfing the Internet for a long time doesn‚Äôt work out with it unambiguously - the device does not have any outstanding characteristics. </p><p>  But such a device can become a ‚Äúsimple smartphone‚Äù with which you can sometimes take a picture, check mail or go to a social network.  And this is precisely what Samsung was focused on, creating it and releasing the model for further sale. </p><p>  And for those who lack the capabilities that this model has, it remains to be advised to pay attention to more expensive devices and flagship smartphones.  For example, at the time of the sale of 7562, this was the <span>Samsung Galaxy S3.</span> </p>
