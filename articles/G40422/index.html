But something went wrong, and the production of digital technology ceased. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  A quick take-off and a sharp drop - this is how the history of 3Q, which began in 2006 with the production of external optical drives and hard drives, can be described.  And after a few years, their catalog was supplemented by nettops, laptops, all-in-ones, tablets, smartphones and various accessories.  3Q has partnered with companies such as Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm and MediaTek.  And in 2015, it announced its closure. </p>

    <h2>  3Q Q-pad RC9727F Tablet </h2><p>  Large display, and even in high resolution.  Such a combination in <span>tablet computers</span> from this company is very rare.  First, it is worth noting that its cost is less than 10 thousand.  But at the same time, the device has a fairly rich configuration, i.e.  there are headphones with a microphone, a charger, a cable for receiving and transmitting data, an adapter for connecting <span>peripheral devices, a</span> manual and a microfiber cloth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

With a ten-inch display and a centimeter-thick case, its weight is 600 grams.  The back cover is made of aluminum.  There is also a 5-megapixel camera lens, 2 speakers, a microphone, and the center logo of the Qoo!  The display side without physical keys, only touch.  Highlight when necessary.  A positive impression is made by the assembly of the tablet: it does not creak and does not play.

    <p>  Given the low cost of the device, the display quality of the Q-pad RC9727F is perplexing.  Here, high resolution (2048 √ó 1536) and pixel density (263 ppi), large viewing angles and enough brightness for comfortable work in direct sunlight. </p><p>  The tablet runs on a four-core Rockchip RK3188 processor, a Mail-400 MP4 GPU, and 2 gigabytes of RAM.  The system itself is powerful, but it spends a lot of resources on the display, so you can not dream of launching powerful mobile applications.  But the device supports 3G-connection, Bluetooth 3.0 and connects well to Wi-Fi points. </p><h2>  3Q Tablet RC9731C </h2><p>  And here is another inexpensive, but fairly technological device.  True, without a 3G modem, but with support for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0.  It is just as weighty and well-fed as the previous model, only a little behind in its characteristics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  First of all, we are talking about a display, which this time received a resolution of 1024 √ó 768 pixels.  Only the sensor now recognizes up to 10 touches.  Viewing angles are not large, and the margin of brightness is small.  You can find fault with the quality of the picture if you want, but knowing the cost of the device (about 4000 rubles), you should be more lenient. </p>

This is a dual-core Rockchip 3066 processor, 1 gigabyte of RAM and 8 GB of internal storage.  For work cases and launching undemanding applications, this is a pretty nimble device with a fairly capacious battery - 7200 mAh.

    <h2>  Model 3Q Meta RC7802F </h2><p>  And this 3Q device has a smaller display - 7.85 inches.  It is lightweight, reliable and productive, according to the developers.  Interestingly, is this really so? </p><p>  First about the cost.  The 3Q Meta RC7802F tablet costs about 5,000 rubles.  For this money, the device itself, a 2 A charger, a data cable, an adapter for peripherals and a user manual are put in the green box. </p>

The edges of the case are rounded, from the display side there is only a 2-megapixel camera, and on the rear aluminum panel there is a front camera and speaker.

    <p>  The display resolution of the device is 1024 √ó 768 pixels, 163 ppi.  The pixel density is enough to comfortably operate the device.  Capacitive display notices up to five touches.  The quad-core processor makes the device work, there is 1 gigabyte of RAM and a Mali-400 video accelerator.  For storage of data allocated 8 GB.  In general, the <span>performance of the</span> 3Q Meta RC7802F <span>tablet is</span> not bad for its price.  Frustrated by the lack of a Bluetooth sensor and 3G connectivity. </p><h2>  Model 3Q Glaze RC7804F </h2><p>  When the start of sales of this device was announced, the greatest interest was its ultra-slim body (6.4 mm).  Since it was time to understand that you should not expect any serious stuffing in such devices. </p><p>  So, the tablet case is a solid piece of thick aluminum.  The metal is painted blue, which makes it look just fine.  On the reverse side, everything is as before: a camera (5 megapixel with autofocus), a company logo and a perforated area for the speaker.  However, the front of the elements is even smaller - only the front camera (2 megapixels). </p>

    <p>  The Android Jelly Bean operating system has not changed.  The Rockchip RK3188 processor with 4 cores, 1 GB of RAM and the Mali-400 video processor - you can not even write about this.  For comfortable use, this is enough.  Many applications will go, except for the most "heavy."  Like Asphalt, Need for Speed, and Real Racing 3, the 3Q Glaze RC7804F will not be able to handle it. </p><h2>  How to flash? </h2><p>  Updating (flashing) the main control program of a mobile device, as a rule, is carried out with the aim of increasing the functionality of the system, getting rid of glitches, brakes and freezes or gaining the ability to modify the system.  Here is one of the options for how to flash a 3Q tablet using the Q-pad RC9727F as an example.  Only you should know that after such actions all information from the tablet may disappear. </p><p>  So, first you need to download and run on your computer the program RKBatchTool version 1.7 or higher, which is designed specifically for flashing devices based on the Rockchip system.  Next, connect the tablet to the PC, then turn it off while holding the power button.  Only it should not turn off, but reboot.  And as soon as the screen goes blank, you must simultaneously press the volume and power buttons.  When Windows detects the device, you need to immediately install the driver from the folder of the aforementioned program. </p>

We find the FW Path field and indicate the path to the update.img firmware file in it.  Click ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù and wait for the completion.  At the end of the work, the tablet should reboot itself.

    <h2>  Firmware issues </h2><p>  This is not the only way to <span>flush a</span> 3Q <span>tablet</span> , there are many of them.  And each of them can bring both positive and negative consequences.  For example, along with the update file, you can download virus software or install drivers that will make the tablet work beyond its capabilities, which will lead to its rapid deterioration. </p><p>  Some, after the firmware, generally <span>do not turn on the</span> 3Q <span>tablet</span> .  What to do in this case?  To avoid this, you need to install only verified update files, only the correct versions and only according to the instructions.  Otherwise, you will have to spend money on repairs or find out <span>how to disassemble the</span> 3Q <span>tablet</span> in order to try to repair it.  But this is unlikely to help. </p>
