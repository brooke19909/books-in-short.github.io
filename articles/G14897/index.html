There are a huge number of them in this country, so tourists can always choose the very paradise place in which they want to spend their holidays.  It is noteworthy that each island of Thailand has its own character and distinctive features.  In recent years, our compatriots have appreciated Samui.  Previously, only Europeans came here, so Russian pioneers really lacked the usual menu and inscriptions in their native language, which make life in Pattaya so easy. </p><p>  Today, a huge number of our compatriots come to Samui.  They are often interested in small hotels located close to the beaches, which on this island resemble a picture from advertising booklets.  In search of a suitable hotel, many opt for First Residence Hotel 3 *.  This hotel is very popular among Russians, who are impressed by the low cost of accommodation, convenient location and the contingent of guests.  Reviews about the First Residence Hotel 3 * in general are positive, so today we decided to offer our readers our own overview of this hotel complex. </p>

    <h2>  Short hotel description </h2><p>  For those who first go to Koh Samui and are not too familiar with the features of Thai relaxation, I want to say that you should not expect a large territory from the hotel complex.  Usually it consists of a small blooming garden and pool, the same awaits you in the First Residence Hotel 3 * (Samui).  This hotel is located in a rather lively place and cannot please tourists with an abundance of infrastructure on the territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel itself is a single residential building consisting of four floors.  From the reviews of the First Residence Hotel 3 * (Thailand \ Samui), it can be concluded that families with children should choose rooms on the first floors, because the administration did not provide for an elevator in the block.  Therefore, guests are forced to climb their apartments to the stairs.  This is convenient not for all guests. </p><p>  First Residence Hotel 3 * is far from a new hotel.  However, guests positively assess its appearance and condition of the room stock.  In addition, the last repair at the hotel was carried out approximately five years ago. </p><p>  The complex belongs to small city hotels, it can provide guests with only forty-four rooms.  But this is precisely what gives it a special zest.  Many say that the hotel is all at home, and the absence of Russian tourists makes it very special. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Almost everyone who rested on Koh Samui in First Residence Hotel 3 *, reviews about the location of the hotel leave highly enthusiastic.  Almost a mile from the complex are shopping centers and entertainment venues.  If this is your first trip to the islands, keep in mind that it is ideal for a romantic and relaxing holiday together.  On Samui there is no abundance of nightclubs and other entertainment inherent in Pattaya.  So get ready to enjoy beautiful views of nature and evening walks along the coast under the moon. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the second line and is separated from the beach by about one hundred and fifty meters.  The most beautiful beach near First Residence Hotel 3 * - Chaweng Noi.  It is a private territory, however, every vacationer can settle here on a sunbed.  It is noteworthy that from the hotel you can walk to Chaweng Beach, it is the most noisy and popular on the island.  There are a large number of bars and shops.  This beach area is municipal, so you need to pay for sunbeds and umbrellas.  But usually when buying drinks at the bar you can get a significant discount. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Almost in front of the hotel stop tuk-tuks.  The average fare is equal to fifty baht.  Within one beach, a trip can cost about twenty butts. </p>

    <h2>  The infrastructure of the hotel complex </h2><p>  First Residence Hotel 3 *, having, as you understood from its name, only three stars, fully corresponds to its status.  Many guests note in reviews that this "troika" is pretty good not only for one night's sleep, but also to spend the whole vacation in it. </p><p>  The hotel has one swimming pool, which is open year round.  The recreation area is provided only on one side, because the hotel territory is not too spacious.  The pool is open for guests during the day until eight in the evening.  Later it is closed for processing and cleaning. </p><p>  The hotel does not have a bar, if you need a cocktail or other drinks, then head to the restaurant.  It is on the territory of the hotel complex alone, so guests eat mainly here. </p><p>  At the 24-hour reception, English-speaking staff works.  Almost all employees speak fluent English, so our compatriots who have basic knowledge of the language will not have communication problems.  Near the reception is a room with safes.  You can use them for an additional fee, however, note that the room closes at eleven in the evening and it is impossible to get there until the morning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the First Residence Hotel 3 * you can change the currency at a rather favorable rate, and there is a small free parking on site.  As in many other places in Thailand, on Koh Samui, tourists often travel on motorbikes.  Therefore, they need secure parking in the vicinity of the hotel. </p><h2>  Service and Facilities </h2><p>  Many vacationers in reviews of the First Residence Hotel 3 * (Chaweng Noi) note that all the staff are very friendly, greets guests with a smile and tries their best to please them.  This cannot but impress our compatriots.  They also often praise housekeeping.  Maids are very enthusiastic about making various shapes out of towels, and if you leave them a tip in the amount of twenty baht, your room will be just perfectly clean. </p><p>  Free Wi-Fi is available on site, but you can only catch the signal in the lobby.  Those who need to be constantly in touch can purchase a special card for connecting to the Internet in neighboring stores.  It costs about five hundred baht, for the money you will be available about seven and a half hours of work on the network. </p><p>  If you need laundry and ironing services, they will be provided at an additional cost at the hotel.  You can also arrange a transfer.  When booking a room, this nuance must be indicated. </p><p>  First Residence Hotel 3 * offers food delivery to apartments.  This service is also paid separately, but guests often use it. </p>

    <h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Thai hotels almost never provide an extensive infrastructure for small guests.  There is none of it in the First Residence Hotel 3 *, so when you come to rest with children, you will have to entertain them yourself. </p><p>  The hotel has a children's pool, this is the only object suitable for a child.  If necessary, the staff of the complex will provide their guests with high chairs and an extra bed for the baby. </p><p>  The services for children at the hotel are limited to this.  But all the staff are sympathetic to the kids and try to help them if necessary. </p><h2>  Hotel accommodation with children </h2><p>  Many come to Thailand at the First Residence Hotel 3 * (Chaweng Noi) with their children.  Therefore, tourists are worried about the conditions of accommodation in a hotel with a child.  The reviews mentioned that the hotel is quite comfortable to stay with a baby under three years old.  After all, a child of this age can be accommodated with parents absolutely free.  If the little guest is less than two years old and needs an extra bed, then he will also live without surcharge. </p><p>  For older children who are provided with an extra bed, parents will pay about eight hundred baht per day.  Keep in mind that in the room you can install only one berth to the existing ones. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel check-in rules </h2><p>  Tourists can check into their apartments from two in the afternoon until eleven in the evening.  Thais rarely take the opportunity to take extra money for the early check-in service, therefore, if possible, guests are assigned to the number of the previously indicated time interval. </p><p>  Departure from the hotel is from six in the morning until noon.  Typically, guests at this point already pay all bills and go down to the lobby to hand over the room keys. </p><p>  Keep in mind that checking into a hotel complex with pets will not succeed.  Thai hoteliers do not allow accommodation with four-legged pets.  Many explain this fact by the fact that the slightest mess and the presence of food in the room can literally lead to an invasion of insects. </p><h2>  Apartment classification </h2><p>  The hotel rooms are divided into two categories: </p><ul><li>  superior; </li><li>  mini family. </li></ul><p>  There are almost forty superiors at the hotel, and you can check into one if necessary.  Each room has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãthirty square meters and provides guests with a full bathroom.  This was noted by almost all of our compatriots vacationing in a hotel. </p><p>  The mini-family room consists of two rooms and has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãsixty squares.  The bedrooms are separated by a door.  It's nice that she is locked.  It is convenient for both adults and children living in apartments. </p>

    <h2>  Brief description of rooms </h2><p>  Photos of First Residence Hotel 3 * are often placed in reviews.  Therefore, potential travelers can independently make up their minds about the condition of the number of rooms.  Typically, guests actively photograph the apartments themselves and the bathroom equipment. </p><p>  Each room is equipped with air conditioning, TV, minibar and balcony.  In the bathroom, toiletries of very good quality are laid out.  Guests praise hair conditioners, shower gels and lotions.  All this is regularly replenished during the cleaning of the room.  Not all apartments are equipped with a hairdryer, but you can always ask for it at the reception. </p><p>  Each room has a tea set.  In the evening, vacationers can boil a cup of tea and spend time on the balcony, admiring the sunset.  It is noteworthy that maids sometimes forget to replenish drinking water supplies.  Feel free to remind them of this, the situation will be instantly corrected. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Guests eat in the only restaurant of the hotel, they usually book rooms with free of charge breakfast.  According to reviews, it is pretty good, although it does not differ in variety.  Vacationers can choose from several hot dishes, fruits and vegetables.  Usually this is enough to recharge your batteries for the whole day.  Especially the guests praise fresh omelettes for breakfast.  A cook can cook them with cheese, ham, mushrooms and vegetables. </p><h2>  tour cost </h2><p>  Three-star hotels in Thailand do not have a high cost of living, but do not forget that it takes much longer to get to Samui than to Pattaya, for example.  Therefore, tours to this island will be much more expensive than trips to other popular resorts in the country. </p><p>  On average, a trip for two with a flight from Moscow for two weeks at the beginning of the holiday season will cost about one hundred and fifteen thousand rubles.  A ten-day vacation costs ninety thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Negative comments of tourists </h2><p>  Naturally, not all vacationers liked the complex.  Although frankly negative reviews about the hotel First Residence Hotel 3 * (Samui) are not found, our compatriots still note a number of shortcomings.  We cannot ignore them and are ready to list: </p><ul><li>  poor nutrition; </li><li>  inconvenient location away from the center of the island; </li><li>  problems with sewage; </li><li>  the presence of insects in the rooms; </li><li>  old loud humming air conditioners; </li><li>  lack of elevator. </li></ul><p>  If we analyze all the shortcomings indicated by the Russians in the reviews, we can conclude that they are quite acceptable for the "three rubles".  Many people write that you should not expect luxury from this hotel, and then rest will pass by five points. </p>
