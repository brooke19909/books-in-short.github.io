  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The recreation center "Aquamarine". Rest in the Northern Black Sea Region (Ukraine)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The infrastructure of beach holidays in the Ukrainian Black Sea coast is developing rapidly.  Every year there are new pensions and private hotels.  And the old holiday houses of the times of the USSR undergo a complete reconstruction.  This booming growth of private resort hotels and bases is sometimes confusing.  There are several boarding houses with the same name.  This article is intended to clarify the confusion with a recreation center called Aquamarine.  One of them is located in the <span>Nikolaev region,</span> in the city of Koblevo.  Also in large numbers offers Odessa Inflow recreation.  Aquamarine is one of them.  This is a very good name for resort hotels.  We will talk about the conditions at both bases - in Odessa and Nikolaev regions. </p>

    <h2>  Aquamarine in Zatoka.  Where is? </h2><p>  Zatoka is a long chain of resorts stretching along the sea west of Odessa.  You can get to each of them by train, running from the regional center to the ancient city called Belgorod-Dniester.  Why is Zatoka interesting?  This is a scythe.  On the one hand is the Black Sea, on the other is an estuary.  Of course, all lovers of beach holidays prefer open spaces of salt water.  On the estuary, which stretches to the very Belgorod-Dniester, ride a yacht and go fishing.  The recreation center ‚ÄúAquamarine‚Äù described by us is located at the Solnechnaya station.  You can get here not only by electric train, but also by minibus (departing from Odessa Privoz), and by your own motor transport along Ovidiopolskoye Shosse.  The Solnechnaya station is a rather lively village.  To find ‚ÄúAquamarine‚Äù, you need to know the address: 84 Lazurnaya Street. This is the very center of the village.  To the beach you need to walk about two hundred meters. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The recreation center "Aquamarine" (Koblevo) </h2><p>  This resort is located on the very border of the Nikolaev and Odessa regions.  Pension "Aquamarine" is located in the Moldavian part of the resort of Koblevo, on Chisinau street.  From the sea - on the second line.  Nearby is the famous water park.  The only minus of Koblevo as a resort is the distance from the highway.  You need to go to the bus station on the highway "Odessa-Nikolaev", and there change trains to the local minibus.  At the height of the summer season, the Moldavian part of Koblevo (the one to the east, closer to the estuary) turns into a bustling resort.  But all the fun is concentrated on the waterfront.  The second line, where the Aquamarine recreation center is located, pleases tired tourists with silence.  Koblevo offers a lot of entertainment.  In addition to the water park, there are water slides directly on the public beach.  There is a travel agency where you can order excursions to Odessa, Nikolaev Zoo and other interesting places in two regions of Ukraine. </p>

    <h2>  Conditions at the boarding house "Aquamarine" in Koblevo </h2><p>  A large landscaped area is occupied by several buildings.  This is a three-story building with fifty rooms, inherited from the Soviet Union, three houses (25 rooms) and a new hotel (12 superior rooms).  The rooms for guests are divided into categories: economy (bathroom on the floor), standard, one-room junior suite and two-room suite.  The recreation center "Aquamarine" on its territory has a playground, gazebos.  Vacationers can use the barbecue for free.  Internet is freely available at the reception and in some rooms.  This guesthouse is located on the second line from the sea.  You need to walk about a hundred and twenty meters to the sandy beach.  Prices in a boarding house depend not only on the room category, but also on the season.  Guests "Aquamarine" in Koblevo begins to receive from the first of June.  Throughout the first month of summer, the lowest prices are held.  So, a place in an economy room costs only five dollars.  At the peak of the season (second half of July and August), the double standard is already estimated at $ 50. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Guests enjoy the area where Aquamarine is located.  Reviews assure that the entire infrastructure of the city is within walking distance.  At the same time, the base is quiet.  Many vacationers note the beauty and well-groomed area, the cleanliness of the rooms, the friendly staff.  The pension has a dining room (you can order full or half board) and a summer cafe. </p>
