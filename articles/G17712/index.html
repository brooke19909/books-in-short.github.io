Such a decorative haircut is especially popular in Western Europe, and it came into fashion back in the 18th century.  Slender rows of perfectly even shrubs, balls, squares, rhombs stretched along the alleys and created labyrinths in regular parks near palaces and castles.  Currently, topiary is a decorative artificial tree, which is made from a wide variety of materials for decorating the interior.  Moreover, the shapes, sizes and appearance of these works of floristic art are very diverse, it all depends on the skill and creative ideas of their creator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Topiary is this." class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2521/283429.jpg" width="249"></div>  Topiary is not an imitation of a living tree, not a small copy of it, it is a completely independent product in its concept, which sometimes has the most fantastic, bizarre shapes.  To make its crown, natural materials are often used: dried fruits and large seeds, flowers, cones, leaves, shells, various spices that the housewives use in cooking.  Artificial trees collected from fragrant plants are not only an ornament, but also aromatize the room, exuding a light pleasant smell.  In addition to natural ones, artificial materials are often used in the manufacture of such a tree: flowers and twigs, glass balls and beads, twisted cord, satin ribbon, etc.

As the basis for the crown, take a round ball made of a <span>floral sponge,</span> foam rubber, nylon stocking stuffed with cotton wool, a children's toy is also suitable - a small plastic ball. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Topiary from the leaves." class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2521/283431.jpg" width="300"></div>  This base is planted on a stem, which is a tree branch, planed and painted in the desired color, fixed in a pot using <span>plaster of</span> water divorced in water <span>.</span>  The crown base for the crown is pasted over with leaves and flowers, starting from the top, in a circle and up to the stem itself or (if it is made of a floral sponge or foam rubber) simply stick short short stalks of prepared dried plants into it.  If you decide to work with glue, then attach the elements in a certain way.  We smear only the lower part of the sheet with a sticky composition.  Then, after gluing, its top will lag behind the surface of the base, and the crown will turn out more fluffy and natural.  The leaves should be applied a little overlap, one on top of the other so that there are no gaps between them.  If you just stick the petioles in a sponge, also do it tightly without leaving voids.  After the crown-crown is completely covered with leaves and flowers, the composition is decorated, making it perfect, using satin ribbons, beads, etc.  The surface of the pot with hardened gypsum is covered with colored pebbles, sisal threads, shells or dried moss.  To topiary served as a decoration of the room for a long time, it is covered on top with a special Dried Flower Spray or regular hair spray.

To make the gaps between the grains invisible, the crown ball is first painted in coffee brown.  Such a topiary is a wonderful room flavor.  In order for coffee to retain its fragrant smell, varnish should not be coated with the product.  If you take moisture-resistant glue for gluing grains, then the dust can easily be washed off with warm water.  As a decor, use golden beads or artificial roses, elegant transparent twigs, colored feathers, etc.
