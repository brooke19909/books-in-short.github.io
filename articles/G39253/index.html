No matter how advanced the characters controlled by the computer, they still can not compare with live users.  That is why the emergence of projects such as WoW or Lineage in the gaming industry was simply inevitable. </p><p>  As time passed, technology developed and players began increasingly to seek additional entertainment on their mobile devices.  The transition of IMO to telephones is an expected and natural phenomenon.  The genre was able not only to attract a new wide audience, but also once again to prove its inexhaustible popularity. </p><p>  Today we have prepared a small top MMORPG on Android, in which all lovers of multiplayer role-playing games should play.  Typical system requirements for such projects are an Android-enabled device and an Internet connection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gameloverz.net" data-author=": Dangerss, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top 10 MMORPGs on Android in Russian" class="if uuid-2604242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55840/2604242.jpg"></div><h2>  Sage Fusion 2 </h2><p>  The first game from the top 10 MMORPGs on Android is a continuation of the eponymous fantasy RPG project.  In the story, the player becomes a successful businessman who, in the company of a bodyguard, goes in search of his lost <span>space starship.</span>  During the game, the characters will be in dangerous catacombs, where the forces of ancient evil dwell. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sage Fusion (release took place in 2013) attracts with excellent hand-drawn graphics, exciting and addictive gameplay, as well as excellent music.  In addition, thanks to the simple and understandable control in the game, you can easily spend more than one hundred hours. </p><h2>  Arcane legends </h2><p>  The next game has been around for quite some time, so its mention in the top 10 MMORPGs on Android (in Russian) is not at all surprising.  Due to its longevity, Arcane Legends (2012) was able to become one of the most <span>popular MMORPGs</span> in the history of the mobile entertainment market. </p><p>  Despite the crazy success and the huge number of fans, the title does not demonstrate anything unique or unusual in its genre.  The player is invited to choose a character from one of the three available classes.  Heroes differ from each other in various skills and abilities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="platypusplatypus.com" data-author=": Andy Z., "><img itemprop="image" alt="top mmorpg on android" class="if uuid-2604176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55840/2604176.jpg"></div><p>  Arcane Legends also gives you the opportunity to take part in PvP battles against other users.  Thanks to the developers, the application receives ongoing support and new updates in the form of additional features, functions and events. </p><h2>  Ninja coming </h2><p>  Ninja coming is another fascinating MMORPG in the top of the Android games, telling about the magical world of Naruto.  The game is just beginning, and we are already witnessing an unequal battle between the brave ninjas and the mysterious hero whose face is hidden under a mask.  What is going on here?  This is what we have to figure out! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Together with the main character, we will visit the nearest village, where we will have many interesting quests and encouraging rewards for each completed mission.  Mobile device users will certainly be satisfied with colorful hand-drawn graphics and addictive gameplay, and all fans of "Naruto" are waiting for joyful meetings with already familiar characters. </p><h2>  Celtic heroes </h2><p>  The next title may be a bit lost against the backdrop of numerous fantasy RPGs, but at the same time it deserves no less attention from the fans of mobile MMOs.  We are talking about Celtic Heroes - a project based on Celtic themes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="apkpure.com" data-author=": One Thumb Mobile Ltd, "><img itemprop="image" alt="top mmorpg games for android" class="if uuid-2604191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55840/2604191.jpg"></div><p>  The game does not try to confuse its users with new functions and complex details - it contains only the most necessary and basic features: the main company, quests and tasks, the ability to join guilds (clans), gaining skills, battles in PvP mode and much more.  Players choose to pass one hero from the five available classes.  Perhaps one of the main features of Celtic Heroes can be called in-game trading, the presence of which in games of this genre is very rare. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Durango: Wild Lands </h2><p>  Durango, which took the next place in our MMORPG top on Android, is considered a relatively new game for mobile devices, which appeared on the market in 2017.  The first thing that catches your eye is a rather unusual setting for a similar genre and a rather interesting plot.  At first, the main character just rides the train, but soon he begins to hear the sounds of someone's screams and a mysterious noise coming from a nearby carriage.  Without thinking twice, our hero goes for reconnaissance and meets a real dinosaur.  It turns out that the train, along with all the passengers, for some unknown reason, was transferred to the prehistoric era, where man is no longer the former king of nature. </p><p>  Durango: Wild Lands is a survival game in an unfriendly yet attractive world.  The player will learn to fish and hunt, will engage in the construction of various buildings and fortifications, go in search of useful things, and, of course, will come face to face with primitive (and not so) monsters.  The main thing is to show persistence, and then the world of Durango will become a place that simply does not want to leave. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mmogames.com" data-author=": Chris Hughes, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top MMORPG for Android in Russian" class="if uuid-2604199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55840/2604199.jpg"></div><h2>  Order &amp; Chaos 1 and 2 </h2><p>  A series of exciting MMORPGs "Order and Chaos" is often called the henchman of the famous "World of Warcraft", only for mobile devices.  Following the best traditions of fantasy, Order &amp; Chaos events unfold in a magical and wonderful world.  Thanks to an excellent leveling system, you can train your character in more than a hundred skills.  Opposing opposing players, monsters and other hostile mobs helps to have a huge arsenal, which includes a wide variety of weapons. </p><p>  Users can entertain themselves with large-scale battles, dangerous trips through dungeons, battles with powerful bosses and the most diverse and unique missions, the total number of which already totals more than a thousand.  In addition, Order &amp; Chaos 1 and 2, without a doubt, are some of the best titles from our top MMORPG on Android with an open world. </p><h2>  Warspear Online </h2><p>  Another MMORPG, which, like Arcane Legends, has existed in the gaming market for a long time - since 2008.  To date, the amount of game content has already reached record levels, while continuing to grow every day more and more.  Players are invited to complete more than 1,500 interesting missions, earn over 15 achievements, explore 8 unique locations and test their strength in PvP arenas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="meialua.gamehall.uol.com.br" data-author=": SOBRE VANESSA REIS, "><img itemprop="image" alt="top 10 mmorpg for android" class="if uuid-2604214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55840/2604214.jpg"></div><p>  Just like in all standard MMOs, the passage of Warspear Online begins with the creation of your own character.  There are four classes and two alliances to choose from, in addition to which the hero can do some special kind of craft. </p><p>  Perhaps the only feature that can push potential players away from Warspear Online is the imposition of in-game purchases.  On the other hand, now adding such transactions has become quite commonplace for most mobile games.  In any case, only the player decides! </p><h2>  Armed Heroes Online </h2><p>  We continue to talk about games from the top 10 MMORPGs on Android and move on to Armed Heroes, the latest development project from the Hong Kong-based company KoramGame.  Note that the game was able to accommodate all the top positions in the United States and Asian countries.  It shows really excellent performance on mobile devices and also has support for its own 3D engine. </p><p>  Users are offered to play for one of six heroes.  There is nothing new in the classes, and they are all well known to fans of any MMO projects: there is a valiant knight, a mysterious necromancer, a hidden killer, and other famous characters.  Each class has its own specific skills, abilities and tactics of warfare.  Armed Heroes Online will surely appeal to all lovers of <span>good MMORPGs</span> and fascinating fantasy worlds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.touchtapplay.com" data-author=": Francesco, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top MMORPG for Android with an open world" class="if uuid-2604222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55840/2604222.jpg"></div><h2>  Kingdom Conquest II </h2><p>  The publishers of the next game were the famous giant company Sega.  Kingdom Conquest II is a fascinating cocktail of excellent gameplay, intriguing plot and an exciting world filled with various adventures and battles. </p><p>  Choosing a character, the player will go on a journey through the darkest dungeons to deal with all evil spirits and monsters.  As a defense, you can use a huge arsenal of weapons, a variety of equipment and, of course, magic. </p><p>  In general, fighting monsters is more interesting not only alone, but also in the company of other players.  That is why Kingdom Conquest II uses an active Internet connection to support convenient multi-user mode. </p><h2>  World of prandis </h2><p>  And we will finish our today's top MMORPG on Android (in Russian) with World of Prandis.  This masterpiece from the Oryugengames studio will appeal to all those who lack classic role-playing adventures in magical worlds.  The main character of World of Prandis is a powerful hero who travels a lot and is constantly looking for exciting adventures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mmogames.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top 10 MMORPG Games for Android" class="if uuid-2604236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55840/2604236.jpg"></div><p>  He will have to fight with powerful monsters, earn money, gain experience and collect really cool trophies.  And if you don‚Äôt want to pass World of Prandis alone, you can always join a guild or team up with friends. </p>
