Tours in Rome in November: advantages and disadvantages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tourists who want to go to Rome in November often ask the same questions.  Among them, the most common are the following: ‚ÄúIs the weather cold there in the fall?‚Äù  Is it necessary to ride with an umbrella?  What events are held during this period in the city? ‚Äù  If you decide to consider <span>tours to Rome</span> in November and choose one of them, then the information below will certainly come in handy. </p><h2>  Season features </h2><p>  So, is it worth going to Rome in the fall?  To begin with, this time of year is considered the period of the "low" season, however, it is called such according to Italian criteria.  This city is a place that is visited simply by a huge number of tourists, so do not expect that on the street and in cultural institutions you will not meet many people.  On the contrary, it must be borne in mind that in November even more guests are traveling to Rome who want to save on prices for hotels and airline tickets that have fallen traditionally in the fall.  Perhaps their cost will be really less compared to the spring season or the end of summer, however, be sure that you will have to stand in line for the main attractions of the city for a very long time. </p>

    <h2>  Rome: November weather </h2><p>  If on October days nature was supportive of Italians tired of the summer heat, then November is a whimsical time.  For example, in Rome it is sometimes really cool, damp and rainy.  Already often at this time thick clouds gather over the city.  Meteorologists say that you should expect at least fifteen days this month to be cloudy.  And how then to pack your bags, going to Rome?  Although the weather in November promises to be rainy, the precipitation is short-lived, which is why the clear sky and the sun can still please tourists.  However, it is better to wear warm clothes when you leave the hotel room in the morning, because the outside will be guaranteed to be damp and cool (no more than 10 degrees, as a rule).  By the middle of the day, the temperature will rise slightly (up to 16 degrees), and if the weather is warm, then you can even count on as much as 18-20 degrees of heat.  And yet, no matter what the weather conditions are foreseen, in no case do not give up umbrellas or raincoats - they can come in handy at any time.  After twelve o'clock in the afternoon it can get colder.  It gets dark in Rome this season at about four o'clock in the afternoon, and after an hour the city will be covered with pitch darkness, and the lights of lanterns and lamps will light up everywhere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What to do in the city in late autumn? </h2><p>  In Rome during this period you can see all the popular attractions.  If during the summer heat in the city it would be very hot, and it would be difficult for you to walk a lot on the streets, then in the late autumn walks in the old quarters will not be boring for sure.  Of course, if the weather does not spoil sharply.  In this case, experienced travelers advise tourists to book a tour by bus.  In addition, remember that in the Eternal City there are a large number of galleries, museum complexes and ancient structures in which you can have a great time in rainy weather - for the benefit of your cultural and spiritual development. </p>

    <p>  Do not despair when it rains in the city.  Rome in November can be cold, but by no means boring or inhospitable.  Go on various excursions around the city or, for example, to the Vatican.  It takes a lot of time to visit the Sistine Chapel and look at all the museum exhibits here (be careful - November 1 is usually closed there).  But at the same time, you definitely will not regret the patched hours.  Those who have already traveled to Rome note that the post office in the Vatican is notable for the speed and serviceability of its work.  Therefore, tourists can easily send home local postcards, picking up options for both their family and friends or colleagues.  Their cost is small - about two euros or even less, but even such a small present will be pleasant to your loved ones. </p><h2>  Festivals and festivals in Rome </h2><p>  Holidays here begin to be celebrated already from the first days of November.  Therefore, those who bought permits to Rome at this time were lucky: they would certainly be interested in familiarizing themselves with local customs.  All Italy celebrates All Saints Day.  This Christian festival has pagan roots, so participating in events will be especially interesting for those travelers who are interested in history.  These days, it is necessary to recall the deceased family members, therefore, in the church, as a rule, memorial services are held.  In the country, the holiday is considered a public holiday, so many shopping centers, shops and cafes do not work.  The next day, on the 2nd, the Romans will buy flowers and go to the cemetery.  The fourth of November is considered the Day of National Unity and in Remembrance of the Soldiers Who Gave Their Life during the First World War.  Also, fashion shows are held in the first week of the last autumn month, and a new season is opened at the opera house.  November is the opening hours of the international festival of sacred music performers, which is opened on the territory of St. Peter's Basilica.  However, concerts are given not only there, but in many churches and basilicas of Rome.  So, as they say, you are welcome! </p>

    <h2>  What else can you do in the city? </h2><p>  If you plan to travel to Rome in November, it is best to plan your schedule for visiting local attractions in advance.  This is especially true of the most popular city locations.  For example, the Coliseum or the Vatican, as well as those cultural institutions in which only a limited number of people can go every day (this applies to the Borghese Gallery).  Thus, if you intend to stay in Rome for only a few days, for which you want to see most of the popular attractions, it is best to buy a ticket there via the Internet.  So you do not have to stand in line at the entrance and it will save time for walking around the city.  One of the most famous sites for these purposes is considered SelectItaly, which is useful to travelers who are going to go to Rome in November.  Reviews of tourists say that many used its services and were satisfied. </p>

    <p>  When you have a lot of time, do not limit yourself to Rome alone.  Take a trip to Tivoli or look at Lazio castles in the capital area.  You can also go in the direction of Florence or visit Pompeii. </p><h2>  Prices in November </h2><p>  Tourists who bought permits in Rome in November can relax in Italy, saving a lot, since the time of the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù season has already passed, and the winter stream of travelers who arrive for Christmas and New Year is still far away.  In fact, a stay in the city during this period is notable for its accessibility.  In particular, because a large number of tour operators, because of the decrease in the number of people traveling in this direction, put up for sale last-minute tours that may be of interest to many.  November Rome will be a truly ideal vacation spot for those who are limited in means, or for those who cannot bear the summer heat and the Italian scorching sun and prefer leisurely autumn walks. </p>

    <h2>  Time difference: Moscow - Rome </h2><p>  Tourists sometimes not only have a good time traveling, but also experience discomfort from the fact that time zones change.  But in this situation, not everything is so critical.  The time difference (Moscow - Rome) is small - only two hours in winter and one hour in summer.  Moreover, it was Roman time that lags behind Moscow.  Therefore, you can easily call your family and friends who stayed at home without fear of waking them in the middle of the night or in the early morning. </p>
