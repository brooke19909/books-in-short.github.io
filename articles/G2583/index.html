I. Muravyov-Apostol is inextricably linked with the fateful events of Russia at the beginning of the 19th century.  Leo Tolstoy, who did not share the ideas of the Decembrists, called him one of the best people not only of that, but of any other time.  A descendant of an ancient family, related to the famous Ukrainian hetman Daniil Apostol, Sergei Ivanovich, who heads the list of Decembrists, became a staunch Republican and an active opponent of serfdom. </p><h2>  The childhood of Muravyov-Apostol </h2><p>  On September 28, 1796, the fourth child, named Sergei, was born in the family of statesman Ivan Matveevich Muravyov-Apostol.  Soon after his birth, Ivan Matveevich was sent by Emperor Paul I as an envoy to Hamburg, where he went with his family.  After returning to Russia in 1801, Ivan Matveevich soon moved to Madrid on official business.  Under pressure from Napoleon, who came to power in France, the Russian mission was recalled from Spain.  Having left his family in Paris, Ivan Matveevich returns to Russia and receives his resignation.  Sergey begins his studies at Hicks' boarding house, where he immediately drew attention to himself with briskness and excellent successes in academic disciplines. </p>

    <h2>  Homecoming </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the children grew up abroad and speak French, under the influence of their mother, they developed a strong sense of patriotism and love for Russia.  However, when in 1809 the family returned to St. Petersburg and the children were happy to accept this return, Anna Semenovna, their mother immediately warned that Russia was a country of slaves, referring to serfdom.  Sergey's brilliant mathematical abilities allow him in 1810 to easily enter the newly formed school <span>of railway engineers.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Participation in the war of 1812 </h2><p>  After Napoleon‚Äôs attack on Russia, the student was sent to serve in the main headquarters of the army, commanded by Kutuzov.  In June 1812, 15-year-old Sergei received baptism of fire in the battles for Vitebsk, and then the young lieutenant participated in the battle of Borodino.  Army Commander M.I. Kutuzov tried to keep him at his main apartment, but at a critical moment, a young officer, as part of a sapper company, built and defended redoubt fortifications under French storm fire. </p>

    <h2>  Tarutin battle </h2><p>  The significance of the Battle of Tarutino, in which the second lieutenant, who did not reach the 16th anniversary, also distinguished himself, consisted not only in the fact that successful results were achieved for the first time, but also in raising the spirit of the Russian troops.  Historians believe that the Battle of Tarutino with its success in October 1812 forced Napoleon to decide to leave captured Moscow.  Then there was a fierce <span>battle near Maloyaroslavets,</span> which led to the fact that Napoleon refused to further advance to Kaluga, the main forces of the Russian army began the pursuit of the retreating French troops.  After Maloyaroslavets, colleagues from the number sent from the school to the war returned to St. Petersburg to continue their studies, but Muravyov-Apostol Sergey Ivanovich decided to remain in the army.  The participation of Muravyov-Apostle in further battles for the liberation of the Fatherland from the French invasion was marked by the award of the Golden Sword and the assignment of the rank of lieutenant.  After the expulsion of Napoleon from Russia, he was awarded the Order of St.  Anne III degree. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Overseas trip </h2><p>  Wanting to participate in a foreign campaign, the 16-year-old officer secured an appointment to the jaeger battalion.  For the case near Lutzen (Germany), Muravyov-Apostol Sergey Ivanovich, whose biography was very difficult, was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir 4 tbsp.  with a bow.  Since 1814, under the command of <span>General Raevsky,</span> he took part in many battles, and for the battle near Paris the young captain receives the Order of Anna of the 2nd degree.  In Paris, he meets with his older brother Matthew, and together in March 2014 they return to Russia, where they are waiting for their father and eight-year-old brother Hippolytus. </p><h2>  Organization of the first secret societies </h2><p>  The unanimous uprising of the Russian people against the foreign invasion in 1812 showed the strength of spirit of ordinary people, including serfs.  After a glorious military campaign, when Russia liberated Europe from the yoke of Napoleon, the enlightened part of the advanced Russian nobility was waiting for the liberation of the peoples of their Fatherland from the yoke of autocracy.  According to S.I. Muravyov-Apostol, the liberation of Russia from its own yoke will lead to the liberation of the whole world, will contribute to the development and prosperity of the country. </p><p>  The desire to help people free themselves from the tyranny of their masters, break free from desperate need and at the same time avoid a repetition of the horrors of the ‚ÄúPugachevschina‚Äù led the best representatives of the privileged class to the need for unification.  The first decade of the 19th century is generally rich in various secret societies, including Masonic lodges, with the help of which nobles could fill a spiritual vacuum after actively participating in world-wide events.  One of these societies, which were created in 1815, was the ‚ÄúArtel of Officers of the Semenovsky Regiment,‚Äù organized by N. M. Muravyov.  S. I. Muravyov-Apostle, who, after returning from a foreign campaign, transferred to serve in the <span>Semenovsky regiment,</span> together with his brother Matvey <span>,</span> became a member of the artel.  The goals of this society, consisting of 15-20 people, were vague and unclear.  Soon, at the direction of the emperor, the artel was dissolved, but the meetings of its members continued, and it could be considered the basis for the further development of the revolutionary movement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  The Union of Salvation </h2><p>  The first secret organization of officers (‚ÄúUnion of Salvation‚Äù) was created in 1816 in the house of the Muravyev-Apostol brothers, where Prince Trubetskoy, Alexander and <span>Nikita Muravyev,</span> Yakushkin were also present.  The organization of young officers, renamed in 1817 after the admission of Pestel P.I. to its members as the "Society of True and Faithful Sons of the Fatherland", was and still remains small (30 people), but with more clearly defined goals.  The main task of society was the struggle for the liberation of the peasants from serfdom and the elimination of autocracy, which is enshrined in the charter of society.  In an effort to spread their influence widely, not only nobles, but also philistines, merchants, clergy, and free peasants were accepted into society. </p><p>  The society was led by the so-called Root Government, which included Muravyov-Apostol Sergey Ivanovich.  Along with the growing discontent of the masses within the country and the strengthening of the pan-European revolutionary situation in the "Union of Welfare", supporters of a decisive military onslaught on the autocracy and the establishment of the republican system gained more and more influence.  The correctness of this approach was also confirmed by the spontaneous appearance in 1820 of soldiers-guardsmen of the Semenovsky regiment.  After the suppression of indignation in the Semenovsky regiment, he was disbanded, and Muravyov-Apostol Sergei Ivanovich was transferred, with the rank of colonel, to the Chernigov Infantry Regiment.  The congress of the Indigenous Council of the Union of Welfare, which was formed in January 1821, announced the dissolution of society.  However, in fact, it was not liquidation that was carried out, but the reorganization of the Soyuz, which resulted in the organization of two companies coordinating joint actions. </p>

    <h2>  Southern Society </h2><p>  A secret organization in Ukraine, the initiator of which was the members of the Tulchinsky council of the "Union of Welfare", was called the "Southern Society."  It was headed by P.I. Pestel, and Sergey Muravyov-Apostol (Decembrist) became the head of the largest Vasilievsky council.  The program goals and objectives of the society, to which the ‚ÄúSociety of the United Slavs‚Äù joined in 1825, are set forth in the ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù by Pavel Ivanovich Pestel. </p><p>  The goals of society remained in tune with the objectives of the Union of Welfare, but it was proposed to act more decisively, using the assassination of the king to decapitate the monarchist party.  At the same time, Pestel believed that the uprising should take place in the capital and be carefully prepared, and Sergei Ivanovich <span data-mce-mark="1">Muravyov-Apostol, the Decembrist,</span> insisted on speedy action using troops under the command of officers - members of the Southern Society. </p><h2>  Rise of the Chernigov Regiment </h2><p>  After the failure of the military performance on Senate Square (St. Petersburg), at the end of December 1815, a riot of soldiers began in the Chernigov regiment, stationed in the Kiev province.  The reason for the uprising was the arrest of Lieutenant Colonel S.I. Muravyov-Apostol, which was personally carried out by the regiment commander after receiving news of the uprising in St. Petersburg.  The next day, the rebels occupied Vasilkov, and then Motovilovka.  In Motovilovka, the proclamation of the rebels (the ‚ÄúOrthodox Catechism‚Äù), composed by Muravyov-Apostol and Bestuzhev-Ryumin, was announced before the formation.  The Chernihiv regiment began moving to Petersburg with the hope that other military units would support it.  However, these hopes turned out to be unfounded, and under the White Church the regiment was surrounded by a detachment of hussars and artillerymen.  January 3, 1826 they were defeated by government forces.  The younger brother of Sergei Ivanovich, Hippolytus, not wanting to be captured, shot himself, and he, seriously injured, was captured.  During the investigation, he behaved courageously and nobly, trying to shield his comrades and take on all the blame. </p>

    <h2>  Decembrist movement in Russia </h2><p>  The Decembrist movement in Russia was special in that they did not rely on a particular social stratum and, taking a mortal risk in the name of liberating the people, did not seek support in it.  The situation of the interregnum after the sudden death of Alexander I allowed the Decembrists to withdraw the guard regiments to the Senate Square in order to force the Senate to proclaim the destruction of autocracy, the elimination of serfdom and the establishment of political freedoms. </p><p>  The indecision and fragmentation of the actions of the conspirators led to the fact that the Decembrist uprising (year 1825) was defeated.  The Supreme Criminal Court, created for the trial of participants in a military insurrection, convicted 121 people.  In accordance with the degree of guilt, everyone who was on the Decembrists list was divided into 11 categories.  In the first category, which envisaged first the death penalty, and then replaced by eternal hard labor, 31 people were convicted.  Five people, recognized by the commission of inquiry outside the ranks, were sentenced to hanging, including Muravyov-Apostol Sergey Ivanovich.  In July 1826, the sentence was carried out. </p>

    <h2>  House of Muravyov-Apostol </h2><p>  The Muravyev-Apostol Manor in Moscow was located on Old Basseynaya Street.  After the uprising of the Decembrists (year 1825), the house was sold.  Lunacharsky was also thinking about perpetuating the memory of the first Russian revolutionaries, who was about to open a museum of the Decembrists in the estate.  The implementation of this plan took place only in 1986, but five years later it was closed due to the accident of the building.  The descendants of the Ant-Apostles, invited in 1991, decided to restore the building by the efforts of the family.  After almost ten years of hard work, the main manor house was restored and leased to the Decembrists Museum.  Currently, exhibitions and excursions are regularly held there. </p>
