But is everything so rosy, as the posters of this youth institution claim?  We‚Äôll deal with the format of the institution, its location, menu and program of events. </p><h2>  Where is it and how to get there </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="52.604868" data-lng="39.594547000000034" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/2/3/5/7235.png"></div><p>  The address of the "Fairy Tale" bar is Lipetsk, Sovetskaya Street, house 4. As a guide, you can choose the city administration, it is just the opposite. </p><p>  The easiest way will be to get to the Ploshchad Teatralnaya stop.  Almost all buses that go towards the city center go there. </p><p>  It makes no sense to drive a private car, since it is impossible to find a parking space in the immediate vicinity. </p><h2>  Food and drink </h2><div class="photo" data-original="dwijok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fairy tale bar" class="if uuid-2708967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95582/2708967.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, the strongest part of the Tale bar menu in Lipetsk is local alcoholic cocktails. </p><p>  The institution has gone from the standard set of "Sex on the Beach" and "Pina Colada" and has developed its wide range of branded drinks.  Most likely, you have never tried any of them, since each element of the cocktail menu is a product of the creative thought of the staff and the restaurateurs team who were engaged in the restaurant reloading. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For those who don‚Äôt drink, the Skazka bar in Lipetsk has a wide range of coffee drinks and teas, as well as non-alcoholic mulled wine and many other pleasant warming liquids. </p><p>  In terms of food, the Tale bar defends the principles of cuisine from all over the world.  Here you can taste Japanese rolls of various types, a huge number of various side dishes, salmon, pork, lamb shish kebabs and not only. </p><p>  Among other things, the cooks of the Skazka bar in Lipetsk cook chicken in ten different ways, and also offer their guests to try a wide range of grill menus. </p><p>  Do not forget about the Italian cuisine in the bar.  Many types of pizza of different sizes, as well as a wide range of types of pasta will allow you to find an individual taste depending on your personal preferences. </p><p>  You can also order a steam cocktail at the restaurant, so it‚Äôs better not to come here with children, since hookah smoke still has a detrimental effect on the health of the smoker and those around him. </p><h2>  Events and cultural program </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dorogoe-lipetsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fairy tale club in lipetsk" class="if uuid-2708976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95582/2708976.jpg"></div><p>  On the evening before the weekend, the Tale bar in Lipetsk is being transformed.  A cafe with business lunches disappears, but a good night club appears with all the ensuing circumstances. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To participate in events, musicians from neighboring regions or local celebrities are invited, Go-Go girls dance at the stands, and the photographer prepares a photo report that conveys all the hot energy of the party. </p><p>  The Fairy Tale bar in Lipetsk becomes a gathering place for young people.  Here you can dance, meet new people, relax, and just have fun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pronews48.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bar in lipetsk" class="if uuid-2708971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95582/2708971.jpg"></div><p>  Among other things, the bar sometimes arranges nice promotions.  For example, there are days when admission for all girls to the institution is free.  Young people must pay about 300 rubles.  This price, of course, is overstated and is kept at the level of the best clubs in the Lipetsk and Voronezh regions.  Nevertheless, the absence of any alternative forces the youth to arrange a full house every Friday. </p><h2>  Visitor Impression </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bar in Lipetsk fairy tale" class="if uuid-2708974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95582/2708974.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews of the bar "Fairy Tale" in Lipetsk are ambiguous.  On the one hand, visitors celebrate delicious food, inexpensive business lunches and a pleasant atmosphere.  On the other hand, the service in the institution is openly lame. </p><p>  For example, the main feature of the institution is the presence of professional karaoke.  But microphones only work from time to time, and the equipment setup does not begin in advance, but directly during the event.  And it doesn‚Äôt bother anyone that in the hall guests who have already made a rather serious deposit contribution to the table and want to receive the offered services right now.  The technical troubleshooting time can reach up to 2-3 hours. </p><p>  The guest can expect a menu of up to 15-20 minutes with a small occupancy of the institution.  It happens that the number of occupied tables equals the number of waiters in the hall, but they continue to ignore the new guest.  However, the dubious level of service is a hallmark of many establishments in Lipetsk.  Bar "Fairy Tale" here was no exception. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that you can come here to have lunch if you forgot to take food to work, or drop by on Friday evening to have fun in the atmosphere of a karaoke bar. </p>
