For legal spouses, the image of these colors may symbolize infidelity.  Of course, the magic of the embroideress‚Äôs work is hidden not in a set, mouline thread or drawing, but in the direction of the craftswoman‚Äôs thoughts.  If you tune in to the realization of a dream by making the first stitch on the canvas with embroidered peonies with a cross, it will certainly come true. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch kits peonies" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1831274.jpg" width="425"></div>

    <h2>  What to choose: a ready-made kit or diagram from the Internet </h2><p>  The sets of some firms are fanned with myths and legends about the quick embodiment of a desire at the end of work.  But it is not so important whether the picture will be embroidered from a ready-made set or according to the pattern found on the Internet.  The effect will be equivalent.  The only difference is that in the first case, everything you need is already at hand, and you can immediately get to work.  In the second - the preparation may be delayed due to the search for threads of the right colors and brands.  On sale there are very attractive kits with intuitive circuits, simple to perform. </p><h2>  Ready-made kit for cross-stitch from the company Riolis: "Peonies in a Vase" </h2><p>  Cross-stitch ‚ÄúPeonies in a Vase‚Äù from Riolis is carried out with woolen threads, due to which the work takes on additional volume.  Its size: 40x40 cm, the canvas used is unmarked Aida 11, therefore needlewomen will have to arm themselves with a water-soluble marker, a ruler and divide it into 10x10 squares of holes to facilitate the process of counting stitches.  In a set - 27 flowers and 4 blends.  For convenience, you can take an organizer, as during operation, the hair wrinkles and becomes less fluffy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch peonies in a vase" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1831278.jpg" width="450"></div>

You can remove a copy from it, so as not to spoil it, if you want to repeat the embroidery.  It is advisable to glue the folds with tape.  The set is easily embroidered, with the exception of the middle of the flowers.  These places can cause difficulty for beginners.  At the end of the work, there are often threads that can be used for other creative ideas.  The embroidery process gives great pleasure to the craftswomen, thanks to a clear and easy pattern.  The picture is bright, saturated.  The petals of each flower are beautifully crafted, the bouquet looks like a real one. </p><h2>  Ready-made kit for cross-stitch "Titmouse and Peonies" from the company "Alice" </h2><p>  The ‚ÄúTitmouse and Peonies‚Äù set refers to sets with full canvas sewing, which may seem difficult for beginner needlewomen.  Therefore, such work is more suitable for embroiderers with experience.  The composition of the kit: 31 floss, 2 hoods, canvas, clear and <span>simple cross-stitch pattern.</span>  The peonies in the figure consist of solid color spots without single stitches.  The size of the finished work is 19x17 cm. Several techniques are used in the process: a cross in 2 threads and 1 thread, a half cross in 1, 2 and 3 threads.  This combination helps to achieve a high-quality study of halftones and to achieve a sense of volume.  Delicate shades of petals and smooth color transitions delight everyone who sees the final result. </p><h2>  Peonies and Delphiniums - a set from Dimensions </h2><p>  Dimensions Peonies and Delphiniums are part of the Gold Collection premium range and are suitable for experienced needlewomen.  Size of finished work: 30x38 cm. Composition: unmarked canvas "Aida" 18 ivory, organizer, floss 33 colors, 6 blends, 2 needles of different sizes, color symbolic pattern.  Used techniques: cross in 2 and 3 threads, half-cross in 2, 3 and 4 threads, French knot in 2 threads, backstitch, lowercase stitch.  It is necessary to pay attention to places where the thread is used in 4 additions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bouquet of peonies cross-stitch" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1831277.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  In the work there is a large volume of the seam ‚Äúback needle‚Äù in 1 and 2 threads, as in most sets from Dimensions.  It is necessary for drawing details and literally transforms the picture.  To speed up the process, backstroke embroidery of peonies with a cross is better not at the end, but gradually, in small sections.  The result will be amazing.  Due to the specific size of the canvas, it is important to find out the location of the embroidery in advance so as not to start work from the wrong side.  Particular difficulties can cause small flowers at the bottom and in the middle of the bouquet, performed using French knots and single crosses.  Some needlewomen call this work the most complex set from Dimensions. </p><p>  The easiest way to start moving towards your dream is cross-stitch.  Ready-made or hand-picked Peonies sets will surely help you meet the right person as soon as possible. </p>
