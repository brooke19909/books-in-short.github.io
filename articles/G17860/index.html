In general, the company that released this model of smartphone has recently begun to gain more and more popularity.  We will not discuss the reasons for this in the article, since all attention is focused exclusively on the device itself.  So, what is the Etuline Enso S5084B Black, the reviews of which are given at the end of the article? </p>

    <h2>  In outline </h2><p>  The device will be able to please buyers with a powerful processor based on eight cores.  The Etuline Enso S5084B Black display, reviews of which the reader will find in this article, displays the picture in HD quality.  In this case, the diagonal of the device is 5 inches.  Built screen based on IPS technology.  This means that the eye strain during the operation of the phone will be reduced to a minimum. </p><p>  Otherwise, I would like to note a good main camera.  Its resolution is eight megapixels.  Etuline generally knows a lot about cameras, it's hard to argue with that.  The flagship price is currently about twelve thousand rubles.  In principle, this is not so much for what the object of our today's review can actually offer.  The device has many interesting features, and they should be familiar with.  Well, we will start, perhaps, according to the standard scheme: with the configuration and appearance of the smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  There is a saying: they are met by clothes, and escorted by the mind.  The reader, of course, may ask a logical question about what this is for.  In fact, everything is very simple.  It becomes clear from the first glance cast on the box.  The packaging is colorful, you can even say that it is bright.  If we take a closer look, then on the top cover we will notice the image of the device.  The model is also located there and the slogan of the manufacturing company is printed. </p><p>  An inscription is put on the box, which dispels all doubts regarding the preinstalled software.  More specifically, it says ‚ÄúInside Yandex.‚Äù Thus, we quickly understand that the Etuline Enso S5084B Black smartphone (black), the reviews of which will be given below, has the appropriate software developed by the notorious Russian company. </p><p>  At one of the ends indicated brief information about what are the technical features of the smartphone.  On the opposite side there is the same thing, only everything is presented not in the form of text, but in the form of pictures.  Perhaps this is the manufacturer focused on customers who do not particularly like to read.  And now a little about reliability.  The packaging is practical, it is tight.  This allows you to perfectly protect the brand new phone inside.  A branded case is put on the device, and it itself is hidden under the box cover. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But what will we find inside her?  The package will include the device itself, an additional rear panel, provided in case of damage to the main one, a warranty card and operating instructions for the device, an electric mains charger, a wired stereo headset, and a USB cable.  Not so rich, but not at all poor equipment.  Let's talk about accessories in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Stereo headset </h2><p>  Nice device.  It is not only suitable for listening to music.  In fact, the stereo headset, which can be found in the box, has a built-in microphone.  This allows you to talk successfully even when headphones are connected to the phone.  In addition, a special button is mounted in them, making it possible to receive an incoming voice call.  The stereo headset can be attached to clothing using the plastic clothespin that the wired device is equipped with. </p><h2>  Sync cable </h2><p>  Actively discussing this accessory for Etuline Enso S5084B Black w3bsit3-dns.com.  Users who have experience with a large number of smartphones have repeatedly noted that this device can be distinguished from others by several factors.  The first is the length.  Not all MicroUSB-USB wires are 1.2 meters long right now, you know.  Secondly, at one end of the wire a special company label is fixed.  It has the inscription Etuline.  Thus, no doubt should arise. </p>

    <h2>  Charger </h2><p>  This accessory, which is powered by the mains, also has a marking sticker.  However, on it we can notice not only the name of the manufacturer, but also the charging performance.  Specifically, through this peculiar transformer, a current having a power of one ampere and a voltage of five volts will be supplied to the device‚Äôs battery. </p><h2>  Smartphone Etuline Enso S5084B black.  Design features </h2><p>  Some external features of the smartphone are immediately evident.  What is it about?  Of course, about the branded cover in which the device is dressed.  This kind of device plays a dual role.  On the one hand, this is a case.  On the other - the back cover (panel).  Interestingly, in combination, the cover also protects the display.  Thus, we have the opportunity to make sure that in the case of our Etuline model, the cover-cover is more than just a design element: it is a well-thought-out engineering solution. </p><p>  The described product has a special window.  It is transparent.  If you cover the phone screen with a cover, all the information will be broadcast through this area.  With the help of a window in the case, you can always find out what time it is, how many times they called you on the phone, and also the name of the melody that is currently playing in the multimedia application.  In addition, through this window, the owner of the phone can always manage it.  The commands will be read by the device quite accurately. </p>

    <p>  The back cover is even.  We will not notice any drawings here.  However, just above the middle the name of the company is written, which again will not let us forget about it.  It seems that the company Etulin marking various elements is not just a habit, but a tradition.  At the bottom of the cover there is a hole through which sound comes out of the main speaker of the phone.  At the bottom there are also outputs for the connector format MicroUSB. </p><h2>  Rear view of the device </h2><p>  Here you can find the lens of the main camera, which has a resolution of 8 megapixels.  The device is equipped with an LED flash located in the upper left corner.  At the top end, by the way, is a connector for a wired stereo headset standard 3.5 mm. </p>

    <h2>  Side view </h2><p>  There is a power control button on the side of the device.  With its help, the device can be turned on, off or locked.  Meanwhile, we won‚Äôt find the volume rocker here.  Why, it is known only to the company's engineers. </p><h2>  Smartphone Etuline Enso S5084B Black: owner reviews </h2><p>  So what do the people who purchased this unit say?  First of all, the owners of the device note that it is better to find hardly anything for twelve thousand rubles.  The advantages of the device are its large and high-quality screen.  Also a positive feature is a good filling.  Celebrate and stylish design. </p><p>  The disadvantages are the impossibility of updating without wired synchronization with a personal computer, as well as a fairly short battery life.  Without an outlet, the phone will not last very long.  Perhaps these are the only drawbacks of this model of the specified company.  At least nothing more was revealed. </p>
