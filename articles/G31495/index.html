    <p>  Someone does not disregard any <span>lottery lottery,</span> while others regard such an activity as hopeless, based on statistics predicting that it is possible to guess 5 numbers only in 0,00026% of cases.  It‚Äôs even more difficult to accurately name 7 numbers: here the probability of winning is 1:76 million. If you think about it, the chances are really small. </p><h2>  A little bit about the essence of lotteries </h2><p>  Today there are many lotteries.  One of the most popular is the Golden Key from the sponsor of Interlot CJSC, which has been broadcast on television since 1996.  There was a time when interest in it faded due to the crisis, and the rallies stopped, but later the situation changed. </p><p>  And yet, what is the likelihood of winning the Golden Key?  Such an opportunity is always present, otherwise why then come up with the lottery itself and predict coincidence of numbers?  Today, this folk fun has a huge circulation and a very profitable prize fund: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  apartments; </li><li>  cars; </li><li>  Home Appliances; </li><li>  cash reward; </li><li>  other valuable prizes. </li></ul>

    <h2>  How to participate in the draw? </h2><p>  Of course, you first need to purchase lottery tickets (these are two cards with fifteen numbers).  The more of them, the higher the probability of victory (the price of one is 50 rubles).  For example, tickets are already on hand, and selected numbers are crossed out.  What's next?  How to win at the Golden Key?  The lottery will be broadcast on TV, and the prize draw will last about half an hour. </p><p>  When the lottery drum is started, drop-down numbers are marked on the cards.  Balls remaining in the drum (there can be up to five) with the same numbers as in the card mean loss.  In the first round, a drawing of numbers in a row takes place.  Participants who cross out the entire line receive prizes. </p><p>  And yet, how to win at the Golden Key?  The lottery is arranged in such a way that the most valuable prizes are played out in the last two rounds.  All numbers drawn in a row are called the jackpot and promise a lot of money to the lucky ones.  The results of the draws are published by the company's website, in addition, they can be checked directly when viewing the program. </p>

    <h2>  Is it worth the risk? </h2><p>  Many people ask: ‚ÄúHow to win at the Golden Key?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs the lottery really conducted according to the announced rules?‚Äù  There are some ways (claimed to be proven in practice) to win real money.  You can predict a win by repeating combinations of lucky numbers for all draws. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This means that you need, at your discretion, to choose a number of numbers that are constantly noted in each ticket purchased.  Or select multiple rows for multiple tickets.  Sooner or later it might work.  There is a known case where a resident of the United States, Mairoc Doug, has been waiting for more than ten years for the numbers to match in the combination he invented, each time without any changes noting it in his ticket.  As a result, he received thirty million dollars. </p>

    <h2>  "Scientific" methods </h2><p>  There is a book by Klaus Joule called ‚ÄúThe Messenger‚Äù, in which he advises you to take advantage of your imagination and turn off for a minute to imagine how to travel by train to other parts.  If there is only a few days left before the coveted rally, it is precisely this number of stations that must be passed to get out on the necessary platform. </p><p>  Then you need to walk around the neighborhood, looking around, and looking for iconic numbers.  Having seen them on the scoreboard or in another place where they can be, remember them in the sequence in which they catch your eye.  Then return to the platform and drive in the opposite direction, trying not to forget the combination. </p><p>  Then it remains only to indicate the numbers on the ticket.  If these options seem to be difficult, then you can always resort to the latest computer programs that make up the statistics of winnings, and according to the theory of probability, outline the ways of winning in the Golden Key lottery. </p><h2>  NLP Technique </h2><p>  It is tempting to see a way of subconscious programming when everyone who wants to win sets himself up for victory by physically sensing the presence of money in his hands.  Usually thoughts materialize, and it remains only to reap the fruits of good luck.  Sometimes the winners say: "I did not even expect to win."  This is not entirely true, everyone who buys a lottery ticket does it with the expectation of winning.  It would be more correct to say: ‚ÄúI did not even expect that I would win this time.‚Äù </p><p>  Since the lottery is a fatal combination of circumstances, you can simply trust in fate and choose a combination of numbers, focusing on the dates of global events around the world.  For example, take the numbers on the hull of a <span>sunken submarine</span> from a news report <span>.</span>  Naturally, there are an infinite number of ways to deceive a fortune or, on the contrary, to agree with it, the main thing is to believe in them. </p>

    <h2>  Lucky Stories </h2><p>  Often people are inspired by other people's examples, so many wonder if they win at the Golden Key? <strong> </strong>  Of course yes!  However, we are talking about insignificant amounts, as the lottery has not had any jackpot events lately. </p><p>  Despite everything, the Golden Key lottery is considered an absolutely real chance to take big money.  There were examples of getting an apartment, and in May this year a resident of Ufa hit a jackpot of 100,000 rubles. </p><p>  The lottery adds popularity and stimulates those who have never participated in the draw, numerous winning tickets.  The Golden Key is gradually becoming a nation-wide fun.  There are cases when people, inspired by the example of a lucky one, purchased dozens of tickets of this lottery ... And they won.  Moreover, hoping to get, say, ten thousand, they won an apartment or a car. </p><p>  therefore <strong> </strong>  to many participants in the draws <strong> </strong>  it will be easy to answer the question about the lottery <strong> </strong>  "Golden Key".  Has anyone won? <strong> </strong>  Yes, and more than once.  Winners are ordinary people.  They say that luck awaits many in the "festive circulation", especially if you buy as many tickets as possible. </p><p>  Inveterate players advise the following: you can not spend all the money without a balance on the purchase of tickets, as well as wait for a win to cover vital expenses.  This is fortune, and sometimes she smiles, and sometimes she laughs.  Having received the long-awaited bonus, you must definitely stop for a while to attract new luck. </p>
