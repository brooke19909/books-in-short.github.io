Of course, this method is much more convenient than showing the same photos to everyone in a large company several times in a row. </p><p>  In addition, surely every smartphone user has a favorite application that I really want to try on a large screen that conveys even the smallest details.  Based on this, a logical question arises: "How to connect the phone to Smart TV?".  In fact, this can be done very easily, and even in several different ways! </p><h2>  What files can be opened on the TV </h2><p>  Many users mistakenly believe that only pictures, videos and films can be transferred to the Smart TV from the gadget.  But in reality, the functionality of modern TVs is much wider than most of their owners think.  Having correctly selected the appropriate type of connection and connecting the smartphone to Smart TV, each user can: </p><ul><li>  Enable online feeds </li><li>  View videos on YouTube channels </li><li>  Broadcast any games and applications to the big screen; </li><li>  Transfer images from your device to the TV. </li></ul><p>  The functionality of synchronization is completely dependent on how the devices are connected. </p><h2>  Connection types </h2><p>  How to connect the phone to Smart TV?  There are several ways to transfer data from a mobile device to a TV, and they are all divided into two types: </p><ul><li>  wireless </li><li>  wired. </li></ul><p>  In the latter case, to connect the gadget to the TV LG, Sony or Samsung, you must have a special cable - USB, HDMI or Slim Port.  An ordinary wire with tulips is also quite suitable.  Almost all modern TVs that do not support Wi-Fi for synchronization with a smartphone are necessarily equipped with at least one of the necessary connectors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.zdnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ways to connect your phone to a TV" class="if uuid-3186349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67167/3186349.jpg"></div><p>  As for the implementation of wireless data transfer to the TV screen, for this both devices must be equipped with technologies such as AirPlay, Miracast or their analogues. </p><h2>  How to connect a phone to a Smart TV via HDMI </h2><p>  If you are at home, the use of cables is unlikely to cause you any inconvenience, but you can easily improve the quality of the transmitted image and the connection as a whole. </p><p>  The HDMI wire is especially appreciated by owners of smartphones and TVs due to the fast and highest quality exchange of information.  When connected via this cable, Smart TV literally reflects the image of the gadget, like a mirror.  It is this effect that makes it possible to boast of photographs and videos in front of a large company, launch your favorite game or just enjoy the music stored on your phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expertreviews.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to use the MHL cable" class="if uuid-3186352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67167/3186352.jpg"></div><p>  True, it is worth saying that the use of this method may be limited to the gadget model.  Indeed, for synchronization via an HDMI cable, both devices must have a corresponding connector, which some smartphones are not equipped with.  Although in this situation, the developers took care of their users, because progress does not stand in one place.  To eliminate this shortcoming, the MHL cable was invented, which is a kind of converter between HDMI and USB-connectors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, how to connect the phone to Smart TV in this way?  Everything is extremely simple.  To establish a connection, perform several manipulations: </p><ul><li>  turn off both devices; </li><li>  connect the phone to the TV cable; </li><li>  turn on devices; </li><li>  open Smart TV settings; </li><li>  select the appropriate signal source; </li><li>  turn on any application on the phone. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.makeuseof.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect your phone to Smart TV via HDMI" class="if uuid-3186350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67167/3186350.jpg"></div><p>  Although often the synchronization between devices is done automatically. </p><h2>  How to connect the phone to Smart TV via USB </h2><p>  Unlike HDMI, this device will not open you the gadget screen, but only show the folder with its contents.  Although you are also able to play the necessary music, videos and images.  In addition, the TV can recognize popular presentation and document formats. </p><p>  How to connect the phone to Smart TV via USB?  In this case, everything is also very simple!  First turn off the devices, then connect the cable through the appropriate connectors and turn on the devices.  After the manipulations, the connection will be established automatically.  Just do not forget that the wire you need will have different outputs at the ends, suitable for a TV and smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ukkoladom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect your phone to the TV via USB" class="if uuid-3186351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67167/3186351.jpg"></div><p>  Such synchronization makes it possible to completely duplicate the image from a mobile device.  In this case, the phone can be controlled using the remote control from the TV. </p><h2>  Wireless sync </h2><p>  The connection methods already described are suitable not only for Smart TV, but also for ordinary TVs.  And now we will talk about how to connect the gadget to a "smart" device.  Indeed, for a wireless contact, the TV must have Wi-Fi technology, which is not available on older models. </p><p>  So, how do you connect your smartphone to Smart TV if, for example, you are on a visit, and you don‚Äôt have the right wire at hand, or just don‚Äôt want to mess with the cables?  To do this, you can also use several methods of synchronization. </p><h2>  Router application </h2><p>  To implement such a connection, you will need: </p><ul><li>  Wi-Fi enabled smartphone </li><li>  TV with the same function or with Smart TV; </li><li>  home router. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.alphr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect a phone to a TV through a router" class="if uuid-3186353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67167/3186353.jpg"></div><p>  To connect your phone to Smart TV, the first thing you need to do is connect both your smartphone and TV to a Wi-Fi network.  Then find in the device menu a special application from the developer, which makes it possible to easily synchronize gadgets from one manufacturer.  For example, Samsung TVs use the AllShare program, on Philips devices you can find a folder called Philips MyRemote, on Sony this function is called VAIO Media Server, and on LG it is Smart Share. </p><p>  Owners of Apple gadgets will come to the rescue with a special Apple TV set-top box, equipped with AirPlay. </p><h2>  Features of standard programs </h2><p>  Of course, manufacturers did not work hard to develop these applications for a reason.  All of them significantly expand the capabilities of ordinary synchronization of a TV and a mobile device.  With the help of these programs, the entire synchronization process is automated, all files are reformatted into a format suitable for playback on a large screen, as a result of which the image quality improves significantly. </p><p>  Connection in this case is as easy and simple as possible.  For example, how to connect the phone to the LG TV?  Connect to the shared network on both devices, and then launch the Smart Share folder.  That's all, now you can try all the functionality of your TV.  In this case, the smartphone can be used as a remote control.  And if you establish a connection on the contrary, then using the remote control from the TV, you can open folders on the phone. </p><h2>  How to connect without a router </h2><p>  In almost all modern devices: both telephones and televisions, there is an additional feature called Wi-Fi Direct.  This program allows devices to communicate directly with each other without the help of a router. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to connect the phone to the TV via Wi-fi Direct" class="if uuid-3186354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67167/3186354.jpg"></div><p>  How to control Smart TV via phone thanks to this feature? </p><ul><li>  In the phone‚Äôs menu, find the ‚ÄúWireless Networks‚Äù tab, then the ‚ÄúWi-Fi Direct‚Äù sub-item and launch it. </li><li>  Then go to the Smart TV menu, find the ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù and run the same function. </li><li>  At this moment, the TV will see all the devices available for connection.  Find your phone among them and select. </li><li>  In conclusion, approve the request received on the smartphone and begin to use the mastered function. </li></ul>
