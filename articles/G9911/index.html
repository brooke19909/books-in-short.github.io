As early as 1820, for his free verses and epigrams, he went to the southern exile.  In fact, the young official was simply sent to work away from Moscow.  For four years he lived in several cities: Odessa, Yekaterinoslav, Chisinau.  During this period, several famous poems were written: “The Bakhchisarai Fountain”, “The Caucasian Captive”, “The Brothers the Robbers”.  At the same time, work began on the poetic novel Eugene Onegin. </p><h2>  Link Pushkin in Mikhailovsky </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Pushkin’s link in Mikhailovsky" class="if uuid-292869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/292869.jpg?1542118080"></div><p>  During his stay in the south, the literary fame of the young poet increases unheard of.  Along with fame, the attentive glances of representatives of state censorship, headed by Alexei Arakcheev, again turn to him.  In 1824, clouds were again gathering over the poet.  The police intercepts one of his private messages to a friend.  In this letter, Pushkin expresses his own atheistic views.  <span>On July 8 of</span> the same year, the poet was removed from service and sent to his mother’s estate, located in the Pskov region.  In fact, Pushkin’s exile in Mikhailovsky was not too strict for him.  She was not like the conclusion of the Decembrists or a number of other figures of that time.  However, this kind of arrest, being away from literary friends and political like-minded people weighed on the poet.  He himself considered the link imprisonment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Mikhailov link of Pushkin" class="if uuid-293961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/293961.jpg?1542118080"></div><p>  Pushkin’s exile in Mikhailovsky lasted from the summer of 1824 until September 1826.  At the same time, it was here that for the first time in his life he had to directly confront the people, the peasantry, which gave the poet new inspiration and was reflected in his subsequent work.  Today, many eyewitness accounts have been preserved, which later told how Pushkin was inspired by the life of the peasants, with great enthusiasm visiting fairs, talking with local peasants.  The entire period of Pushkin’s exile to Mikhailovskoye was next to him by his aged nanny Arina Rodionovna.  In his poems and letters, he calls her the only friend.  Also, he was periodically visited by old lyceum comrades: Pushchin and Delvig, which was a great joy for the classic.  In the summer of 1826, a young poet <span>N. Yazykov</span> settled near the <span>Pushkin estate</span> <span>.</span>  In it, Alexander Sergeyevich found a close friend.  They spent many evenings together. </p><p>  Link Pushkin in Mikhailovsky bright light reflected in his work.  On the spiritual life of the poet, as already noted, </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Pushkin’s exile period in Mikhailovsky" class="if uuid-293960" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/293960.jpg?1542118080"></div><p>  a great influence was exerted by communication with folk people, an introduction to folklore.  What was created during this period is perhaps one of the brightest and most brilliant pages of the creative biography of the greatest poet.  Here most of the poem “Gypsies” is added, three chapters of “Eugene Onegin” are created, “Boris Godunov”, “Faust Scene”, “Count Nulin” and many less well-known poems, drafts and critical articles come out of the poet’s pen on the estate .  Interestingly, having left for St. Petersburg in the autumn of 1825, a month after the expiration of the term of exile, Pushkin again returned to Mikhailovskoye.  This time he spends about a month there.  However, later the poet often returns here, drawing new inspiration and creative powers. </p>
