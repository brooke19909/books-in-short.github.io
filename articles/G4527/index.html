Fast, simple and beautiful.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Knitting on a fork is a very original and fairly simple way to create amazingly beautiful openwork things.  For some reason, this method is not widespread, although it has been known since ancient times.  Our grandmothers and great-grandmothers knitted so thin cotton lace for cuffs, collars and dress trim, and also decorated bedspreads, tablecloths and curtains with fork lace. </p><p>  Knitting on a fork is carried out using an ordinary knitting hook and a special fork - a device similar to a very large hairpin.  The miniature and subtlety of the resulting openwork depends on the size and thickness of the tool.  The canvas, knitted on a fork, consists of individual bands of braid that are connected by tight or openwork knitting into a single whole.  However, to create an original lace trim, collar or frill, a separate knitted strip is quite suitable. </p><p>  The plug can be made of metal wire, plastic or even thick cardboard.  As already noted, in shape it resembles a hairpin or large-sized double-tooth without a handle.  You can buy a knitting fork in a store where there are whole sets of tools of several sizes and matching hooks.  If you can‚Äôt buy the tool, you can make it yourself from a long knitting needle by bending it with an ‚Äúarch‚Äù using simple manipulations. </p><p>  Knitting on a fork begins with making a crochet loop and putting it on one tooth.  The length of the loop should be half the distance between the teeth.  The tool is taken in the left hand and held with teeth up.  The hook is introduced into the loop worn on the fork, pulling it, then turn from right to left in the hand, so that the thread from the ball grabs the second tooth, and a loop is obtained that is crocheted and crocheted without a crochet in the center above the previous loop.  Then again they turn the fork from right to left, the thread from the ball, which has wrapped around the tooth, is picked up with a crochet and knitted again with a crochet.  The whole process is repeated again and again.  The tape consisting of long loops in the center captured by a "snake" is gradually tied out.  This is the easiest knitting on a fork for beginners to master this type of needlework. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When the braid is tied to the required length, it is crocheted around the edge with crochet columns.  This is where the fun begins.  With the help of alternating columns and air loops, as well as grabbing several long loops at once, formed as a result of wrapping the fork, and twisting or crossing them, very beautiful openwork patterns are created.  When tying the edge of the braid, it is important to ensure that the width of this edge is equal to the width of the middle of the braid.  Processing the strips connected along the edge, they are immediately connected to a single piece of fabric.  Thus, they get stoles and shawls, as well as tablecloths and bedspreads.  But knitting on a fork is not limited to creating only scarves and stoles.  Sweaters and sweaters, openwork skirts, dresses and coats are created from stripes joined together by various openwork weaves. </p><p>  Making a fine lace trim will be possible for any craftswoman who has mastered knitting on a fork.  Patterns, interweaving lace, which are assembled from long loops, the most diverse.  For example, from such a braid you can easily knit a round lace motif if you assemble one side of it into a tight ring, and on the other side between the loops of the braid knit arches from air loops, creating a flat circle.  Round motifs are combined into one piece for dresses, sweaters, shawls and much more. </p><p>  To master this very interesting and exciting type of knitting, it is enough to learn how to knit a braid.  It is easy to do.  If you pick up the fork and hook and start working, everything will become clear and understandable.  And having tied the braid and spreading it in front of you, you will immediately find many ideas for tying and connecting it, as well as just using it as a thin lace frill. </p>
