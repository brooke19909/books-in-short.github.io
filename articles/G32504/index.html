Real fans of their field are engaged in their favorite hobby always and everywhere - on a trip, in transport, in nature and on a walk with a child.  And if a hobby has grown into work, then without special devices that make life easier, there is no way to do it. </p><h2>  Range of accessories </h2><p>  Modern stores for needlewomen offer a huge selection of various devices designed to facilitate and simplify the process.  Separators of threads for knitting by jacquard, fingertips, protecting hands from damage, special holders for yarn.  Most fixtures can be made with your own hands.  It will take improvised materials and a little imagination. </p><h2>  Thread holder </h2><p>  A useful and necessary device for knitting is a holder that will not allow tangles to roll out throughout the apartment.  This device is especially useful for those who have knitting from several threads.  And for working with jacquard, when the yarn is constantly confused with each other, this device is indispensable. </p>

    <p>  To work, you need several plastic bottles.  Their number depends on how many threads of different colors are simultaneously in operation.  The volume of the bottle affects the size of the hank you can put inside. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First, the neck is cut off with a clerical knife at the bottle.  Marker outlines the lines along which the container will be cut.  Most of the plastic is cut off, leaving a thin strip with a width of about 2.5 cm. To make the tip take the form of a hook, a match or a lighter is carefully brought under the strip of plastic.  This must be done very carefully, not allowing the material to melt.  When the strip at the end takes the form of a loop, you will need to wait until the mold solidifies.  It is convenient to fix such a hook on the back of a chair or on the handle of a desk drawer, and put a ball inside.  Conveniently packed thread will not be able to roll into the far corner. </p><h2>  Yarn separator </h2><p>  Often when knitting, the question arises of how to make sure that the threads do not intertwine.  To achieve this, a knitting device, consisting of an ordinary plastic bucket, can help (you can take a large food container or a container from under water).  Around the perimeter on the edge of the container are fixed stationery clips.  The clamp loop is removed and the thread is threaded into it, then the clamp is attached to the container.  Yarn threaded through such a device will not be confused. </p>

    <p>  So that the balls do not run into one another, inside you can make dividers from cardboard.  For this, 3 or 4 strips of cardboard are cut out with a length equal to the diameter of the container, and the width must be chosen with a margin so that it is enough for the size of the ball.  Such strips are inserted one into another.  A cut is made in each middle, and they are put on each other with a herringbone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Specific fixtures </h2><p>  Specialists offer such a device as a ceramic knitting bowl.  These devices for knitting with their own hands are made by craftsmen working with clay.  However, you can make a similar design from a plastic container from shampoo or from a bottle.  For this, 2/3 of the neck is cut off in the container.  The remainder is laid on its side and a slot line is marked with a marker.  It should be a twisted line, curving down.  Due to the shape of the turn, the thread falling into it will not tend to run away, but will fall inside and not slip. </p>

    <p>  The edges of such a device is better to process - to paste over with adhesive tape or colored adhesive paper.  If there is a thermogun, then a layer of glue applied in two or three approaches will perfectly close sharp sections.  The slot should not be too shallow.  As a rule, 0.5-0.7 mm is enough for even <span>thick yarn</span> to lie perfectly in the container. </p><h2>  Portable organizer </h2><p>  For those needlewomen who can not spend a minute without their favorite thing, an organizer or a bag for yarn is an excellent solution.  Such knitting devices are convenient in that they take up little space.  They are mounted on the arm and do not fall anywhere.  Inside you can put a skein of necessary yarn - so it will always be at hand, will not fall and get dirty.  In order to sew such a bag with your own hands, you need to draw a pattern.  It consists of two parts - external and internal.  You can do with only one layer - it all depends on the wishes. </p><h2>  Organizer pattern </h2><p>  To build a pattern, you need to take sizes - the girth of the wrist.  The letter ‚ÄúT‚Äù is drawn on paper with a wide hat and a thinner perpendicular leg.  The pattern must be mirrored symmetrically.  The edges of the thin legs are immediately treated to prevent sprinkling. </p>

    <p>  For this, adhesive material is used, or the fabric is wrapped or sewn by hand.  Then the handbag is sewn from the wrong side, without grabbing the narrow ‚Äúlegs‚Äù.  This bag is very light and comfortable. </p><h2>  Knitting socks </h2><p>  Almost every knitter has the first product after the scarf - socks.  Knitting them is easy enough, but working with several knitting needles at the same time requires some skill.  For those who want to knit socks, a knitting tool called a loom or tenerife will come to the rescue.  It looks like this device is on one row from a <span>knitting machine.</span>  The device has hooks or rods on which the thread is attached.  Then, with the help of hands or with the help of a special hook, the thread is thrown and a web is formed.  The hook can be simple to knit.  Too large a bend, which is in the classic hook, does not let fly threads.  However, there is also no possibility in this method of weaving to transfer the thread quickly.  The hook can also be made independently. </p>

    <p>  Such a device for knitting socks at home is made from improvised materials.  For example, to make a rectangular stand, you need a board 3-4 cm wide and about 50 cm long. Carnations are driven along the perimeter of the board.  The distance between them is chosen independently, however, the best option that will fit most of the yarn is not more than 1 cm. </p><p>  Depending on the intended pattern, the shape of the machine and the location of the fixtures can vary.  In order to knit socks on such a device, it is better to use another form option.  Need a foam or plastic round base.  A silicone cover is good.  The clerical buttons are inserted around the perimeter at a distance of about 0.7 cm. A hole is cut in the center, the diameter of which is 5 cm. </p><h2>  Knitting process </h2><p>  Suitable for knitting socks and mitts.  To fasten the loop, you must move clockwise.  The tail of the thread is held in the left hand, and a turn is made on the button with the right.  Having made a full move, perform another row.  And in the third row, the previous loops (loops of the first row) are thrown through the loops of the second row.  To do this, with a hook or hand, the loop of the lower row rises, slightly tightens and is discarded from the paper clip.  Row after row of yarn, interconnected, lengthens.  Knitting in this technique is loose, but elastic.  Due to this, you can not untie the heel on the toes - the canvas comfortably sits on the foot. </p>

    <p>  Knit so until the sock or mitten reaches the required length (to the thumb or heel).  To reduce the loops, omissions are made in knitting - the yarn is not thrown onto each axis, but through one axis. </p><p>  An unusual, but useful device for knitting, everyone can do for himself.  The main thing is to understand what is needed - convenience, functionality, increased speed.  A device for knitting mitts, socks, scarves can be designed to meet the needs of the master. </p>
