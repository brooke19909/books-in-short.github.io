  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get a loan at MTS</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An urgent call needs to be made, and, as luck would have it, there is no money on the account, and at the moment there is no way to replenish it.  A familiar situation, isn't it?  This is not a problem for MTS customers.  How to get a loan at MTS? </p><p>  Currently, this mobile operator offers its customers 2 lending options.  Let us consider each of them in more detail to figure out how to borrow on MTS. </p><p>  Credit ‚ÄúPromised Payment‚Äù </p><p>  In order to take the ‚ÄúPromised Payment‚Äù loan from MTS, a few seconds are enough.  But it is important that the minus on the balance of the phone does not exceed 30 rubles. </p><p>  The size of the loan depends on how much the subscriber spends per month on mobile communications.  For expenses up to 300 rubles, you can get a loan of up to 200 rubles.  Costs in the range of 301-500 rubles will make it possible to borrow from MTS up to 400 rubles.  With a monthly cost of more than 501 rubles, the credit limit will be up to 800 rubles. </p><p>  With a positive account balance, the amount of 50 rubles is always available to the subscriber.  A loan in accordance with this type of service is provided for 7 days, during which the subscriber is obliged to repay the entire amount. </p><p>  If you are satisfied with the promised payment of up to 20 rubles, the service will be activated for free.  For the established promised payment in excess of this amount, you will have to pay 5 rubles for each connection.  In general, the service is available with a balance of at least minus 30 rubles. </p><p>  If a subscriber‚Äôs monthly communication costs are more than 500 rubles and a limit of 800 rubles is available to him, then if there is already a promised payment, you can set another one.  But their amount cannot exceed 800 rubles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to get a loan on MTS by activating the ‚Äúpromised payment‚Äù service?  There are three ways to do this: </p><ul><li>  dial * 111 * 123 # on the phone and press the call button; </li><li>  Use the online assistant </li><li>  call 1113. </li></ul><p>  How to get a loan at MTS "In full confidence"? </p><p>  The method of providing this service is fundamentally different from the previous one.  If in that case the loan is valid for only 7 days, then the ‚ÄúOn Full Trust‚Äù loan is valid from the moment of its connection.  A credit limit of 300 rubles is already set by default. </p><p>  And after using the loan for six months, its limit can be increased by an amount corresponding to 50% of the expenses of the owner of the phone for cellular communications. </p><p>  The conditions for obtaining a credit of trust are as follows: </p><ul><li>  You must be a MTS subscriber for at least three months; </li><li>  for the three months preceding the activation of the service, an average of at least 300 rubles should be credited to the subscriber‚Äôs account; </li><li>  the balance on the appropriate phone at the date of loan processing should be positive; </li><li>  lack of debt on other MTS accounts. </li></ul><p>  It should also be remembered that both loans cannot be taken at the same time.  These services are mutually exclusive. </p><p>  The service can be activated / deactivated independently in two ways: </p><ul><li>  by dialing * 111 * 32 # on the mobile phone, press the call button; </li><li>  through an online assistant. </li></ul><p>  The limit may increase once a month under the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  full and timely payment of all bills; </li><li>  the subscriber is obliged to increase his expenses on cellular services; </li><li>  the difference between the old and new limits is at least 50 rubles. </li></ul><p>  If communication services are not paid on time, the limit can be reduced to the original size - 300 rubles.  After repayment of the debt, the limit can again be calculated in accordance with current expenses. </p><p>  You can fix it yourself or resume recalculation in accordance with the sum of the costs of communication services in two ways: </p><ul><li>  dial * 111 * 2136 # on the mobile phone and press the call button; </li><li>  Use the services of an online assistant. </li></ul><p>  If the subscriber does not use communication services for more than two months, but the monthly fee for using periodic services is debited from his number, then the loan will be disconnected automatically, and the calculation method will be changed to advance. </p><p>  If you have the ‚ÄúOn full trust‚Äù service, you can change your existing tariff without hindrance. </p><p>  I hope this article helped you solve the question ‚ÄúHow to get a loan on MTS?‚Äù And your phone will never be blocked again at the most inopportune moment. </p>
