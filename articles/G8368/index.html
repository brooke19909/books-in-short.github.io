    <h2>  LED Overview </h2><p>  Before studying the basis of the principles used to mark LEDs, consider the basic information about the corresponding type of product.  What are they? </p><p>  A LED is a special diode that glows if an electric current passes through it.  The main component of this product is semiconductor material.  What additives it contains determines the color when the LED glows.  For example, if aluminum is added to the semiconductor, then the color of the LED to which the electric current is connected may be red.  If indium is added - blue.  In modern industry, LEDs are available in the widest range of modifications based on the content of impurities. </p><p>  The products under consideration (LED marking can reflect this feature) are used in a wide range of industries: in the manufacture of lamps, televisions, decorative elements, etc. In these areas, LEDs in many cases have no analogues, and if they are, then the ones under consideration products in many cases there are undeniable advantages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, if you compare traditional incandescent and LED bulbs, then the latter may be preferable, because: </p><p>  - they will have significantly lower power consumption; </p><p>  - they will have a longer service life; </p><p>  - they are able to work under reduced voltage; </p><p>  - they are characterized by environmental friendliness, safe operation. </p><h2>  LED design </h2><p>  Another aspect that will be useful to study before considering how LED marking is applied is the design of the corresponding elements.  They consist of: </p><p>  - lenses (most often made of epoxy resin); </p><p>  - wire contact; </p><p>  - crystal; </p><p>  - reflector; </p><p>  - electrodes; </p><p>  - anode and cathode. </p><h2>  How do LEDs work? </h2><p>  <span>How do LEDs function?</span>  <span>The reflector of the corresponding element includes an LED crystal.</span>  <span>The corresponding component defines a specific scattering angle.</span>  <span>The light generated by applying voltage to the LED passes through the layers of the housing, after which it hits the lens, and then begins to scatter.</span> </p>

    <p>  It can be noted that LEDs are able to function both in the visible color range and in the infrared.  This feature emphasizes the versatility of the products in question.  LED color markings may be used to indicate the color of the respective product.  Consider its features in more detail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What are the features of marking LEDs in color? </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that a single unified labeling of LEDs by color on the world market has not yet been approved.  Each manufacturer uses its own approaches to classify the respective products.  If we talk about the Russian market - in our country there is a widespread classification of LEDs into 4 types: </p><p>  - red; </p><p>  - green; </p><p>  - yellow; </p><p>  - orange. </p><p>  Let us consider it in more detail in the context of marking the corresponding products. </p><h2>  Red LEDs on the Russian market: marking </h2><p>  If a red stripe is used as a marking of the Russian diode, then it will be of type AL112A (G) and glow in red.  If the marking is represented by a green stripe, the LED will be classified as AL112B (D) and will also glow in red.  In turn, the blue bar indicates an AL112B type product.  However, it also has a red color.  The following LEDs marked with a red dot will have the same color: AL112E (K), AL301A, AL310A, AL316A, as well as PIKM02A-1K. </p><p>  However, there are <span>red LEDs</span> : </p><p>  - AL112ZH (L) and AL307G with a green dot; </p><p>  - AL112I (M), AL310B, as well as AL316B with a blue dot; </p><p>  -AL307A, AL307V, AL336K, as well as KIPD02A-1K with a black dot; </p><p>  - KIPD02B-1K with two black dots; </p><p>  - AL301B, AL336B, as well as KIPM02B-1K with two red dots. </p><p>  There is also an AL307B type product without marking - also a red glow.  Let us now consider what labeling of green LEDs is used on the Russian market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Green LEDs </h2><p>  So, the following products have a green glow color: </p><p>  - KIPD02V-1L with a black dot; </p><p>  - AL336I with a white dot; </p><p>  - AL336G, as well as KIPM02G-1L with two green dots; </p><p>  - KIPD02G-1L - with two black dots. </p><p>  The next type of product on the Russian market is yellow.  Consider what is the labeling of LEDs, its decoding - in relation to products of the corresponding type. </p><h2>  Yellow LEDs </h2><p>  LEDs that have a yellow glow include: </p><p>  - AL336D - with one yellow dot, AL336E - with two, AL336ZH - with three; </p><p>  - AL307D, KIPD02E-1ZH - with one black dot, AL307E and KIPD02E-1ZH - with two; </p><p>  - KIP02D-1ZH - with three green dots. </p><p>  The next common type of product is orange.  Let us examine what the marking of LEDs (LED) of the corresponding type is. </p>

    <h2>  Features of marking LED strips </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the production of LED strips refers to the types of business that are characterized by just the same unified approach of manufacturers to labeling products.  So, in order to classify <span>LED strips</span> , a unified code consisting of 8 elements is used.  It is presented in the following structure. </p><p>  In the first element of the corresponding code, in fact, the name of the main component of the tape is encrypted - LED, LED. </p><p>  The second code element reflects the color of the corresponding product: </p><p>  - R - red - from English Red; </p><p>  - G - green - from Green; </p><p>  - B - blue; </p><p>  - CW - white; </p><p>  - The RGB code reflects the fact that the LED is multi-color. </p><p>  In the third element of the considered code, by means of which the LED is encrypted - marking the conclusions.  For example, they can be classified as SMD.  That is, the code will show that the chip is designed to be installed directly on a printed circuit board, as part of surface mounting.  In turn, in a unified code, DIP type LED marking can also be applied, <span>which will show that the products are intended for installation not on the surface of something, but in holes.</span> </p>

    <p>  The 4th element of the unified LED code reflects the case size in millimeters.  In the 5th - the number of relevant products per 1 meter of tape on which they are installed. </p><p>  In the 6th - the protection class of the LED from the effects of various external factors.  Here, for example, an IP code can be applied, which reflects the fact that the protection class is specified in accordance with the industry standard for the protection of electronic devices IEC-952. </p><p>  In the 7th element, the degree of protection of the LED is reflected.  Codes may be present here: </p><p>  - 0, indicating that the LEDs do not have protection against external factors; </p><p>  - 1, indicating that the product is protected from the penetration of objects whose diameter is 50 mm or more; </p><p>  - 2, reflecting that the LED is protected from exposure to objects with a diameter of 12-80 mm; </p><p>  - 3, showing protection against objects with a diameter of 2.5 mm or more; </p><p>  - 4, reflecting the security of the LED from objects in diameter from 1 mm; </p><p>  - 5, showing that the product is protected from dust in an amount that could lead to a violation of the functionality of the LED; </p><p>  - 6, which indicates that dust is not allowed into the product. </p><p>  In turn, the 8th element of the unified code reflects the degree of protection of the product from liquid penetration.  Codes can be fixed in it: </p><p>  - 0, which indicates that the LED is not protected from liquids; </p><p>  - 1, reflecting the fact that drops of water that fall vertically cannot penetrate the product; </p><p>  - 2, which indicates that the LED is protected from water drops that fall at an angle of 15 degrees; </p><p>  - 3, fixing protection against drops that fall at an angle of 60 degrees; </p><p>  - 4, showing that the LED is protected from water drops that fall on the product at any angle; </p><p>  - 5, which reflects that the product is protected from the effects of a stream of water of normal intensity; </p><p>  - 6, showing that water directed by a strong stream cannot penetrate into the LED; </p><p>  - 7, indicating that water will not penetrate the product even when immersed to a depth of 15 cm; </p><p>  - 8, which indicates that the LED will retain functionality even after prolonged immersion in water. </p><h2>  Decoding of the code for uniform labeling of LED strip: example </h2><p>  What might an example of a unified code look like in the structure considered by us? </p><p>  So, for example, the marking of SMD LEDs may look like this: LED-R-SMD-5050/60 IP68.  It means that: </p><p>  - the LEDs are located on the tape; </p><p>  - the corresponding products have a red glow - R; </p><p>  - the tape is made using SMD type LEDs - that is, intended for installation on the surface; </p><p>  - The LED has a housing size of 50 to 50 square meters.  millimeters; </p><p>  - 60 LEDs are placed on the tape, the fact; </p><p>  - in accordance with international standards, the tape can be used in a dusty room, as well as for prolonged placement in water - IP68. </p><p>  Manufacturers of LED strips thus offer their users a convenient and informative product classification.  With its help, effective marking of SMD-LEDs, as well as those that belong to the DIP category, can be carried out. </p><p>  Among other common types of products, the release of which uses the products in question - car headlights and flashlights.  It will be useful to study how, accordingly, marking of headlights for LEDs is carried out, as well as products installed in various types of flashlights. </p><h2>  LED Marking Features for Headlights </h2><p>  The most important characteristic of the <span>LED lamp</span> installed in the headlight of the car is the type of its base.  This parameter should be guided primarily when choosing a car headlight - from the point of view of its application instead of halogen. </p>

    <p>  For example, if you choose a LED head light, the following relationships can be observed between its marking and brightness: </p><p>  - marking H1 corresponds to a power of 55 W and a brightness of 1550 lumens; </p><p>  - H3 - power 55 W and brightness 1450; </p><p>  - H4 - 55 and 1650 for high beam, 1000 for low; </p><p>  -H7 55 and 1,500; </p><p>  - H8 - 35 and 800; </p><p>  - H9 - 65 and 2100; </p><p>  - H11 - 55 and 1350; </p><p>  - HB2 - 60 and 1500 for high beams, 910 - for low beam; </p><p>  - HB3 - 60 and 1860; </p><p>  - HB4 - 51 and 1095. </p><p>  Experts recommend choosing LED lamps that slightly exceed the brightness of halogen products. </p><p>  There are other classification approaches that can be used to mark LED headlights.  So, for example, there are certain types of products installed in fog lights - for example, H8, H10, and also H11.  Lamps of the type W5W, T10, as well as T4W are installed in the side and side turn lamps.  The specific <span>type of LED,</span> thus, is selected based on the purpose of a particular headlight. </p><h2>  Marking LED Flashlights </h2><p>  The next type of product in which LEDs can be used is flashlights.  The classification of the respective products also has nuances.  The marking of LEDs for flashlights, depending on the policy of manufacturers, can be either similar to the one that characterizes the classification of LED strips that we examined above, or completely unique (although, of course, it is in the manufacturer‚Äôs interests to make it as close as possible to industry-wide approaches) . </p><p>  For example, we can consider the classification of LEDs for flashlights of the American company CREE - one of the leaders in the global market for related products. </p><h2>  CREE <span>LED Flashlights</span> : Classification </h2><p>  The products of this brand are divided into 2 main groups - XLamp flashlights, as well as superbright.  Each of the corresponding groups is classified into families that differ in housing type and operational parameters.  The main classification criterion in this case is the allowed value of the current that passes through the crystal, which is present in the structure of the LED. </p><p>  It can be noted that the most <span>powerful</span> flashlights such as XLamp from CREE include products that have a corresponding value in excess of 350 mA.  In turn, superbright products operate at a significantly lower operating current - usually not exceeding 50 mA.  Speaking specifically about the classification of CREE products, the lights belonging to the Xlamp group are classified into the following main varieties: XR, XP, MC. </p><p>  They are marked, in turn, by the same designations. </p><p>  It can be noted that they are all SMD LEDs.  Labeling that would reflect this fact may not apply in this case, since there is no product in the corresponding line that does not meet this criterion.  Depending on the specific crystal, the marking of these types of LEDs can be supplemented by the letters C or E. </p><p>  In turn, LEDs, classified as superbright, are divided into groups that differ mainly in design options.  So, the company produces products that are labeled as P4 - they <span>have a square section and 4 leads.</span>  <span>LEDs adapted for surface mounting are grouped by the manufacturer in the</span> PLCC <span>category</span> . </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So, we examined what constitutes the defining parameters of such products as marking-characteristic LEDs.  Their connection, size, operating conditions, security and many other parameters can be indicated using the relevant information.  The generally accepted classification of LEDs in the global industry is not approved.  Which, however, can be quite logical based on the fact that these products are used in a wide range of industries. </p><p>  At the same time, in certain areas in which LEDs are used, their marking-characteristic can be unified.  For example, this concerns the production of LED strips.  Using a unified labeling code, consisting of 8 elements, the user can determine the key parameters of the purchased product. </p><p>  But in many cases, to obtain reliable information about LEDs, you have to use only the classification and labeling that are developed by a particular brand manufacturer.  They can be either similar to those that characterize the approaches of competing corporations, or completely unique. </p><p>  In many cases, the classification criterion for LEDs may be not so much their characteristics as an independent product, but the parameters of the final product in which they are installed.  For example, according to such principles, products used in the design of car headlights can be classified - from the point of view of the most useful for the end user applicability of LED marking.  However, out of the context of the final product, the classification and, as a consequence, the labeling of LEDs can be carried out according to completely different principles. </p>
