    <h2>  Start </h2><p>  For the first time, it was necessary to think about the creation of new troops in the difficult and turbulent period of our history - in the Time of Troubles, seared by the terrible threat of a foreign invasion.  During this period of contention, foreign legionaries were hired by militia units to fight the <span>Polish army.</span>  It was then that Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky, genuinely struck by the coordinated competent actions of the Swedish infantry, stubbornly reflecting the attacks of the Polish hussars, decided to organize an army according to the foreign model - the Dutch and Swedish.  The regiments of the new system, which basically consisted of peasant militias, were assembled in Novgorod and totaled 18 thousand people.  The Belgian Christier Somme taught them the proper use of weapons, focusing on the tactics of fighting the cavalry, in which a number of pikemen covered the musketeers with the beeper - the main weapon of the time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First successes </h2><p>  Even hastily trained, the regiments of the new system in September 1609 won several significant victories over the Poles: they broke through the blockade of Moscow and returned several cities, pushing the invaders back.  But the Time of Troubles made adjustments to further events.  After the poisoning of Skopin-Shuysky army scattered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regiments of the new system under Alexei Mikhailovich" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/430857.jpg" width="600"></div>  Thus ended the trial successful organization of regiments according to a foreign model.

    <h2>  Second attempt </h2><p>  The strategic need for the return of Smolensk, given to the Poles, and the revival of a strong combat-ready army was another impetus for the creation of new regiments in 1630.  The Swedish and Dutch specialists who embarked on this difficult matter by the end of 1631 formed 2 regiments, each of which had 1,600 people.  Initially, the acquisition of regiments was planned to be made from children of stateless boyars, but they were not interested in the infantry service, and it was decided to accept Cossacks and children of archers in the army. </p><p>  The command of the regiments was carried out mainly by foreign initial people.  Each regiment, consisting of 8 companies, was under the control of a colonel, lieutenant colonel, major and five captains.  There were 200 soldiers in the company, of which 120 were musketeers and 80 were pikemen.  <span>The number of regiments</span> grew rapidly: by the beginning of 1632 there were already 6 (9 thousand people). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From the middle of 1632, the creation of the first Reiters regiment of boyar and noble children began, the number of which by the end of the year had grown to 1721 people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regiments of a new system it" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/430660.jpg" width="422"></div>  In its composition, a dragoon company was first organized, and soon a separate dragoon regiment consisting of 12 companies was formed.  Regiments of the new system in the period 1632-1634.  constituted the backbone of the army, 10 combat-ready units of 17 thousand people were created.  They boldly fought, were brave and desperate, heroically showing themselves in battles with superior enemy forces, but Russia could not win the war.  And at the end of hostilities, the regiments of the new system were dissolved.  The second attempt to organize troops was also only half successful.

    <h2>  Third stage </h2><p>  After several years, in 1638, the government resumed the formation of new units to protect the borders of southern Russia.  The royalist and British general Thomas Daleil led the preparation of troops located in the Novgorod rank. </p><p>  The formation of the regiments led to the compulsory recruitment of affluent people who served from spring to autumn, and for the winter they went home.  This practice did not justify itself: the lack of training associated with long vacations affected.  Therefore, in the years 1643-1648, some southern villages and villages were nationalized, and the peasants were recorded as dragoons. </p><h2>  Military reform of Aleksey Mikhailovich </h2>

    <p>  The middle of the 17th century in Russia was marked by an extremely important event for the country - by decree of <span>Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich</span> , a radical reform of the army began: the strengthening of the best parts of the old system - the elite Moscow local cavalry, Moscow archers and gunners, as well as the creation of military units in the likeness of those who had already shown their military skill regiments. </p><p>  In the conditions of the Russian-Polish war of 1654-1667.  it was these formations that became the strong foundation of the country's armed forces.  The regiments of the new system under Alexei Mikhailovich are soldier and dragoon units, composed of affluent people recruited for life service.  State duty was introduced. </p><p>  Reytarsky regiments were formed not only from subsistence, but also from impoverished or homeless noblemen, Cossack and <span>boyar children.</span>  Hundreds of noblemen in full force were transferred to the ranger system.  A strategically important move was the separation of equestrian spearmen - a hussar from the composition of the reiter.  The Swedish experience in conducting military operations and equipping a warrior was immensely useful, the similarity of Russian and Swedish cavalry affected.  The impeccable training and excellent equipment of the hussars favorably distinguished these compounds among the Russian cavalry. </p><h2>  Pride of Russia </h2><p>  Shelves of the new building in ser.  17th century  formed under the leadership of well-trained officers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regiments of the new system in ser 17v formed" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/430866.jpg" width="404"></div>  During the war, at least one hundred thousand soldiers were recruited and trained, who proved the viability of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such military formations.  By the end of the century, the regiments of the new system are already the best part of the troops, which later formed the basis of the regular victorious Russian army.
