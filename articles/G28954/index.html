And the further they are, the less known.  But this does not apply to Izhevsk - the capital of the Udmurt Republic.  Although it is located at a distance of almost one thousand kilometers from the main city of the state, its defense and engineering production reminds of itself.  In addition, Izhevsk is the ‚Äúarms capital‚Äù of Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="usadba18.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Nearest Manor&quot; - a cottage village in Izhevsk" class="if uuid-2265116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2265116.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit about the city </h2><p>  Almost on the banks of one of the most famous large rivers, the Kama, Izhevsk is located.  The city itself also has a huge reservoir - Izhevsk Pond.  And around - forests and mountains.  That is what Izhevsk is. </p><p>  But this is not his main advantage.  The whole world knows about the production of high-quality steels, weapons and military equipment.  In addition, there are many more manufacturing processing enterprises, a developed network of trade, which together allows you to keep unemployment at a minimum level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="izhevsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House in the cottage village &quot;Middle Manor&quot;" class="if uuid-2265118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2265118.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the remoteness and inaccessibility of the city, its population has been growing steadily for over seven years.  And this means there is a constant demand for residential real estate and a special perspective of developers.  Due to such a large number of industrial enterprises, many citizens prefer to move from urban housing to fresh air, to cottage villages.  One of these is the "Near Homestead" - a cottage village in Izhevsk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The location of the village and transport accessibility </h2><p>  At a distance of about 11 kilometers from the city center, only two kilometers from its border, in the southern direction along the Sarapulsky tract, beyond the village of Stary Chultem, the described village is located.  The project ‚ÄúNear Homestead‚Äù, a cottage village in Izhevsk, was launched in early 2012.  Over the past 5 years, almost all allocated land plots have been built up, residents are constantly living in them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="izhevsk.1gs.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Two-storey house" class="if uuid-2265119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2265119.jpg"></div><p>  Getting to the village is not difficult, either on personal vehicles or on public transport.  Three bus routes run daily from the Southern bus station in the indicated direction.  The road does not take much time, given the proximity to the city. </p><h2>  Description of the cottage village </h2><p>  What is a cottage village in Izhevsk "Middle Manor"?  These are more than 170 land plots of the right rectangular shape, several streets, all the necessary communications.  Each plot has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã8 to 17 acres.  You can purchase it with or without a construction contract and build your own home. </p><h2>  Houses in the village </h2><p>  If it is chosen in a row, the developer offers several house designs, different in size and layout.  They can be either one-story or two-story.  The smallest projects are 96 square meters.  They consist of a combined kitchen-living room and three bedrooms.  There are more spacious projects.  You can also order your own project. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="izhevsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Newly built house" class="if uuid-2265121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2265121.jpg"></div><p>  All houses are built of ceramic and aerated concrete blocks, roofs are covered with metal tiles.  The windows are glazed with five-chamber PVC profiles with two-chamber double-glazed windows.  The developer of the cottage village "Near Homestead" in Izhevsk, for the convenience of its residents, performs installation and wiring of internal communications in the house, and mounts suspended ceilings. </p><h2>  The cost of land </h2><p>  Depending on the location of the plot, the price of a house in the cottage village "Near Homestead" in Izhevsk can vary from 57 to 70 thousand rubles per one hundred square meters of land.  This cost includes all utilities, paved roads.  In addition, the developer provides services and assistance in obtaining permits for the construction of a residential building.  When paying, you can immediately pay the full full cost of the plot, you can use the proposed installment plan or arrange a bank loan mortgage. </p><h2>  Internal and external infrastructure </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.8547543" data-lng="53.21037100000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/0/4/804.png"></div><p>  If we talk about the village "Middle Manor" as a residential complex, then the developer tried to provide for the construction of all the necessary social infrastructure for a comfortable life.  Since it is located at some distance from the city, it is more comfortable for its residents to purchase the necessary products and things without having to leave the territory of the complex.  To do this, the village has a shop, cafe, kindergarten, children's playgrounds and sports grounds.  For management and security, an administrative building was built where the management company is located.  All streets are lit.  A special guest parking is provided for guests. </p><h2>  Reviews about the village </h2><p>  The developer of the residential complex in Izhevsk, LLC Nezhnaya Usadba, collected only positive reviews on the Web.  You can see many photos in which the joyful residents of the village cheerfully celebrate Maslenitsa and the New Year, plant a memory alley.  Built houses are already inhabited and equipped.  Those who are fortunate enough to acquire a land plot in this village enjoy life in the fresh air, watching the children play in new playgrounds. </p>
