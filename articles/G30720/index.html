    <p>  The obligation to calculate the value of property on the balance sheet is legally established to ensure large transactions for the sale of assets.  To establish the size of the transaction, the book value of assets (this is the line of balance sheet 1600) is compared with the value of property sold under the contract.  Exceeding the amount of property sold in the amount of 25% of the total assets on the balance sheet gives the transaction a large status, which means that such agreements must be approved by the meeting of shareholders.  In addition, users of financial statements, such as insurers, investors or founders, are entitled to request any information, and its provision is the responsibility of the company.  It is for these purposes that a special document is drawn up - a certificate of the carrying amount of assets, which is filled out on the basis of the specified calculation formula. </p><h2>  Calculation Example </h2><p>  In the balance sheet values ‚Äã‚Äãof indicators are indicated at the beginning of the reporting period and its end.  Based on the presented balance sheet, we will determine the value of assets (in thousand rubles) and analyze their dynamics for the year. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><caption>  <em>The initial data of the first two sections of the form BO-1 and the analysis of their changes</em> </caption><tbody><tr><td>  <em>Indicator</em> </td><td>  <em>line</em> </td><td>  <em>as of December 31, 2014</em> </td><td>  <em>as of December 31, 2015</em> </td><td><p>  <em>changes</em> </p><p>  <em>absolute</em> </p></td><td>  <em>growth rate in%</em> </td></tr><tr><td>  Fixed assets: </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Intangible assets </td><td>  1110 </td><td>  54 </td><td>  42 </td><td>  -42 </td><td>  -22.2 </td></tr><tr><td>  OS </td><td>  1150 </td><td>  568000 </td><td>  653,000 </td><td>  +85000 </td><td>  +15.0 </td></tr><tr><td>  Total 1 </td><td>  1100 </td><td>  568054 </td><td>  653042 </td><td>  +84 988 </td><td>  +15.0 </td></tr><tr><td>  Current assets </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  productive reserves </td><td>  1210 </td><td>  3955 </td><td>  5452 </td><td>  +1497 </td><td>  +37.9 </td></tr><tr><td>  accounts receivable </td><td>  1230 </td><td>  325 </td><td>  451 </td><td>  +126 </td><td>  +38.7 </td></tr><tr><td>  cash </td><td>  1250 </td><td>  1851 </td><td>  2985 </td><td>  +1134 </td><td>  +61.0 </td></tr><tr><td>  Total 2 section </td><td></td><td>  6131 </td><td>  8888 </td><td>  +2757 </td><td>  +45.0 </td></tr><tr><td>  BALANCE </td><td></td><td>  574185 </td><td>  661930 </td><td>  +87745 </td><td>  +15.3 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  From the formula already included in the balance sheet, it follows: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ total indicators for line 1100, combining positions that demonstrate the presence of fixed assets (p. 1150) and intangible assets (p. 1110), at the beginning of the reporting year amounted to 568 054 rubles.

(3 955 + 325 + 1 851), at the end of the period - 8 888 rubles.  (5,452 + 451 + 2,985); </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ the results of the 1st and 2nd sections are combined as a result of the balance sheet asset, that is, as of 31.12.  2015 the book value of assets (this is the line of balance of 1600) amounted to 661 930 rubles.  (653 042 + 8 888), and at the end of 2014 it was 574 185 rubles, i.e. 658 054 + 6 131. </p><h2>  Analyst Conclusions </h2><p>  When comparing the absolute values ‚Äã‚Äãobtained, the economist is given the opportunity to analyze the condition of the assets, see the tendency to increase or decrease the total availability of property, and by its categories give an assessment of the actual situation with the assets of the company on a certain date. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="1200 current assets" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1644557.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  So, according to the presented balance, the economist calculates the changes in the values ‚Äã‚Äãof each line, comparing the indicators at the beginning and end of the year.  In the given example, the cost: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ intangible assets decreased by 12 thousand rubles; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ fixed assets increased by 85,000 rubles; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ inventories increased by 1497 rubles; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ accounts receivable increased by 126 thousand rubles; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ cash increased by 1134 rubles. </p><p>  According to these data, one can judge a very confident increase in the value of the company's property for 2015: an increase in fixed assets indicates the acquisition of some fixed assets, a decrease in intangible assets was the result of the write-off of accrued depreciation, since in the 1st section the book value of assets is the residual value. </p><p>  For all groups of working capital, there is also an increase in line values, which indicates the expansion of production and a noticeable increase in marketing activity, with the availability of inventories increasing by 37.9%, and cash - by 61%.  This means that sales growth is outpacing the growth of inventories.  Therefore, the company pursues a competent policy to search for markets and increase sales. </p><h2>  Analysis of accounts receivable balance sheet </h2><p>  Separately analyze the status of receivables.  The absolute value of this indicator increased 126 thousand rubles, the growth rate by the beginning of the year was 38.7%.  However, one cannot confidently talk about the undoubted growth of this indicator.  Given the growth of stocks at almost the same pace (37.9%), and the increase in the monetary component by 61%, we can judge the stability of this value and the absence of an increase in debts, because in the total value of assets the share of debt of debtors remained at the level of the beginning of the year - 0, 06%: </p><p>  325/574 185 * 100% = 0.056% at the beginning of the year, </p><p>  451/661 930 * 100% = 0.068% at the end of the year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="1100 non-current assets" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1644558.jpg" width="595"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Such a calculation is necessary because accounts receivable, being an asset, nevertheless divert funds from production turnover and require mandatory control of the dynamics of changes, i.e., timely collection of debts.  In our example, the absence of its increase against the background of a general increase in assets is a very positive sign of the financial health of the organization.  The total book value of assets (this is the line of balance of 1600) increased over the year by 87,745 rubles, or by 15.3%. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  For a more detailed analysis of indicators, the economist uses many calculated coefficients.  We in this article tried to tell not only how to fill out the balance sheet and calculate the amount of assets on it, but also tried to see the analytical picture behind the dry numbers of line-by-line values ‚Äã‚Äãof this accounting form. </p>
