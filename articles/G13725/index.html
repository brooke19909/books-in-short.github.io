But political consulting is not only consulting, but also the use of certain technologies to ensure the successful conduct of actions, elections, and other campaigns.  Some political scientists link the work of political consultants with the organizers of PR campaigns, others with the activities of professionals related to election technologies, and others with the help of politicians already in power in their activities. </p><p>  The activities of a modern politician are becoming more and more complicated every year.  He should be a good analyst, excellent speaker, have a positive image, have charisma, be a skilled diplomat, be able to manage public opinion, analyze the actions of competitors, conduct public events at a high level, effectively interact with public, political, administrative, economic structures and so on .  Naturally, one cannot do all this alone;  We need a close-knit team and political consulting. </p><p>  The first political consultants appeared, apparently, when the first politicians appeared who needed assistants and advisers.  Each politician needs expert judgment and professional advice.  But modern politics needs not just competent advice, but scientific recommendations based on objective methods of cognition that he can get from professional political consultants who have at their disposal effective tools in the form of modern political technologies to achieve specific goals. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, political consulting in Russia has not yet reached the level that exists in the West.  In this specific market there are many incompetent specialists from related <span>fields of activity:</span> journalists, philosophers, cultural <span>experts, advertising specialists</span> , etc.  High-level specialists are needed - sociologists, psychologists, image makers, speechwriters and others, each competent in their field of knowledge. </p><p>  Political consulting can be divided into the following <span>types of work</span> : </p><ul><li>  election consulting; </li><li>  analysis of political processes, training and professional development of politicians; </li><li>  image formation and maintenance; </li><li>  social and psychological counseling; </li><li>  "Promotion" politics and others. </li></ul><p>  In addition, counseling can be carried out in the areas of improving political programs, educating politicians on effective methods of positive public relations, and substantiating political innovations. </p><p>  Political consulting is an area of ‚Äã‚Äãconsulting work related to accurate scientific analysis, <span>forecasting of a political</span> object and issuing high-quality recommendations <span>to political actors</span> . </p><p>  Let's consider some models of political consulting: </p><ol><li>  Counseling, as a rule, is one-time, which takes place on small issues that do not have a significant impact on the political process, the activities of a leader or a <span>political organization.</span> </li><li>  Counseling, often long-term, which takes place under a contract concluded for two to three years.  In this case, a long-term cooperation program is developed on a problem of interest to the client;  during the entire duration of the program the customer is consulted. </li><li>  Consultation in a group, which is carried out at the same time as two or more employees of the organization that seeks consulting assistance. </li><li>  Individual counseling aims at teaching one client the techniques and methods of political activity. </li></ol>
