    <p>  The DVR of this brand has a built-in radar, and an updated version of the model will be released by the summer of this year.  Thanks to the device, almost all traffic police radars are detected, including Strelka.  The Full HD shooting system provides excellent shooting day and night, while the viewing angle is 140 degrees.  The device has a convenient mount on the suction cup, so it can be rotated in any direction.  Inspector marlin <strong> </strong>  made in Korea, which indicates the high quality of products.  100% detection of cameras and radars is provided due to the presence of GPS.  Recording is carried out cyclically in a circle, there are no gaps, respectively, if necessary, you will receive a full-fledged video recording without interruptions.  It has a device and a color display on which you can watch the video. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Key Benefits </h2><p>  Many people consider the Inspector Marlin anti-radar to be one of the best in the line of analogs.  Firstly, in comparison with other similar devices, this model shows excellent shooting performance in the daytime and at night.  Secondly, it is based on the Ambarella A5S processor, so the video stream is processed quickly and efficiently.  Thirdly, the DVR is equipped with a highly sensitive Aptina sensor, which is built into the popular brands of mobile technology. </p><p>  An important factor is that the recording is continuous, while the old fragments are deleted, and new clips are recorded instead.  This is very convenient because you do not have to worry about erasing records from a memory card: Inspector Marlin will <strong> </strong>  function reliably and stably!  By the way, a wide viewing angle (recall, it is 140 degrees) is the guarantee that everything that is needed will fall into the frame: cars in the next row, and road signs, and sidewalks.  The built-in display allows you to watch videos without leaving your car. </p>

    <h2>  How does the radar work? </h2><p>  Very often, hybrid devices, that is, combining the functions of different devices, are expressed unflattering.  A model Inspector Marlin reviews <strong> </strong>  received exceptionally positive.  Firstly, it easily detects all types of radars, <span>speed meters</span> and Strelka cameras.  Secondly, the detection is carried out in different ways - both by the radar part of the device and by the database, in which the coordinates of various cameras are entered in advance.  Thirdly, the user himself can add new cameras to the database.  How does the Inspector Marlin radar detector work: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  The radar clearly defines the location of the cameras at a distance of 900 meters. </li><li>  If the signal is not caught due to vehicles in front, the detection will be based on the GPS base. </li><li>  Information about an approaching camera or meter will be displayed on the display, as well as duplicated by a voice notification in Russian. </li></ol><p>  Thus, the driver can only respond on time to the signal and take appropriate measures. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Firstly, it is immediately worth noting the production of a DVR based on a powerful Ambarella A5S processor.  Secondly, the camera is highly sensitive, due to which the video quality wins.  Thirdly, and this is a very important factor, thanks to which the Inspector Marlin reviews are so positive: the radar detector and the video recorder work simultaneously in it.  Fourthly, the device has a GPS base, which can always be updated. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of Hybrid Radars </h2><p>  Most motorists agree that hybrid devices for the car are not the best, because they work unstably.  However, the modern market for various devices for cars shows that just such models are most in demand by customers.  What are the reasons for such diverse opinions?  Buying each device individually is good in that you can choose specific models that you like by technical parameters.  Each device will have its own functional features and will be of high quality, but there is one essential thing: such a purchase will cost a lot.  In addition, your car will simply be oversaturated with various wires, lotions and suction cups, which will be distracting and even annoying along the way. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  At the same time, hybrids, for example, Inspector Marlin, reviews <strong> </strong>  get good ones.  Firstly, this is a compact solution, since several functions are combined in one device, and therefore you will not have to spoil the appearance of the cabin.  Secondly, the purchase of such a product will be cheaper.  But you can not do without minuses: if the hybrid device breaks, then all systems will fail immediately.  In addition, it is possible that the radar detector will work better than the DVR, and vice versa. </p><h2>  Is it necessary? </h2>

    <p>  Today, without a variety of car devices, it is difficult to imagine a modern car.  Are they needed, as it seems?  And what are the functions of such devices?

With the help of the radar, the driver will be timely warned about police cameras recording the speed of vehicles.  That is, if you want to drive the car as conveniently and safely as possible, then it‚Äôs still worth installing such devices in your car. </p>

    <h2>  What do consumers say? </h2><p>  About the DVR Inspector Marlin reviews are mostly positive.  Many attribute this to the fact that hybrid devices are simpler to maintain and economical, so most people prefer these very profitable solutions.  Drivers note the convenience of fixing the device due to the bracket with a suction cup: it allows you to fix the DVR in any position, while the mount will be reliable.  There is a special platform on the mount, which can be easily unscrewed if the device needs to be removed. </p><p>  Appreciated by users and the appearance of the device.  As users note, the Inspector Marlin looks stylish, high-quality and worthy of any car.  There are no complaints about the reliability of the device: all the parts are firmly fixed, everything is in its place, the parts are adjusted to each other.  All this, combined with an excellent thoughtful design, makes the Inspector Marlin indispensable for a modern car. </p><h2>  Operating modes and menu style </h2><p>  The device can operate in several modes: ‚Äúcity‚Äù and ‚Äúhighway‚Äù, while both radar and video recorder work simultaneously.  If necessary, you can configure the device so that one thing works.  The device is compact, ascetic, while it works stably and is easy to control.  The device works in all ranges of Russia, while all stationary radars are already included in the database.  However, for Inspector Marlin, updates are released monthly, so you can always update your database. </p><p>  When operating in the ‚ÄúRoute‚Äù and ‚ÄúCity‚Äù modes, you can set separate speed limits so that the device does not make sounds, but at the same time transfers all important information to the display.  Thanks to the built-in battery, the DVR can work offline, however, only 10 minutes. </p>

    <h2>  What is the result? </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that the Inspector Marlin model was introduced six months ago, in December 2013, and in such a short period of time has become one of the favorite Russian drivers.  True, many noted that this or that software is missing.  But the company has enough time for improvement, and updates are released stably every month.  Therefore, you don‚Äôt have to worry that over time all the shortcomings will be eliminated, and additional functions will be added to the device.  Inspector Marlin is a device for those who value compactness, novelty and modern solutions coupled with efficiency. </p><p>  In addition, you should think carefully about what to purchase: a hybrid device that will perform several functions, or a specific model of a DVR or a radar detector.  A variety of models and additional options will help in choosing any motorist. </p>
