Even without making large capital investments and without spending a huge amount on the services of a landscape designer, you can beautifully decorate flowerbeds or paths of your garden from waste material. </p><p>  As a material for creativity, you can use unnecessary cut wood, used plastic bottles and corks from them, foam plastic material is useful.  It is advisable not to throw out the old wheels from the car, but to convert them into a minipond or a flowerbed on the site.  If you don‚Äôt have old tires, don‚Äôt be upset either, at any tire fitting you will be given unnecessary tires in the required quantity. </p><p>  The article presents several garden crafts from the listed materials with detailed instructions for their manufacture.  And perhaps after reading the material you will have your own ideas, because making with your own hands is a creative and interesting process. </p><h2>  Flowerpot from tires </h2><p>  Carved flowerpots for planting flowers can be made in the courtyard of a private house or at the entrance to the garden.  It will take old tires, a sharp knife and a strong man.  I would like to warn right away that this is not an easy matter, because in order to cut, and even more so turn the rubber to the wrong side, you will have to try, because it is very dense.  But in principle, any strong man will easily perform such a task. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flowerbed of old tires" class="if uuid-2273116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2273116.jpg"></div><p>  The slice is made in the form of isosceles triangles, try to ensure that all corners are the same size.  Before work, you can mark the tire with a marker so that everything works out correctly.  As you can see in the step-by-step instructions in the photo, the turned tire can simply be put on the ground, a stand can be made from the cut-off part, or, in general, it can be hung from braided ropes on a hook.  It all depends on the desire and size of the wheels.  After manufacturing, the container is painted in the desired color, covered with earth.  Everything, garden crafts are ready!  You can plant flowers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Flower train </h2><p>  From old wooden boxes it is possible to easily arrange the next version of the flowerbed.  For such a garden craft, it‚Äôs enough to pick up the tree cuts for the wheels and attach the driver‚Äôs cab element to the first trailer.  Tree saw cuts must first be cleaned with sandpaper, coated with varnish and painted 2 times.  After the first painting, they again need to be cleaned with sandpaper.  Wheels are attached to painted boxes on screws or bolts, if desired. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Box locomotive" class="if uuid-2273119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2273119.jpg"></div><p>  For the driver‚Äôs cab, you need to turn the box vertically and make a roof of moisture-proof plywood and insert partitions into the side parts.  As a pipe of a steam locomotive, old tin cans painted in the same color are used. </p><p>  As you can see, labor efforts to make such a garden craft will not go much, and such a structure will look spectacular on the site. </p><h2>  Married couple made of wood </h2><p>  If you have cut nearby poplar trees, then hurry up to get more thick branches.  As firewood for heating the stove, poplar wood is of no interest, but as a garden craft made of wood, it is quite suitable.  Using your imagination and saw, you can cut out the details of such a sculpture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pair of wood" class="if uuid-2273183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2273183.jpg"></div><p>  This couple can stand in the middle of the garden and act as a garden scarecrow.  Indeed, for birds, they will be so like people.  They can be dressed up in old things, then uninvited guests will think that the owners are on the garden site. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The parts of the composition are fastened together with simple nails or screws.  From thin branches the eyes, nose and ears of the heroes are cut.  So that the figures do not fall from the wind, they can be put on a concrete "sole". </p><h2>  Figures of fairy-tale heroes made of polystyrene foam </h2><p>  Fans of fairy tales and garden crafts with their own hands can carve sculptures of gnomes from a piece of polystyrene foam, or, in extreme cases, mushrooms.  Even without the skills of a sculptor, mushrooms are easy to make.  For work, it is advisable to take dense material that will not crumble into large balls. </p><p>  Separately, you can cut the hat and leg of the mushroom.  Then each part is leveled with gypsum putty and painted with acrylics.  Polyfoam is glued together with a glue gun or Crystal clear glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gardenfun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Styrofoam Figures" class="if uuid-2273099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2273099.jpg"></div><p>  Polyfoam perfectly attaches to concrete.  If you want to put them on the ground, then you can make such a stand, as in the photo above, and just stick the pipe into the ground.  To make the figure shine, it can be opened with a layer of acrylic varnish. </p><h2>  Birds from the lids </h2><p>  If you have a lot of caps from plastic bottles gathered in your household, then you can make funny birds as crafts on the garden plot.  Moisture-resistant plywood is taken as a basis, from which the shape of birds is cut out with a jigsaw.  Then the surface is coated with acrylic paints.  The beak is painted with yellow paint, the wing is red, and the body is blue.  You can come up with your own version.  It all depends on the imagination of the master. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hsbstore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Funny birds from the covers" class="if uuid-2276267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2276267.jpg"></div><p>  The paws are made of thin knitting wire, which can be wrapped with pliers around a screw that is screwed on the back of the craft.  Then the work is carried out with the selection of covers of the desired color.  They are screwed to the base with a screwdriver.  You can use glue.  It is beautiful to put such original birds both in the garden and in the front garden in front of the house, simply by sticking the wire into the ground. </p><h2>  Picture on the wall </h2><p>  Often on the garden plot there are additional outbuildings.  It can be a barn or a workshop, a toilet or an outdoor shower.  So that they look not corny painted, you can draw a picture on the wall of the building with the help of covers.  Such a DIY garden craft with a photo is presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crafts from the Lids" class="if uuid-2273129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2273129.jpg"></div><p>  You will need a plastic bottle, painted like a vase, cocktail tubes, wine corks and plastic bottle caps, matched by color.  As leaves, you can use either pieces cut from a plastic bottle or felt material, as in the photo in the article. </p><p>  Wine corks are cut into small cylinders and painted in different colors.  From the plastic covers of the same color, for example, yellow, the petals of the flower are formed, and from red - the middle, and vice versa.  Each part is glued to a metal structure on liquid nails. </p><p>  If you have a small child in your house, then flowers can be replaced with any figurine of a fairy-tale character, cartoon character or animal.  Such a design of the utility rooms will please the eye even in winter cold. </p><h2>  Ladybugs made of stones </h2><p>  If you went to relax at sea in the summer, then do not forget to bring sea round stones as a souvenir to decorate your garden crafts with your own hands.  A few pieces are enough to decorate with bright figures a flower bed or flower garden in the country or on the garden plot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.morgansmithbaritone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stone bugs" class="if uuid-2276272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2276272.jpg"></div><p>  Choose stones of different sizes, but they should all be flat and wide, as in the photo.  They are covered with acrylic paint.  The drawing is quite simple, so that any housewife can do it.  To insects beautifully shone, after drying the paint, you can also cover the stones with acrylic varnish.  It is enough to complete the drawing on one side, it will be more economical, because the other part of the stone lies on the ground and is not visible. </p><h2>  "Cups" on the site </h2><p>  From old tires of different sizes, you can make original flower beds in the shape of cups.  The lower wheel remains unchanged, painted in any color as desired.  The upper wheel must be cut in a circle on one side.  The cut off circle is not thrown away, but is used as a saucer.  He is also painted and put on the very bottom of the flowerbed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flowerbed &quot;Cup&quot;" class="if uuid-2273123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2273123.jpg"></div><p>  Between themselves, the structural parts are bolted together.  To make the flowerbed look like a cup with a handle, you need to use either a piece of rubber hose, which can always be found on the territory of the household, or cut off the strip from the additional wheel. </p><p>  After making and painting, a layer of earth is poured and flowers sit down.  If you do not want to pour a large amount of soil into such a high flower bed, you can insert a circle cut from moisture-proof plywood between the first and second wheels.  Then the bottom of the flower bed will be empty, and the earth will be poured only from above. </p><h2>  Interesting tire ideas </h2><p>  Old tires can be used in different ways.  Looks nice fence made of half-buried wheels.  They can be painted in different colors and enclose the garden from the yard or garden. </p><p>  From old tires you can make not only flowerbeds of different shapes, but also garden figures of animals and fairy-tale characters: bear, sun, hare, turtles, etc. </p><p>  If you cut the sides of the tires into strips, you can create a swan with wings, a rooster or a peacock.  Additional elements are cut out of plywood with a jigsaw. </p><p>  For a child, you can make a car or a tricycle by adding a steering wheel and seat to the wheels buried in the ground.  You can also make a swing out of tires by attaching strong ropes to it.  From a large wheel it‚Äôs good to make a bright sandbox by adding paws and a head, for example, a turtle. </p><p>  There are craftsmen who come up with furniture from old tires.  If you twist together two wheels with bolts and attach a plywood tabletop, then there will be a table on the veranda.  In the same way, you can make stools, and even chairs with a back. </p><h2>  Empty Bottle Furniture </h2><p>  Folk craftsmen also create furniture from empty plastic bottles.  For a whole year, you can collect a large number of them.  If you tape together several bottles assembled in a circle, you can make an ottoman.  To do this, corrugated cardboard is attached to the top and bottom, two layers can be made so that the lids on the bottles do not push it.  A circle from a sheet of foam rubber is cut out on the upper part for softness of the seat.  Then a cover is made of any dense material.  That's it, the ottoman is ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="hsbstore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Furniture made of plastic bottles" class="if uuid-2273222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2273222.jpg"></div><p>  In the same way, you can create both a bed and a comfortable chair.  It will be very light, so that in good weather it can be taken out to fresh air and sit on the garden plot with comfort. </p><p>  Also, garden crafts made of plastic bottles can be animal figures, of which by cutting the desired shape you can make vases for flowers and containers for seedlings.  Having put on the site a weather vane made of a plastic bottle, you will always know how strong the wind is on the street. </p><p>  It‚Äôs easy to create crafts from improvised material, you only need to come up with your own version and prepare material for the composition in advance.  The article provides many examples of garden crafts with photos.  The choice is yours!  Good luck in your work! </p>
