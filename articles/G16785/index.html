Monetary units with such a denomination were issued in large quantities that year, therefore they are not of special value.  The only rare instance is a coin with ledges on the obverse.  Today we will understand the varieties, characteristics, detailed description and cost of various copies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 kopecks" class="if uuid-3176787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3176787.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  A coin of 10 kopecks was produced in 1984 by the Leningrad Mint.  There is no exact data on the number of units issued.  All that is known is that it was a mass circulation.  There is also evidence that the monetary units were not only in circulation and were present in large numbers in the citizens' wallet, but were also found in special annual sets made for the state bank. </p><p>  Coins were made from the alloy popular at that time - nickel silver.  This is a combination of nickel, copper and zinc.  Weighed a little over 1.6 grams.  They have no magnetic characteristics and properties.  There is a protruding edging on both sides. </p><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  The central part of 10 kopecks in 1984 is the emblem of the Soviet Union.  In the middle is the image of planet Earth.  A sickle and a hammer cross against its background.  A little lower is the sun, from which long rays emanate towards the planet.  From the North Pole, where the ears of wheat meet, a star is located.  Sheaves of wheat are the frame of the central image.  They are bundled using tape.  Only fifteen tape bindings.  Each turn of the tape symbolizes a union republic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the left and right side of the star are the axes of the ears.  There is no step.  If you look closely at the top of the central spike, which is on the left side, you will notice that there is a small spine.  She goes straight to one of the rays of the star.  At the bottom of the coin disk is the abbreviation of the USSR.  The letters are minted strictly horizontally in print. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.numista.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 kopecks 1984" class="if uuid-3176793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3176793.jpg"></div><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  Almost the entire upper part of 10 kopecks in 1984 is occupied by a figure denoting the face value of the coin.  Ten is printed from the top edge to the center of the coin disc.  Under the numbers is the inscription "cents", showing the letter designation of the face value. </p><p>  At the very bottom is the year of minting of monetary units.  The letters are large and occupy a large half of the lower part.  Rotary angles are smoothed.  Framing the composition (left and right) ears of wheat directed upwards.  Each ear originates from oak leaves.  There are two of them.  On the right, in the upper part of the ears, the number "0" ends in the middle, and on the left, at the beginning of the number "1". </p><h2>  Improved coinage </h2><p>  As we have already said, the coin of 10 kopecks in 1984 is not of special value to collectors.  However, there is a variation called improved coinage, and costs a lot more than standard coins.  Very rarely, monetary units come across in the ordinary turnover.  They are mainly found in special kits manufactured for the USSR State Bank.  An old-style stamp was used for production. </p><p>  If you look closely at the obverse of a coin of 10 kopeks 1984, you can see that the longest ear on the left side has no spine.  The right side of the image also has differences.  There is a ledge formed by the tips of the ears.  The reverse on such a coin corresponds to standard coinage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coins.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin 10 kopecks" class="if uuid-3176796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3176796.jpg"></div><h2>  Marriages </h2><p>  There are several options for defective coins that have been on sale in recent years: </p><ul><li>  Stamp split. </li><li>  Shift obverse. </li><li>  Incomplete printing of the image in the region of "0". </li><li>  Turns in different directions. </li><li>  Crack blanks. </li></ul><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Coins of standard coinage will cost from 3 to 25 rubles.  Slightly more expensive is the price of coins of improved minting - from 540 to 1400 rubles.  Defective are the most expensive.  Their price varies from 1000 to 2600 rubles. </p>
