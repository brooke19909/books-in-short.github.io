Since the city is small, the flow of tourists is not impressive in its quantity.  However, there are attractions in Stupino that may interest and surprise. </p><h2>  General information about the city </h2><p>  A small town located in the Moscow region - Stupino, whose sights are mostly devoted to aviation, is a large industrial center.  The city has a large number of factories working for the country's military-industrial complex.  There are also foreign companies here. </p><p>  Stupino is constantly evolving, but the echoes of the Soviet era, when the city was still closed, remained.  Everything seems to be clean and in order, but there is no proper service. </p><p>  The city has interesting historical facts.  For example, in 1931, orders were given to build an electric locomotive factory, which was supposed to be located five kilometers from Stupino.  This played a significant role in the life of the future city.  Three years later, the village of Stupino turns into a village called "Electric Locomotive". </p><p>  Four years later, the village was gone, because the construction of the plant was stopped.  However, the working locals, as well as the engineers, did not like it, and they reached out to Stalin.  After which it was decided to finish the construction of the plant, but now he specialized in the production of training aircraft, propellers and turbochargers.  In 1938, the village acquired the status of a city and returned to its former name - Stupino. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Popular Attractions Stupino </h2><p>  If you visit the city, as well as look at its sights, it is very noticeable that aviation equipment was created here.  However, there are not only monuments to workers and aircraft, but also other interesting places.  Therefore, we offer to consider the main attractions of Stupino with a photo and description. </p><h2>  Trinity Belopesotsky Monastery </h2><p>  The monastery is located in the vicinity of the city, on the banks of the Oka River.  Its foundation dates back to the 15th century, and Vladimir Belopesotsky did it. </p><p>  Initially, men lived in the monastery.  After some events, this building turned into a prison and a dormitory for workers.  In 1993, it was decided to restore the monastery, but now it is intended for women. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zagorizonty.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trinity Belopesotsky nunnery." class="if uuid-2971100" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/2971100.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the monastery itself, there are various cultural and architectural monuments on the territory.  For example, the temple of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker and the Church of the Beheading of John the Baptist. </p><h2>  Museum of Local History </h2><p>  A very popular place in which a large number of different collections have gathered.  Among them you can see beautiful paintings that belong to different periods, a large collection of coins, as well as get acquainted with the decorative art of Stupino.  The museum also has interesting old photographs and valuable documents. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, the building consists of five rooms.  Exhibits in the museum continue to replenish.  So, for example, in two halls exhibitions regularly change.  The remaining rooms are given for permanent exhibition. </p><h2>  Monument to the creators of propellers </h2><p>  For people who are fond of aviation, this is a favorite attraction of the city of Stupino.  The monument is located on Victory Avenue. </p><p>  A beautiful alley leads to the aviation monument.  The monument consists of two metal columns, on which a large blue screw flaunts, from afar resembling the sun. </p><p>  Monuments that are associated with aviation are often found in the city, but this one is the most interesting and popular among other Stupino sights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="galina-lukas.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="An unusual monument to the creators of propellers." class="if uuid-2974818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/2974818.jpg"></div><h2>  Nick City Art Gallery </h2><p>  The art gallery has been operating since 1996. Its founder, Nikolay Vasilievich Avdeev, is also its director.  Today it has about 2 thousand different exhibits.  The purpose of the gallery is to draw the attention of local citizens to art. </p><p>  The city gallery has an animalistic hall, which is very popular among visitors.

This can only be found here in the city, where they are made. </p><p>  Helicopter blades are not just a monument, but also a symbol of the city.  This is because the machine-building enterprise that produces them is the leader in this field throughout Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dmrog.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the helicopter blades." class="if uuid-2974815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/2974815.jpg"></div><h2>  Palace of Culture </h2><p>  The most beautiful building of the city is the Stupino Palace of Culture.
