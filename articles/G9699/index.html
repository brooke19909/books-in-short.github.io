Amateurs-numismatists with pleasure collect and collect rare coins that are of particular value to such people.  The value of commemorative coins often exceeds tens of thousands of dollars.  This, of course, is only if the banknote is really rare and has a fairly small issue.  Nevertheless, it‚Äôs quite possible in the world of numismatic values ‚Äã‚Äãto buy a coin that is ten times better than its face value at a price.  Today we will consider one of such monetary units - 2 euro anniversary. </p><h2>  Variety of varieties </h2><p>  In fact, a very large number of people who like commemorative coins.  2 euros is just such an attractive collection of exhibits.  In fact, it is a commemorative banknote, which was minted and issued by states that are <span>members of the European Union.</span>  They have been issuing jubilee 2 euros since 2004 as a legal tender.  They are common in all states of the eurozone.  Commemorative coins of 2 euros have more than 124 varieties. </p>

    <h2>  Unique features </h2><p>  Commemorative monetary units are usually issued almost as usual.  For example, 10-ruble coins from the series "Ancient Cities of Russia".  Nevertheless, such money has become a common collectible.  In addition, in addition to less valuable commemorative coins, there is a special, narrower subcategory, which is called just a collection.  If the ordinary commemorative coin depicts the flora and fauna of the country, some famous personalities of this state or historical events, then the collectible commemorative coins of 2 euros are also cast from precious metal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Coinage standards and restrictions </h2>

    <p>  At the beginning of 2004, the <span>Council of Europe</span> decided that the ban on changing the national sides of coins was repealed.  Just this was the reason for the release of commemorative 2 euros.  Anniversary banknotes nevertheless had their own distinctive standards and even certain restrictions.  One of the key standards for the issue of 2 euros is that only the national side of the coin can have a distinctive image (and <span>this is an obverse),</span> while the reverse is always the same.  The obverse should also indicate the country that issued this banknote. </p>

    <p>  Among other things, there are also quantity limits.  They come down to the following rules: </p><ul><li>  Each state that is part of the eurozone has the right to only one issue of commemorative 2 euros per year. </li><li>  The total number of such coins should not exceed 0.1% of the amount that all eurozone states issued that year.  If the historical event depicted on the obverse has a special significance, then the number can be increased to 2%.  But in this case, the country, which issued 2 euros in jubilee with a higher circulation, does not have the right to mint such coins for another four years. </li><li>  The total amount of this kind of banknotes should also not exceed 5% of the total volume of two-euro coins, which the state issued this year. </li></ul><h2>  Commemorative cost 2 euros </h2><p>  Huge popularity among beginner collectors enjoy 2 euro anniversary.  The price of these banknotes, as a rule, ranges from three to thirty euros.  However, there are exceptions.  Coins of San Marino, Monaco, as well as the Vatican can cost up to hundreds of euros.  The record set at the moment, the monetary unit of Monaco.  Its initial cost at issue was 120 euros.  And now its market price is ‚Äúfloating‚Äù in the region of 1,500 euros, which is already a significant amount and puts this coin among the rarest, collection ones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is one curious fact.  An interesting detail is that in 2007, in Monaco, a commemorative two-euro banknote was issued with unreasonably high prices.  In 2008, this country of the European Community tried to continue issuing commemorative money, however, the minting of coins with this denomination was prohibited.  This indicates careful monitoring of the correct, legal issue of commemorative banknotes in the European Union.  Of course, a small country can significantly increase its budget with the help of such frauds, so an accurate verification of compliance with the norms and restrictions adopted by the Council of Europe is undoubtedly necessary. </p><p>  It must be said that apart from the rest are three series of two-euro coins, which were immediately issued by all members of the Eurozone.  This is "10 years of the Economic and Monetary Union" and the "Treaty of Rome", and besides this, "10 years of the Euro." </p><h2>  Vatican 2 Euro </h2><p>  For an example of how commemorative 2 euros look, we give an example of a Vatican coin, which has a pretty good price among the other two-level signs.  It was released on December 15, 2004, and its circulation was 100 thousand pieces.  The coin depicts schematically sketched borders that make up the walls of the Vatican.  In the center is the image of St. Peter's Square and, of course, the cathedral itself, which is located on it. </p>

    <p>  In addition, there are several inscriptions on this banknote.  To the left of the diagram is 75 ANNO DELLO STATO.  This in Italian means "75th anniversary of the founding of the state."  To the right of the scheme, the years are 1929-2004.  Then there is the Sign of the Roman <span>Mint,</span> as well as in smaller print the name of the designer - VEROI, plus the initials of the engraver - LDS INC.  On the outer ring there is also the inscription CITTA DEL VATICANO, which means the name (Vatican city).  In conclusion, the outer circle is decorated with twelve stars of the European Union. </p><p>  The coin looks very beautiful and stylish.  Undoubtedly, many residents of the Vatican, people of the Catholic faith or just lovers of this city would want to have such an instance in their collection. </p>
