Camping</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In St. Petersburg there is an ideal place where you can have a great time - this is the Aviators Park.  It is suitable for a relaxing pastime, and for outdoor activities.  Many residents of the city and its environs come here to spend time with friends on a picnic or to have fun with the whole family.  Especially if the weather is fine on the street and the sun is shining brightly, then there is no better place for such walks in the whole Leningrad region. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  In the territory where the Aviators Park is located today, the main airfield of Leningrad was previously located.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, this base was used to test new <span>aviation equipment</span> and various airplanes.  There were also trained and prepared for the work of aircraft mechanics and pilots. </p>

    <p>  This place was once of great importance for Russian aviation, and many Soviet records were set here.  But in the forties, after the surrounding area began to be built up with new buildings, this airfield was closed.  And later its territory turned into a resting place for local residents. </p><p>  Then, in the sixties, it was decided to build an Aviator park here, which has a very interesting layout.  The runway of the former airfield turned into Novo-Izmailovsky Avenue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1968, in this cultural place, it was decided to erect a monument to military pilots having a height of twelve meters. </p><h2>  Description of the park </h2><p>  This area consists of many winding and bizarre paths and alleys, and its area is more than thirty hectares.  In the heart of this cultural place, its main attraction is located - a pond, on the banks of which the famous monument is located.  Thus, this monument is visible from any corner of the park. </p><p>  The whole area is planted with deciduous trees, but there is also a small alley on which only spruce trees grow. </p><p>  Aviators Park is always full of vacationers, as here you can practice any kind of sport, take walks to improve your health or simply spend your leisure time in nature and breathe fresh air. </p>

    <h2>  What else can you do? </h2><p>  It is officially forbidden to fry kebabs and make bonfires in the park zone in order to avoid pollution of the surrounding area and burning of trees.  But this does not mean that there is no way to arrange a vacation in nature with delicious goodies, and for this it is not necessary to cook something in the Aviators park. </p><p>  You can simply take a <span>picnic basket</span> there <span>,</span> after putting a lot of different and tasty sandwiches in it, and then with your family or friends go to a wonderful pond to enjoy the atmosphere of peace and tranquility prevailing there. </p><p>  The main alley of the park is especially good for walking mothers with prams, and older children can be taught rollerblading and cycling, as this road has perfectly flat asphalt.  In one secluded place of this territory there is even a cozy children's corner, where a trampoline is periodically installed. </p><p>  The Aviators Park pond is popular with avid fishermen who fish here only for the sake of sports interest, since there are not a lot of fish here. </p>
