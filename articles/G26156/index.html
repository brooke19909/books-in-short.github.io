    <h2>  By plane to Kabardinka: travel features </h2><p>  Naturally, air travel is the fastest way to get from one point to another.  But do not forget that it applies to the most expensive.  In addition, there are not always flights from every city in Russia on the desired route.  Therefore, we consider air travel to Kabardinka on the example of Moscow. </p><p>  Since the resort itself does not have its own airport terminal, Muscovites have the opportunity to choose any airport located in Gelendzhik, Anapa and Krasnodar.  From any point in the future you can get to Kabardinka as soon as possible. </p><p>  If you choose Gelendzhik, then get ready to pay about 9 thousand rubles for a one-way trip.  From here to the village there are several bus routes: </p><ul><li>  32; </li><li>  31; </li><li>  103. </li></ul><p>  The interval of movement is from one and a half to three hours. </p><p>  If you decide to get to Kabardinka via Anapa, then keep in mind that the cost of air travel will be a little more than 7 thousand rubles.  Next, you will need to purchase tickets for one of the intercity bus routes passing through several resort cities: </p><ul><li>  Temryuk - Tuapse; </li><li>  Temryuk - Gelendzhik; </li><li>  Anapa - Sochi. </li></ul><p>  In general, the road on any of the buses will take you about two hours. </p><p>  You can fly from Moscow to Krasnodar by paying 6 thousand rubles.  Every day, a bus leaves for the Kabardinka bus from the Krasnodar bus station, which will be on the road for about four hours. </p>
