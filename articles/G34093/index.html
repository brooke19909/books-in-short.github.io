Nevertheless, even an experienced driver is not immune to errors.  For many years of experience, at least one or two speeds exceeded every motorist.  What can we say about amateurs of dynamic driving and beginners, who, for obvious reasons, can even unconsciously go beyond the established limits.  In other words, every car owner should have a good radar with a video recorder, supplemented by modern functions.  This device will help to determine in advance the location of the so-called arrows and complexes "motorway", which will allow the driver to get rid of problems with traffic inspectors. </p><h2>  Basic requirements for radar detector </h2>

    <p>  The main function of a car radar detector is to notify the driver of the risk of deviation from the rules.  As a rule, the device detects the presence of speed control systems on the road and gives the corresponding signal to the owner.  Accordingly, a good radar detector should not only track DPS points, but also quickly warn about them, and with a minimum percentage of false positives.  This function is provided by various means, the most popular of which is the antenna. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The evaluation criterion for a high-quality radar detector is reduced to the sensitivity of this antenna.  In the middle price segment, devices are presented that can notify the driver several hundred meters to the tracking point.  But increasingly, a good <span>radar detector with a DVR is</span> associated among specialists with wireless technologies based on GPS receivers.  Features of such models should be considered separately. </p><h2>  Advantages of devices with a GPS module </h2>

    <p>  If the antenna allows you to fix the radar signal locally, in close proximity to the observation points, then the GPS model works directly with maps of the coordinates of the location of the cameras.  This gives a huge advantage, since traditional detectors are not able to pick up the signal from modern surveillance systems.  For example, even a good radar detector with a highly sensitive antenna will not allow you to detect the aforementioned Avtodoria complex.  The fact is that the latter does not have radar and microwave radiation at all.  But the model with the GPS receiver, relying on the map data, will notify the driver in advance of approaching the ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù zone. </p><p>  But the use of GPS technology is not limited to this factor.  A common problem with many radar detectors is the inability to correlate the primary function with specific speed limits.  This means that the device will give a signal even if the speed is within acceptable limits.  In turn, a good radar detector that catches the ‚Äúarrow‚Äù should also focus on its maximum values.  Usually for this purpose, devices are endowed with the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the sensor element under certain driving conditions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Modern optional </h2><p>  With the presence of a GPS module today, few people are surprised, but there are also less common and at the same time promising developments, the benefits of which are highly estimated by experts.  Among them, the presence of batteries that are powered not only by the cigarette lighter, but also able to accumulate solar energy, can be noted.  Of course, the benefit of this technology is possible only in specific weather conditions, but free energy in the operation of the car certainly will not be superfluous.  In addition, a good radar detector in its modern version certainly has ‚Äúsmart‚Äù software that protects against interference and increases the efficiency of the device.  By the way, it is precisely such models that have the greatest protection against false signals that are eliminated.  It is also worth paying attention to the possibility of a hidden installation.  This design is more expensive, but will eliminate the risk of problems with road inspectors of a different kind.  And now it‚Äôs worth getting acquainted with specific models representing the segment of radar detectors. </p>

    <h2>  Vedetta SLR 600 by Cobra </h2><p>  The manufacturer recently launched the entire Vedetta family.  Such models are characterized by an organic combination of several modern technologies, while also having effective traditional solutions.  In particular, the SLR 600 is a multi-functional radar detector and a 2-in-1 recorder - a good option if you need a device for quick detection of ‚Äúshooters‚Äù.  But the model is good not only for its effectiveness in combating traffic police radars, but also in terms of ergonomics.  The device is equipped with a 2.4-inch swivel screen and touch control.  The features of this solution include competent adaptation to Russian operating conditions: the device works with almost all radio and laser systems that are used by traffic police. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But there are also disadvantages to this radar detector.  Experts note low-quality fasteners, which are supplied.  As a result, many users complain of poor physical fixation of the device.  The problem is complicated by the fact that the original design imposes serious restrictions on the use of alternative methods of fastening. </p><h2>  MRD-410VS from Mystery </h2><p>  In a sense, the opposite of the above proposal is the Philippine MRD-410VS radar detector.  It should be noted right away that he will not be pampered with wide functionality and advanced technical stuffing.  This is an inexpensive but reliable solution for a discerning car enthusiast.  For comparison, while a good Cobra radar detector provides excellent detection capabilities for high-speed monitoring stations, the Mystery offer is convenient in physical handling.  The device is easily attached, without causing problems in further operation.  However, the <span>GPS module</span> in this case is missing, so you have to put up with the inability to identify laser meters.  Users, for their part, praise the device for a clear display, ergonomic settings controls and, of course, a low cost of 3 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  X-COP 7500 from Neoline </h2><p>  In this case, the Korean model is considered from the middle segment, in which the technical and structural advantages and functionality are balanced.  What is especially interesting in this device, it automatically changes the sensitivity characteristics, adapting to the driving conditions.  At the same time, it is worth noting the dependence on the quality of battery power.  The slightest differences in the supply can lead to a complete shutdown.  But the rest is a good <span>radar detector, reviews</span> of which emphasize the reliability of the technical filling and aesthetic design.  Unfortunately, these advantages are not supported by ergonomics.  The configuration of settings for many users causes a critical attitude to the model, as well as the main controls with a bracket. </p><h2>  21RS from RT Pilot </h2><p>  Another option with a decent performance of the internal filling and ample opportunities for the main function.  However, its ergonomics are not the best.  Firstly, it should be noted the non-standard placement of buttons that serve to control the main parameters of the device.  Secondly, updates are inconveniently implemented and the sound is tuned.  But from the point of view of catching signals, this is probably the best radar detector for a car in the middle segment.  The device not only tracks the location of radars, but also makes it possible to set speed thresholds for sound alerts.  True, there are some nuances in working with laser systems.  The model quickly monitors them, but determines the spectrum of actions inaccurately. </p>

    <h2>  G-800 STR by Sho-Me </h2><p>  The model is not bad and with a price tag of 5 thousand rubles.  can claim to be a leader in its segment.  It is very important that the technical filling allows you to control almost all signals.  This function is complemented by a wide range of settings, including tracking the maximum speed, turning off the sound notification when driving slowly, switching to the operating mode in conditions of reduced sensitivity, etc.  Sho-Me company is considered one of the best manufacturers of DVRs, but in this case it managed to release a good radar detector with optimal technical parameters.  But the main thing is that high operational data are confirmed by the practice of use.  Tests indicate the accuracy of the detector, its range and the compliance of each setting with the real behavior of the equipment. </p><h2>  Best options </h2>

    <p>  The choice should be based on specific preferences and needs, however, according to the totality of the data, the MRD-410VS and G-800 STR models can be called leaders.  These are different devices, therefore their target audiences are different.  In the first case, we are talking about a budget solution that copes well with the basic capabilities of the task.  As for the ratio of price, functionality and efficiency, the Sho-Me model is the best radar detector.  Reviews note that the device catches both traditional <span>tracking systems</span> and the latest lasers.  Of course, in this case, the device is not free from errors, but they are insignificant. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The anti-radar segment is developing along with technologies that track vehicle speed.  To date, manufacturers of DVRs offer models that can cover the entire spectrum of lasers and radio signals.  But, as practice shows, during operation, ergonomic qualities can also be significant.  Ease of control, fastener system, settings elements - all this is no less important than the main functions of the radar detector.  As for the cost, then, in most cases, it corresponds to the quality - the main thing is to turn to the products of well-known and reputable manufacturers. </p>
