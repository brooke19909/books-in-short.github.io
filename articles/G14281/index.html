Later, in 1920, it was transformed.  So the museum of the local region appeared.  At the party‚Äôs call, peasants from nearby villages began to bring to the museum the old household items and even the bones of ancient animals and artifacts found during agricultural work that were preserved in their houses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1951, the city authorities decided to organize the Kurgan <span>Regional Museum of Local Lore (KOKM).</span> </p>

    <h2>  Virtual and other projects </h2><p>  The Museum of Local History of Kurgan strives to keep pace with the times.  In particular, a patriotic project dedicated to the heroes of the Great Patriotic War was recently launched there, which allows creating a virtual memory book. </p><p>  In addition, KOKM regularly participates in the famous ‚ÄúMuseum Night‚Äù campaign, and on weekends, preschool children can be taken by inviting them to get acquainted with the habits of a little chipmunk. </p><p>  Selfie exhibitions are also very popular.  During such events, everyone will be able to take pictures with a unique exhibit participating in the action.  For example, in April, a fairly large meteorite was exhibited at the museum, which landed near the village of Chashi in the Kurgan Region in 1963.  Everyone was given the opportunity to hold the ‚Äúspace alien‚Äù in their hands and take a selfie with him, which you can immediately boast on social networks. </p>
