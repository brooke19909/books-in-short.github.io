The watch cameras and radars are improved from year to year, and the detectors, in turn, try to keep up with them and also receive updates to series and rulers.  Today we‚Äôll talk about one of the new products from the venerable brand, whose products are in enviable demand among domestic consumers. </p>

    <p>  So, the subject of today's review is the Neoline X-COP 5500 radar detector. Reviews, characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of the model will be considered in this article. </p><h2>  Detectors </h2><p>  Almost all detectors differ from each other only in design and a set of recognizable frequencies.  Control cameras are constantly being improved and, adopting an obsolete device, you are at great risk of missing a signal from the radar, which is fraught with a monetary fine, or even deprivation of rights. </p><p>  Therefore, each manufacturer tries to update their devices as often as possible.  Even if this cannot be done technically and visually, at least in hardware using firmware.  The Neoline brand also tries to keep up with its competitors and produces technically savvy gadgets like the Neoline X-COP 5500. The company's tests showed that the device recognizes all the well-known domestic road monitoring systems.  He will try to figure out whether this is really so, and whether it is worth buying this device at all. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The device is packaged in a nice box made of thick cardboard in white and blue colors.  On the front part you can see the image of the device itself, its most remarkable characteristics are also there, and on the back a more detailed specification, test results and a separate part are taken by random user reviews on the Neoline X-COP 5500. At the ends are the distributors labels and the model name. </p>

The black plastic case has an inclined surface with a front display.

    <p>  Due to its universal and strict appearance, the Neoline X-COP 5500 radar detector can be installed both in the modest equipment of the domestic automobile industry and in venerable foreign-class cars, it looks quite right here and there. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the front surface of the glass goes at an angle to the horizontal, the main display is strictly perpendicular.  In similar competing gadgets, the screen is simply brought to the end, and here we see an interesting design solution. </p><p>  Reviews on the Neoline X-COP 5500 in this regard are mixed.  Of course, this appearance gives the device individuality and beauty, but this point has its drawbacks.  On a sunny day, the information on the <span>detector is well</span> read - clearly and without glare, but at night the data seems to be duplicated, that is, you see the gadget's readings both on the display and in the reflection on the windshield.  This point is quite confusing for some users. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  On the left side of the device, you can see two connectors: mini-USB for connecting to a PC (updating firmware on the Neoline X-COP 5500, reprogramming function keys, etc.) and an output for charging.  Both interfaces hold the loops tight enough and there were no problems with disconnection.  However, some owners in their reviews on the Neoline X-COP 5500 complain about the fact that the wires interfere with the driver‚Äôs review, and why the manufacturer did not place the connectors on the right side - it is not entirely clear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  There are only four buttons on the gadget, the two extreme ones are signed, and the internal ones have an understandable user design (up, down), so there should be no confusion.  The buttons are used to fine-tune the detector, adjust the volume and to disable or enable the reception of frequencies of a certain type. </p><h2>  The device is in operation </h2><p>  Before starting work, the manufacturer highly recommends installing the latest update for the Neoline X-COP 5500 from the official site, and only after that start working.  Otherwise, you risk missing another DPS radar. </p><p>  Field tests showed that the Neoline X-COP 5500 GPS copes well with the direction finding of the Strelka-M and Strelka-ST police radars, and at a distance of up to 1 km, which is very impressive.  At one time, these DPS devices made a lot of noise among motorists, when no detector could cope with their identification. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the Neoline X-COP 5500 GPS is capable of detecting such an advanced vehicle control system as Atodoria, which can easily recognize not only the registration number of the vehicle, but also quite accurately determine the average vehicle speed at a considerable distance - from 500 m to 10 km (depending on the landscape). </p><p>  In addition to the notorious Strelka, the device can warn of such serious complexes as Cordon and Chris, which focus on the speed and passage of vehicles along lanes for public transport in the city stream.  The DPS mobile / manual radars like Berkut, Radis, Binara, Iskra and Vizira will not be a problem.  The detector from Neoline detects these devices for almost a kilometer, which largely depends on the landscape. </p><p>  The gadget recognizes some cameras with the help of the built-in module, and some ones are detected by GPS protocols.  This allows you to virtually eliminate the sudden hit of a car under police radars. </p><p>  Owners generally speak quite well about the capabilities of the X-COP 5500 series. Users are quite satisfied with the direction-finding capabilities of the detector, as well as a pleasant and versatile appearance.  Some motorists complain about the ‚Äúthoughtfulness‚Äù of the device, but such a phenomenon is so rare (mainly in the cold season) that this point can hardly be called critical. </p><h2>  Competitors </h2><p>  The automotive market is replete with such devices and our respondent has enough competitors.  Among a bunch of similar models, there are a couple of the most interesting gadgets that almost exactly copy (or vice versa) the capabilities of the X-COP 5500. </p><h2>  Mystery MRD-705GVS </h2><p>  This device can be called the twin brother of ‚ÄúNeoline‚Äù, with the only difference being that the appearance of the MRD-705GVS is a bit simpler, and you can‚Äôt hang such a gadget in the business class.  The model has a built-in GPS module, and it is also capable of detecting the above-mentioned list of police radars. </p>

    <p>  The only thing Mystery wins is the price (a thousand cheaper).  That is, users get the same functionality as ‚ÄúNeoline‚Äù with a lower cost, but a plain appearance.  What is more important is up to you. </p><h2>  "Cobra RU 945CT" </h2><p>  The appearance of this detector allows you to hang it even in an alien cruiser: the calling body, all kinds of grilles, inserts, protrusions and other surroundings that scream like that - I'm the best.  However, despite all its attractiveness, the ‚Äúfilling‚Äù of the model is very ordinary. </p>

    <p>  The device sees ‚ÄúStrelka‚Äù and other radars popular with DPS, but in the absence of a GPS module, the ‚ÄúCobra‚Äù functionality slightly loses to the two previous models.  But the gadget has one indisputable advantage - the viewing angle of the laser sensor is 360 degrees.  That is, if the DPS radar is directed, let's say, into your back, this device will detect it.  The device costs a little cheaper than Neoline (about 300 rubles), but more than 200 rubles more than Mystery. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The purchase of the X-COP 5500 detector was more than satisfied with many users, especially since the price tag for the model is quite affordable - around 7,000 rubles.  Of course, before you install the gadget in the car, you need to tinker with it: install the latest firmware update, configure sensors, signals, etc., but after all the procedures, the device reminds itself only during radar bearing. </p><p>  The model, like most other low-cost gadgets of this kind, ‚Äúsuffers‚Äù from false positives in urban conditions, that is, where there are a lot of shops with automatic doors, which for detectors are like a red rag for a bull.  But after leaving the track, the problem disappears, and the device works as it should - correctly and without failures. </p><p>  For its price, the X-COP 5500 from Neoline is a successful purchase that you are unlikely to regret, especially since this device will pay off quite quickly.  Also worth noting is the fact that devices of this plan are designed to remind you of high-speed mode, that is, to ensure greater safety on the road, but not the other way around. </p>
