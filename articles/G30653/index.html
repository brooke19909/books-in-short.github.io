    <p>  <strong>Roswell incident of 1947</strong> </p><p>  The immediate event occurred on the night of the second to the third of July, literally on the eve of the celebration of the local <span>Independence Day.</span>  Roswell is a very tiny settlement in the state of New Mexico, which even today has a few tens of thousands of inhabitants.  That night, a local farmer, Mark Braisel, witnessed a flash of light in the sky and a loud sound like a peal of thunder.  Since the storm had passed before, he did not attach much importance to the event.  However, in the morning, having left for the field to collect his scattered sheep, the man suddenly discovered strange debris in a vacant lot of unfamiliar material.  The farmer told his find to the local sheriff.  The public was thrilled.  The military and journalists appeared at the scene very soon.  The first collected the remains of the crash of an unknown object, and correspondents quickly made an event out of the event, stories around the world about UFOs in Roswell.  This version was confirmed by some local residents, and even the US Air Force spokesman Walter Hout.  However, the very next day, the military issued a refutation, explaining that in reality it was just a crash of a weather balloon.  The explanation of the official authorities seemed quite logical, especially since journalists were allowed to look at these fragments.  They really turned out to be unremarkable.  All speculation about the alien origin of the device was attributed to the natural human desire for sensations and the Roswell incident gradually began to be forgotten. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p><strong></strong></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Roswell incident of 1947" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/268337.jpg" width="325"></div>  <strong>New sensation</strong>

    <p>  Everything would have remained, but already in the 1970s, new witnesses suddenly appeared that the flying saucer of extraterrestrial origin crashed over the town.  This was first announced by Major Jesse Marcel in one of his interviews.  He claimed that the debris presented to reporters in the forties was a fake.  And that, in fact, an <span>alien ship</span> was actually found there <span>,</span> at the opening of which the bodies of humanoids were seized.  Witnesses began to appear throughout the state in those years, who said they had been silent for many years, but suddenly lost their strength to hide the truth.  Now it was impossible to hide the alien invasion, because it had so many eyewitnesses!  The film by British director Ray Santilli, released in 1995, added fuel to the fire of rumors.  It allegedly demonstrated documentary chronicles of the autopsy of an alien alien, which was discovered in a fallen plate.  However, the film received a flurry of criticism for the obvious lies and falsifications that were noticeable to both physicians (in the work of pathologists on the video) and cameramen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="UFO in Roswell" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/268487.jpg" width="540"></div>  <strong>The Mogul Project</strong>

    <p>  In the mid-nineties, a version was expressed that the Roswell incident could have completely earthly, that is, spy roots.  In the second half of the 1940s, the Cold War began in the world and an active nuclear race was underway.  The Soviet leadership during this period, as part of the Mogul program, developed weather balloons designed to monitor the nuclear tests of Americans in their territory.  That apparatus could be what eyewitnesses saw in the state of New Mexico. </p><p>  <strong>Roswell incident remains a mystery</strong> </p><p>  However, not everyone liked this explanation, since the military‚Äôs extraordinary interest in the events of 1947 was obvious.  And many supporters of the ufological version have doubts <span>that such a</span> commotion could have caused a simple Soviet probe.  Mutual surveillance was not a secret for governments anyway.  Another, and so far the last, peppercorn to this mystery was the testament of Walter Houth, who died in 2005.  The very one who was the first of the military to tell the world about aliens in 1947.  Now he stated that he really saw extraterrestrial beings then.  Skepticism is given to this will by the fact that the daughter of Hout at that time worked in the UFO Museum, open to tourists in Roswell.  And, of course, he was quite interested in stirring up a sensation.  Be that as it may, each for himself determines what to believe. </p>
