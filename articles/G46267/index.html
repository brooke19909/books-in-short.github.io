Indeed, even an unpretentious person will probably want to be able to return to a cozy room in the evening with properly working appliances, clean and high-quality bedding, and also count on good service and attentive staff.  An important role is played by the location of the hotel.  After all, it is unlikely that you would like to spend a lot of time and effort on regular walks to the main infrastructure.  To make the right decision when choosing a hotel, according to many tourists, it helps to study the reviews of those people who have already stayed in the place that interests you.  After all, former guests try to share their impressions about the advantages and disadvantages of a particular hotel, based on their own experience of living in it.  Thanks to this information, you can create your own idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat will await you during your vacation. </p><p>  Today we want to familiarize you with the opinions of Russian tourists staying during their holidays in Thailand at the three-star Royal Century Hotel Pattaya.

According to them, it corresponds to its three-star category and cost of living.  Tourists also liked the location of the Royal Centuri.  Indeed, within walking distance of the hotel are the main entertainment places in Pattaya.  Also in the vicinity of the hotel you will find a lot of restaurants and cafes, which offer not only local, but also Indian, Chinese and even Russian cuisine.  Nearby is a market where you can buy fresh fruits and seafood, supermarkets operating around the clock, a shopping center, travel agencies, car rental points, exchangers, a large shopping and entertainment center and much more. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  As for its own territory, Royal Century Hotel Pattaya 3 * (Thailand, Pattaya), then it, according to the guests, is very small.  So there‚Äôs nowhere to go for a walk.  But half of the territory is occupied by a beautiful pool.  The water in it is clean, but some guests note excessive amounts of bleach.  Also, some guests complained about splinter tiles at the bottom of the pool.  But in general, as our compatriots note, you can refresh yourself here several times during the holidays.  In addition, there are sun loungers nearby, where you can conveniently sit and take sun baths. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal century hotel pattaya reviews" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1262662.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Since the hotel in question is far from new, as they say, has seen views and belongs to the economic category, you can not count on apartments with luxurious design and modern technology.  However, almost all tourists were quite satisfied with the equipment and condition of their rooms.  So, according to them, the rooms are clean, comfortable, recently redecorated. </p><p>  Furniture and appliances, although not new, are in good working condition.  In the bathroom, the water pressure is always good, no interruptions were noted.  Also, some guests are advised to choose rooms on higher floors.  Here you can enjoy a beautiful view of the city and less noise from the street will bother you.  Although even those who lived on the lower floors claim that with the windows closed, no loud sounds were heard. </p><p>  As for the complaints, they were mainly noted only because Wi-Fi in the Royal Century Pattaya Hotel 3 * is provided only for a fee.  However, this problem can be easily solved by purchasing a local mobile operator‚Äôs SIM card with mobile Internet package upon arrival.  It will cost inexpensively, and you can always be in touch with family and friends who have remained at home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal century hotel pattaya 3 reviews" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1262661.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  This point, of course, excites most tourists arriving on vacation in Thailand.  As for the Royal Century Pattaya Hotel 3 * we are considering, the distance from it to the nearest beach is about 800 meters.  You can reach the sea in 10-15 minutes.  However, guests rarely go to the nearest beach, as it does not differ in cleanliness.  Seasoned travelers are advised to choose other places to stay.  You can get to them by tuk-tuk or by renting a motorbike.  Experienced tourists are also advised to visit the islands at least a couple of times.  Here you can swim in the clear water and relax on the beautiful beaches.  You can get to them by ferry, which regularly departs from the pier of Pattaya. </p>
