A hook, a minimum of yarn and a good pattern - this is what can turn a simple white baby dress into a princess outfit or snowflakes. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted crocheted crown" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1146264.jpg" width="230"></div>

    <h2>  No ‚Äúand so it will do‚Äù </h2><p>  To get a product that can compete with plastic and metal crowns, sold in excess in stores, you should pay attention to the choice of yarn and decor.  If you show insufficient diligence, the resulting crown will be like a "maid in homemade."  This is unlikely to please a child who is counting on a beautiful thing.  In addition, any hand-made product is always subjected to close study and criticism of others, which means that a crocheted crown should be stylish, accurate, proportional. </p><h2>  Yarn and tool </h2><p>  Thin stiff yarn is best for knitting the crown.  Optimal is the choice in favor of cotton, linen, viscose or polyamide.  The thickness of the thread can not be less than 500 m / 100 grams, it is better to choose yarn even thinner.  Of course, knitting with such thin threads is not for the faint of heart, because everything will also have to comply with a high density full (otherwise, uneven stretched loops cannot be avoided).  The finished canvas should be dense and as rigid as possible to get a neat crown.  The hook should be used thin, with a head size of 0.9-1.2 mm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the color of the yarn, it is better to use classic tones: from cold white to pastel shades of blue, pink and purple.  The use of beige yarn can negate all efforts, because it looks ‚Äúdirty‚Äù next to clothes of a lighter color. </p><h2>  Additional decor </h2><p>  Gone are the days when that children's costume was considered to be beautiful, on which there were more ‚Äúsparkles‚Äù than on the Christmas tree, so you do not need to rack your brains and try to fit more decor on the knitted crown.  Crochet a crown for a girl, no doubt, can be decorated with sewn decorative elements, suitable in style and color.  However, it is important to observe the measure and not overdo it.  Sewing items that can be a decoration for the crown: </p><ul><li>  Beads and beads. </li><li>  Sequins. </li><li>  Rhinestones. </li><li>  Satin ribbons and cords. </li></ul><p>  Fine decor is very convenient to sew between the loops of the canvas.  Also, pico are great for this purpose, which often decorates the last row of crowns.  The decor should be sewn before the crown is impregnated with a fixing solution. </p><p>  As an option for decoration, you can consider the use of yarn with lurex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crown hook" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1146261.jpg" width="408"></div>  <span>The metal thread</span> in the knitting yarn shines well and has a smart look, however, use other sparkling elements with Lurex carefully, there is a chance to overdo it.

The first one looks like a finished product, easier to manufacture and opens up more possibilities for the distribution of decor.  However, it is easy to make a mistake in calculating the circumference of the head and get a crown that is either too large or small. </p><p>  A crocheted crown in the shape of a diadem is attached to a metal or plastic hoop.  Also, if the height of the decorative part of the crown is low, you can do with simple ties (as shown in the photo below). <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a crown" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1146266.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Most likely, this model can serve only as an example illustrating the general principle of knitting tiaras, since the craftswoman used a rather thick yarn. </p><h2>  Round crown </h2><p>  For its manufacture, it is necessary to measure the circumference of the head of the child for whom the crown is knitted (a hook and yarn should be prepared in advance).  At the same time, it is worth considering that the decoration will be worn on the top of the head, which is why this part of the head should be measured. </p>

    <p>  As a pattern, various knitting patterns of an openwork border are perfectly suitable.  They are abundantly offered by many editions devoted to crochet.  However, to be sure of a successful result, you should tie a sample.  Thus, it is possible to calculate the size of the future crown as accurately as possible and to avoid such unpleasant consequences as: </p><ul><li>  Incompatibility of the size of the rapport with the size of the product ("cropped" rapports). </li><li>  Errors in the selection of yarn or hook. </li><li>  Inconsistency of the finished crown with the rest of the costume (a knitted sample can be attached to the dress and change the pattern or yarn in time). </li></ul><p>  The round shape allows you to evenly distribute the decor with which the crown will be decorated over the entire diameter of the product.  Snowflakes, crochet them quite simply, knit separately from the canvas of the crown and then sew.  Or they can be hung on shoelaces on the sides of the crown.  The photo below shows examples of several very successful <span>snowflake patterns.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet snowflake crown" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1146262.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Knitted crown (crocheted snowflakes give it a completely winter flavor) is suitable only for the celebration of the New Year, while the use of a universal decor will expand the scope of use of the accessory. </p><h2>  Knitted Tiara </h2><p>  When choosing this form for the manufacture of the crown, the head volume can not be measured.  By the way, this model can be used repeatedly, even if the child has grown up, or it can be presented to friends who have a baby, without worrying about the size of his head.  In search of information on how to crochet a crown for a girl, it is easy to find a large number of tips and patterns.  It is worth choosing the one when looking at which there are as few questions as possible.  In this case, the work will be a pleasure, and the result will be positive. </p><p>  The scheme below is quite complicated in execution, but if it is successfully implemented, a very beautiful crown will be obtained.  The hook is good in that it allows you to knit the fabric even of such a complex shape. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted crown" class="if" height="497" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1146263.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  In order for the finished product to fully perform its functions, it must be subjected to treatment with starch, PVA glue or gelatin.  All of these methods are equally effective, especially if you combine some of them. </p><p>  Considering that the described procedures lead to wetting, it is necessary to prepare in advance an object on which the crown will dry (the hook and the specificity of the canvas associated with it can lead to shrinkage or deformation after drying).  Many craftswomen note that a glass jar is excellent for these purposes.  Sometimes an inflated ball is also used.  Then the crocheted dried crown will have the correct shape, become really stiff and will not fail at a crucial moment. </p>
