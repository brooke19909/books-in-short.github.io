    <h2>  Some negative moments of a hotel stay </h2><p>  Despite the many advantages of this three-star hotel, many tourists are inclined to believe that this is not a cheap pleasure at all - a trip to the eco-hotel ‚ÄúLevant‚Äù.  Reviews of his small flaws and suggestions for improving the service can be found on the tourist sites dedicated to hotel services: </p><ul><li>  Children's animation.  I would like to improve it and add an evening disco for kids by analogy with foreign hotels. </li><li>  Lack of elevator and ramps for prams.  Climbing the stairs of the four-story hotel building was difficult for some guests.  This fact must be taken into account when booking a room. </li><li>  I would like to expand the assortment of sanitary and hygienic accessories in the bathroom, and improve the quality of existing ones. </li></ul><p>  In general, all tourists who visited the eco-hotel "Levant" at one time or another time of the year, are satisfied with the choice made and do not regret the money spent.  Regular customers of the hotel note that every year service rises to an ever higher level, the range of services offered is expanding, the quality of existing ones is being improved.  The hotel can be recommended to your relatives and friends as a quiet corner on the coast of a large Black Sea resort of the Crimean peninsula. </p>
