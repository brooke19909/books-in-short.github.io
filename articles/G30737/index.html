  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY Stealth and Bull Nose paper planes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each person at least once in his life (and most likely more than one) folded an airplane out of paper.  The older generation still remembers the days when airplanes served as analogues of current SMS-messages in the classroom.  Almost any adult or child, if you give him a piece of paper and say "make an airplane," can do it in just a couple of minutes.  However, did you know that there are a lot of ways to fold a paper airplane?  This is not one or two schemes, but the whole world of paper aircraft modeling. </p><p>  The article tells how to make paper planes with your own hands. </p><h2>  The main nuances </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gigazine.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the nuances of how to fold a good airplane" class="if uuid-2916386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109071/2916386.jpg"></div><p>  To begin with, it is worth considering the main subtleties and nuances applicable to all paper airplanes. </p><ol><li>  Do not take paper that is too thick or thick.  It does not hold its shape well, the folds will unfold, and the airplane, because of its gravity, will fly poorly.  Notebook paper or plain paper for printers is the best option. </li><li>  Iron the fold lines well, but carefully.  Do not do this with your fingernails or a coin - this will damage the paper and it will tear quickly.  It is best to press with a fingertip or an eraser. </li><li>  If the airplane, at launch, first flies up sharply, and then falls into an air hole and falls, it is necessary to weight the nose.  To do this, you can attach a small piece of plasticine or a paper clip, depending on the size of the model. </li><li>  If the plane does not want to fly straight, and all the time it turns in the same direction - weight the wing from the opposite side, just like a paper clip or a piece of plasticine. </li><li>  The model to run on the street is better to fold out of colored paper or painted in bright colors.  So it will be easier to find in the grass or on the tree. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="news.bitcoin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a plane that flies for a long time" class="if uuid-2916401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109071/2916401.jpg"></div><h2>  Scheme paper airplane "Stealth" </h2><p>  This model flies great for long distances, and it just looks pretty cool.  If you have long wondered how to make a paper airplane that flies for a long time - this scheme is for you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Take a sheet of A4 paper and bend it in half (vertically).  Smooth the fold line and straighten it back. </li><li>  Fold the top two corners toward the center of the sheet. </li><li>  Fold the resulting sharp end onto yourself, leaving 2-3 cm to the edge of the sheet. </li><li>  Fold the top corners again to the center of the sheet. </li><li>  Bend the protruding tip up and press firmly. </li><li>  Bend the entire model in half from you. </li><li>  Bend the wing towards yourself so that between the bottom of the figure and the fold line is about 2 cm. Turn the figure over and repeat the same action from the back. </li><li>  Bend the tips (1-2 cm) of each wing up so that they are at right angles. </li><li>  Make two shallow cuts in each wing and fold the resulting label up, as shown in the photo. </li><li>  It remains only to glue the middle with glue-pencil or a piece of double-sided tape.  Done!  You can run! </li></ol><p>  This model is easy to fold and, with a little practice, you will achieve the ideal.  It is better to launch on the street or in spacious rooms - so you can appreciate the flight range of such an airplane.  And in the open space you can hold a competition - whose "Stealth" will fly the farthest. </p><h2>  Plane "Bull nose" </h2><p>  The model owes its name to the atypical shape of the nose - it, unlike most paper planes, is not pointed, but square, dull.  However, the <span>first impression is misleading,</span> and this aircraft will surprise you with its speed and long distance. </p><p>  How to make it? </p><ol><li>  Bend the upper right corner of the A4 sheet to the left side so that the fold line runs from the lower right corner to the top of the sheet.  Iron the fold as it should, then straighten it back. </li><li>  Repeat the first step, but now with the upper left corner. </li><li>  Attach the corner of the right sheet to the crease outlined in the first step. </li><li>  Do the same, but on the left side. <div class="photo" data-original="www.diynetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bull nose airplane" class="if uuid-2914812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109071/2914812.jpg"></div></li><li>  Align the right edge of the figure with the edge of the crease in step 3. </li><li>  Align the left edge of the shape with the edge of the fold in step 4. </li><li>  Bend the upper edge towards yourself, aligning it with the intersection point of the right and left layers. </li><li>  Bend the model away from you in half.  Now bend each wing in half.  Just as in the previous model, glue the middle with glue-pencil or double-sided tape. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.diynetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bull nose model" class="if uuid-2914832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109071/2914832.jpg"></div><p>  The plane is ready to launch!  You should not do this indoors, as this model accelerates very much, and therefore is strongly deformed when it collides with walls. </p><h2>  Realistic airplane model </h2><p>  Finally, you can watch a video on how to make a paper airplane that flies for a long time. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="IrP4WcLWjMs" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrP4WcLWjMs" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/0/5/1/4/10514.jpg"></div><p>  This model is more complicated than the previous ones, but the airplane according to this scheme is more realistic. </p>
