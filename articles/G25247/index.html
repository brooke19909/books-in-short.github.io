It seems that barely stepping on this hot sun from the <span>ramp,</span> you can immediately become the hero of some beautiful story, similar to those told in old films, generously seasoned with melodious songs and bewitching dances.  If you first find yourself in Goa, which has long been a favorite resort for young people from all over the world, you will be surprised at the number of Russians resting and living there.  And this is quite easy to explain: in the state of Goa, you can find everything that our compatriots associate with a good rest, and besides, Indian vacations will not become wasteful for the family budget.  The country has built quite a few small and inexpensive hotels that offer good conditions for budget tourists.  It is extremely difficult to choose the most suitable hotel from all the proposed ones, so today we will devote an article to the Don Joao Resorts 2 * hotel complex, which deserves the attention of not only budget travelers, but also people with average incomes. </p>

The houses located deep in the territory are blue in color.  Thanks to the bright colors, the whole hotel has a unique atmosphere, conducive to relaxation and fun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you plan to stay in Don Joao Resorts 2 *, then keep in mind that the hotel has a beautiful and well-groomed area with one drawback - it is divided into two parts expensive.  Therefore, the hotel is not worth choosing for families with small children for a long stay. </p><p>  Don Joao Resort 2 * in Goa was built in the ninety-third year of the last century.  Eight years ago, the hotel complex was renovated, so today it can please its guests with high-quality furniture and modern appliances. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is three thousand square meters, which housed cozy cottages, pools and a restaurant.

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Many guests say in their reviews that the hotel has a very convenient location.  It is quite easy to get to interesting tourist places and other resorts from it.  Therefore, lovers of an active lifestyle often choose Don Joao Resort 2 * in North Goa for accommodation. </p><p>  "Anjuna" is the beach closest to the hotel, located at a distance of five hundred meters from the main buildings.  Therefore, when booking a room, do not forget that the hotel complex is located on the second coastline, which, however, does not make the road to the sea very difficult.  About eighteen kilometers from the hotel is the capital of Goa - Panaji.  People often come here for sights and luxurious beaches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One and a half kilometers from the hotel is the most fashionable club in the resort and one of the most popular bars in all of North Goa.  From the Dabolim airport, where all Russian tourists fly to, Don Joao Resorts 2 * needs to get about an hour.  By taxi or any other transport, travelers will have to cover about forty-six kilometers. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Features </h2><p>  The hotel complex belongs to the category of small, so it offers guests only forty-five rooms.  They have a different category, and some of them lack air conditioning.  This must be taken into account when booking a room online or at a travel agency. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that the staff at Don Joao Resorts 2 * <span>(India, north of</span> Goa) does not speak Russian.  Also, employees understand English quite poorly, but this does not bring big problems to hotel guests.  Most issues are resolved quickly even with a lack of knowledge of the language.  This indicates the high professionalism of the hotel staff. </p><p>  Do not forget that pets are not allowed in the hotel.  Check-in occurs at three in the afternoon, in cases when your number is prepared in advance, it will be possible to check in earlier than the deadline. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is noteworthy that the Don Joao Resorts 2 * hotel has its own website, where all information about it is given and there is a special section for booking rooms.  Payment is accepted by bank and credit cards. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  There is a beautiful outdoor pool on site.  In the recreation area around it there are free sunbeds and umbrellas.  There is never a lot of people here, so places often remain free.  Breakfast is often served in the same area. </p><p>  Guests eat in a large and comfortable restaurant, but not all room categories include breakfast.  You can also have a meal in the cafe, which has a separate bar area.  Here, according to the guests, delicious cocktails are prepared and cheerful discos with dances are held until the morning. </p><p>  The reception at the hotel is open around the clock, so guests can always contact the duty staff.  A safe is provided for guests, and valuable things and money can be left in it.  At the reception there is a car rental and currency exchange.  It is worth noting that they are rarely used.  In India, tourists are usually afraid to travel by car on their own, and they try to change the currency in large branches of the bank. </p><h2>  Facilities and service </h2><p>  Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel; the signal catches perfectly even in the most remote rooms.  If desired, guests can take their things to the laundry room, located in a separate building of the hotel.  But you need to pay extra for this service immediately after the delivery of dirty clothes to the hotel staff. </p><p>  Don Joao Resorts 2 * also offers medical services.  A doctor works here who can provide first aid for various diseases.  However, keep in mind that this service is paid by guests additionally. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that the beach closest to the hotel is Anjuna.  It is considered municipal and free.  Many guests like that the beach is sandy.  This allows you to relax on it with young children, in addition, the entrance to the water on almost the entire beach area is gentle, and the bottom is not rocky. </p><p>  If you want to visit other beaches, then they are easily accessible by public transport.  This usually takes no more than twenty to thirty minutes.  Those tourists who managed to visit several beaches in North Goa, argue that they are similar to each other, so you should not go from one to another in search of the best. </p>

    <h2>  Description of rooms </h2><p>  Reviews about Don Joao Resort 2 * contain a lot of useful information about hotel rooms.  In general, we can say that the hotel complex is an excellent combination of price and quality. </p><p>  As we have said, all rooms are located in small cottages.  Most of the apartments consist of two rooms and balconies.  Typically, air-conditioned rooms include a small fridge, TV and ceiling fan.  The bathroom has a shower and a mirror.  Water is heated by means of a flow heater. </p><p>  Rooms are cleaned once every two days.  It is difficult to call it excellent, but the maids do not leave dirt in the rooms.  Bed linen is changed approximately once a week.  The sink and toilet bowl are extremely rarely washed.  However, such nuances rarely excite guests. </p>

    <h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  If you plan your vacation yourself, then it can cost you quite inexpensively.  After all, accommodation at the Don Joao Resorts 2 * hotel costs no more than seven hundred rupees per day. </p><p>  You can also purchase a tourist ticket to this hotel complex.  The cost of the tour for ten nights ranges from forty to eighty thousand rubles, depending on the season. </p><h2>  Hotel Don Joao Resorts 2 *: reviews </h2><p>  For all potential guests of this hotel, reviews of guests who have already managed to relax at the hotel are important.  There are quite a lot of them, so it will not be difficult to analyze them.  Naturally, tourists leave both positive and negative comments about living in Don Joao Resorts 2 *. </p><p>  First of all, we decided to talk about the advantages of this economy class hotel: </p><ul><li>  convenient location relative to infrastructure; </li><li>  good value for money; </li><li>  lack of theft; </li><li>  friendly and friendly staff; </li><li>  a luxurious beach with lots of cheap cafes; </li><li>  calm atmosphere in the hotel. </li></ul><p>  Such an abundance of pluses is a very good indicator for a hotel complex with two stars.  However, do not forget about the minuses that our compatriots noticed in their reviews: </p><ul><li>  very poor and tasteless breakfasts; </li><li>  the abundance of insects in the rooms; </li><li>  antique furniture in need of repair and painting; </li><li>  early blackout in many establishments around the hotel (hour X occurs at nine in the evening); </li><li>  lack of cosmetic sets in the bathrooms; </li><li>  old and often full of linen. </li></ul><p>  Despite the abundance of minuses, most tourists find the hotel quite suitable for a short stay.  They advise you to come here with a positive attitude for rest and relaxation.  Keep in mind that India is a rather peculiar country filled with contrasts.  Therefore, choosing a hotel, do not expect European service and service.  This is almost impossible to find here, however, a vacation at Don Joao Resorts 2 * will not disappoint you. </p>
