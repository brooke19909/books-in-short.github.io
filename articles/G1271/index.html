Greece awaits tourists at any time of the year</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Greece is located in the south of Europe.  The country is washed by the Ionian, Mediterranean, <span>Aegean seas</span> and has a subtropical Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and warm, rainy winters.  Depending on the specific area, weather conditions can vary greatly.  Thus, the climate on the <span>islands of Greece</span> and in the southern parts of the country is milder than in the northern and central regions.  In the north in winter, even freezing temperatures can be observed, especially in November-January.  The coolness is accompanied by rainy weather.  The driest period in this area is from July to September.  The islands and southern zones have a warmer climate.  In the hottest months (July, August), the temperature can rise to + 40 ° C and higher, but such heat is more easily tolerated on the islands than on the mainland.  Winter is drier than in the north, the <span>average temperature</span> is + 5- + 10 ° .  Let’s take a closer look at the climate in Greece for months. </p>

    <p>  This time of year begins with universal flowering: buds swell, wild flowers bloom - literally Greece is transforming before our eyes.  The climate during this period is not the same in different regions.  The temperature in the country in March can vary from +14 to + 19 ° C, light rain is typical.  In the sea, the water is still cool - it does not exceed + 16 ° .  In April, the weather gets warmer, violent flowering continues, and even arid islands such as Crete and the Cyclades are covered with green carpet.  At this time, the sea has not yet been warmed up, but the air temperature has already reached + 20- + 23 ° .  In May, the country plunges into summer - bathing seasons open on the islands.  The water temperature for this period is usually + 19 ... + 21 ° C.  The second half of May is a very good time to relax, at this time of the year in the island part a sunny, warm, but not hot climate prevails.  Greece, however, has not yet been occupied by tourists, as happens in July and August, so prices for tours and services are quite reasonable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In June, it becomes really hot already, however, maximum temperatures are ahead.  Sea water warms up to + 25 ° , air - up to + 30 °  and higher.  Swimming in the sea during this period is comfortable for both adults and children, so you can safely go on vacation in the first half of June.  In July, the climate becomes even hotter.  Greece is overwhelmed by heat.  And if in the north the temperature reaches + 35 ° C, then in the center it can be +40, or even + 45 ° C.  Water in the sea becomes warmer by another 1-2 ° C.  August is characterized by weather similar to that of July, but the heat at this time is more easily tolerated due to the coolness brought by the sea monsoons. </p>

    <p>  September is still reminiscent of summer, this is one of the best months to travel to the country - there are fewer tourists, the weather is not so hot, but it is still comfortable and without rain.  And most importantly, what attracts vacationers is the warmest sea, perfectly warmed up over the summer.  Outside the temperature is around + 30 ° C, breathing is easy thanks to sea monsoons.  In October, the climate becomes cooler.  Greece during this period is subject to rains, but short-term.  Nevertheless, the velvet season is still ongoing, the air temperature is approximately + 25 ° C, and the water temperature is + 20 ° C.  At the end of October, it’s already risky to go on <span>holiday to Greece</span> - the rainy season is coming, although clear days will certainly meet.  Rest at this time on the southern islands (Patmos, Crete, Rhodes) - there the weather is still an order of magnitude warmer, the rains are much less frequent, and the water is still warmed up to + 24 ° .  And only in November autumn begins - swimming in the sea is already cold, but you can devote time to excursions and walks.  The temperature in the street is about + 20- + 22 ° . </p>

    <p>  Winter time is characterized by regional temperatures ranging from +5 to + 13 ° C.  It may snow, but it usually melts while still in the air.  The mountains have a colder climate.  Greece opens the ski season, snow in the mountains can lie until April.  The weather in December is cool, the temperature is + 10- + 12 ° C, swimming in the sea, of course, is no longer possible.  Nevertheless, tourists continue to visit Greece, they are attracted at this time by the upcoming series of holidays, starting from the <span>day of St. Nicholas</span> on December 6 and ending with Christmas and New Year.  By the way, in January the weather can make a nice gift - sometimes the temperature at this time rises to + 20 ° C.  The Greeks call this event alkionic days, because according to myths it is believed that a sharp warming is associated with the removal by chickens (birds) of chicks.  In February, the weather usually becomes windy, humid.  On average, the temperature in the country is set at + 12 ° . </p>
