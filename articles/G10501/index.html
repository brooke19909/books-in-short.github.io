    <p>  Turquoise lake is located near the small Crimean village of Zaprudnoe.  Due to the fact that this is one of the mountain reservoirs, the path to it is very difficult.  Moreover, the duration of the mountain climb to it is about a dozen kilometers - the beginning is located near Partenit. </p><p>  Local residents pay special attention to the fact that the mountain road has not been repaired for a long time and today has fallen into decay.  Therefore, many advise to get to the eminent reservoir not on a personal car, but on another transport - on a horse, bicycle or even on foot.  Turquoise lake in Crimea (Zaprudnoe), although it is a landmark of the peninsula, but the roads to it leave much to be desired. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Finding the right place is not difficult - all the surroundings of Turquoise <span>Lake of Crimea</span> are strewn with lots of signs for the guests of these places.  The main thing is to get to Partenit. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there by public transport? </h2><p>  Many guests of the Crimean peninsula prefer to travel on it without personal cars - public transport is also well developed in these places.

    <p>  Some local residents and guests of the region believe in the serious magical power that the waters of the lake possess.  According to local beliefs, they save from the seal of loneliness, as well as from such misfortune as the <span>crown of celibacy.</span>  There are many legends that reveal the amazing power of turquoise water. </p><p>  The waters of Turquoise Lake in Crimea are always cool, even on the hottest summer days.  There is a simple explanation for this - the pond is fed from a variety of sources spurting from the ground.  They bring cold jets into the thickness of warm water. </p><h2>  How the lake appeared </h2><p>  This reservoir appeared partially as a result of human activity.  Significant limestone deposits were discovered in these places several decades ago.  As part of its mining, heavy equipment dug up a full-fledged quarry.  But soon, from the very bottom, the source began to beat. </p><p>  All lime mining operations were hastily curtailed.  And the abandoned quarry was soon filled with water of the original turquoise hue.  The peculiarity of this lake is not only in the specific color of its water.  The fact is that it has a salty taste. </p><p>  Where is the Turquoise lake in the Crimea, all local residents know.  Also, this reservoir is known as the Jubilee or <span>Emerald Lake.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Beach Holiday Options </h2><p>  Guests of Turquoise Lake will certainly find something to do in these places.  The most common local activities are fishing, as well as beach vacations. </p><p>  Mostly family vacations, picnics are practiced here.  The lake itself is located in the territory of Alushta forestry.  Therefore, nature is carefully protected here.  Nevertheless, fishing is permitted in these places by fishing rods, as well as roasting barbecue on an open fire. </p><p>  Those who decide to stay here should admire the area from the heights of the Ayu-Dag mountain range located in the immediate vicinity. </p><p>  For lovers of intellectual relaxation in neighboring Partenit there is a stone museum.  Many of its exhibits possess not only artistic, but also scientific value. </p><h2>  Natural wealth of Turquoise Lake </h2><p>  Crimean nature is famous for its uniqueness.  In any corner of the peninsula there is a mass of beautiful places, to the creation of which a human hand was not attached.  Turquoise lake is no exception. </p><p>  The pond is located high in the mountains, surrounded by forests.  Many specimens from relict plants grow here.  Mountain vegetation is presented in a great variety, including coniferous trees.  This explains the fact that in the vicinity of the lake it is very easy to breathe.  Pure coniferous air is intertwined with echoes of aromas of natural local herbs. </p>
