At the dawn of its history, namely at the beginning of the XVIII century, this part of Vasilyevsky Island was part of the estate owned by Alexander Danilovich Menshikov.  In the XIX century, there were located warehouses for wine owned by the merchants of the Eliseevs.  In 1824, it was in this building that their firm began to function.

For 6 hours of renting a place for a car, you will have to pay 550 rubles, and for a whole day - 1100 rubles. </p><p>  The hotel is always open for people with disabilities.  Especially for them, special rooms have been developed, in which there is a lot of free space for unimpeded movement, the absence of steps on the floor and special handrails in the bathroom. </p><p>  The special concierge service at Solo Sokos Hotel Palace Bridge is ready to help guests with any questions.  Booking a taxi, searching for tickets to the best places in theaters or to the most interesting exhibitions, organizing excursions - all this can be done by hotel employees, whose counter is on the right side of the main entrance to the hotel. </p>

    <p>  Another unusual hotel service is the presence of a real golf academy.  Professionals can play here and beginners can train.  The presence of special platforms and simulators makes the process of training blows simple and affordable.  Also on the territory of the golf club you can organize some kind of golf-style event. </p><h2>  What guests say about the Solo Sokos Hotel in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Most of the reviews about Solo Sokos Hotel Palace Bridge characterize this hotel as very good.  Numerous guests who could afford a rather cheap vacation here praise the local spa most of all.  However, some note that there are quite a lot of people in it because guests here come from other St. Petersburg hotels of the Sokos chain. </p><p>  Hotel guests also respond positively about the hotel staff and comfortable rooms, however, someone managed to see minor flaws in the cleaning and evaluate the not very good sound insulation.  Of particular delight is the location of the hotel, which allows you to see many of the sights of the city, practically without leaving your room. </p>

    <p>  Of the minuses, guests pay special attention to the high cost of breakfast and a small number of sun loungers in the spa area, because often they are not enough for everyone.  Also, for the fulfillment of some requests you have to pay, for example, for the delivery of dishes to a room with a kitchen.  This fact also disappoints the guests. </p>
