Why is the water here so clean, there are several versions.  Some say that the reason is in the filtration properties of the soil.  Others tend to purify the water with a local colony of mussels.  Still others consider the proximity of the calcareous rocky cape Taranhut to be the reason. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Geographically, the Kristi Hotel (Crimea, Yevpatoriya, Mirny) is located on the Yuzh Spit, located between the Black Sea and <span>Lake Donuzlav,</span> 28 kilometers from Yevpatoriya, 5 kilometers from the village of Mirny (the former military town of the aviation unit), on the territory of the Garden Association "Neptune". </p><p>  The village is surrounded by the sea on three sides.  In addition to the remarkable purity of the water, the shallow sandy sea bay of Donuzlav, ideal for safe bathing of children, brings its nuance to a beach holiday.  Another neighboring water resource is the estuary, rich in special healing mineral mud. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  The spacious four-story specialized building, designed for 54 hotel rooms, houses the Kristi Hotel (Crimea, Yevpatoriya, Mirny).  Reviews about the rest in it indicate that this hotel complex is most suitable for a quiet family vacation. </p><p>  It is in demand among tourists (tours to it should be bought ahead of time, for 3-4 months) and is considered one of the best in Yevpatoriya.  On the part of the administration and staff of the hotel complex, all conditions have been created for this.  The hotel complex is new, well-groomed.  It offers beautiful sea views. </p>

    <p>  However, hotel guests write in their reviews about the lack of modern landscape design on its territory. </p><p>  In order to specialize the Kristi Hotel (Crimea) in terms of youth recreation, infrastructure investments are needed: clubs, bars, discos should be built.  Due to its natural potential, such a project can and should be successful. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel "Christie" (Mirny, Crimea) is really comfortable and guarantees a pleasant beach vacation and good food.  It is ideal for people seeking solitude and peace.  The hotel complex pleases its guests with a classic interior design, good furniture and working appliances.  However, from the point of view of a tourist, his infrastructure is not without some drawbacks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Firstly, the administration has not solved the problem of cheap transfer to the city.  Almost 30 km from the hotel to Yevpatoriya, which is called the capital of the steppe and northwestern Crimea.  Taxi is the only transport with which a hotel guest who went shopping can get to shopping centers (ATB, Fourchette, Fresh, Console, Gezlev, Natalie), markets and other trading establishments.  And for a one-way trip, a tourist must pay a taxi driver 800 rubles. </p><p>  Secondly, the problem of fixed-route taxis has not been resolved in the region.  In principle, a good hotel "Christie" (Crimea), which is declared by tour operators as located in the <span>village of Mirny,</span> is actually 5 km away from it.  This means that if necessary, buy medicine or withdraw money from the card, you will have to go to Mirny and again use the expensive transport. </p><h2>  Service and Facilities </h2><p>  The services characteristic of four-star hotels are also available at the Christie Hotel (Crimea).  Reviews, however, indicate the absence of hotel pools at it, but there is a lake nearby. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has a 24-hour mini-market, an underground parking, a water sports center - diving and surfing.  Wi-Fi is free throughout. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A round-the-clock reception is functioning well, the girls are quick and friendly: guests are consulted, and they also fulfill their requests in the current time mode. </p><p>  The hotel employs children's animators.  They skillfully entertain children with games both at the hotel and on the beach.  However, parents should keep an eye on their children.  The fact is that the hotel has a lot of children and it is physically difficult for the animator to see everyone at the same time.  Every evening, a half-hour disco is held for children. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Four types of guest rooms are offered to their guests by the Kristi Hotel (Crimea, Yevpatoriya).  The reviews allow us to judge that all of them - 23 standard rooms, 24 junior suites, 6 suites, and, of course, a VIP room - were pleasant to those living in them.  The rooms are spacious, bright, comfortable.  Each has a balcony with sea views and a bathroom with a shower.  Air conditioning is working properly. </p><p>  The furniture in the rooms corresponds to the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù level, it is comfortable and worn out.  Sheets and towels are fresh.  The bathroom is equipped with regularly replenished hygiene products.  But drinking water is present in the refrigerator only upon arrival. </p><p>  Room cleaning is done daily and carefully - the administration controls this process. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The excellent spacious and well-maintained sandy beach with a smooth entry into the water is enjoyed by the Kristi Hotel (Crimea, Mirny).  Reviews of him indicate that in reality he is municipal, not hotel, so not hotel guests come here to relax. </p>

    <p>  However, the outstanding quality of this beach more than covers all the "cons".  Resorts are delighted with him!  The water is clear, has a turquoise hue.  The beach is carefully cleaned and its finest sand is clean.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are more than enough.  True, tourists recommend taking beach towels in the morning, since their number is limited. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Guests can choose the best type of food for themselves: only breakfast, half board or guesthouse. </p><p>  Breakfast at the hotel is light.  Two types of porridge, scrambled eggs and omelet, 3-4 vegetable salads, cheese, sausages, sausage, yogurt, pancakes, pancakes, jam, tea, coffee.  Lunch is organized not according to the buffet method, but traditionally in Russian: two or three versions of the first and second, three or four types of salad.  For the preparation of main dishes, chicken, fish, and less often pork are used.  Everything is very delicious. </p><p>  Dinner by assortment resembles lunch, but without first courses. </p>

    <p>  The double opinion is expressed by the guests about the food with which they are treated by the Christie Hotel (Mirny, Crimea).  This is not about the quality of the restaurant's dishes.  On the contrary, it is excellent.  It is given, as an argument, a comparison of a modest assortment of Christie dishes and Turkish hotels similar in stardom.  And, according to many tourists, although we have fewer choices, they do feed Crimean cooks at home, and therefore there is no poisoning.  Which of the arguing rights?  Probably, as usual, the truth is somewhere in the middle. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  An extensive list of fascinating excursions is offered to its guests by the Kristi Hotel (Crimea).  We list some of them: </p><ol><li>  Visit to the water park "Banana Coast" (the largest in the Crimea). </li><li>  Toplva Monastery. </li><li>  Excursion in Sevastopol, in Evpatoria. </li><li>  <span>Mount Demerdzhi</span> and waterfall Dzhur-Dzhur. </li><li>  Karst caves of Crimea. </li><li>  Visiting winemaking enterprises. </li><li>  ATV rides. </li><li>  Khan's Palace in Bakhchisarai. </li><li>  The city in the caves, Mangul. </li></ol><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Hotel guests have the opportunity to join windsurfing or kitesurfing.  In just a few lessons, experienced instructors will help them learn how to glide along the waves under sail.  Lake Donuzlav is perfect for this. </p><p>  The surf school owns the equipment necessary for this occupation: wetsuits, sails, boards.  There are special options for drying wetsuits. </p>

    <p>  The hotel also has a diving school.  Donuzlav Lake is an ideal place where, at a shallow depth (only 2-3 m) and with excellent transparency, you can admire fish, shrimp and crab, jellyfish poured in the sun. </p><p>  The hotel complex rents catamarans to its guests, rents yachts and boats.  Watercraft allow tourists to travel along the coast of Donuzlav.  Even beginners can use the catamaran on the lake.  After all, its average depth off the coast is only 2 meters. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  For experienced tourists, a lot of geographic names say - the village of Mirny, Crimea.  Hotel Kristi, a comfortable modern hotel complex, is currently located in a remote province with outstanding natural resources.  This has its pros and cons.  Hotel guests have to travel 30 kilometers to Evpatoria, the capital of the steppe and northwestern Crimea, while overpaying for taxi drivers. </p><p>  However, experienced tourists who have acquired a tour to the Christie Hotel (Crimea) have also learned how to "make lemonade out of lemons" here.  With one shot they kill two birds with one stone, that is, ease their problems of shopping and excursions by renting a car in Simferopol (the hotel has a guarded parking lot for vehicles). </p><p>  The question of where to go shopping is already covered by us.  The list of <span>shopping centers in Yevpatoriya</span> is presented in this article above. </p><p>  Tourists are always worried about the traditional question for them: what makes sense to buy in the recreation area as a souvenir?  Of course, I want to buy something purely local. </p>

    <p>  Valuable and rare plants used for the production of aromatic oils grow in the steppe part of Crimea - mountain lavender and fennel, hyssop and wormwood, rosemary and juniper, <span>clary sage</span> and cypress.  All of them are popular with tourists. </p><p>  Of course, the traditional "sea souvenirs" are the original shells, dried sea crabs and other inhabitants of the sea, selected sea stones.  You can choose them to your taste among a wide range of numerous souvenir shops. </p><p>  According to tourists' reviews, natural grape wines from the Evpatoria winery "The Sun in a Glass" and "Bastardo" can become a good small souvenir.  They are very different from the powder analogues of the same name, which have clogged the shelves of our stores.  As they say, feel the difference. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  For many tourists who had a rest in this hotel, the words ‚ÄúCrimea‚Äù, ‚ÄúHotel Christie‚Äù, ‚Äúp. Mirny‚Äù sound like pleasant music.  Those who stayed there at least once immediately recall the stunning natural resource of this amazing healing place, the gorgeous beach, the comfort of a four-star hotel complex, the friendliness of the staff, which turns tourists into a small pleasant fairy tale.  The hotel has long been chosen by families with children who value a calm, comfortable stay.  It is in demand, and in the high season it is quite difficult to purchase tours to it. </p>
