The monk warriors who took the vow of chastity, obedience and poverty very quickly turned into a real force, which everyone in Europe reckoned with.  This organization combined the spirit and martial traditions of the Templars with the charitable activities of the hospital admirers, while at the same time being a conductor of the aggressive policy in the East conducted by Western Europe.  The article is devoted to the history of the Teutonic Order: the origin, development, death and legacy that has passed through the centuries. </p><h2>  The situation of Christians in the Holy Land during the Third Crusade </h2><p>  Crusades to the Holy Land became fertile ground for the appearance of the first spiritual orders of chivalry.  They became the embodiment of a medieval religious spirit, the mood of European society, eager to protect Christian shrines and co-religionists from the aggression of Islam.  On the one hand, it was a necessary need to consolidate all reserves, and on the other, the Roman Catholic Church skillfully took advantage of it to strengthen its own influence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knights of the teutonic order" class="if uuid-2707453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2707453.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the Teutonic Order originates during the Third Crusade (1189-1192nd).  The situation for Christians at that time was extremely difficult: they were squeezed out of Jerusalem.  Only the city of Tire in the Principality of Antioch survived.  Conrad Montferratsky, who ruled there, successfully restrained the onslaught of Muslims, but his forces were melting away.  The situation was changed by reinforcements that arrived from Europe, the composition of which was very diverse: warriors, pilgrims, merchants, artisans, and a lot of strange people who followed any army during the Middle Ages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The first appearance of the German-speaking knighthood in the Holy Land </h2><p>  On the southern side of the peninsula washed by Haifa Bay, the port city of Acra was located in those days.  Thanks to its excellent protection, the port was able to unload and load cargo in almost any weather.  This tidbit could not go unnoticed by the humble ‚Äúwarriors of the Lord.‚Äù  Baron Guy de Luisignan made a desperate attempt to besiege the city, even though the garrison of the defenders exceeded his strength several times. </p><p>  However, the biggest test and trouble during all the medieval wars was the lack of medicine.  Unsanitary conditions, a huge concentration of people in one place were excellent conditions for the development of various diseases, such as typhoid.  Knights of the Teutonic Order, hospitals, Templars as they could fight this scourge.  Almshouses were the only place where help was provided by the pilgrims who tried in this way to go to heaven for their deeds.  Among them were representatives of the trade circles of Bremen and L√ºbeck.  Their initial task was to create a German-speaking knighthood fraternity to help the sick and injured. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixels.com" data-author=": Serge Averbukh, "><img itemprop="image" alt="teutonic order history" class="if uuid-2707477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2707477.jpg"></div><p>  In the future, the possibility of building a certain military organization to protect and support their trade operations was considered.  This was done in order to no longer depend on the Knights Templar, which had a huge influence in the region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The son of the drowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick Barbarossa, favorably reacted to this idea and at first supported the created almshouses.  This explains the fact that the knights of the Teutonic Order had excellent relations with the Holy Roman Empire.  Very often they even acted as intermediaries between its rulers and the heads of the Roman Catholic Church.  With such full support, created in 1198 by the Brotherhood of the Teutonic Church of St. Mary of Jerusalem, did everything possible to justify high trust. </p><p>  Soon, like their colleagues, the organization of the Knights of the Teutonic Order acquired large land holdings not only in the Holy Land, but mainly in Europe.  It was there that the main, most combat-ready forces of the brotherhood were concentrated. </p><h2>  The structure of the Teutonic Order </h2><p>  The provinces (commissions) of the order were located in Livonia, Puglia, Teutonia, Austria, Prussia, Armenia and Romania.  The chronicles mention seven large provinces, but there were also smaller possessions. </p><p>  Each position and title in the order was elective.  Even the head of the order, the Great Grandmaster, was elected and was obliged to consult with 5 grossgebiters (Great Lords).  Each of these 5 permanent advisers was responsible for a certain direction in the order: </p><ol><li>  The Great Komtur (the right hand of the head of the order and its quartermaster). </li><li>  High Marshal. </li><li>  Supreme Hospitaller (managed all the hospitals of the organization). </li><li>  Quartermaster. </li><li>  Treasurer. </li></ol><p>  The administration of a certain province was carried out by Land Comtur.  He also had to consult, but with the chapter.  Even the commander of the fortress garrison (castellan) made this or that decision with an eye on the opinions of the soldiers under his command. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to the chronicles, the Teutonic knights were not distinguished by discipline.  For the same Templars, the orders were much tougher.  Nevertheless, at first, the organization quite effectively coped with the tasks assigned to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dumielauxepices.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knighting of the teutonic order" class="if uuid-2707451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2707451.jpg"></div><h2>  Organization Composition </h2><p>  Members of the chivalric fraternity were divided into categories, each of which had certain functions.  At the very top, as expected in those days, there were brothers-knights.  These are the descendants of noble families, who constituted the elite of the Order‚Äôs troops.  A little lower in status in this structure were the priest brothers who organized the ceremonial, ideological component of the ministry in the order.  In addition, they were still engaged in various sciences and were perhaps the most educated members of the community. </p><p>  The common people who were engaged in both military and church services were called other brothers. </p><p>  The Knights of the Teutonic Order also attracted laymen who were not bound by solemn vows, but who nevertheless brought considerable benefit.  They were represented by two main categories: half-brothers and familiars.  Familiars are generous sponsors from among the richest sections of the population.  And half-brothers were involved in various economic activities. </p><h2>  Knight of the Teutonic Order </h2><p>  There was a certain selection for all candidates who wanted to join the movement of the "liberators" of the Holy Sepulcher.  It took place on the basis of a conversation, during which important details of the biography were clarified.  Before starting the questioning, the chapter warned of a life full of hardships.  This is a service to a higher idea until the end of life. </p><p>  Only after this it was necessary to make sure that the newcomer was not previously in another order, had no spouse and debts.  He himself is no one's creditor, and if he is, he has forgiven or has already settled this sensitive issue.  The knight dogs of the Teutonic Order do not tolerate money-grubbing. </p><p>  The presence of a serious illness was a significant obstacle.  In addition, it was necessary to have complete personal freedom.  Everything secret sooner or later becomes apparent.  If unpleasant facts of fraud were revealed, then, despite his merits, such a member of the fraternity was expelled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knights of the Teutonic Order Typhoid" class="if uuid-2707436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2707436.jpg"></div><p>  At the initiation into the knights of the Teutonic Order, a sacred oath was taken on the observance of chastity, obedience and poverty until death.  From now on, fasting, prayers, military affairs, hard physical labor were to tame the body and spirit on the way to finding a place in paradise.  Despite these harsh conditions, more and more people wanted to become part of the ‚Äúarmy of Christ‚Äù, to carry his word with fire and sword into the lands of the Gentiles. </p><p>  Religious fanaticism in the fragile minds of the crowd, not wishing to think and live independently, at all times, preachers of various kinds skillfully heat up.  In the Middle Ages, the romantic halo that surrounded robbers, rapists and murderers, and also ‚Äúdefenders of the Christian faith‚Äù, was so blinding that many young men from the most distinguished and respected families of that time did not hesitate to choose the path of a monk warrior. </p><p>  The virgin knight of the Teutonic Order could find solace only in prayers and in the hope that sooner or later his soul would rush to paradise. </p><h2>  Appearance and Symbols </h2><p>  <span>A black cross</span> on a white background is one of the most striking and recognizable symbols of the order.  So in popular culture it is customary to portray the Teutonic.  However, not all members of this community had the right to wear such a robe.  For each hierarchical level, the regulation clearly defined symbolism.  She was reflected in the arms, robes. </p><p>  The coat of arms of the head of the order emphasized his vassal devotion to the German emperor.  Another yellow cross with a shield and an eagle was superimposed on a black cross with a yellow border.  The heraldry of other hierarchs raises many disputes and disagreements.  But it‚Äôs known for sure that the leadership of smaller administrative units had special wands indicating their supremacy and the right to conduct courts. </p><p>  Only the knight brothers had the right to wear white cloaks with black crosses.  For all other categories of knights of the Teutonic Order, the vestments were gray cloaks with a T-shaped cross.  This extended to mercenary commanders. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Teutonic Knights" class="if uuid-2707459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2707459.jpg"></div><h2>  Asceticism </h2><p>  Even Bernard of Clairvaux, a spiritual leader and one of the ideological inspirers of the Crusades, drew a clear line between monastic and worldly knights.  According to him, traditional chivalry was on the side of the Devil.  Lush <span>clothes, knightly</span> tournaments, luxury - all this removed them from the Lord.  A true Christian warrior is dirty, with a long beard and hair, despising worldly vanity, focused on fulfilling a sacred duty.  When going to bed, the brothers did not take off their clothes and boots.  Therefore, it is not surprising that typhus and knights of the Teutonic Order always walked hand in hand. </p><p>  However, almost the whole "cultural" Europe for a long time, even after the Crusades, neglected the rules of basic hygiene.  And as punishment - multi-shift outbreaks of plague and smallpox, destroying most of its population. </p><p>  Having a huge influence in society, Bernard of Clairvaux (even the papacy listened to his opinion) easily pushed his ideas, which for a long time excited minds.  Describing the life of the knight of the Teutonic Order of the 13th century, it should be mentioned that, despite the high rank in the hierarchy of the organization, any member had the right to have only a certain set of personal belongings.  These included: a pair of shirts and two pairs of boots, a mattress, surco, a knife.  Locks on chests did not hang.  It was forbidden to wear any fur. </p><p>  It was forbidden to wear their coats of arms and boast of their origin during hunting, tournaments.  The only entertainment allowed was woodcarving. </p><p>  Various penalties for misconduct were envisaged.  One of these was the "removal of the mantle and the meal on the floor."  The guilty knight had no right to sit at the common table with the other brothers until the penalty was lifted.  This punishment was most often resorted to for serious violations in the campaign.  For example, a violation of the system. </p><h2>  Armor </h2><p>  The basis of the protective equipment of the knight of the Teutonic Order in full growth was chain mail with long sleeves.  A chain hood was attached to it.  Under it were worn quilted gambizon or caftan.  A quilted cap covered his head over the chain mail.  A shell was put on top of the listed uniforms.  German and Italian blacksmiths paid close attention to the issue of armor modernization (their English and French colleagues did not show such agility).  The result was a significant increase in plate armor.  His lapel, back parts were connected at the shoulders, having lacing on the sides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="i24web.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="virgin knight of the teutonic order" class="if uuid-2707465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2707465.jpg"></div><p>  If until about the middle of the 14th century the breastplate was relatively small, designed to protect the chest, then this mistake was later corrected.  The stomach was now also covered. </p><p>  Experiments with steel, the lack of qualified personnel, and the combination of German and Italian styles in the arms industry led to the fact that the main material for the manufacture of such equipment was "white" steel. </p><p>  The protection of the legs was usually made up by chain mail stockings, steel knee pads.  They wore legguards.  In addition, there were leggings made of one plate.  The spurs of the knights were studded and gilded. </p><h2>  Armament </h2><p>  The uniform and armament of the knights of the Teutonic Order were distinguished by excellent efficiency.  The influence of not only the best traditions of the West, but also the East was observed.  If we touch on the topic of small arms of the time, then, judging by the surviving documents that describe in detail the characteristics and type of cocked mechanism, some conclusions suggest themselves: </p><ul><li>  ordinary, rifle and composite crossbows stood out; </li><li>  firearms were mastered with enthusiasm; </li><li>  part of this type of weaponry the order was able to produce on its own. </li></ul><p>  Swords were considered more noble weapons, but some of the heads of the Catholic Church anathematized crossbows.  True, few people paid attention to this.  In war, all means are good. </p><p>  The most popular means of close combat were combat axes and hammers.  After being in Palestine, the shape of an ax blade was borrowed there.  They could easily break through the armor.  The sword could not boast of such characteristics. </p><h2>  Martial traditions </h2><p>  Knights of the Teutonic Order favorably differed from lay knights in their discipline.  The charter of the order regulated every little thing, not only in battle.  Typically, the knight was accompanied by several of his squires with camp horses that did not participate in the hostilities.  The war horse was used only in battle, but even with several spare animals, warriors often traveled long distances on foot.  It was strictly forbidden to mount a horse or put on armor without an order. </p><p>  In military matters, the Teutons were pragmatic.  Traditional knighthood on the battlefields could easily start a swara for the right to be the first to attack, in order to cover the name with glory.  Even while in battle, they could easily break the line or arbitrarily give a signal.  And this is a direct road to defeat.  The Teutons had such offenses punishable by death. </p><p>  Their combat formation was carried out in three lines.  The reserve was located in the third line.  Heavy knights came to the front line.  Behind them in the form of an elongated quadrangle usually mounted riders and auxiliary forces.  Closed the construction of the Order Infantry. </p><p>  There was a definite meaning in such a distribution of forces: a heavy wedge violated the enemy‚Äôs battle formations, while the lesser-fighting detachments that followed led to the shaken enemy of the knighthood. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knights of the teutonic order uniforms and weapons" class="if uuid-2707489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2707489.jpg"></div><h2>  Battle of Grunwald </h2><p>  Most of all, the Teutonic Order annoyed the Poles and Litvinians.  They were his main enemies.  Even having a numerical superiority, Jagiello and Vytautas understood that the victory in this battle would go to the one whose morale would be stronger.  Therefore, they were in no hurry, even despite the dissatisfied whispers of their most ardent warriors, to get involved in the battle. </p><p>  Before appearing on the battlefield, the Teutonians overcame a huge distance in the rain and settled in the open space under the cover of their artillery, languishing from the heat.  And their opponents took refuge in the shade of the forest and, despite accusations of cowardice, were in no hurry to leave. </p><p> The battle began with the battle cry "Lithuania", and the Litvin cavalry destroyed the guns.  Proper construction made it possible to get to the Teutons with minimal losses.  This sowed panic in the ranks of the German infantry, and then death, but from their own cavalry - Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen spared no one in the heat of battle.  The light Litvin cavalry fulfilled its task: the guns were destroyed, and the heavy cavalry of the Teutons entered the cabin ahead of schedule.  But on the side of the combined forces there were losses.  Tatar cavalry fled without looking back. </p><p>  Poles and chivalry clashed in a cruel cabin.  The Litvins, meanwhile, lured the crusaders into the woods, where an ambush was waiting for them.  All this time, the Poles and soldiers from Smolensk courageously opposed the best army of Europe at that time.  The return of the Litvinians raised the morale of the Poles.  And then a reserve of both sides was introduced into the battle.  Even the peasants of the Litvin and Poles rushed to the rescue in this difficult hour.  The Great Grossmeister also participated in this cruel, merciless rags, where he found his death. </p><p>  The ancestors of the Poles, Belarusians, Russians, Ukrainians, Tatars, Czechs and many other peoples stopped the faithful dogs of the Vatican.  Nowadays, you can see only photos of a knight of the Teutonic Order or attend the annual festival of the Battle of Grunwald - another common victory that united the fate of different nations. </p>
