Health effects</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For many years, humanity cannot unambiguously answer the question of what is the impact of the parade of planets on human health and well-being of the inhabitants of the Earth.  The fact is that the science of astrology is very closely intertwined with various beliefs and Vedic practices.  Many false prophets and foretellers in every possible way intimidate people with scary predictions about the end of the world, connecting it with a parade of planets.  On the Internet - in social networks and on the pages of various sites - you can find a huge number of "horror stories" about Armageddon.  In this article, we will try to figure out whether these words really have at least some truth and how the parade of planets affects a person. </p><h2>  The emergence of astrology </h2><p>  Astrology is one of the most ancient sciences that originated in Egypt, studying the movement of celestial bodies and their influence on our planet.  Our ancestors are still in the 5th century.  BC  e.  began to notice that the stars in the sky are constantly moving and have a certain effect on the earth, water and people.  Moreover, ancient civilizations knew exactly what <span>impact the parade of planets has on man.</span>  The famous astrologer P. Huber, having read one of the predictions of the Sumerian priests, decided to check it.  The text said that during one of the solar eclipses one of the kings of Akkad would die.  Having checked the data on the time of death of the members of this dynasty with the calendar of eclipses, he found out that indeed this prediction came true at least 3 times. </p>

    <p>  Druids studied astrology very deeply.  It is known that they knew about the influence of celestial bodies on everything living, about their size, that they are constantly in motion and what effect the planet parade has on human health.  The proof of this is the well-known Stonehenge.  This structure was the temple of the Druids, where they could observe the movement of celestial bodies.  Since these priests did not have written language, their knowledge did not reach our times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Planets and other celestial bodies </h2><p>  Thanks to Galileo Galilei and his first telescopes, scientists were able to find out that in our galaxy called the Milky Way, there are four inner planets: Earth, Venus, Mars and Mercury - and four outer planets: Neptune, Uranus, Jupiter and Saturn.  All these planets revolve around a central star called the Sun.  Each planet is located in its own elliptical orbit.  With the development of astronomy, it also became known that in addition to the 8 major planets in the solar system, there are 6 dwarf planets: Eris, Ceres, Pluto, Makemake, Haumea and the Ninth Planet.  The latter was discovered in January 2016, and its exact location is still being studied. </p>

    <p>  According to recent studies, our solar system has about 200 billion different celestial bodies.  It also became known that they move in their orbits and at a certain moment can build one solid line - a parade of planets.  The more celestial bodies become in a row, the less often such an event is observed.  That is why to find out what effect of the parade of planets on human health is quite difficult, because this happens not so often. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A bit about the moon and the sun </h2><p>  The moon is a celestial body that is a satellite of the earth.  The ancient Egyptians called it Yah, and the Babylonians called Sin.  This night star is quite interesting and keeps a huge number of secrets and mysteries.  For example, scientists have found that during the day the air temperature on the Moon is above +100 ¬∞ C, and at night below -160 ¬∞ C.  It is also known that the Earth and its satellite move synchronously and make a complete revolution in 27 days.  It is for this reason that the Moon is always turned to the Earth with only one side.  An interesting fact is that its other side looks completely different and has practically no visible depressions and bends.  Since the moon is a satellite of the earth, it has a definite effect on it.  <span>The force of attraction</span> between these two celestial bodies is so great that they can be said to be interconnected, most likely, therefore, synchronous. </p>

    <p>  This can also explain the effect of the parade of planets on the well-being of a person, because all the planets in the solar system are attracted to certain objects of space.  In the Milky Way on all the planets (including the Sun including) the force of gravity acts.  In other words, we can say that the entire solar system is connected by invisible threads, and that is why every celestial body has a certain effect on our planet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ebbs and flows </h2><p>  These fluctuations in the water in the sea and ocean are evidence that the sun and moon have a very strong influence on our planet.  The moon, due to its <span>gravitational force,</span> attracts water to itself.  As you know, our satellite revolves around the Earth: when it approaches, water tends to meet it (high tide), when it moves away, it leaves after the Moon (low tide).  Some scientists believe that the effect of the parade of planets on human health is associated with this particular feature, since the approach and distance of the planets can affect our earth and water in the same way.  On the ocean, the tides are not so noticeable, since it has a large area.  Another thing is a narrow river.  During high tide, a huge mass of water tends to the shore, but due to the small distance between the banks, the stream grows in height.  So, in the Amazon River, the tide height can reach 4 meters at a speed of 24 km / h. </p>

    <p>  Due to the fact that the Sun is 400 times farther than the Moon from our planet, it creates water vibrations 2 times smaller.  Since the effect on the human parade of planets has not been fully studied, it remains a mystery whether this phenomenon can affect our water in the same way as the Sun and Moon do. </p><h2>  Parade of planets </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the parade of planets is a phenomenon when several celestial bodies line up in a row.  This happens quite rarely, since all the planets are at a different distance from the Sun, and the length of their orbits is different.  The most distant planet from a hot star is Neptune, the trajectory of its movement in orbit is 30 times greater than that of our planet.  In addition, each celestial body has its own speed of movement around the sun.  So, if the Earth makes a full revolution in 365 days, that is, in one year, then for the planet Neptune this path is almost 165 years.  That is, even if the influence of a planet parade on a person does occur, then this phenomenon is quite rare. </p>

    <h2>  Types of alignment of planets </h2><p>  There are large (six planets) and a small parade (four), as well as visible (5 bright planets can be seen in one sector) and an invisible planet parade.  Of course, the less celestial bodies participate in this phenomenon, the more often it occurs.  The parade of planets of three components can be observed up to two times a year.  In addition, given the different longitude of the location of celestial bodies (for example, Venus has a maximum of 48 degrees), it should be remembered that this phenomenon can be observed either in the morning or in the evening.  The impact on the person of the parade of planets can be considered a little from a different angle.  For example, in 1977, this phenomenon allowed Russian scientists to study a large number of celestial bodies.  The outer planets are arranged in a row in a narrow sector of the galaxy, which allowed scientists to study the distant bodies in a more detailed spacecraft. </p><h2>  Nine celestial bodies in one line </h2><p>  The rarest parade of planets can be called the one in which all 9 celestial bodies participate: Pluto, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus and Mercury.  Such an event takes place every 179 years: in 1445, 1624, 1803, in 1982 the world could observe this rare phenomenon through the lenses of a telescope and telescopes.  The next parade of planets with the participation of all nine luminaries can be seen in 2161.  In recent years, humanity has been trying to answer the question, how does the parade of planets affect a person?  Scientists analyze past phenomena and events that may be associated with them, but they still do not find an answer.  And to be more precise, there are answers, there are a lot of them, but at the same time they are all different, and there is no single point of view on this issue. </p><h2>  The connection of man with space </h2><p>  According to the astrological forecast chart, stars and planets have a certain influence on each person.  For example, in Sagittarius, Jupiter is considered the leading planet, and in Cancer - the Moon.  The influence of the parade of planets on a person can be explained precisely on this side, because the horoscopes that we all love to read so much are based on the impact of various planets on the character and fate of people.  In astral charts, the date and time of a person‚Äôs birth is important, since only with the help of these data can one determine exactly under which constellation he was born. </p><p>  In this regard, another science is important - numerology, which is very closely intertwined with astrology.  Here, numbers also have their influence, because each number denotes a specific planet.  For example, 1 is the Sun, 2 is the Moon, etc. From the same point of view, we can consider the effect of the parade of planets on people.  As we already know, this phenomenon suggests that celestial bodies in the firmament should be in one row at a certain degree. </p>

    <p>  Since this phenomenon is quite rare, we can say that people born at this time will be endowed with a special gift or talent.  For example, on March 10, 1982 there was a rare parade of planets of 9 stars, and on this day such actors as Thomas Middleditch, Anita Berhane, Krishtov Hadek were born.  It is for this reason that we can say that the influence of the parade of planets on people still exists, but for the most part it is positive. </p><h2>  Solar flares </h2><p>  One cannot but touch upon such a topic as <span>solar flares</span> in this topic <span>,</span> since many scientists believe that aligning the planets in one row can provoke this process.  Of course, solar flares occur on a bright star quite often and with different strengths.  This is a process during which a huge amount of energy is released with a volume of world electricity consumption in one million years.  Due to the fact that our atmosphere has several layers, flashes can not do tremendous harm, but certain consequences still exist.  For example, <span>geomagnetic storms</span> that affect the operation of technology and the deterioration of people's health. </p><h2>  Sector angle </h2><p>  It remains only to prove that the influence of the parade of planets on a person can actually occur due to solar flares.  It must be remembered that, despite the force of attraction between the Sun and other planets, they are quite far from each other.  Of course, if all 9 planets at one moment become in a row with a minimum sector angle of 1-9 ¬∞, then perhaps all together they can have a definite effect on the Sun, and it, in turn, on the Earth. </p>

    <p>  However, such a position of celestial bodies is unlikely and tends to zero.  This is explained by the fact that the planets are in different orbits, rotate at different speeds and are very distant from each other.  The minimum angle that 9 planets took in 1982 and in 1624 was 40 ¬∞ relative to our planet, and if you look, for example, from the center of the sun, then as much as 65 ¬∞.  In other words, these parades of the planets can only be called conditional and visible in the sky from planet Earth.  If we had the opportunity to look at this phenomenon from Pluto, then we would not see what was expected. </p><h2>  <span>Mayan tribes</span> and apocalypse </h2><p>  Another horror story from pseudo-seers is Mayan predictions about the end of the world.  As you know, this civilization of Mesoamerica was well versed in art, score, architecture and writing.  Maya had his own calendar, which is completely different from ours, and most interestingly, it was calculated until 2012.  Does this mean that this year was the end of the world?  Of course not.  And, despite the fact that their calendar was compiled before 2012, the last 4 years somewhere in the predictions come from Maya.  Perhaps this civilization studied the influence of the parade of planets on humans, but there is no evidence of this.  Fortunately, all these predictions are only groundless bullying of people. </p>
