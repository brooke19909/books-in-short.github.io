    <h2>  Short excursion </h2><p>  In the Republic of Abkhazia, Grebeshok is a small village, beautifully spread on the rocks of the Gagra Range.  Located in the same district.  Today, a little more than 500 people live in the village (Abkhazians, slightly more Armenians and a small percentage of Ukrainians, Greeks and Russians). </p><p>  There are many legends about this settlement.  One of the most beautiful and mysterious - about the prince of Oldenburg.  His castle is hidden in green from prying eyes.  It is said that a very influential person lost an ivory comb, studded with precious stones.  He perished in the dark waters of the sea.  The loss greatly saddened the lady, and then the prince presented her with a gift of allotment of land with a secluded mansion, giving him the name "Scallop". </p><h2>  Information for guests of the republic: Abkhazia, Grebeshok </h2><p>  In any region of Abkhazia, the Russian currency runs.  Since 2012, Visa, MasterCard payment systems began to work.  But there are still very few ATMs, they are located mainly in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãbanks, so it is better to have cash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In a rare store there is a terminal payment.  It is better not to bring the currency to the republic.  Changing it is difficult. </p><p>  The standard summer season begins in Abkhazia in May and ends towards the end of October. </p><p>  In May, the sun still does not burn, sea water is cool (not for everybody).  But it is already comfortably warm, and the air is full of aromas.  Spicy herbs, fruit trees and a great many flowers bloom.  At this time, it is good to relax for tourists who, for one reason or another, can not stand the heat.  This is the period of the ‚Äúbuildup‚Äù of the season, there are few people, so walking is a pleasure. </p><p>  In June - early July, the time comes for lovers of moderate heat and the beginning of the swimming season. </p><p>  In July and August is the hot season in the Republic of Abkhazia.  Scallop is no exception.  This is a real peak of heat.  The sun is burning, water is boiling water, cool only in the shade. </p>

    <p>  By the middle of the first school month in the Republic of Abkhazia (Grebeshok) the heat and the number of vacationers are decreasing.  Again it becomes quiet, cozy and comfortable.  It‚Äôs still quite hot during the day, and in the evenings you already want to wrap yourself in a plaid. </p><p>  As for clothes, the unspoken rule of the republic residents strongly recommends swimwear, shorts, tops to be worn exclusively on the beach.  In cities, towns, shops, banks and especially places of historical significance, appropriate clothing must be worn.  And if you have a trip to the mountains, you need to take care of warm clothing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Abkhazia has a well-developed transport infrastructure.  There are many bus routes, shuttles and private taxis. </p><h2>  Perfect privacy </h2><p>  The little-known place makes it possible to relax quietly and in isolation.  It seems to be only five kilometers to the city of Gagra and 15 to the border, and there are few tourists here. </p><p>  The guests of the village Grebeshok (Abkhazia) leave almost the same reviews: ‚Äúwe got by chance (or on the recommendation) and now we will rest here every summer ...‚Äù </p>

    <p>  It's really good here.  Nature is almost wild, virgin.  Cozy quiet family resort.  Nearby there are no large holiday homes or resorts and entertainment venues.  Here city bustle and workdays are forgotten like a nightmare. </p><p>  In the Republic of Abkhazia Grebeshok, photos confirm this fact, "hid" in the bay.  Due to this geographical location, the coast with the village located on it is successfully protected from storm waves and rain clouds.  Even when showers are poured in Adler or Gagra, in Scallop sushi and grace. </p><h2>  Apartments in the guest house </h2><p>  For guests are prepared rooms from single to five and detached bungalows, sheltered by greenery.  On tourist sites of the Republic of Abkhazia (Grebeshki village), the description of the apartments is true, guests of the republic assure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Bungalow standards usually have two separate rooms, triple or quadruple.  Almost every room has a toilet, shower, washbasin.  The suites have a TV, air conditioning and a refrigerator.  Be sure to have a terrace or porch for evening gatherings.  All guest houses have cold water, there are always boilers.  From any window, a stunning view: either of the vast sea, or of lush greenery rising up, or of vineyards and orchards with exotic pomegranates, figs, etc. </p><p>  And there are extraordinary sunsets and sunrises. </p>

    <p>  The sea - in convenient walking distance along a path drowning in greenery, almost directly.  Abkhazia gives its guests a wonderful vacation. </p><p>  Grebeshki village is proud of its amazing natural gift: one part of the beach is soft sand, the other is small pebble. </p><p>  Many tourists worry about fresh drinking water.  In Grebeshki, this problem is solved.  There are many springs and springs with beautiful water (after the city it is drunk like nectar). </p><p>  Guest houses and parking lots near them are guarded. </p><h2>  Hospitable hosts </h2><p>  Apart from all the benefits provided by guest houses, tourists praise the cuisine in guest houses.  Upon arrival, some vacationers are upset because of the ban on self-cooking.  All leave almost with a bunch of recipes from the hostess! </p><p>  Dishes are not only deliciously delicious - they are divinely served. </p>

    <p>  Housewives buy products from neighbors in the village.  Therefore, everything is always fresh and incredibly tasty.  Three meals a day, homemade (this is always the focus).  Food discounts are available for children under 10 years old.  If you want something like that, you can go shopping in Gagra (a bus stop is nearby). </p><p>  The hostesses of guest houses, when guests leave for excursions, hiking in the mountains and other absences, for various reasons, collect "food with them." </p><h2>  Affordable Vacation </h2><p>  After a bustling city, it is deserted, and silence just rings in your ears.  In the Republic of Abkhazia (Grebeshok), the private sector is pleasantly pleased with prices and hospitality.  For the convenience of vacationers in the village there are not only guest houses and turnkey houses, but also completely inexpensive beds in the private sector. </p><p>  And if you want to relax from the beach, you can wander around the surrounding area.  For example, to explore the mysterious castle of the Prince of Oldenburg (he is more than a hundred years old).  In general, the Gagra region is rich in interesting places of recreation, where you can go with children.  What, for example, is a trip to <span>Lake Ritsa</span> or an excursion to the famous Gagripsh restaurant!  It is assembled like a constructor - there is not a single nail in it!  After inspection, you can have a tasty and inexpensive meal. </p>

    <p>  <span>Gegsky Falls is</span> not Victoria, of course, but the sight is amazing.  Blue lake with an indoor cafe on the water, St.  Hypatia.  It is located in the gorge of the river Tsikherva and is made by human hands.  It is believed that there were many rooms in it, but today only three are open, the rest are filled up.  In the troubled times of persecution of Orthodox Christians in the cave, Bishop Ipatius of Gagra was hiding. </p><p>  The excursion to the Colonnade fascinates both children and adults.  It consists of four towers, which are connected by small arcades.  The total length of the complex is more than 60 m. Today it is one of the most visited places in the city of Gagra.  The Colonnade offers stunning views of the entire city beach.  On the left side of the viewing complex is the entrance to the Seaside Park.  Directly opposite the colonnade is the now abandoned cinema building.  Once this building was admired by spiral staircases and handsome lions at the entrance. </p><h2>  Reservation </h2><p>  An annual vacation (Abkhazia, Grebeshok) will be successful only in case of advance booking of rooms.  To do this, you need to transfer the amount of the deposit - usually this is the daily cost of the selected apartments per room - to the proposed electronic wallets or bank accounts of the owners.  The finished form is on the website of a guest house.  After the owners confirm the receipt of funds, the room is booked.  Here, the owners of the rooms are asked to take into account that the deposit is not returned, for whatever reason.  But it is necessarily deducted from the final amount for accommodation and meals. </p>

    <p>  Reservation for rooms is held until 23:59 on the agreed day of arrival, unless otherwise agreed with the hostess. </p><p>  Room reservation for the upcoming summer season begins in February of this year. </p><h2>  Post scriptum </h2><p>  If you want to really relax with comfort and coziness in silence by the sea, get memories and emotions for the year ahead and anxiously wait for next summer, then you need to go to the Republic of Abkhazia.  Scallop is waiting. </p>
