  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to control your TV from your phone: recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In those days, when mobile gadgets were built on the old operating systems "Bada", "Symbian" and similar ones, many users, ask them the question: "Is it possible to control the TV from the phone?", Would turn a finger at the temple. </p><p>  But with the advent of platforms such as Android, the latest iOS and Windows 10 Mobile, this procedure no longer seems fantastic.  In terms of functionality, modern smartphones and tablets breathe powerful desktop devices into the back. </p><p>  TV manufacturers also take this fact into account and contribute in every way to the development of this area in both hardware and software.  So today it‚Äôs quite possible to control the TV using your phone.  We‚Äôll just try to figure out exactly how this can be done and what is needed for this.  From our article you will learn how a regular smartphone can replace a standard button remote control from a TV. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Almost every well-known TV manufacturer is trying to bring something new and original to their product.  Yes, competing models have a lot in common, but there are a lot of branded features that others do not have.  It is thanks to the latter that managing a smart TV from a phone is not so simple, because each brand has its own approach to this procedure, and universal solutions do not always work. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the principle of operation of such a tandem is the same for everyone.  There is a TV device, a smartphone, special software and wireless communications.  This set allows you to control the TV through the phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For communication, use one of three modules: </p><ul><li>  Wi-Fi. </li><li>  Bluetooth. </li><li>  IR port </li></ul><p>  Manufacturers of mobile gadgets have almost completely abandoned the latest technology, because the first two completely level its effectiveness.  But in some devices it is still in use and with its help you can also successfully control the TV through the phone.  In this case, the effectiveness and functionality of the procedure is markedly reduced. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  As for the software, it can be divided into two main categories - these are universal and proprietary applications.  Using your original software to control your TV from your phone is much easier.  In addition, all available functionalities are fully disclosed and without any restrictions. </p><p>  Universal applications also allow you to control the TV from your phone, but they do not always behave appropriately, if at all.  Here we are talking mostly about TV devices from little-known brands or generally no-name factories.  While almost every well-known manufacturer has its own software. </p><h2>  Proprietary software </h2><p>  If you have a branded device, then it is best to control the TV from your phone using special software, and not look for universal software.  As for the operating system of the mobile gadget, all the programs described below are perfectly adapted for the Android and iOS platforms, and in some cases Windows Phone. </p><p>  Manufacturers with their own software: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  LG. </li><li>  Samsung. </li><li>  "Panasonic." </li><li>  Philips. </li><li>  Sony. </li></ul><p>  Consider the proprietary software of each brand in more detail. </p><h2>  LG </h2><p>  In order to control your LG TV from your phone, you need to go to the official website of the brand and in the software section download the branded LG TV Remote application.  After installing the program, you will need to start scanning devices, while turning on your TV. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="LG TV Remote" class="if uuid-3123524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3123524.jpg"></div><p>  After searching, the program will list the supported devices, and if your TV is among them, it means the channel will work and you can fully control the TV from your Android, iOS or Windows Phone. </p><p>  After synchronization, two windows should appear on your mobile gadget.  At the bottom there will be an interface for controlling volume and channels, built by analogy with a keypad.  In addition, with its help you can go to the main screen, take a screenshot, enable 3D effects and call up the application control panel. </p><p>  At the top of the screen is a working area that provides access to all installed programs.  The touch screen of the smartphone during operation mirrors your movements, where the pointer on the TV screen moves after your finger.  With it, you can fully control the TV from the phone: play content, configure functionality with tools, and even play.  In a word, we get not just a classic remote control, but a real complex for interacting with TV. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Samsung </h2><p>  In order to control the Samsung TV from your phone, you must also go to the official resource of the brand and download the Samsung TV &amp; Remote program in the software section.  The application interface, judging by the user reviews, is quite friendly, there are no problems with the toolkit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mspoweruser.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung TV &amp; Remote" class="if uuid-3123525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3123525.jpg"></div><p>  The screen on the mobile gadget is divided into two parts.  On one are the keys for selecting channels, the touch rocker for adjusting the volume level and the buttons for turning on the TV, as well as the transition to the navigation menu. </p><p>  The second part of the screen is organized in such a way as to simplify the management of multimedia functions of the TV.  Here we have a semblance of a joystick, by pressing the keys of which access to selected channels, content and other (customizable) elements is provided. </p><p>  Users respond well to the application.  It allows you to fully control the Samsung TV from the phone, but he has one fly in the ointment.  This is an advertisement.  In principle, it cannot be called aggressive, but this has not been noted for competing analogues. </p><p>  So some particularly ardent opponents of advertising prefer third-party universal applications.  You can control the TV through an Android phone or iOS.  There is a version of the application for Windows Phone as well, but judging by the reviews, it is full of bugs and not very well adapted for this platform. </p><h2>  Panasonic </h2><p>  To control a Panasonic brand TV from your phone, you need to go to the brand‚Äôs official website and find the TV Remote Panasonic program in the corresponding section.  Users very positively respond to this software and consider it the best among others: convenient, functional, smart and intuitive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mactechnews.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV Remote Panasonic" class="if uuid-3123529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3123529.jpg"></div><p>  There are no unnecessary questions when working with the interface.  The entire toolkit is competently located by category, and in particularly difficult cases, an intelligent help system will help.  In addition, one of the main differences between the program and competing counterparts is the availability of advanced swipes. </p><p>  Actually, the main management is built on the latter.  When switching using gestures between the desktops, each one has access to some functionality: working with files, a navigation menu, settings, adjusting the basic values ‚Äã‚Äãof TV, etc. You can also use your smartphone as a game controller, turn on the sleep timer, surf the Internet with it and much more. </p><p>  Advertising and some extra information are completely absent.  The program received Russian-language localization, moreover competent, without fragmentary and stupid phrases.  Judging by the reviews, using it is a pleasure.  The application runs on the Android and iOS platforms. </p><h2>  Philips </h2><p>  To work with Philips equipment using mobile gadgets, you will need a special Philips MeRemote program.  You can find it on the official website of the manufacturer, in the software section. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tomgoijer.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips MeRemote" class="if uuid-3123528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3123528.jpg"></div><p>  At the first start, the application will offer to scan devices, and if any were found, it will present a list for synchronization.  The program interface is simple and convenient.  All the main tools are correctly divided into sections, so there is no need to wander around the menu. </p><p>  On the main screen you can see a list of categories, by clicking on which the corresponding working area opens.  Here you can interact with the gadget files, control the sound level, switch channels, open applications, etc. </p><p>  One of the main advantages of the software from Philips is its speed and minimum system requirements for filling the mobile device.  For the application to work correctly, even an ancient gadget with 512 MB of RAM supporting the Android platform is enough.  The speed of the menus and tools is amazing.  The delay in playing content after a click is less than a second of time.  The SimplyShare brand technology used to achieve this performance is considered the best among other analogues. </p><p>  Ad units, banners, and other unnecessary ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù were not noticed by users when working with the program.  The application stably performs the tasks assigned to it - without glitches and lags. </p><h2>  Sony </h2><p>  To control Sony equipment using a smartphone or tablet, you need the TV Side View program.  You can find it on the official resource of the brand in the "Files for download" section.  Immediately after launch, the application scans nearby devices (the TV must be turned on). </p><div class="photo" data-original="sonyxperiacommunity.sonyworldcommunity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tv side view" class="if uuid-3123530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3123530.jpg"></div><p>  After synchronization, access to the working areas of the program is opened.  The interface design is made in dark and calm colors and divided into sections.  Each category has its own working area with specific tools for it. </p><p>  One table allows you to control navigation and switch channels, the other - controls the volume level, the third - is responsible for working with applications, the fourth - with files, etc. Dealing with the interface is not difficult.  The application received competent Russian-language localization and an intelligently compiled help section. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the well-developed voice control of the main tools.  With it, you can not only switch channels and adjust sound, but also adjust brightness with contrast, open regular applications and even type text into a notebook. </p><p>  The program is not particularly demanding on the system resources of a mobile gadget, but it needs at least 1 GB of RAM for correct operation.  Otherwise, hangs and other lags may be observed.  Advertising banners and pop-ups do not even smell here.  But Sony never allowed itself to do this in its proprietary programs. </p><h2>  Third-party software </h2><p>  As mentioned above, there is also universal software that allows you to control the TV using mobile devices.  It is necessary to use it at your own peril and risk, because the developers do not guarantee stable operation with any of the TVs. </p><h2>  Tv remote control </h2><p>  This application offers wide functionality and ease of use.  The program has a lot of positive reviews from owners of televisions of various brands and brands.  It‚Äôs worth immediately warning that, alas, there is no Russian-language localization here.  But it is not required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Tv remote control" class="if uuid-3123527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3123527.jpg"></div><p>  The application interface is simple and intuitive.  Judging by the reviews, users do not experience any serious problems.  All the main tools are on the main screen and quality visualized. </p><p>  Each unit is responsible for the implementation of any specific tasks.  There is a zone for switching channels, controlling volume, turning on / off the TV, etc. The program also allows you to work with media content: music, video and photos. </p><p>  After launch, the application will offer to configure the connection via the IrDA-interface (a type of infrared port) or wireless protocols, bluetooth and Wi-Fi.  Next, you will need to register the IP address of the TV and select a model from the list provided.  The latter is very broad and multi-level.  There is also support for branded models from LG, Samsung, Panasonic, Sharp, Akai and other manufacturers, including little-known Chinese brands. </p><p>  The program is free, so periodic banners and windows from partners and sponsors pop up.  But they appear not so often, therefore it is difficult to call them aggressive.  The application runs on the Android platform of all versions and is undemanding to the system resources of the mobile gadget. </p><h2>  Easy Universal TV Remote </h2><p>  Another universal program for controlling a TV from a smartphone or tablet.  The application differs from the previous product only in its interface.  The functional set of both solutions is the same. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.appsapk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Easy Universal TV Remote" class="if uuid-3123553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3123553.jpg"></div><p>  Here you can also switch channels, turn the TV off and on, change the volume level, work with files, applications, etc. Installing and setting up the program should also not cause difficulties. </p><p>  At the first start, the utility will offer to set up a connection to the TV: Wi-Fi, bluetooth or infrared.  Then you will need to select the desired model of your TV from the list below.  The list is pretty decent and includes not only series from well-known brands, but also devices from unfamiliar manufacturers. </p><p>  The program runs on the Android platform and is distributed completely free.  The last point automatically implies an abundance of advertising.  But there are not so many annoying banners and pop-ups.  At least most of the users are not annoying. </p>
