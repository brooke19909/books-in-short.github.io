But first things first. </p><h2>  Smart refrigerator from LG and its features </h2><p>  Smart refrigerator with <span>Smart technologies</span> from LG in its functions is close to what resembles artificial intelligence.  Judge for yourself. </p><p>  On the door of the refrigerator is a touch display that allows you to monitor the location and condition of the products inside.  That is, there is no need to constantly open the refrigerator doors, and this reduces the penetration of warm air into the chamber and thereby saves energy costs. </p>

    <h2>  Fridge + smartphone </h2><p>  If you connect the refrigerator control system to a smartphone or tablet, you can see what is missing in the refrigerator and buy the necessary products while away from home.  This eliminates the need to create long shopping lists and helps to avoid unnecessary costs. </p><p>  You can also order products by typing the appropriate commands on the display of the refrigerator itself or program the system so that the order of the finished products is carried out automatically.  There is no need to leave the house and leave a small child unattended in order to escape to the store, you also can not worry that some products will end at the most inopportune moment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The freshness control system will promptly notify the owner of the refrigerator about which products have an expiration date and time to use or discard them. </p><p>  The breakdown prevention system, if it detects any malfunctions in the refrigerator, will immediately contact the customer service center and report a malfunction.  This helps to avoid serious damage and take timely measures for the smooth operation of the equipment. </p>

    <h2>  Fridge + TV </h2><p>  Special programs allow you to view various videos, photos, television programs, weather forecasts on the refrigerator display.  This is quite convenient, because many of us spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking or cleaning.  In addition, the LG refrigerator will tell you what recipes can be prepared from products already available in it and even allow you to watch video tutorials on them. </p><p>  The control of a healthy diet can be programmed by entering your data (height, weight, type of diet) into the system of this refrigerator and receiving the necessary recommendations in the form of recipes and observing a meal regimen. </p><p>  In addition, the LG refrigerator operates on the principle of energy conservation, choosing the optimal mode and controlling functions that allow you to simultaneously save products and at the same time save energy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Such a pleasure costs about $ 3,000, but those who can afford smart technology note that these costs are fully justified and are gradually paying off. </p><p>  Next, we‚Äôll talk about dishes, or rather containers for storing food, which are also called ‚Äúsmart refrigerators‚Äù. </p><h2>  Smart Tupperware refrigerator </h2><p>  Tupperware is an American company whose name comes from the name of its founder, Earl Silas Tupper. </p><p>  One of the brands of this company is plastic containers designed to store various products in the refrigerator.  According to the advertisement, these containers help to maintain the initial freshness and appearance of the products for a long time.  It is for this that a series of such dishes was called the ‚Äúsmart refrigerator‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Features of Tupperware Smart Fridge </h2><p>  According to the manufacturer, Tupperware containers are made of durable, as harmless (medical) plastic as possible. </p><p>  The plastic container is resistant to scratches, staining with vegetables and fruits (beets, carrots), has openings for air ventilation, is easy to clean and lasts a long time. </p><p>  The bottom of the container has recesses in which condensate accumulates, and thus the products in the container do not come in contact with moisture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A convenient lid is attached to the container, which fits snugly, but at the same time easily opens and closes. </p><p>  The main feature of the Tupperware smart refrigerator is its ventilation system.  This principle of preserving the quality of products was developed on the basis of the respiration rate of various plant crops. </p><p>  By the way, the first smart refrigerators developed by this manufacturer were just containers for storing plant foods.  Subsequently, the campaign also created separate containers for storing meat and fish.  They do not have a ventilation system, they differ slightly in their external and internal structure, they are designed for storing, thawing and marinating meat and fish. </p><p>  But, as practice shows, the consumer, having bought one of the Tupperware containers, does not pay much attention to his ‚Äúspecialization‚Äù, but stores all the products in a row in it. </p>

    <h2>  A bit of science </h2><p>  It turns out that plants breathe.  And they breathe differently.  Therefore, an air ventilation system was created inside the container. </p><p>  Vegetables, fruits, berries and other vegetation absorb oxygen and emit carbon dioxide during respiration.  The fresher the plant, the more intense it breathes.  And therefore, the principle of storing plant food in containers with ventilation should provide a longer shelf life of products. </p><p>  Both surplus and lack of carbon dioxide can adversely affect the product.  Therefore, for the outflow-inflow of air, the Tupperware ‚Äúsmart refrigerator‚Äù ventilation system in containers was made. </p><p>  For different crops, the oxygen ‚Äì carbon dioxide ratio for preserving freshness is different.  Therefore, on the surface of the container there is a table (slider) that indicates how many valves should be in the open-closed position for various vegetables, fruits, berries. </p><p>  Of course, the shelf life of different products depends not only on the ratio of the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the container, but also on temperature, humidity, plant variety, and the area in which the culture is grown.  But the creators of the ‚Äúsmart refrigerator‚Äù did not even try to invent a panacea, but only wanted to slightly improve the storage conditions of plant foods and thereby extend its freshness. </p><p>  If you store ready-made food or, say, meat, fish in such containers, then the positive effect of long-term storage may manifest itself, but it will rather depend on the temperature inside the refrigerator‚Äôs chamber, air humidity, freshness and quality of the product itself, and the thermal method processing, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  A lot of people have already purchased a ‚Äúsmart refrigerator‚Äù.  The opinions of those who applied it in practice are different: someone is satisfied with the result, and someone believes that he threw the money away. </p><p>  We will try to be objective and consider the pros and cons. </p><p>  1. Dear item. </p><p>  The high price of a Tupperware smart refrigerator is definitely a minus.  Are there many plastic containers from different manufacturers on sale and is it difficult to make ventilation holes in any plastic and achieve the same results for less money? </p><p>  However, do not forget that Tupperware containers are made of durable plastic.  The manufacturer gives them a guarantee of 30 years, of course, subject to the correct operating conditions: this container can not be placed in the microwave or freezer, rubbed abrasively with abrasive cleaners, then it will last a long time. </p><p>  2. The lack of effect of long-term storage. </p><p>  Not all users of this ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù say that vegetables, herbs or other products are better stored in a ‚Äúsmart refrigerator‚Äù than under other conditions.  Why is this happening? </p><p>  If you look at the slider (pictures) on the surface of the Tupperware container, you can see that only plant crops are shown there, which means that the manufacturer does not guarantee that other products are also recommended to be stored in these containers. </p><p>  Further, many, acquiring a smart refrigerator, stuff various vegetables, greens and fruits into it in a row, despite the fact that they are of different types of breathing. </p><p>  The fact is that (as we have already said) the safety of products depends not only on ventilation, but also on humidity.  Greens, for example, are better preserved in a slightly wet form, while for potatoes this moisture is useless.  According to many gardeners, it is not recommended to store dill and parsley together - well, they do not like to lie next to each other and badly affect each other. </p><p>  Therefore, if you want to notice the positive effect of using a smart refrigerator, you still have to follow the rules and store different vegetables in different containers. </p>

    <h2>  Terms of Use </h2><p>  If you purchased a Tupperware smart refrigerator, how to use it correctly? </p><p>  To store vegetables or other crops in a clean, dry and ventilated container, close with a lid, set the ventilation mode according to the information on the slider (open, closed, ajar).  Put the container in the refrigerator.  As condensation forms in the recesses at the bottom, drain it. </p><p>  It is advisable not to use a container for storing finely chopped products, as they fill the recesses and impede air circulation. </p>
