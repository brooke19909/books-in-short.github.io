    <p>  Some users believe that it would be nice for the manufacturer brand to implement Wi-Fi support in the device.  However, this communication technology cannot be used by the owner of the Wexler Book T7205.  How to turn on Wi-Fi in a device in which there are no necessary modules, modern mobile electronics lovers have not yet come up with.  However, the lack of Wi-Fi, as many experts believe, is generally not critical due to the fact that the reader supports OGT technology.  This standard allows you to connect any device compatible with USB-connectors to the device, such as, for example, flash drives.  As a rule, an e-book does not have any problems with recognizing external accessories. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The appearance of the device is characterized by experts as very original.  So, many experts note the presence of angles cut off at 90 degrees on the case - while on many competing devices, the corresponding elements are rounded.  The back cover of the Wexler Book T7205, as many users note, is made of material that is pleasant to the touch and makes using the e-book very comfortable.  If necessary, the user can put on the case of the e-book case, which is included in the package. </p><h2>  Features of managing the reader </h2><p>  Experts note the excellent ergonomics of the device - in particular, the presence of a smooth transition between the back of the case and the end elements.  Such a design solution is useful for several reasons.  Firstly, the case, made in the marked concept, is especially convenient to hold.  Secondly, in the process of using the device, the probability of closing the speaker with your hand located exactly in the area corresponding to the smooth transition between the back cover and side elements of the electronic book case is minimized. </p>

    <p>  On the right side of the device is a key with which you can turn pages.  On the left side of the case there is a button with which you can open the context menu, next to which is the return key.  Under the screen is the Home button.  In the lower part of the case there are slots, through which other devices can be connected to the electronic book.  There is also a power button, a headphone jack, a reset button, and an LED indicator. </p><h2>  Ebook Design: Reviews </h2><p>  The Wexler Book T7205 e-book, as noted by device owners and experts, has a progressive design and the most convenient controls.

The capabilities of these technologies allow, in particular, to display to the user the text of the book in the form that is as close as possible to the structure of the original literary work. </p><p>  Apart from the main function, the Wexler Book T7205 e-book - the feedback from users and experts regarding the respective capabilities is extremely positive - can also recognize audio formats and video files.  As we noted above - MP3 and ACC.  There is also support for common video formats.  The programs installed in the Wexler Book T7205 also allow you to edit the text.  Using the device, you can view photos in popular formats - such as, for example, JPEG.  Support for appropriate formats allows you to turn the "reader" into a convenient multimedia tool.  You can listen to music through the speakers, or by connecting headphones to the ‚Äúreader‚Äù. </p><h2>  Functionality: reviews </h2><p>  What do users say about the features of the Wexler Book T7205 e-book?  The characteristics of the device, as well as the design, as we noted above, receive the highest ratings from lovers of devices of the corresponding type.  The trend of positive points of view is also the functionality of the electronic book.  As users note, the device copes well with both the main tasks - reading files in formats such as DJVU, FB2, PDB, DOC, and with their complement, which involve launching various multimedia files using the device. </p>

    <h2>  Download additional programs </h2><p>  If necessary, you can download applications adapted to the Android OS to the device.  Despite the fact that the device does not support Wi-Fi, this can be done through the cable that is included with the Wexler Book T7205.  How to connect a device to a computer?  Very simple - you need to connect it to a PC using a wire and wait until Windows recognizes the reader as an external medium.  After that, it will be possible to download files in formats that the device supports.  Another option - we said about it above, involves the use of wires with the OTG module. Both file upload schemes to the e-book function stably. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions can we draw by exploring the main features of the WEXLER device?  First of all, it is worth noting the innovativeness of the device - at the time of entering the market, the presence of the Android OS on devices of the corresponding type was not a steady trend. </p>

    <p>  The e-book has an elegant design, characterized by comfortable management.  The functionality of the device is at the highest level.  At the time of entering the market, the device could be purchased very inexpensively - the selling price of the ‚Äúreader‚Äù was about $ 45.  Now this book can be bought even cheaper - in the catalogs of retailers, on ads online or at online auctions.  Thus, the ‚Äúreader‚Äù at the time of entering the market could well be considered as one of the most competitive products in the corresponding segment.  Even now, for many users, those functions that are supported by the device are quite enough for solving basic tasks. </p>
