The Russians are always welcome here.  Therefore, our compatriots are happy to come here to rest.  One of the best Vietnamese resorts is considered Nha Trang.  Thanks to the mild climate and unique natural beauties, tourism is developing very rapidly here.  We offer to relax in Nha Trang choose the wonderful hotel Mia Resort Nha Trang 5 *.  Its employees make every effort so that tourists staying in Vietnam will leave only good and bright memories. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.1343546" data-lng="109.21210080000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/3/6/1/17361.png"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  If you look at the map, you can see that Vietnam has a long narrow strip encircling the Indochina Peninsula from its southeast side.  Such a geographical feature causes completely different climatic conditions in the north and south of the country.  Nha Trang is located closer to the south.  It is 439 km from Ho Chi Minh City, and 1280 km from Hanoi.  Mia Resort Nha Trang is built about half an hour from the resort center.  This is a quiet and unusually beautiful place in a valley surrounded by hills on one side and the South China Sea on the other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kayak.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mia Resort Nha Trang Vietnam" class="if uuid-3215090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3215090.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  In the reviews, almost all tourists indicate that the Mia Resort Nha Trang is located near the modern Kamran Airport.  The distance is only 30 km.  The road to the hotel takes about half an hour.  If you are traveling from a travel agency, a comfortable transfer will be waiting for you at the airport.  All tourists are offered wet towels and a bottle of cool water.  If you reserved a room yourself, you can get from the airport to your destination by taxi.  As evidenced by the reviews of tourists, private cabs take expensive.  The most profitable taxi here is Vivasun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of the Territory </h2><p>  The Mia Resort Nha Trang Hotel occupies a plot of only 10 thousand square meters.  This is not very much for hotels of this level.  However, the territory of this hotel is too elongated along the coast, so all the buildings and structures are at some distance from each other.  In addition, all the tracks are paved with stone tiles, which makes it difficult to move in high-heeled shoes.  Tourists in their reviews report that it‚Äôs rather inconvenient to go from your building, for example, to a restaurant.  Hotel management solved this problem.  For all guests free buggies (small open cars) are provided, with which you can move around the territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.directrooms.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mia Resort Nha Trang reviews" class="if uuid-3215094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3215094.jpg"></div><p>  Mia Resort Nha Trang is surrounded by greenery and flowers.  Perfect cleanliness is maintained around.  The whole territory is divided into sections.  Each has its own name.  On these sites are villas and three two-story buildings, as well as a number of facilities for recreation and entertainment of tourists, the administrative building, bars and restaurants.
