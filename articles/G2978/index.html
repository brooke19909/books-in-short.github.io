And it doesn’t matter how many years the Frankish Empire lasted, the main thing is that it became one of the first European states to unite many peoples. </p><h2>  <strong>Start</strong> </h2><p>  It all began in the distant sixth century.  The scattered tribes of German barbarians (as the Romans called all the peoples living outside their empire) tried to create similarities of states.  The foundation of the Frankish state was laid by Clovis, the leader of one of the tribes, who founded the Merovingian dynasty.  <span>The adoption of Christianity,</span> competent policy towards other tribes allowed him to create a prototype of the kingdom.  A century later, another king, Dagober, introduced the royal council and the apparatus of officials, who worked on important issues, continued his work.  But the unity of the Frankish state was formal - some of the richest parts of it constantly tried to separate, claiming the title of independent kingdoms.  It was this that caused the Merovingians to lose power over the Franks state and move away from the government, giving way to the more enterprising Carolingians. </p>

    <h2>  Charles </h2><p>  After a long struggle for power, the throne was received by Pepin Short - father of Charlemagne.  He also called the new dynasty the Carolingians, in honor of his son.  His rule was marked by a series of reforms, in addition, the new ruler relied on the Church, which helped him to overthrow the last Merovingian.  But for now, talk about how many years the Frankish Empire lasted, <strong> </strong>  early - Carolingians were just beginning to rule. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The first three years of his reign, Charlemagne ruled together with his brother Carlomir.  He began with a variety of reforms: modernizing the army, changing the judicial system, enhancing the role of the Church in the life of the state, and so on.  Then military campaigns began, as a result of which the territory of the state of Karl almost doubled.  Now the king’s possessions extended from Spain to Hungary, he controlled the territory of modern Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Austria and Germany, he owned separate parts of Italy - the formation of the Frankish Empire can be connected with the unification of all these lands under the authority of one monarch. </p><h2>  Empire </h2><p>  In 800 AD, Charlemagne was proclaimed emperor, and his possessions became known as the Frankish Empire.  All the efforts of the monarch were aimed at creating a theocratic, church state, which would be a continuation of the fallen Western Roman Empire. </p>

    <p>  But Karl was not only involved in the development of the army.  The period of his reign went down in history as the Carolingian Renaissance - at that time schools were opened in the then kingdom of the Franks, Latin was taught, interest in the history and culture of various peoples increased.  Later, Karl ordered to collect folk songs and traditions, at his own request the first grammar was created for the <span>Germanic tribes.</span>  Answering the question “How many years did the Frankish Empire last”, we can safely say: all the time that Charlemagne was in power. </p><h2>  Decay </h2><p>  A huge empire was destroyed less than half a century after its creation.  The division of the Frankish Empire occurred when the grandchildren of Charlemagne were unable to share power.  After the death of the emperor, power passed to his only son (the father survived the other two).  The reign of Louis the Pious was long for those times: he stayed in power for thirty years.  He bequeathed his throne to his eldest son, but the other two were indignant, because of which the father made concessions to the heirs.  In 843, the Verdun Treaty was signed, according to which the empire was divided into France, Germany and Italy.  How many years did the Frankish Empire last?  Only 43 years old, 43 amazing for the whole world of the year. </p>
