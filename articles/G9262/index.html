  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Year cards scrapbooking - a way of expressing creative talents</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before exploring the theme of "New Year's cards scrapbooking", you should clarify the meaning of the word "scrapbooking".  This word itself, translated from English, means the manual design of albums, literally "clipping + album."  Each sheet of the album should express a complete thought.  Moreover, these sheets can take the form of an accordion, accordion, box or houses. </p><p>  And as a separate area, one should already single out the <span>production of postcards,</span> which is called "cardmeyking".  However, in the Russian language, the word ‚Äúscrapbooking‚Äù with its broader meaning ‚Äî handicraft art associated with paper ‚Äî has taken root. </p><p>  Today, handicraft art everywhere breaks into all areas of our lives, and more and more often people resort not to the banal purchase of congratulatory messages, but to the exclusive performance of their own man-made works of paper art.  As one of the options in this direction are New Year cards scrapbooking. </p><p>  To make Christmas <span>cards with your own hands,</span> scrapbooking, you just need to pick up interesting, exclusive, colorful material and come up with a plot for the design of congratulations.  For example <strong>, a</strong> scrapbooking man‚Äôs postcard can have a window with a drop-down sash on the front side of the first sheet.  For this, it is necessary to draw a window on the sheet and make cuts in such a way that the opening sashes turn out.  Having opened the sash, you can see in the window a photograph of either the donor himself (how he holds out a bouquet of flowers towards the addressee or clasps his hands to his heart with a declaration of love), or a picture of the beloved woman who is destined for the message, or a photo where both lovers are pressed against each other happily look out the window. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the photo is pasted from the wrong side of the main page, you should consider the ‚Äúcamouflage‚Äù of the place of gluing.  If New Year's cards are made scrapbooking, then on the place to be disguised, you can stick a Christmas tree or Santa Claus. </p><p>  The shutters in front can also be beautifully decorated with ornaments by placing them in the wall of a cozy house.  On the roof of the hut "pile snow" from cotton wool, and next to the house we "plant" a Christmas tree.  Especially talented handicraftsmen can create it from beads by stretching the trunk along the cardboard.  Thus, one half of the tree can be voluminous, and the green branches will be freely located, spread out in different directions. </p><p>  Around the Christmas tree, funny miniature little animals will look great, which you can buy in children's goods stores.  But you can make them with your own hands from pieces of fur! </p><p>  Another very interesting option is scrapbooking according to the scheme of children's books with retractable pictures.  For example, an applique of an animal is glued on the page, which symbolizes the year that has passed (dragon).  He approaches the magician's hat lying on the stone.  The hat rises, and everyone opens the symbol of the coming year (snake). </p><p>  In fact, a cardboard strip is glued to the hat, with the help of which the movement will be carried out, that is, lifting the hat, under which the application with the image of the snake rests.  A slot has been made in which this cardboard is inserted, and so that the cardboard strip is not visible when the hat is raised, this place is masked by small carnival glasses - a mask.  These glasses are glued only at the tips, actually representing a tunnel for the movement of the strip - a tool to raise the hat. </p><p>  But it is also important that the New Year cards scrapbooking had an original design and in its internal part.  Therefore, you can, for example, stick a decorated Christmas tree in such a way that it folds at the moment the postcard closes and becomes convex after it is opened. </p><p>  To do this, cut the tree out of velvet paper, bend it in half in length and attach it to the surface of the opened card in the position when it protrudes above the plane.  The folds of the tree and the postcard should be on the same line, but have opposite directions: the postcard is folded to the left like a book, and the tree bends to the right. </p><p>  And how wonderful decorations look on our Christmas tree, if you make them moving too!  For example, flat balls, fish, mushrooms are easy to attach to it with threads so that they hang and swing like real ones.  And the recipient will surely appreciate your work as it deserves it! </p>
