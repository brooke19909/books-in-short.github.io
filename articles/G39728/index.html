As you grow up with a whole heap of everyday problems and the fast run of time, this fantasy takes on more and more hazy outlines.  But in vain! </p><h2>  Treasure is the dream of any person </h2><p>  Comparing the number of hidden and undetected treasures over the past centuries, one can notice a rather significant difference, which is the primary incentive to search for another treasure. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find treasures" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/657367.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Excitement, <span>faith in oneself</span> and intuition will be the impetus that can radically change everyday life.  Of course, here knowledge will still be appropriate, since it is necessary to search, having a certain supply of information behind you. </p><p>  So <span>what is a treasure?</span>  How to find treasures?  Where to do it? </p><p>  A treasure is a certain stock of values ‚Äã‚Äãburied in a secluded place by some people whom other people want to take over.  Three categories of people who want to take possession of treasures are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  <span>Black diggers,</span> knowing exactly how to find treasures, because the purpose of the search for them is to profit: any item found is measured only in monetary terms.  Ignoring generally accepted norms and principles, they are looking for where a simple person would be shy to step foot. </li><li>  Red diggers.  This kind of seekers honors traditions and respects the past.  For them, the search for lost treasures is connected with a sense of duty and a desire to convey historical values ‚Äã‚Äãto posterity, as well as to assist the state in establishing events of bygone years.  All actions are determined by the call of the heart, and the purpose of the search is to preserve memory.  Gathering in communities, they are ready to accept those who want to help sort out the history. </li><li>  White diggers.  For them, treasure hunting is more like a hobby, although the monetary factor plays an important role.  The love of history is successfully combined with the desire to earn money on it, and the selfish motive is restrained by respect for traditions and observance of signs. </li></ul><h2>  Types of information for finding a treasure </h2><p>  Treasures and treasures can be sought with direct and indirect information.  Direct information most accurately indicates the path to the treasures, as it is based on the knowledge of their location.  For example, a descendant is looking for the treasure of his relative (grandfather, great-grandfather), knowing exactly or approximately its location.  In almost all cases, the search is successful.  Only the less expected value of the treasure can disappoint, especially if the <span>material costs</span> and the efforts invested in its search exceed the size of the found. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Indirect information is based on assumptions, conjectures, an intuitive instinct that tells where to look for a treasure.  In this case, there is no guarantee of complete success, but there is little chance of making yourself richer.  Here it all depends on the luck and luck of the treasure hunter.  Therefore, before diving into the exciting world of searches, at least a minimum knowledge of history is required. </p><h2>  Earth is the safest store for valuables </h2><p>  In Russia, which was going through troubled times all the time, suffering from overwhelming oprichnina, harassment of officials, dispossession and barbaric raids, the ‚Äúbest bank‚Äù was the best depository of money.  All that was required to be hidden, a man tried to bury.  This was done without witnesses in an inconspicuous but memorable place.  In a house with an earthen floor, values ‚Äã‚Äãwere buried most often under the stove.  This was a double benefit: shelter from prying eyes and saving from frequent fires.  Basements, sheds, attics were also actively used.  The treasure was buried under the thickest trees in the garden, on trade routes, along river banks, under pillars of fences and large stones.  As a rule, such information is guided by professionals trying to find other people's treasures and treasures. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Napoleon's gold - where to look? </h2><p>  Among the legends of large treasures, a separate place is occupied by the story of Napoleon's gold, which 200 years ago tried to conquer Moscow and remove the looted values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom it.  For this, three convoys were organized, the last of which, consisting of 350 wagons, disappeared along the way, literally ‚Äúevaporated‚Äù, despite reliable information about the route and stops. </p><p>  In winter Russia, the long journey with looted goods was very difficult for the French soldiers. </p>

    <p>  Lack of food, deaths of horses, severe frosts and skirmishes with Russian partisans exhausted the enemy to the limit: the French were forced to get rid of all the excess that interfered with the road: guns, boxes with charges, things.  Confidence in the delivery of looted goods in connection with the observed picture was minimized, so Prince Beauharnais, who was responsible for the values, decided to hide part of them, which was done.  The impetus for such a decision was the information that their own French soldiers, driven to despair and powerlessness, began to pull away the loot and hide it along the line. </p><p>  The robbery of the remnants of the convoy continued even further, when the French fell into the hands of the Russian troops.  Everyone who was not lazy was robbed and hid here, so the Russian command decided to burn the carts with their contents.  Since the wagons burned completely without leaving a trace, a version appeared that there was no gold and silver in them, and perhaps there were paintings and expensive things. </p><p>  There are a sufficient number of versions regarding the disappearance of Napoleonic values.  One of them suggests that the carts on which the treasures of Russia were taken were just a distraction.  And Napoleon took the looted goods with him.  There is also a version that the values ‚Äã‚Äãwere hidden at the first stage of the trip, when the French had a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat difficulties they would expect on the road.  Despite the many organized expeditions and excavations, this secret remained unsolved. </p><h2>  Scythian gold </h2><p>  Treasures of Russia include Scythian gold in their list, remaining after the disappearance of the tribes of the same name and hidden somewhere between the Don and the Danube among the many mounds in which the dead were previously buried.  Often his weapon, armor and jewelry were put in the grave with the deceased.  Also, a mask of thin gold (foil) covered the face of the deceased, clothes or wooden figurines.  By the way, the <span>barrow mound is</span> strife, since their main group does not have gold burials inside.  But the royal mounds, completely plundered back in the 19th century, differed in appearance from simple ones, which an experienced treasure hunter could easily determine. </p><h2>  Treasure Kolchak </h2><p>  To this day, Kolchak‚Äôs treasures are actively being searched for, which in 1918 occupied Kazan and appropriated the bulk of <span>Russia</span> 's <span>gold reserves</span> (approximately 1,600 tons), which is saved here.  This money gave tremendous power to Kolchak - the proclaimed Supreme Ruler of the Russian state - and began to spend money on arming the White Guard.  Some of them remained in Japan, not turning into weapons.  According to various sources, investments were estimated at 150 tons of precious metal.  About the same amount of gold was exported and placed on deposits with foreign banks.  As a result, about 400 tons of assigned precious metal remained in the country. </p><p>  When the White Guards were forced to retreat into the depths of Siberia, they divided the remains of Russian wealth into three trains.  The first was selected by the Czechoslovak Corps and given to the Bolsheviks on the condition of unhindered exit from Russian territory.  The fate of the other two teams remained unknown.  Presumably, the White Guards could throw gold into an abandoned adit (approximately between Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk), trying to save it from the Bolsheviks. </p><p>  The third echelon was divided into several parts, the owner of which was Ataman Semenov, whose gold was later transferred to Japan.  The remainder can be safely called Kolchak's gold: its fate is also unknown and does not allow many treasure hunters to sleep peacefully.  Some of the valuables were sent by river on the steamer Permyak and buried somewhere in the region of Surgut.  The second part (approximately 26 boxes) was unloaded from the train and also buried somewhere.  The third share of the treasure was hidden near Krasnoyarsk in the crypt of the devastated church.  The only surviving participant in these events, who knew where to find the treasure, was killed in 1960 while trying to cross the Russian-Turkish border.  When it was discovered, 150 kilograms of gold bars. </p><h2>  The treasure of Genghis Khan </h2><p>  To find the grave of Genghis Khan - the head of the most extensive of world states, the lord of millions of souls, the owner of countless wealth - the cherished dream of treasure hunters around the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Genghis khan's treasure" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/657358.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Transbaikalia, Altai: the place of his burial was kept in the strictest confidence, and the grave itself was razed to the ground.  About 2000 thousand people took part in the funeral of the great ruler, but they were literally chopped into pieces by 800 equestrian soldiers from the guard of Genghis Khan.  These soldiers were also killed that day.  All this was done in order to keep secret the location of the tomb of the ruler.  However, the matter was not limited to these bloodthirsty actions.  So, the burial area was cleared of any unauthorized persons by specially created patrols.  According to one version, a riverbed was laid at the burial site to completely hide the tracks.  The expeditions visited the territory of Mongolia more than once in order to find the grave, and therefore the treasure of Genghis Khan, which by the most conservative standards costs millions of dollars.  But all efforts were in vain. </p><h2>  Where did the pirates hide the treasures? </h2><p>  Pirate treasures, whose theme is very often exploited in the film industry and literary works, amaze the minds of treasure seekers.  Part of what was written and reproduced on the screen, of course, is fiction, but there are real stories.  The most prominent person in the history of piracy was the Englishman Edward Teach, known by the nickname Blackbeard.  This ruthless and bloodthirsty captain managed to accumulate a huge number of jewelry, attacking the Spanish ships transporting gold from Mexico and South America.  His pirate career lasted only two years and ended with an inglorious death in a battle with the crew of an English ship.  What happened to the jewels?  Where to look for Blackbeard's treasure?  Edward Teach said that the treasure he had safely hidden.  But here where the pirate did this, still can not understand the thousands who want to get rich.  The treasure map suggests that this could be done on the islands of the Caribbean, in the Chesapeake Bay (east coast of the USA) or caves in the Cayman Islands. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="treasure map" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/657368.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The pirate Henry Morgan - a native of Wales, like <span>Edward Teach,</span> was notorious.  Part of the treasures hidden by him was discovered in 1997 in a cave near the Chagres River (Panama) by former American soldiers who held in their hands a treasure map bought from a market merchant.  The treasures of Henry Morgan can be found on the same Cayman Islands, located northwest of Jamaica, on the island of Pinos (65 km south of the coast of Cuba). </p><h2>  A few tips for a beginner treasure hunter </h2><p>  How to find treasures?  As practice has shown, the best place to look is a village destroyed during the war or during the revolution. </p><p>  To determine the location of such destroyed settlements, it is necessary to acquire topographic maps of a large scale.  Some of them should depict the area in pre-war form, and part - in the modern.  From them you can find out where and what structures were located earlier (chapels, estates, churches).  They will not be difficult to find with a compass.  In the search area, it is advisable to interview the local population for legends that are worth considering, but believe them unconditionally.  Indeed, out of 100 exciting legends, approximately 10 will contain a grain of truth, and in the best case, only one of the narratives will be real.  That is, it is important to be able to filter information. </p><p>  Of course, it is highly advisable to look for treasures with a metal detector by carefully examining the surface. </p>

    <p>  It is possible that items of interest can be found under the turf.  Well, if the history of the object has more than one hundred years, for which a sufficient number of coins could have been lost there.  Due to the large amount of metal trash, among which the desired valuable items may be present, it is important that the metal detector has the ability to determine the degree of rejection of the trash, having sound and visual recognition. </p><h2>  Subtleties </h2><p>  In order to know how to find treasures, you need to understand how the hiding places are arranged.  Household items (utensils, icons, clothes, samovars) people were put in boxes and chests.  They dug a hole near the house, where they hid them.  Top pit sprinkled with stones or rubbish.  Treasure hunters know that more often than not they made funerals in yards, barns, gardens and kitchen gardens, that is, where it is easy to veil fresh soil. </p><p>  Wells, to which people in difficult times of life trusted their property, can serve as guardians of all kinds of secrets.  In them, in addition to all kinds of junk, which was valuable to its owner, one can find staff documents, helmets, and all kinds of equipment.  This is especially true for places where the front line passed.  A distinctive feature of the wells is the high safety of the items in it. </p><h2>  Attic - a convenient place to find a treasure </h2><p>  Convenience for sheltering values ‚Äã‚Äãwas represented by attics.  Attic bookmarks, which are often resorted to by urban residents, have several stages in their history: </p><ul><li>  the beginning of the 20th century, after the First Russian Revolution; </li><li>  1917 revolutionary coup; </li><li>  The 40s, when a decree was issued on the surrender of weapons by the population and increased responsibility for the propaganda of fascism, which meant the preservation of objects depicting fascist symbols. </li></ul><p>  The search for treasures in the attic can be greatly facilitated by putting yourself in the place of a person who wants to hide his valuables.  Roofing beams, rafters, niches, recesses in the walls and brickwork, any ventilation openings, subtle hidden corners that are easily remembered visually - these are the places that can please the seeker with something of value.  The use of metal detectors here will not be effective due to the large number of construction debris and water pipes, creating a strong background.  By the way, there is always a void between the ceiling of the room and the attic floor, in which you can easily hide a large suitcase.  True, the examination of these places is complicated by the fact that the process of emptying and raising the floorboards creates considerable noise and takes a lot of time.  Therefore, it is preferable to investigate such voids in uninhabited houses. </p><p>  Where to find a treasure besides the attic and the earth?  Treasures were often found in rivers and canals. </p>

    <p>  Over the years, a large number of coins and all kinds of objects have accumulated in reservoirs that can now have historical and artistic value.  Many of these treasures were dumped into the rivers in order to get rid of evidence, especially in troubled times.  In reservoirs you can find royal awards, sabers, daggers, icons, incense sticks.  Extraction of finds requires warm weather, a good tray and a shovel.  Soil needs to be scooped up and washed out. </p><p>  Since fortune is more like persistent treasure hunters, the result will depend not only on luck, but also on their activity and enthusiasm. </p>
