What are their impressions of visiting the recreation center "Ildorf" in the Nizhny Novgorod region?  Dzerzhinsk is the closest city to the entertainment complex.  It is on him that the guests of the region are guided.  Getting to the base is easy, especially if you travel by car. </p><p>  Tourists recommend a recreation center for those who love nature.  Its advantage is that you are simultaneously in the fresh air and at the same time living in comfortable conditions.  This is very important for urban residents who are accustomed to a particular service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="faintour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday Village &quot;Ildorf&quot; Nizhny Novgorod" class="if uuid-2599910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2599910.jpg"></div><p>  The large complex is good for both children and adults.  It is focused on families, and therefore there is a lot of entertainment that is interesting for people of different ages.  At the recreation center you can organize for yourself a relaxing and secluded vacation, as well as active entertainment.  Here everyone will find something interesting for himself.  Invariable success at visitors is used by horses.  Contact with these amazing animals can not be compared with anything.  Even if you have never ridden, you have a great opportunity to do so. </p><h2>  Entertainment Reviews </h2><p>  On the territory there is a wide selection of entertainment.  Of particular note is the water-bath complex, which works even in the winter.  Of course, the base is most interesting in the warm season, since the main activities are connected with the street.  Nevertheless, you can have a great time here at any time of the year.  On New Year's Eve, New Year's parties are held here for children.  The surrounding forest makes the event even more fabulous.  After this, how not to believe in Santa Claus? </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  According to guests, the base is a great place to relax for guests of all ages and categories.  If you want to have fun with your family in nature - welcome to Ildorf.  Everything is provided for outdoor activities.  While mothers and children bathe in the river, fathers can go fishing, for which city residents do not have time in everyday life.  And in the evenings, animators conduct entertainment programs for a worthy end to a wonderful holiday.  Relying on rave reviews from tourists, we can safely recommend a recreation center for trips. </p>
