    <h2>  Airbeats Headphone Review </h2><p>  Some consumers, judging by the reviews, suggest that the Beats brand somehow refers to the famous rapper Dr. Dre.  This is not so, and such thoughts are false.  All products are made in the Republic of China, not in the company of the rapper. </p><p>  One of the most famous models of the manufacturer was <span>Air Beats wireless headphones.</span>  You need to pay attention to them, because, even considering the low cost, they are characterized by good quality. </p><p>  The cost of the model is only $ 20.  If you buy on the territory of Russia or Ukraine, you will have to overpay a little (twice), on Internet services the acquisition will be somewhat cheaper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Airbeats Reviews </h2><p>  In the reviews, people note both the positive aspects of the device, and the negative. </p><p>  The Beats Air Wireless Headphones have the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  Low price, which is fully consistent with the installed functionality. </li><li>  The device is also a headset, which facilitates the work with it. </li><li>  The microphone is of adequate quality, communication on it does not cause discomfort. </li><li>  The design is attractive.  All installed buttons on the case have their own coloring, lighting and design.  The most common design is the bluetooth icon. </li><li>  Light weight. </li><li>  Comfortable enough, which has become a special gift for the consumer. </li><li>  The sound is at a normal level.  Headphones are loud, no distortion. </li></ul><p>  Among the negative sides, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Poor quality materials. </li><li>  Many expected that there will be replaceable ear pads in the kit, but they are not.  But no one complained about the quick wear and lack of comfort of the "factory". </li></ul>

    <h2>  Appearance of Beats Solo 3 Wireless </h2><p>  Not much less than this model differs from the previous generation.  The look is really impressive.  The device is an invoice, not a full-size one.  A variety of colors remained at a good level.  There are many options, each of them in a sufficient assortment is sold in specialized stores. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It feels like Beats Wireless headphones are comfortable, many reviews confirm this.  You can use them for several hours in a row.  The design is completely made of plastic, but it is, in principle, resistant to damage.  Ear pads made of leatherette.  For ease of use, the device can be folded. </p><h2>  Options and new items in the Beats Solo 3 Wireless device </h2><p>  Beats wireless headphones come standard.  There is a case, carabiner, audio cable, USB for charging.  The playback wire does not work in conjunction with the Android OS, although the headphones themselves, functioning through the Bluetooth module, work fine when controlled from the "green man". </p><p>  The range of the device is impressive.  The headphones play music even at a distance of 35 m. However, it should be borne in mind that if there are several walls between the smartphone and the device, this figure will drop sharply to 10-20 m. The headphones will work for about 40 hours when fully charged.  This is confirmed even by consumer reviews, which cannot but rejoice. </p>

    <h2>  Sound Monster Beats Wireless </h2><p>  Monster Beats are not suitable for playing classical music.  They deal best with electronic, this must be considered when buying.  Bass and low frequencies are heard normally.  There are some distortions, but they are slightly striking. </p><p>  Some owners confidently declare that the price category and quality of reproduction does not correspond at all to each other.

    <h2>  Beats Studio Wireless wired and wireless headphones - which ones to choose? </h2><p>  How to choose Beats headphones?  Wireless, the price of which is 17 thousand rubles, or wired, whose cost reaches 14 thousand rubles?  If you rely on the recommendations of people and their reviews, then it is certainly worth a little more to spend and purchase a model with a bluetooth module. </p><p>  The downside of the wireless device is batteries.  They will be quickly discharged in the conditions of frosts (winter is rather cold in Russia).  Because of this, you will have to constantly purchase new batteries, which now cost a lot.  However, the absence of wires will allow you to perform less manipulation: no need to worry about the fact that the phone may fall and the headphones pull out. </p><p>  Like other wireless devices, the Beats Studio Wireless can be updated.  The company periodically releases new software. </p>
