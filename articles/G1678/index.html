Mountain Key Village: photos, description, resorts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Once upon a time, a monastery was erected in these places - Holy Trinity Nicholas.  Near him the village spread out.  And now, starting in 1965, this place is an urban resort town. </p><p>  <span>This is the village of</span> Primorsky Krai - Gorny Klyuchi (Kirovsky district).  The article provides some information about this mountain resort. </p><h2>  Geographical location and climate </h2><p>  This area is located in a natural park area, on the site of the southern slopes of the Sikhote-Alin ridge of the Ussuri taiga.  In administrative terms, the village, which is the center of the Gornoklyuchevsky settlement, is located in the northern part of the Kirovsky district.  The picturesque area is located at r.  Ussuri, in the place where Draguchin (duct) flows into it along the left bank.  The distance to the village of Kirov is about 16 kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB:%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%A3%D1%81%D1%81%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B8_%D1%83_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%91%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D0%9A%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%87%D0%B8.JPG"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ussuri River" class="if uuid-2839992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2839992.jpg"></div><p>  The railway station Shmakovka is located 21 km from the Mountain Keys of the Primorsky Territory.  The railway station Ruzhino, where many passenger trains stop, is located in the city of Lesozavodsk.  In addition, from many cities of Primorye, as well as from the city of Khabarovsk, intercity buses pass through Gorny Klyuchi. </p><p>  The climatic conditions of these places are sharply continental.  Winters are quiet, sunny, but cold, with little rainfall.  Since mid-November there has been a steady snow cover.  Fogs are rare in these places, in July the air temperature is + 21.8 degrees, in January - minus 20.8. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.23827240000001" data-lng="133.5065029" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/1/8/7/9187.png"></div><h2>  Briefly about the village </h2><p>  Through the village of <span>Primorsky Krai,</span> Gorny Klyuch, which is located on the banks of the Ussuri River, passes the M60 highway, which is the main transport artery of the Primorsky Krai. </p><p>  The famous Shmakovka resort located in Russia, which was discovered on mineral water deposits, as well as the oldest man‚Äôs monastery in the entire Far East, is located here.  People come to these places mainly in order to strengthen their health in boarding houses or visit the famous monastery.  More in the village there is nothing particularly remarkable.  All sanatoriums are located along the settlement, forming a long street in the form of an alley with residential and medical buildings, with swings and benches installed under tall coniferous trees.  The length of this park zone is about 2000 meters.  Many squirrels, pigeons and other birds live here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lotus lake" class="if uuid-2839979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2839979.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of the resort area </h2><p>  The name of the resort area suggests that there are sources near the village of Gorny Klyuchi in the Primorsky Territory.  A sanatorium complex operates here, using local reserves of mineral waters, very similar in composition to narzan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The local economy is more based on wellness and sanatorium services.  There are 4 sanatoriums in the village: im.  50th anniversary of the October Revolution, ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù, ‚ÄúShmakovsky military sanatorium‚Äù and ‚ÄúEmerald‚Äù.  Thanks to the beautiful scenic spots of the Ussuri Valley, unique balneological health resorts, mineral springs and clean air, these places attract a large number of tourists and vacationers.  The medical procedures of boarding houses are designed for both adults and children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB:%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%81_%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D0%9A%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%87%D0%B8_%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4_%D1%81_%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D1%8B_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%"><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the resort from the highway" class="if uuid-2839976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2839976.jpg"></div><h2>  Shmakovsky sanatorium </h2><p>  The military <span>sanatorium of the Primorsky Territory</span> in the village of Gorny Klyuchi is currently a powerful multidisciplinary treatment and prophylactic institution that can simultaneously receive about 500 people for treatment.  The main pride of the boarding house is a huge range of medical and preventive services offered to patients, and table mineral water. </p><p>  In total there are 4 therapeutic departments, physiotherapeutic, laboratory and reception, as well as departments of functional diagnostics and physiotherapy exercises. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photogoroda.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://photogoroda.com/foto-76311-voennyj-sanatorij.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Military sanatorium" class="if uuid-2840226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2840226.jpg"></div><p>  The medical boarding house is equipped with the most modern physiotherapeutic and diagnostic equipment.  The wonderful surrounding nature and clean air contribute to a favorable and relaxing holiday in it. </p><h2>  A bit about one historical attraction </h2><p>  Primorsky Krai (p. Mountain Keys) is famous for the oldest Holy Trinity Nicholas Monastery in the whole Far East, founded in 1893.  It has been operating since 1895.  Since then, it has become an important religious center of the region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.culture.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.culture.ru/objects/805/troickii-nikolaevskii-ussuriiskii-muzhskoi-monastyr-v-poselke-gornye-klyuchi"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monastery" class="if uuid-2840054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2840054.jpg"></div><p>  The monastery was closed in 1924, and in 1927-1991 it was used as a warehouse.  Only in 1995, monastic life again resumed in the monastery, but part of the former monastery buildings began to belong to the Shmakovsky sanatorium for the military. </p><p>  The Chapel of the Transfiguration of the Lord remained unfinished after the beginning of its construction in 1917.  Having become the property of the sanatorium, it was transformed into an observation deck, due to its convenient location on a high hill, from where a magnificent panorama of the surroundings opens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="primturist.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Orthodox chapel" class="if uuid-2839972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2839972.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The exact date of the foundation of the village of Gorny Klyuchi of the Primorsky Territory is still not known.  One of the versions about the beginning of the history of the village says that a settlement was laid down, as already noted above, in 1895 - from the date of the founding of the Shmakovsky monastery.  Once, upon learning of this convenient and fertile place, migrants from other places gathered all their home belongings in carts and hit the road.  The place is really very good: a river, fertile land, a monastery under construction and growing.  This earth corner was a real dream. </p><p>  However, things are a little different now.  Most likely, it is thanks to the presence of such wonderful sanatoriums that the village keeps afloat. </p>
