    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  This small village was founded by Cossacks in 1725.  Then the <span>Akhtanizovsky estuary</span> had no access to the sea.  Agricultural land needed irrigation, so local Cossacks dug a canal that began to connect <span>the Kuban River, the</span> Akhtanizovsky estuary and the Sea of ​​Azov.  The canal was quite narrow, so it had to be regularly cleaned of sand, which caused the wind.  So the name of the village appeared, reminding its modern residents how the channel was formed connecting the local lake and the Sea of ​​Azov.  Peresyp today is considered a great place for a quiet family vacation away from the bustle of the city. </p><p>  This village became known to tourists in Soviet times, when the state decided to open boarding houses and motels here.  However, despite the flow of tourists, the leisurely pace of life of the Peresyp has not changed, and remains so until now.  It is this silence and measuredness that vacationers appreciate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Settlement today </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Peresyp is not one of the most developed places for recreation, tourists who come here always have something to do.
