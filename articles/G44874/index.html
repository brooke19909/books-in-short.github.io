It has unusually beautiful nature, mild climate, wonderful Black Sea coast and a lot of entertainment for every taste.  Near Alanya, in neighboring villages, a vibrant tourist life boils all season.  We invite you to the small but unusually picturesque Mahmutlar, near which - almost on the seashore - is located the excellent 4-star Alanya Klas Hotel.  It belongs to a single hotel chain with a positive and promising name Klas.  We suggest you take a virtual tour of the Alania Klas hotel and some other hotels of the chain and see what is so ‚Äúcool‚Äù in them that they are given quite high marks - from 4 to 4.4 out of 5 points. </p><h2>  Location, how to get there </h2><p>  First, visit Alanya Klas Hotel 4 *.  It is located a stone's throw from First Class Hotel 5 *, therefore guests of one and the second hotel can use many infrastructure facilities without the slightest obstacle.  With the location of these two hotels, as well as other similar establishments of the Klas chain, there is little confusion.  Tour operators report that they are in the village of Mahmutlar.  In fact this is not true.  To clarify the situation.  In 2014, Mahmutlar officially became a district of Alanya, one might say, its suburb.  From it to the city center a little over 11 km.  An excellent <span>asphalt road</span> connects these settlements <span>,</span> along which minibuses ‚Äúrun‚Äù all day.  You can get to the city in 20 minutes.  On the seashore, you can also get to Mahmutlar from Alanya (walk), since beaches stretch along the coast with an endless ribbon.  This former village, and now the urban area itself is small, there are only three central streets in it, but its infrastructure is well developed.  There are many supermarkets, <span>bars, restaurants,</span> pharmacies, the Russian Cultural Center, discos, beauty and health salons, and a market.  From the eastern side (farthest from Alanya), Mahmutlar smoothly passes into the village called Kargichak, the border between which as such is not.  This is the farthest resort in the region.  It is remarkable only for its natural beauties - the Taurus Mountains, the sea coast and orange gardens.  The infrastructure here is poorly developed, but hotel prices are the cheapest in all of Alanya.  It is in this place that those who choose tours to the Alanya Klas Hotel will have a rest.  Advertising brochures often confuse which village it is located in.  Let us explain in Kargichak.  The distance from here to Alanya is about 16 km, and to the airport in Antalya, where charters with Russian tourists arrive, almost 140 km.  Transfers go to Kargichak for 3 hours or more - it depends on how many tourists will be brought to other hotels along the way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alanya Klas Hotel" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2034028.jpg" width="598"></div>

Although there is another Klas hotel in the neighborhood, the territory of this hotel has its own territory.  It is small, only 10,000 m <sup>2</sup> , but it has two swimming pools, restaurants, bars, a shop and a spa center.  There was a place for a playground.  The whole territory is very clean and green, exotic palm trees grow around, pine trees more familiar to our eyes, as well as oranges and olives. </p><p>  The hotel was built in 2005, and in 2015 there was a total reconstruction, so that so far all the equipment in it is new and functional.  The building is five-story, quite attractive from the outside, although there are no special decor elements in it.  For the guests this, perhaps, is not so important, it matters to them that here each room has its own spacious balcony with views of the sea or the mountains surrounding the village. </p><p>  The reception at Alanya Klas Hotel has friendly staff who understand Russian and are able to speak Russian, which helps a lot in solving current issues.  Here you can not only get room keys, but also exchange money, buy a tour, call a doctor, taxi, rent things, rent a vehicle (car, motorcycle, bicycle).  In the lobby, where the reception is located, there are comfortable sofas, armchairs, tables, a bar, and free wireless internet.  By the way, you can use it only here, since nowhere else, including numbers, the Internet does not work, although theoretically it is. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Klas Boutique Hotel Alanya" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2034018.jpg" width="599"></div>

According to tourists, their design is simple, fully consistent with the concept of minimalism.  The rooms have the most necessary set of furniture, a mirror, a flat-screen TV with a diagonal of 55 cm (there are three Russian channels), a refrigerator, air conditioning.  The hygiene room has a shower with a curtain, a toilet and a washbasin.  Hygiene products are provided in bottles with a dispenser.  The soundproofing in the rooms is average, there are no insects (ants and others), cleaning is done every other day.  The maids, by their kindness or sincere tip, twist the figures on the beds from towels.  Their responsibilities also include mopping, taking out garbage, replenishing ending soaps, shampoo, toilet paper, changing bed linen (2 times a week) and towels (every other day).  There are only two categories of rooms in Alanya Klas Hotel: </p><p>  1. Standard area from 14 to 28 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  2. Family 40 m2. </p><p>  The difference is only in their size and in the number of beds installed.  The standard can accommodate 2 people (adults) and 1 child (in a crib).  The family can accommodate 4 people, plus 1 child in a crib. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Only with Al food can you buy tours to Alanya Klas Hotel.  The description of the restaurant, where all the main meals are held, tourists give quite pleasant.  The purity and order reigning here are especially noted.  Note that this is a restaurant of the neighboring five-star First Class Hotel.  Despite the fact that the guests of two hotels are eating here at the same time, everyone always has a free table, clean plates, forks and spoons.  Waiters work very efficiently, manage to remove dirty dishes from tables, change the tablecloth and serve tourists.  The menu of breakfasts, lunches and dinners is full of all kinds of dishes for every taste - there are dairy products, cereals (5 types), cheeses, sausages, cutlets, sausages, many side dishes from vegetables, pasta, rice, salads, fruits, pastries, desserts.  Hungry guests can have a bite to eat at the Kalinka-Malinka cafe, which is already the property of the Alania Klas Hotel, or in the bars by the pool and on the beach.  In addition, the hotel in question has two more bars - in the lounge area and at the disco. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Klas Dom Hotel Alanya" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2034024.jpg" width="599"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Of course, Turkey is famous all over the world for its wonderful beaches.  Alanya Klas Hotel from the coastline is only 50 meters, but tourists cannot easily and quickly overcome them.  An obstacle to this is the wide four-lane road.  It‚Äôs better to cross it using the tunnel, but, according to the guests, there is no lighting there and the steps are not repaired.  If you do not take into account this slight inconvenience, a beach holiday for hotel guests is not bad.  The sea in this part of the coast is clean and relatively calm, large waves are rare.  Beach cover - pebble sand.  Entry into the water, however, with stones, but gentle, the depth does not begin near the shore.  Since two hotels are located almost on the same territory, and each has a beach area, their guests can choose which of the two beaches they should be located on.  Free sunbeds are on one and the other.  Also on both beaches there are toilets, changing cabins, a shower, a bar, water attractions work.  The difference is that a pier is built on one of the beaches, from which it is convenient to dive. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Hotel Alanya Klas Hotel reviews from tourists.  They give him an average rating of 4 to 4.4 out of 5. What do you like here: </p><ul><li>  small but well-groomed area; </li><li>  excellent pools, one with water slides; </li><li>  delicious food; </li><li>  friendliness and friendliness of employees; </li><li>  great animation; </li><li>  beautiful sea views from the windows of the rooms; </li><li>  entertainment for children. </li></ul><p>  What do not like: </p><ul><li>  not every furniture was replaced during the repair; </li><li>  meals in the restaurant of the guests of two hotels at once; </li><li>  passage to the beach. </li></ul><h2>  Klas Dom Hotel Alanya </h2><p>  This hotel also has a 4 star rating.  From the Alanya Klas we reviewed, it is located about 2 km towards Alanya.  It is also 2 km from the village of Mahmutlar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Alanya Klas Hotel" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2034048.jpg" width="597"></div>  This hotel was built in 1996, that is, his experience is already substantial.  The territory is small, only 6,000 m <sup>2</sup> , and given the fact that there are 4 residential buildings ("A", "B" and "C"), there is very little space for walking and leisure.  Nevertheless, the whole territory is neat and well-groomed, wherever possible, evergreen shrubs and flowers are planted.  Under the canopy of trees, there is a pool with water slides and a playground.  The reception is located in the central five-story building "A".  Here in the lobby there are shops, a billiard room, a cinema hall and a restaurant.  The infrastructure of Klas Dom Hotel Alanya has two conference rooms, a sauna, a hammam, a games room with board games, and an Internet cafe.

Their categories are standard with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã20 m <sup>2</sup> and family with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã40 m <sup>2</sup> .  According to the descriptions of tourists, living conditions in different buildings are significantly different.  So, the building ‚ÄúA‚Äù has recently undergone repairs, so there is a situation in the rooms, furniture and sanitary ware, bedding and towels, although not new, but sound, everything works fine, everything is clean.  In case "C" the picture is somewhat different.  Repair has not yet reached here, so the rooms, according to the guests, do not correspond to the declared 4 * category.  The furniture, linens and towels are old, the taps in some rooms do not close well, which is why water is constantly dripping.  The equipment of all 194 rooms is the same and includes a TV, free air conditioning, a small refrigerator.

    <h2>  Food and leisure </h2><p>  Klas Boutique is just one of those neighboring hotels, whose meals are served in the restaurant of the Klas Dom hotel.  The distance to it is 650 meters.  Some guests see this as a plus, as they rightly believe that after a hearty meal, it is useful to take a walk. </p><p> Leisure at the hotel takes place only by the pool.
