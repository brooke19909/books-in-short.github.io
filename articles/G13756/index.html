    <h2>  Personal diary: where to start? </h2><p>  So, you have decided to get the LD!  First you need to decide on the tools and materials needed for this lesson.  First of all, you should decide what size your diary will be, and after that you should already look for the answer to the question "how to make LD?".  If most of the notes are planned to be kept at home or in another convenient place, then for this purpose an ordinary notebook is perfect.  A notepad on the rings or a thick sketchbook may also be a good choice.  It will be convenient to make entries in a diary of this format, since doing it on a large page is always easier. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, if you plan to travel a lot and "secret" at this time with a "paper friend", you must make sure that he does not take up much space in his bag and is always at hand.  An excellent choice in this situation will be a small notebook on the rings or a book.  A good option is also keeping a diary on separate sheets - A4, A5 format or the so-called posts, which periodically need to be stitched together. </p>

    <h2>  LD from the sketchbook </h2><p>  Owners of creative and creative thinking can choose an album for drawing as a basis for a diary.  Such an LD will make it possible to make not only notes on its pages, but also drawings.  Of course, no one can forbid you to draw in a regular notebook, but remember how quickly paints or felt-tip pens interrupt on the opposite side of such pages, in connection with which the text on them is practically not visible.  The album is a completely different matter.  Its thick pages will allow you to use any felt-tip pens or paints in your work, keeping the page clean from the back.  In addition, it is easier to stick various design elements to such sheets - cardboard inserts, pieces of fabric, buttons, etc. </p><h2>  Old book - an unusual basis for LD </h2><p>  If the option with neither a notebook nor an album suits you and you still think how to make LD yourself, then look for an old book and use it as a basis for a diary.  Spending time with such a ‚Äúpaper friend‚Äù will surely make you feel like an extraordinary and unique person.  If the book is very thick, then it is worth deleting some pages from it, but not all together, but, for example, every third or fourth.  An exception is the case if it is planned to draw in such a diary, then some pages will first have to be glued together in two. </p><p>  But how to make entries in such an LD if printed text is already present there?  And herein lies the whole interest of this process!  First you need to cover up the printed text.  Of course, this process is rather laborious, but at this time you will have the opportunity to think about what you want to share with your ‚Äúpaper friend‚Äù.  For glossing, it is best to use paints with a small addition of gouache, since the text does not appear through them, unlike watercolors. </p>

    <h2>  The external design of the diary </h2><p>  So, the basis for the LD was chosen, the tools were prepared, it was time to take care of the appearance of your ‚Äúpaper friend‚Äù, namely, decorate its cover.  To do this, you can use a variety of materials.  You can make a removable cover of bright gift paper or sew it from fabric of interesting colors and a pleasant to the touch texture.  On top you can also sew guipure, braid, beads, bows, paste rhinestones or fix two pieces of fabric from different edges of the notebook and make an imitation of lacing.  In a word, there are a huge number of ways to make LD original, the main thing is to let your imagination manifest. </p><p>  If needlework is not your path, you can restrict yourself to a simpler option and decorate the cover of a notebook, album or book with funny stickers with images of your favorite characters from films or stick out clippings from magazines. </p><h2>  Diary Interior Design </h2><p>  Having designed a beautiful cover, you simply cannot allow that there was no ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù inside the diary.  Agree, if you don‚Äôt know how to make an original page in LD, then communication with a ‚Äúpaper friend‚Äù can become quite boring and very annoying.  That is why recordings should be done with multi-colored pens.  Moreover, the author can use colors depending on his mood.  For example, black - in a state of sadness, blue - calm, pink - a romantic mood.  Drawings or pasted illustrations can also be attached to the records, which will give a more complete picture of the event or emotions. </p>
