It is also called Volzhskaya.  With its help, two embankments are connected: Verkhne-Volzhskaya or Nizhne-Volzhskaya. </p><h2>  About Attraction </h2><p>  This building adorns Nizhny Novgorod.  The Chkalov staircase was created in accordance with the project of talented architects <span>A. Yakovlev,</span> L. Rudnev and V. Munts.  Its beginning is located in the viewing area next to the monument dedicated to Chkalov.  This is precisely why this item found its name. </p>

This structure has the shape of an eight.  The Chkalovskaya ladder (Nizhny Novgorod) is quite large.  How many steps here are of interest to many who first see her.

    <p>  There are 560 of them, if you count from both sides.  If you move up, you can count 442 on the right.  Reaching the intersections of the slopes on the sides, you can walk to two sites for viewing.  This place is considered by people living in Nizhny Novgorod to be one of their business cards.  The Chkalov staircase is the path to the monument boat called ‚ÄúHero‚Äù, located directly near the Volga. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  When this land was part of the Russian Empire, as well as in the period before the Second World War, there was the Volga slope.  Only then did the Chkalov staircase begin to decorate Nizhny Novgorod. </p><p>  However, when she was not here yet, people already loved to gather here.  Also here guests of the city were called.  On the site, which is now occupied by a monument created in honor of V. Chkalov, there was a protrusion of a semicircular shape, from where you could admire the Borskaya floodplain.  From here there was an opportunity to get to Blagoveshchenskaya Square, which was later renamed Sovetskaya and then Minin and Pozharsky.  There is also a short exit to the beginning of Georgievskaya embankment. </p>

    <h2>  Pause and start work </h2><p>  Plans for the creation of this staircase on the territory of the Volga slope were first visited by A. Shulpin in 1939, when he was chairman of the Gorky city executive committee.  At that time, it was a rather spectacular step, because it was the Chkalov Stairs (Nizhny Novgorod) that should have become the link between the city center and the Volga. </p><p>  The photos show that indeed one embankment is connected to another thanks to this building, which, according to the bold plans of the architects, should have become larger than the <span>Potemkinskaya stairs,</span> which you can see in Odessa. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The project was not implemented immediately, because this was hindered by the war with Germany that began very soon.  They returned to development already in 1943, when this territory was recovering from the consequences of the bombing by the German invaders.  The idea was further developed and was further advanced.  Shulpin made a trip to Moscow, where he presented the project of Yakovlev, Rudnev and Munts - talented architects from Leningrad. </p>

    <h2>  Construction </h2><p>  It was originally planned that the staircase would go down from the hotel complex "Russia".  However, she was moved to the monument to Chkalov, who was a friend of the main developer.  Thanks to this, the structure in its location approached the city Kremlin of the Middle Ages.  After obtaining approval, funds were allocated from the capital, thanks to which it was possible to carry out the construction of a large-scale object glorifying the victory in the battle of Stalingrad. </p><p>  They also wanted to name the staircase in honor of this city.  In 1943, the first stone was laid.  The people living here were engaged in construction, as well as the Germans, who were captured.  The grand opening was carried out in 1949.  A total of 7 million rubles was submitted by the chairman of the city executive committee.  As a result, he was arrested in connection with the misappropriation of the budget.  After Stalin died, the culprit was rehabilitated. </p>

    <h2>  Popularity </h2><p>  Nowadays, you can see a beautiful panorama of the city from here.  If the mayor has sinned in anything, now he can only be thanked for that.  Many tourists come to take a look at this famous place.  There are regularly held competitions in sports, most often these are races. </p><p>  In 1985, at the foot of the pedestal, they staged a beautiful boat, used by the Volga Fleet in wartime.  The name of this monument is ‚ÄúHero‚Äù, it has gained great popularity among the newlyweds. </p><p>  Until the period of 2008, the attraction was hung from all sides with flowers: on shafts, screws and other parts.  However, the administration did not like this behavior very much, so metal structures were erected to stop this.  The last time the staircase was restored during the 2013th. </p><h2>  Impression </h2><p>  A beautiful and picturesque place is the Chkalov Stairs (Nizhny Novgorod).  Her address: Nizhnevolzhskaya embankment. </p><p>  Visitors and locals call the building simply gorgeous.  This is the epicenter of city life.  Many are attracted by the old Kremlin and a beautiful monument to the great pilot Chkalov, from which you can see the picturesque embankment of the Volga River. </p>
