For more than thirty centuries, the personality of this statesman and thinker has been overgrown with legends and fabrications.  He is considered the wisest of the wisest, but to verify the accuracy of the statements of the Jewish sage is no longer possible.  However, the quotes of Solomon to this day are relevant and in demand. </p><h2>  Solomon's biography </h2><p>  The main source of information about the ruler of the Jewish kingdom is the Bible.  To this day, disputes about the veracity of this scripture do not subside.  However, at present, we still officially accept the fact that such a person lived and rules.  The years of his reign date back to about the 10th century BC.  e.  Solomon was the third king of the Jewish state, before his father David was in power. </p><p>  Under Solomon, the Jerusalem Temple was built, one of the main religious buildings of the entire Jewish people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kirkjulistahatid.is" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.kirkjulistahatid.is/en/king-solomon-a-microforum-2/"><img itemprop="image" alt="solomon quote everything will pass" class="if uuid-2618214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2618214.jpg"></div><p>  Over the 40 years of King Solomon's rule, the state has flourished and gained power.  <span>The wisdom of Solomon</span> helped his country and people live in peace and prosperity. </p><h2>  The wisdom of the great king </h2><p>  As already mentioned, King Solomon admired his wisdom, and today anyone who seeks the answer to seemingly difficult and insoluble questions can refer to the quotes of Solomon.  The wisdom and correctness of his statements has been verified for many centuries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><blockquote><p>  Wisdom is more useful than stupidity, as light is more useful than darkness.  But a single fate will befall both the wise and the stupid. </p><p>  The main thing is wisdom: acquire wisdom and acquire intelligence with all your possessions. </p></blockquote><p>  The king also spoke of love: </p><blockquote><p>  Hatred arouses contention, but love covers all sins. </p></blockquote><p>  He respected and appreciated the family: </p><blockquote><p>  Together, it would be better than one, because if they fall, they will raise one another, but woe, if one falls, and to raise him, there is no other, and even if two are lying, is it warm to them, how can they warm themselves? </p>  A wise wife sets up her house, and a stupid one destroys it with her own hands. </blockquote><p>  Solomon's quotes are known throughout the world, they contain advice and the simple truth of life, and sometimes a complex philosophical meaning.  You can agree with them, you can dispute, but everyone can find something important for themselves.  It will be a conversation about love, or about stupidity, about anger or hatred, about the abundance or meaning of life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jeremiahliang.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wisdom of solomon quotes" class="if uuid-2618204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2618204.jpg"></div><p>  Solomon not only speaks of difficult situations in simple words, but also often gives advice.  After many years, these wise thoughts from the past and today can help prevent mistakes. </p><blockquote><p>  Do not eat the food of an envious person and do not be tempted by his tasty dishes. </p><p>  Do not answer the fool for his foolishness, lest he become a wise man in his eyes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Obey your father: he begat you;  and do not neglect your mother when she is old. </p></blockquote><h2>  Famous Quotes </h2><p>  Quotes of Solomon have been wandering for hundreds of years among people who care about life.  They are passed from mouth to mouth, discussed at schools and institutes, addressed to them in moments of doubt and sadness.  Probably one of the most famous quotes: </p><blockquote><p>  There is a time for everything, and a time for every work under heaven: a time to be born and a time to die ... a time to destroy and a time to build ... a time to scatter stones and a time to lay stones ... a time to be silent and a time to speak. </p></blockquote><p>  This phrase can often be found in small print collections of Jewish wisdom. </p><p>  The sage often provided a basis for reflection, speaking philosophically, so that everyone could find their own meaning in words. </p><blockquote><p>  What happened is what will be, and what is happening is happening, and there is nothing new under the Sun. </p></blockquote><p>  Tsar Solomon‚Äôs quotes today are not only distributed on Internet resources, but also left on his body in the form of tattoos. </p><blockquote><p>  Anger is ruining and reasonable. </p><p>  He who gives to a beggar does not become poor. </p><p>  The soul of the lazy wants, but in vain. </p><p>  Fools only despise wisdom and instruction. </p><p>  Fear is nothing but the deprivation of help from reason. </p><p>  From all labor there is profit, and from idle talk only damage. </p></blockquote><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="King Solomon" class="if uuid-2618206" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2618206.jpg"></div><p>  As we can see, Solomon speaks a lot about human stupidity.  It was laziness, unwillingness to learn and work on his personality that caused him sincere indignation.  Now this is more relevant than ever, because most modern people are "mired" on the Internet, computer games and senseless waste paper of tabloid novels.  It is sad to see how society is degrading. </p><blockquote><p>  The wise are silent, therefore fools can pass for the wise if they are silent. </p><p>  Do not answer the foolish by his foolishness, lest you also become like him. </p><p>  Better knowledge than perfect gold;  because wisdom is better than pearls, and none of the desired can be compared with it. </p><p>  The main thing is wisdom: acquire wisdom and acquire intelligence with all your possessions.  Appreciate her, and she will exalt you. </p></blockquote><p>  And there are such statements, the meaning of which was rephrased in a modern manner.  For example, quote: </p><blockquote><p>  It is better to live in a corner on the roof than with a grumpy wife in a spacious house. </p></blockquote><p>  The common expression "With sweet paradise and in a hut" carries the same meaning. </p><p>  Solomon did not bypass the topic of drunkenness, which at all times worried many. </p><blockquote><p>  Who has a howl?  Who has a moan?  Who has a fight?  Who has grief?  Who has wounds for no reason?  Who has the crimson eyes?  Those who sit for a long time at the wine ... And you say: They beat me, it did not hurt me;  pushing me, I did not feel.  When I wake up, I will again look for the same. </p></blockquote><h2>  The history of the famous quote </h2><p>  In addition to numerous quotes and <span>wise sayings</span> , many parables are associated with the name of Solomon.  One of them is known from Solomon's quote, "Everything Passes."  This popular parable is about the famous ring of Solomon. </p><p>  Once the Jewish ruler turned to the sage, so that he would give him advice on how to cope with difficult life situations.  To which the sage gave Solomon a ring where an engraving was made with the words: "Everything will pass."  The elder explained that when faced with an ambiguous emotional situation, whether it is joy or anger, you need to remove the ring from your finger and look at the inscription. </p><p>  In one of these situations, where anger took power over emotions, Solomon took off the ring, and having not received reassurance from the familiar inscription, we were surprised to find another engraving on the inside of the ring, which read: "And this too." </p><p>  There is even a continuation of this story, when the king "found" another inscription on his deathbed, which read: "Nothing passes." </p><p>  Today, probably, this is the most famous quotes of Solomon that every person on Earth knows. </p><h2>  Nowadays </h2><p>  The sage was addressed at all times, and the more time has passed since the day of his death, the more significant his saying was considered.  Indeed, over the years, the meaning of life for a person has not changed.  Passions still rage, disagreements occur in families, fools try to seem smart, and the wise seek the meaning of life and keep their soul. </p><p>  Like hundreds of years ago, we are worried about the same problems, but everyone is dying, no matter how sad it sounds. </p><blockquote><p>  Our life will pass like the trail of a cloud, and will scatter like fog, and there will be no return from death: for a seal has been put, and no one is returning. </p></blockquote><p>  Solomon made sure that his life experience went to the next generation.  Could he think then that his wisdom would survive to this day?  But it is to her that we turn in moments of despair, recalling the great and simple words that everything passes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nerartgallery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="King Solomon" class="if uuid-2618799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2618799.jpg"></div><p>  Solomon worked a lot during his life, leaving their work to people regardless of whether they are smart or stupid, it is important that these people will own his work, and everyone will decide what to do with it. </p>
