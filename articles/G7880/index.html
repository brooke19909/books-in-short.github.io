    <h2>  General characteristics of the facility </h2><p>  Teletskoye Lake, whose hostels are waiting for guests both in summer and winter, is the largest body of water in the Altai Territory.  Its depth reaches 330 meters.  It is because of this that Teletskoy is called the younger brother of Lake Baikal.  In the local dialect, it is called Altyn-Kol, which means <span>"golden lake".</span>  According to legend, at the bottom of it lies a large gold bar, which the angry Altai threw there during the famine: he went around the whole edge, but could not buy anything for it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Teletskoye lake in winter" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/658143.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Despite the popularity of the destination, tourists have not yet sufficiently mastered Lake Teletskoye.  Rest can be spent only on its northern part.  True, you can sail to the South Bank by boat or take an SUV through the pass.

The eastern shore of the lake is now part of the Altai Reserve.  The two largest waterfalls in the lake are Korbu and Kishte.  Also, tourists like to watch waterfalls on the Third River.  The undoubted advantage that Teletskoye Lake possesses is the price of rest, it is available to almost everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia Altai Republic Teletskoye Lake" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/658142.jpg" width="375"></div>

Kishte waterfall, although not very large, but very beautiful.  You can get to it by boat.  It is visible only from the water surface, it is impossible to get to it by land.  The intestine is very deep.  By the way, it is on the way, just 4 kilometers from <span>the highest waterfall in</span> Korbu.  It is also located on the eastern shore of the lake and is part of the Altai Nature Reserve.  Usually tourists are brought to him by boat.  To the village of Artybash - about 30 kilometers, the distance is pretty decent.

    <p>  Another waterfall with a very beautiful name Ayu-Kechpes, which is translated from the local means "the bear will not pass."  A stream of water falls from an 80-meter cliff, but it is not very full-flowing and cascades.  The beauty of Ayu-Keches is best appreciated from the water, and at a fairly large distance from the object itself. </p><p>  Waterfall Forty Sins is shrouded in legend.  Now it is not known who gave him such a name, but it is believed that if you stand under its streams, then forty sins are washed away from a person. </p><p>  Also, tourists often visit the cascade of waterfalls on the Third River.  The fact is that finding them is very easy.  You can go hiking on your own, without guides and guides.  You can walk from Artybash village.  There are three kilometers along a good asphalt road, and then you will have to overcome a small section of the forest path.  Waterfalls here are not so magnificent, but there are many of them, they flow down cascades. </p><p>  In addition to water, there are also mountain attractions on Lake Teletskoye.  For example, stone mushrooms.  Teletskoye Lake (the map clearly shows this) is surrounded by rivers that flow into or out of it.  Stone mushrooms are located 50 kilometers from the mouth of the Chulyshman River.  They are high peak-like cliffs, on top of which there are stones. </p><p>  Excursions to Mount Kibitek are very popular, because from its slopes you can enjoy stunning views of Lake Teletskoye.  The hostels located in the immediate vicinity of this mountain certainly offer tourists a trip with a guide. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Teletskoye Lake rest" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/658141.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another interesting place is Stone Bay.  This is a small bay, which can be reached on foot from the village of Iogach, and only 4 kilometers from Artybash.  The shores of this bay are completely covered with boulders of different sizes, so it is so popular. </p><h2>  Location of objects </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Teletskoye Lake map" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/658144.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><p>  Teletskoye Lake (the map clearly demonstrates this) has a very interesting shape, which is not surprising for a <span>lake of mountain</span> origin.  All resorts are thickened on the north coast, in the vicinity of the villages of Artybash and Iogach. </p>
