The very location of the city, in the slope of the Carpathian ridge at an altitude of 340 meters above sea level, among thousands of square kilometers of clean forests, is ideal for healing and recreation, complementing the healing process. </p><h2>  Morshin - resort </h2><p>  The effectiveness of treatment in the sanatoriums of the city has been confirmed for almost 140 years.  During this time, hundreds of thousands of vacationers from all over the former USSR and neighboring countries visited Morshin sanatoriums.  The first holiday season was opened here in 1878 as a climatic one.  People came to the resort to treat respiratory organs.  Mineral sources discovered in Morshyn and a study of the properties of water allowed medical scientists to conclude that the high content of magnesium sulfate salts in the waters allows them to be used for various gastroenterological diseases.  From this moment begins the construction of sanatoriums. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Morshin resort sanatoriums" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1837357.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Since the beginning of the 20th century, Morshin with sanatoriums and resorts has been called the Galician Carlsbad or the Ukrainian Karlovy Vary.  Over the years, popularity has been growing in Europe, since the medical base of Morshyn is not inferior to the famous resorts of Wiesbaden, Baden-Baden and Karlovy Vary.  Everything suited the Europeans: medical procedures, picturesque nature, healing air, prices in Morshin sanatoriums.  And at present, the activity of visiting resorts and sanatoriums has not decreased.  Guests of Ukrainians and their neighboring states are fully satisfied with the pricing policy of sanatoriums and the treatment in them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  City infrastructure </h2><p>  You can arrive in the city by bus, train or private transport.  There are automobile and railway stations and all communication services - communication, Internet, banks, ATMs.  There are outdoor areas with billiards, a mini-pool, outdoor baths, bars, cafes, tennis courts, a salt cave and gyms.  The city has a tour desk dealing with excursions of various subjects, from visiting the ski Bukovel to a pilgrimage to Manyavsky Sket and <span>Pochaev Lavra.</span>  Near the city there are lakes, very popular among people who come to rest and treatment.  The water is clean, as well as in the sources, healing, which is why doctors of sanatoriums recommend swimming in them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Morshin Satatorium" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1837359.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Morshin: health resorts </h2><p>  There are several pensions in the city.  The most famous are Marble Palace, Kiev Plus, Morshinsky, Dniester.  All these sanatoriums have one focus - healing with the help of mineral waters, mud therapy and the natural climate.  The only thing that distinguishes <span>these resorts is the</span> level of comfort of living.  This affects the cost of tickets.  To the more comfortable and modern with a high level of service can be attributed, as patients write in the reviews, sanatorium Morshina "Marble Palace" and "Morshinsky."  The procedures in all the above sanatoriums of the city are almost the same, that is, undergoing treatment in these sanatoriums will satisfy patients who come to improve their health and recover. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sanatoriums "Marble Palace" and "Morshinsky" </h2><p>  The oldest of them is the Marble Palace, located in the city center, but surrounded on all sides by a picturesque forest park.  On the square in front of the health resort there is a pump room of mineral waters.  During the construction of the building of the sanatorium, various varieties of marble were used, which is why this Morshin sanatorium is called the "Marble Palace".  And the sanatorium "Morshinsky" is located in a vast landscaped park with giant oaks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Morshin Health Resort Prices" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1837360.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The basic treatment, which is prescribed by the doctors of the sanatoriums, is aimed at improving: digestive organs (liver, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas), endocrine system (thyroid gland and diabetes mellitus), kidneys, urinary system, male genital area, respiratory system (ENT, asthma, bronchitis )  Here patients with gynecological problems and musculoskeletal system recover.  The modern medical base of the sanatoriums provides a complete diagnosis of patients who have arrived for rehabilitation.  There are several general health programs to promote health.  For accommodation, rooms are available that meet different requests of visitors. </p><p>  In the sanatoriums "Marble Palace" and "Morshinsky" there are standard, luxury, junior suites, suites with balustrades, exclusive and improved.  Naturally, the cost of a ticket to the sanatorium will depend on the choice of category of accommodation.  On average, living in a double standard room with 3 meals a day and going through the procedures per day costs from 58 to 64 US dollars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spas morshina reviews" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1837358.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sanatoria Morshina "Kiev Plus" and "Dniester" </h2><p>  These two sanatoriums practically do not differ in providing treatment and rehabilitation for patients who have arrived on holiday packages.  This is a multidisciplinary health resort.  They, like the previous ones, are located within the city and are surrounded by forest parks.  The equipment of the sanatoriums is modern.  Trips to the Dniester and Kiev Plus are sold in an all-inclusive format, that is, the entire organization of treatment and recreation is included in the cost.  It remains surprising that prices in these resorts are moderate.  So, for the same apartments in the above sanatoriums they will pay $ 37 here. </p><p>  Leaving the sanatoriums, people write reviews about treatment and relaxation.  With words of gratitude, those who leave are leaving for the medical staff and the maids serving their life.  I like food, especially Ukrainian cuisine, and the organization of leisure.  That is why grateful patients come here every year to improve their health. </p>
