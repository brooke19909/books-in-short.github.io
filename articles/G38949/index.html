  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cook Islands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cook Islands is a small tourist paradise.  Almost the entire local population, one way or another, is working in the service sector of vacationers.  In addition, there are magnificent white sand beaches, corners of pristine nature, original culture and much more that may interest tourists. </p><p>  Cook Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean, south of <span>New Zealand,</span> of which they have long been a part.  Today it is a self-governing state entity, the sovereignty of which, however, is far from recognized by all countries.  Locals have New Zealand citizenship, but live by their constitution. </p><p>  This association includes 15 islands of various sizes, their total area is 237 km2, and the population is about 60 thousand people.  The main island of Cook is Rarotonga, the capital of the island and the whole state - Avarua.  The archipelago includes islands of volcanic and coral origin, and they are divided into two groups: northern and southern. </p><p>  The first visits to these lands took place in 1595 and in 1606, however, records of the Cook Islands appeared only in 1773, when they were first visited by the explorer James Cook.  He visited the southern part of the archipelago, and in his notes gave him the name of Harvey Island.  However, it did not take root even later, in the 19th century, Kruzenshtern, a Russian traveler, called these lands the Cook Islands. </p><p>  In 1814, another visit to the archipelago by Europeans took place, ending with a bloody massacre, and a few years later the first missionaries arrived.  The local population was quickly introduced to the new faith and still preaches Christianity.  Already in 1888, the Cook Islands became a protectorate of England, and in 1901 they were transferred to the administration of New Zealand.  The <span>archipelago</span> became a self-governing <span>state</span> in 1965. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Church music is very popular on the Cook Islands.  Moreover, unlike generally accepted traditions, local church hymns are performed using the 6th chord.  Traditional religious songs are of great importance in the life of the islanders.  There are hymns dedicated to every important event in a person‚Äôs life: wedding, funeral, birth of children and so on.  In addition to the hymns common throughout the archipelago, each of the islands has its own set of songs. </p><p>  It is best to explore the Cook Islands starting with Rarotong, it is here that the main part of the sights of the time of colonization, including the first church, the first settlement of missionaries and so on.  It also organizes excursions to the pristine jungle and <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãfishing.</span>  Divers will find many interesting things for themselves here.  The fact is that before the island was in the center of a large coral atoll, which now went under water. </p><p>  It should be noted that Rarotonga is one of the young islands of the archipelago, as can be judged by the mountain formation on this and other islands.  Rarotong has a powerful volcanic ensemble, with high young mountains, while on the rest the mountains are more reminiscent of high hills with gentle slopes. </p><p>  All this, coupled with sandy beaches and a hot tropical climate, attracts tourists to the Cook Islands.  Tours here are in demand all year round, since seasonal <span>climate changes</span> in this area are insignificant, they give off a cool, dry period from April to November, when the temperature is approximately 24-26 degrees;  and a hot humid period, from December to March.  At this time, the average temperature is about 25-30 degrees. </p><p>  A visa to Ostrava Cook is issued at the entrance, which, without a doubt, is very convenient.  In order to get it, you only need a passport, a return ticket and a <span>tourist voucher.</span>  It does not interfere with familiarity with <span>customs regulations.</span>  So, the import of currency into the territory of the state is not limited, but it is impossible to export more than 5000 New Zealand dollars.  You can not import food, weapons and drugs.  Samples of animals or plants that are under protection cannot be taken out.  For this reason, all products from wood, feathers, leather, corals, etc. are subject to inspection and mandatory certification. </p>
