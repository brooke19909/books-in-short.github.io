  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lictor is: the essence of the profession and historical facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Lictors are Roman civil servants who were the bodyguards of magistrates from the time of the Roman Empire (and earlier).  Lictors have been used since the days of the Roman kingdom, and, according to the historian Libya, they could have appeared even earlier in Etruscan civilization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reconstruction of liqueurs" class="if uuid-3145431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/3145431.jpg"></div><h2>  History and features </h2><p>  According to Livy, the first lictors were inaugurated by the very first Roman king, Romulus, who appointed 12 of them for his own protection. </p><p>  Initially, lictors were bodyguards who were selected from the plebs, but for most of Roman history they were freedmen.  Centurions from legions also automatically became representatives of this position upon retirement from the army.  They were, however, Roman citizens, as they wore togas and were free to reside in Rome. </p><p>  The speaker should have been a well-built man, capable of physical work.  They were exempted from military service, received a fixed salary (600 sisters at the beginning of the Empire) and were organized in corporations.  Usually they were personally selected by the magistrate, whom they were supposed to serve, but sometimes they were elected by drawing lots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Speaker and praetor" class="if uuid-3145434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/3145434.jpg"></div><h2>  Targets and goals </h2><p>  The lecturers were associated with Comitia Curiata, and probably one was originally selected from each curia individually, since initially there were 30 curia and 30 carriers of this position (24 for two consuls and six for a single praetor). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main task of the lictors was to work as the bodyguards of the magistrate, having an imperium.  They carried rods tied with ribbons, with axes squeezed into them, which symbolized the ability to execute the death penalty.  These outlandish tools were called fasciae, and today they are depicted on most administrative symbols, including in Russia.  Also, fascia was a symbol of the Italian fascist party. </p><h2>  Reliable bodyguards </h2><p>  The speaker everywhere followed the judge, including the Forum, the house, temples and bathhouses.  Before him, organized queues were organized.  If there was a crowd on the way of the magistrate, the lictors paved the way through it and provided their master with safety, pushing everyone aside, except for the Roman matrons, who were especially honored.  They also had to stand next to the magistrate whenever he addressed the crowd. </p><p>  Judges sometimes dispensed with such bodyguards.  The lictors also had legal and criminal responsibilities: they could, on the orders of their master, arrest Roman citizens and punish them.  Other bodyguards were praetors.  Praetors in ancient Rome are heavily armed bodyguards for politicians and emperors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Consul and two liqueurs" class="if uuid-3145439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/3145439.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes in special cases, such as a funeral or political meetings, these elite bodyguards were put to private individuals as a sign of respect from the city.  A Roman citizen is a full-fledged resident of a republic or empire, but ordinary citizens did not have the opportunity to take on such a guard. </p><h2>  Chicken Lecturers </h2><p>  Lictor curiatus (multiple lictores curiati) is a special type of lictor that did not have twigs or fascia, and whose main tasks were religious in nature.  There were about 30 people who served under the command of Pontiff Maxim, the high priest of Rome.  They attended the sacrifices, where they carried or sent sacrificial animals to the altar.  Vestals, flames (priests) and other high-ranking priests had the right to escort and protection from such special lictors (this was their main duty). </p><p>  In the Empire, women of the royal family were usually followed by two bodyguards of this type.  Lictores Curiati was also responsible for convening the Comitia Curiata (public assembly) and maintaining order during the meeting. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The lictor is a very important position in ancient Rome.  Not a single magistrate could do without these people. </p>
