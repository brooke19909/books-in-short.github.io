And there are many reasons.  Remoteness from the capital is compensated by the own infrastructure of the residential complex, as well as transport accessibility.  An important advantage in this case is the environment - the air outside the city is much cleaner, it breathes really differently.  Many residents of the cities near Moscow note the silence and tranquility inherent in new microdistricts.  And, of course, you can buy an apartment here on favorable terms, especially if you invest your money at the construction stage. </p><p>  A striking example of a modern <span>residential complex that</span> meets all applicable quality standards is the Soyuzny <span>residential complex</span> (Odintsovo).  Reviews of real residents will help to make an objective review and evaluate the conditions that a developer can offer potential residents. </p>

    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  If you are not embarrassed by living in Odintsovo, you will surely like the project presented by Stroytek LLC.  An eight-section residential building with 25 floors with an annex in the form of a comprehensive school is the Soyuzny residential complex (Odintsovo).  Five sections form the letter "P", due to which a closed house adjoining territory appears - this feature has been enjoyed by many buyers.  Just imagine: due to this, it is possible to isolate the yard from the through traffic of cars, ensuring maximum safety for children playing on the court. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, there will be excellent sports fields, entire complexes.  The adjacent area will be landscaped using walking paths, flower beds, flower beds and recreation areas.  An open parking lot for 237 cars will save you from the difficulty of finding a free parking space.  Currently, the first phase has been completed.  According to reviews of the Soyuzny residential complex (Odintsovo), the second phase will end in mid-2018. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  So, what do the inhabitants and those who managed to visit the site say about the location of the Soyuzny residential complex (Odintsovo).  Object address: Odintsovo, st.  Makovsky, d. 26, 26a. </p><p>  The successful location of the complex is what many buyers say.  It is rather difficult to evaluate it in the photo and general plan, so we strongly recommend visiting the site and making sure of all the benefits personally.  So, for the construction of a new complex, an ecologically clean area was chosen.  The uniqueness of natural landscapes, untouched forest, the absence of harmful industries - excellent living conditions.  Here, in Odintsovo, there is the famous <span>Meshchersky Park</span> and the well-equipped embankment of the Setun River - for residents of the complex it has become a favorite place for walking and relaxing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Let's evaluate infrastructure of the Soyuzniy residential complex (Odintsovo) together.  Photos show the spaciousness and comfort of the new complex.  And all residents can use the developed infrastructure of the city.  There are enough shopping and entertainment centers, shops, cinemas, restaurants and cafes.  The mayor pays a lot of attention to the development of sports, as evidenced by the many sports fields, the stadium and the Ice Palace, which allows you to enjoy ice skating even in the warm season. </p>

    <p>  The developer appreciated the level of comfort provided by the city and provided for the presence of missing objects in the complex.  Residents of houses of the first stage note a good parking, albeit a ground school, in which the residents of the complex can easily arrange their children, as well as good shops, a bank branch and excellent recreation areas with a lawn, gazebos and benches.  And, of course, the main pride and full-fledged attraction is the forest: it is literally at hand. </p><p>  Speaking about the drawbacks of the complex that residents have noticed, first of all I want to focus on the parking lot, or rather, its size.  In practice, it barely holds the cars of apartment owners, but the construction of the complex continues.  The developer needs to pay special attention to this component, be sure to include additional parking spaces in the project or lay the construction of a multi-level parking.  Almost every modern family has a car, so the lack of parking can be a powerful argument against buying an apartment or cause for doubt. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Some time ago, residential complexes even in the near Moscow suburbs were available only to those who have at least one car in their family.  But today this problem is solved.  The exception is not the LCD "Union" (Odintsovo).  Responses of residents of the complex confirm that it is located in convenient transport accessibility from the capital.  Regular buses leave for the nearest metro stations (metro station ‚ÄúVictory Park‚Äù, metro station ‚ÄúYugo-Zapadnaya, metro station‚Äú Kievskaya ‚Äù) every 10-15 minutes. Just 1.5 km from the house is the Odintsovo railway station: it can be reached by the Belorussky railway station. This is what the builder promises. In fact, everything is really like this: there is <span>a public transport stop</span> near the house <span>,</span> and the train station is just 10 minutes in a calm step. </p>

    <h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  The apartments of the Soyuzny residential complex (Odintsovo) impress with a variety of planning solutions.  A feature of the project was the European planning, providing for the unification of the kitchen and recreation areas - an excellent option for young families who dream of living separately from their parents.  The developer offered a choice of very small, affordable, but comfortable apartments, and spacious rooms with an additional sanitary unit and dressing room. </p><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  Many note that even negative reviews could not affect their choice.  And all this is largely due to very affordable prices for apartments located in houses.  For such a complex, being built in an ecologically clean area and a city with developed infrastructure, the price is really affordable.  Moreover, the developer allows you to save at the expense of shares and advantageous offers.  The cost of apartments starts from 2,700,000 rubles per 28 square meters. </p>

    <h2>  Terms of purchase </h2><p>  A weighty argument in favor of the developer, respectively, of the complex itself, is the many ways to pay for an apartment.  So what can the developer of the Soyuzny residential complex (Odintsovo) have to offer.  The feedback from the investors confirms that in cash, buyers receive an additional discount.  Through cooperation with major banks, it is possible to offer buyers favorable terms for mortgage lending.  Well, the main gift for buyers was the opportunity to purchase an apartment in installments.  Many people prefer to buy apartments at the construction stage, when the foundation is just laid.  This is a rather big risk, but the cost of an apartment is 30-40% cheaper.  In this case, the developer is verified, on his account dozens of successfully completed projects not only in the Moscow Region, but also in Moscow itself. </p>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  We tried to evaluate from all sides LCD "Union" (Odintsovo).  Responses of residents of the facility first stage "helped" us in this.  Of course, the project is not the most ideal, and its territory is very small, which does not allow placing all the necessary infrastructure facilities.  But the developed infrastructure of Odintsovo, amazing ecology and proximity to the forest belt still did their job.  At the moment, almost all the apartments in the complex are sold out, so do not miss the opportunity to get comfortable housing in an excellent area near Moscow. </p>
