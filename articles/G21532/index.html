What was this science called before?  Let's turn to compound words.  Based on the name, we can say that this is a science about society.  But what does it mean? </p><h2>  Concept of society </h2><p>  It seems that giving an explanation is very easy.  Everyone has heard about the society of book lovers, fishers and hunters.  This term also occurs in economic (economic) activities - a limited liability company, joint-stock company, etc.  You can also find application to the concept in historical science.  For example, it is used to determine socio-economic pharmacy - feudal or capitalist.  Many define society as a collective of people, a meeting, etc. </p>

    <p>  But social studies of Bogolyubov (the author of school textbooks) gives a clear understanding of this concept.  Society is a part of the world that is isolated from nature, but is closely related to it, which includes the <span>forms of uniting people</span> and ways of their interaction. </p><h2>  Social Studies: Bogolyubov about the signs of human society </h2><p>  This question is key in this science.  Without it, one cannot fully understand what social science is.  It has the following symptoms: </p><ul><li>  Separation from nature.  It is understood that man is no longer so dependent on her vagaries, climate, as primitive people and animals.  We learned how to build houses, stockpile supplies in the event of a crop failure, replace many natural materials with artificial ones, etc. </li><li>  Closely related to nature.  Separation does not mean complete rejection.  Despite all the advances in science and technology, man is constantly in contact with nature.  It is enough to recall how many lives are taken by the tsunami, how many destruction comes from hurricanes to understand the connection with nature. </li><li>  Society implies a system of combining the forms of people.  They are different: political or economic associations, workers or cooperative collectives, as well as all kinds of social institutions.  All this is combined into a single system, which bears the scientific term "society". </li><li>  Ways of interaction between associations.  For the functioning of the system requires tools, methods of maintaining unity, integrity.  They are forms of human interaction. </li></ul>

Colleagues at work are a labor collective, not a society in the understanding of science, despite the fact that they can be called that at the everyday level. </p><h2>  Spheres of public life </h2><p>  Social studies are completely based on this concept.  Spheres are particles of a single system.  Each segment plays a role and supports the unity of society.  There are four of them: </p><ul><li>  The economic sphere.  This is all that is associated with the production, distribution and exchange of material goods and services. </li><li>  Political.  This includes all social management institutions.  Keyly, this is connected with such a concept as the state. </li><li>  Social.  Connected with human communication within society. </li><li>  Spiritual.  It is aimed at meeting the intangible needs of a person. </li></ul>

    <p>  Therefore, the question of what social science is, it is also possible to answer that it is a science that studies the <span>spheres of social life,</span> their role in human life and the ways of interaction between them. </p><h2>  The role of social science </h2><p>  Indeed, this science seems useless to many.  Yes, and most humanitarian, too.  Until the 20th century, they did not pay any attention at all.  Only mathematical, applied sciences were appreciated in life.  They laid the main emphasis in development.  This is what led to a sharp technological leap in the development of mankind.  What is social science and for what purpose this science is needed, nobody was interested. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But the so-called technocracy has borne fruit.  Subjugating all industries, automation, people got the deepest crisis on the planet.  It resulted in two unheard-of wars on this scale.  In just half a century, more people have died on the fields of new, technical battles than in the entire history of mankind before. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Thus, the leap in science and technology allowed us to create unheard of weapons that in a few minutes will completely destroy the planet with all living organisms on it.  Atomic and hydrogen bombs are able to divert the Earth from its course, which will lead to its death as a cosmic body. </p>

    <p>  The author of the school books "Social Studies" Bogolyubov also believes.  For many years he studied the <span>exact sciences,</span> considering the humanitarian as a waste of time.  But then came the realization that technology without human development is capable of destroying all life.  It is with the development of humanity, morality, law, with an increase in the level of education, culture and spirituality that it is necessary to improve and introduce new devices.  And without theoretical knowledge this is impossible.  Social science as a science is called upon to close the knowledge gap.  Studying the spheres of life, a person will learn what morality and values, culture and religion are, will carefully treat the surrounding nature, with respect to people and to himself. </p>
