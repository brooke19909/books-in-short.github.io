Tourists who are regulars of this resort, position their pastime on it (including hotel accommodation) as a good vacation for the right price.  The last repair here was made in 2014.  Private beach, swimming pools, good rooms, excellent location - these are not all the bonuses of staying at the hotel.  Getting into it, you are plunged into a special atmosphere, which, probably, is difficult to meet elsewhere in this country.  And the real home comfort that will surround you during your vacation will give it a special charm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orka Nergis Beach Hotel" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1988365.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Marmaris </h2><p>  This is one of the most unusual resorts in Turkey.  So, having arrived in Marmaris, at the Orka Nergis Beach Hotel, you will immediately realize that this city is very different from Antalya and Alanya.  Marmaris is not good palaces for tourists and not animation - it is a city of parties and walks.  People come here to swim in the purest water, where the Mediterranean Sea merges with the Aegean, and in the afternoon seek for themselves entertainment.  Starting from Icmeler, along all the hotels of the first line there is a promenade - a beautiful promenade.  The closer to the center, the more it becomes lively.  Music always plays there, various bars and restaurants work, and in the port there are snow-white yachts, one more beautiful than the other.  Want exotic?  Amazingly beautiful streets lined with white houses with terraces and tiled roofs twined with bougainvilleas of different colors lead directly up to the port, on a cliff.  Upstairs is the fortress built by Suleiman the Magnificent, turned into an interesting museum.  And at the highest point of the cliff there is an amazing coffee house with great views.  Going down you will find yourself at Bar Street, where young people walk around all night until the morning.  And on the main square of Ataturk in the evening, singing fountains turn on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to the Orka Nergis Beach Hotel, you must first fly to <span>Dalaman Airport.</span>  From there, by bus or dolmush you will reach the city center.  Directly from the airport - from the domestic flights hall - the Hawash company carries it.  But such buses run quite rarely.  You can take a taxi from the airport to the Dalaman bus station.  From there you can catch a shuttle bus to Marmaris.  And already from the resort station you get to the hotel with one of the city dolmushi.  Using the same transfer, if such a service is included in the price of your ticket, you will reach the very gate of the hotel directly from the hub. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orka Nergis Beach Hotel 4" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1988367.jpg" width="300"></div>

These are five white buildings that stand on the very shore of the sea.  One of them is six-story, the rest are slightly smaller.  The promenade separates the hotel from the beach.  There are two elevators in the hotel buildings - one ordinary and one panoramic.  The hotel is small, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã9,000 square meters, everything is very compact.  Guests can park their car in the free car park.  There are several relaxation areas with sunbeds, greens, pillows and sofas - one immediately at the promenade, almost near the sea, and the second on a large terrace by the bar.  The buildings are surrounded by a beautiful and well-groomed, albeit small, garden. </p><h2>  Orka Nergis Beach Hotel: room description </h2><p>  How are tourists lodged in this hotel?  The hotel offers guests almost two hundred and fifty rooms.  195 of them are standard, and 51 are family-run, which can also accommodate large companies.  Any standard room can accommodate no more than two adults and one child.  Its filling is usual for resort hotels - a room with a double bed, a shower room, a balcony, a minibar, a TV.  Safe is paid. </p><p>  The family room is almost the same as the standard one, it only consists of two rooms and has two more folding sofas.  Some units also have a kitchen, equipped with a stove and microwave.  Special beds are available for young children.  Two bottles of drinking water are put into each room daily.  The furniture is simple, but solid, not old, not broken.  Air conditioning is not the newest model, but with manual control.  Two Russian channels are shown on TV.  The rooms are cleaned well, the bed is clean.  There are tables and chairs on the balconies.  Many rooms have direct or side sea views, while others have garden and pool views. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orka Nergis Beach Hotel Turkey" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1988356.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here you can rent a car, take things to the laundry and dry cleaning.  Guests use the sauna, hammam, massage services.  A fitness center and gym are available.  You can play billiards and table tennis.  What other activities does Orka Nergis Beach Hotel have?  First of all, this animation, both daytime and evening.  Although, of course, this is not Alanya, but in the morning you are not allowed to be bored.  Games, contests, water aerobics - all this in the afternoon.  And in the evening - a variety of shows and concerts.  For kids from four to twelve years old a mini-club is open, but English-speaking.  According to tourists, the hotel service is at a very high level.  If you want to sit in a calm environment and listen to music, visit the institution "Pukka" a stone's throw from the hotel.  It has a very pleasant atmosphere and real relaxation.  The audience at the hotel is very different - both Russians, Ukrainians, Europeans, Turks, and citizens of the Middle East.  But no one annoys anyone, young people relax in their own way, family people - on their own.  Everything is very decent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orka Nergis Beach Hotel Restaurants" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1988366.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to feed </h2><p>  In this hotel you can take accommodation without meals, breakfast, half board or all inclusive.  At Orka Nergis Beach Hotel <strong> </strong>  restaurants and bars are praised by the guests both for the quality of food and service, as well as for convenience, comfort and style.  The main establishment where tourists are fed is Negris.  Turkish cuisine is practiced here, as well as dishes of different nations.  The small restaurant ‚ÄúHaven O Seven‚Äù is very cozy and attracts lovers of Italian food.  There are bars by the pools and in the lobby.  They offer cocktails, drinks, alcohol, tea, coffee, pastries and various snacks.  You can also have a good meal by the pool.  At least many have lunch there.  The food is all fresh, tasty.  There are no complaints that breakfast is served that did not eat at dinner.  The chef is often present at the distribution and controls how dishes are served.  There is always a choice of food, as well as a variety of fruits - apples, grapes, oranges, watermelons.  There are always plenty of vegetables, salads, snacks.  Often there are turkey and lamb.  Every evening something is grilled.  The all-inclusive system is valid until eleven in the evening.  But between breakfasts, lunches and dinners there are always some snacks.  Therefore, the guests get the impression that they feed here simply from morning to evening. </p><h2>  Sea coast and pools </h2><p>  One of the main features that Orka Nergis Beach Hotel boasts is the beach.  After all, not all resort hotels in Marmaris have their own piece of coast.  True, it is part of the citywide beach, and nevertheless belongs to the Orka Negris.  The sea is fifty meters from the hotel buildings.  The beach is very clean, and there are always enough sunbeds, despite the hotel‚Äôs workload.  You can take towels for sunbathing under a ten-dollar deposit.  Sun beds are of good quality, the entrance to the sea is good.  In addition, the beach has conditions for sunbathing, not only in the sand, but also on the pier, which goes into the water, and the sun lasts longer there.  The hotel has an outdoor pool for adults and a children's paddling pool.  But this rarely happens in Marmaris hotels of the first line.  The pools are clean and the water does not smell like bleach.  Sunbathing near them is very comfortable.  Umbrellas and sun loungers are free on the beach and near the pool for hotel guests.  Some tourists say that there are too many people on the sea and not enough shade.  Therefore, taking advantage of the excellent location of the hotel, they rested under palm trees by the pools.  And at sea they went swimming.  It‚Äôs not deep right here, so the entrance is good for children.  However, there may first be stones.  The water is very clean and clear, especially in the morning and evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orka Nergis Beach Hotel Beach" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1988357.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Service at Orka Nergis Beach Hotel at a fairly high level.  The hotel staff is at your service day and night, almost 24 hours a day.  The most positive feedback from tourists is about the bartender in the lobby.  He not only makes great cocktails, but is always cheerful and entertains guests with jokes.  True, no one speaks Russian from the staff, but with a basic knowledge of English you can always communicate, and they will perfectly understand you.  The staff are all friendly, quickly do their job and fulfill requests, polite and tidy.  If you want to move to another room, and the hotel is not packed to capacity, then your desire will always be fulfilled. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  If you already got to Marmaris and to the Orka Nergis Beach Hotel 4 * hotel, then be sure to first walk along the promenade.  Twenty minutes to the city center, no more than half an hour to the fortress of Suleiman the Magnificent and the famous Bar Street.  You can also go on dolmusha in the opposite direction, to the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãIcmeler, and from there a special pedestrian path, and then walk back along the promenade.  Or rent a bike and ride around the area.  Very nice tracks are equipped here.  Be sure to sail on the islands here.  Regardless of whether you take a tour of the Aegean, the Mediterranean Sea or both at once, you will get a lot of pleasure, dive into the deep and warm sea, see the underwater grottoes and caves and admire the breathtaking scenery of islands, mountains and rocks.  Only at the hotel you should not buy such excursions: they will be two to three times more expensive than they are sold in the travel agency.  Go to any of them or do not be too lazy, go to the promenade and find out prices directly on the boats that leave the islands every day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orka Nergis Beach Hotel reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1988353.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  In the local supermarkets that surround the Orka Nergis Beach Hotel (Turkey), you can buy pretty high-quality items, jeans and shoes at great discounts.  If you go to the city center, you will find yourself in a real labyrinth of streets filled with shops and shops with souvenirs and various things - sweets, spices, jewelry, textiles - for every taste.  The city has very large shopping malls.  They are called chars.  One of them is located right next to the fortress.  In charts you can buy everything from fur and leather products to beach slaps and sundresses.  On Thursdays, a large indoor market in the center sells fresh fruits and vegetables.  Prices there are cheaper than in supermarkets, and especially they are low in the evening.  It‚Äôs better to pay in cash everywhere - this can save you money.  Paying with a bank card is not profitable. </p><h2>  Orka Nergis Beach Hotel: reviews </h2>

    <p>  Not all tourists know the specifics of such a resort as Marmaris, and therefore they are often surprised by the difference between Antalya and the hotels of this Turkish "Ibiza".  However, they all note that the hotel has wonderful food and a luxurious beach, and unlike many similar coasts in other parts of the country, you can swim here even at night.  In addition, Marmaris is similar to European resorts in that you will not see harassment or molestation here from the locals.  Everything is very decent, polite and democratic.  Therefore, as a result, tourists' impressions about the rest at the Orka Nergis Beach Hotel 4 * are the best.  Beautiful sea, amazing landscapes, wonderful authentic oriental flavor and dynamic European party - you probably will not find such a cocktail anywhere else. </p>
