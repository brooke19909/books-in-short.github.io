Perhaps this is due to the reputation of the Korean manufacturer and his big name, or maybe the fact is that his products really differ not only in appearance (which favorably emphasizes all the advantages), but also in build quality. </p><p>  This article will describe well-known mobile phones from this company that are in use or previously enjoyed unprecedented demand.  Some of them are quite expensive at the moment, others are already out of fashion and will be affordable even for the middle class.  Do not ignore the phones of this company, because they deserve attention from the consumer. </p><h2>  Samsung Corby line of phones </h2><p>  This series consists of budget and easy to use phones.  At first glance, they bribe a buyer indifferent to minimalism.  Of course, do not forget about the filling - the device is really amazing for its price category. </p><p>  Any Samsung GT phone can be attributed to the Corby line.  The last to be connected to the series was the GT-i5500.  It works on the Android operating system;  It has a touch screen display on the side.  The camera is especially sharp.  There is a bluetooth receiver and Wi-Fi. </p><p>  Some phones of this brand are presented far beyond the borders of Korea and the CIS countries.  Their differences are in the support of certain technologies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung phone line" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1345978.jpg" width="600"></div>

But some models (older) still cannot work simultaneously with two.  And those that came out recently, are already the owners of this relatively new technology.  The latter are bought more often than the former. </p><p>  It is not difficult to choose the Samsung Duos phone, but the assortment is easy to get confused.  The assortment is represented by a standard keyboard telephone, touchscreen and slider.  The first option was produced the most - about seven models.  The rest are two or three.  But this does not prevent the buyer from getting confused when choosing.  You need to build on the purpose of the phone and its functionality.  Three sensory options will be better in this series. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cell phones samsung" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1345980.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Phones Samsung Galaxy </h2><p>  Galaxy line will give an unforgettable experience when using the devices!  <span>Touch screen,</span> streamlined sides, a new operating system that supports many modern and popular applications.  Good memory, excellent and clear sound, amazing viewing angles.  All this makes us only to be in a state of shock.  But not only from the amazing capabilities of devices such as Samsung cell phones.  Their price will also amaze any poor person. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Under this series, many devices with different indices are released - GT, S, Note, A and others.  What compares them favorably with other phones of competing companies?  For example, one of the latest models has a 16 megapixel camera.  Of course, few owners of such a cell will need a professional device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone samsung gt" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1345982.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Samsung Galaxy S </h2><p>  It is necessary to consider the S line in detail, because it is one of the smartest.  The goal of developing all the smartphones in this series is to create a device that can compete with the iPhone.  According to early models, you can’t say that Korean developers did achieve their goals, but you can definitely talk about the popularity of the latest models. </p><p>  The Samsung Galaxy S line of phones was announced in the world long before the “premiere”.  The first model was introduced in 2010, and it instantly sold out in large numbers in the world.  The first milestone of 1 million sales was overcome in just 45 days.  But, unfortunately, one of the iPhones was able to overcome such a mark in just a week.  Therefore, the company still has work to do. </p><p>  The phones have good RAM (up to 2 GB), excellent graphics accelerator and processor.  It can be noted that the devices almost never freeze, even if they are completely clogged with music or pictures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone samsung duos" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1345984.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Series “Samsung Galaxy Note” </h2><p>  The line of Samsung Galaxy Note phones is devices that are practically leaders in the sales of this company's products.  All phones of this series work on the “Android” latest version.  They are the owners of large screens.  Some of the devices also support styluses.  All devices work with memory cards, the smaller part is up to 32 GB, the larger - up to 64 GB.  This, of course, pleases every customer. </p>
