    <h2>  Description of the natural attraction </h2><p>  In the northern part of Montenegro, on the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina and near the city of Pluzine, is one of the most beautiful sights - Lake of Piva.  The region itself has picturesque villages and is rich in vegetation.  The place is great for fishing, hunting, hiking and cycling, swimming and mountain climbing.  A large number of medicinal herbs and teas grow here.  The region is ecologically clean and still little known among tourists, so you can relax here, left alone with nature. </p><p>  Lake Piva in Montenegro was formed artificially due to the construction of the dam of the same name on the high mountain river Komarnitsa.  Although in fact it seems that it is a creation of nature.  The meadows, hills, trees and shrubs surrounding the reservoir form an incredibly beautiful landscape that inspires and has a moral rest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Lake and Canyons </h2><p>  Earlier, on the site of Piva, a mountain river rushed along a violent current.  In 1975, it was decided to build a dam in the area.  This building was erected according to a large-scale project - the thickness is about 30 m, hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of concrete were left during the construction process.  Today, Mratine Dam is the largest in Europe and one of the largest in the world. </p><p>  Lake Piva in Montenegro has a length of 46 km, its depth is approximately 200 m. During the hot season, the water temperature warms up only to +22 ¬∞ C.  The lake is the second largest in the country and has enough fresh water for the whole of Montenegro. </p><p>  It was the construction of the dam that became the factor that greatly influenced the general landscape of the area.  The lake formed in the canyon has blue, sometimes even emerald water of crystalline purity, picturesque shores lead to it, which in turn are surrounded by lush vegetation. </p><p>  In order to fully enjoy the incredible beauty of canyons in Montenegro, tourists are invited to rent a boat or buy a ticket for a pleasure boat.  Kayaking is organized - rafting on the river.  The place is best suited for peaceful walks, during which you can escape from the bustle of the city and everyday activities, gain strength and recharge your batteries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Other points of interest in Piva </h2><p>  Among tourists, the Piva Monastery is a well-known historical landmark of Montenegro.  This is an architectural monument of the 16th century, located about two kilometers from the lake.  Initially, it was located on the very bank of the river, but after flooding in order to preserve the cultural object, it was decided to move the temple a couple of kilometers up from the canyon of the Piva River.  In that place there was only a cemetery, a hospitable house and a monastery bakery - the rest of the buildings were flooded. </p><p>  The temple is very modest outside, but rich inside.  An amazing wall mural is impressive.  Its elements occupy 1000 m <sup>2</sup> .  When moving, the fresco was carefully removed and then restored.  The monastery has a large collection of wall paintings and icons and is one of the main attractions of the country. </p><h2>  GPS coordinates of Lake Piva in Montenegro </h2><p>  The reservoir is located relatively far from the resort coastal cities of the country, therefore it is not particularly popular with independent tourists or with tour agencies.  The lake is located in the north of Montenegro and belongs to the municipality of the nearby city of Pluzine.  In order to make it easier to get to it in case of independent travel, it is recommended to use GPS coordinates that will lead exactly to the goal: 43 ¬∞ 10 π12 ∫N 18 ¬∞ 50 π15 ∫E. </p>

    <h2>  Lake Piva, Montenegro: how to get there? </h2><p>  Although the area is not very popular, Budva's travel agencies organize trips to various attractions in the country, including Lake of Piva.  As a rule, during such a tour it is proposed to visit another monastery, see the Mratine Dam and Durmitor National Park.  It appeared in 1952, and since 1980 is a UNESCO site.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe park is 39,000 hectares, in the territory of which there are 48 mountain peaks, 18 lakes, 748 springs, a ski resort, caves, canyons of Montenegro and much more. </p><p>  You can get to Lake Piva by public transport: first go to the large transport center Niksic, and then transfer to the bus, which will take you directly to Pluzhine.  But experienced tourists write that the easiest way is to rent a car and go to natural attractions on your own.  The distance from Budva to Pluzine is about 170 km, the right way will be indicated by road signs.  Riding is a pleasure: smooth roads, beautiful views along the way and safe serpentines. </p>
