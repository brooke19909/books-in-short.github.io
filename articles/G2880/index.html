    <p>  Self-made things never go out of fashion.  Do I need to talk about how convenient and practical the ability to knit?  We think that this is superfluous.  This type of needlework does not need advertising.  Any girl, stating: ‚ÄúI want to learn how to knit,‚Äù knows very well what advantages this hobby gives her. </p><p>  Today on sale there is a huge number of various magazines with diagrams and models.  Yes, and on the Internet you can always draw great ideas.  However, there are things that any craftswoman learns from her own experience.  For example, how to knit the initial and final, the so-called edge loops. </p><p>  If you want to get a product that will not deform when worn, it is better to remove the first loop without knitting.  Otherwise, the side edge of the product will be too loose.  The final loop should be front, regardless of what pattern the entire canvas is made.  Only then the edges will be smooth and beautiful. </p><p>  Now a little about how to knit first-row stitch loops.  A novice needlewoman rarely can perform this simple operation correctly.  Either the loops come out too tight and it is impossible to stick a needle under them, or vice versa - too loose and not the same in size.  If all of the above applies to you, just next time, loop on two knitting needles at once, folding them together. </p><p>  Now in fashion products made of thick yarn, knitted with large viscous.  As a rule, they are recommended for large-sized knitting needles.  Of course, today you can buy anything.  But pleasure is not cheap, and a haberdashery warehouse in your house is useless.  Let's open a little secret how to knit a ‚Äúholey‚Äù front or back fabric on any knitting needles.  Front row - all loops are knit with a crochet.  Wrong - just take off the yarn.  Thus, the loop is twice as large in size.  By the way, if you make not one, but two crochets, the canvas will become even more openwork.  Unfortunately, this trick is not suitable for loose or complex patterns. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Learning to knit on your own is not so difficult.  A little patience, perseverance, desire, and now you are already the owner of the finished parts of the future man-made masterpiece.  The thing, as they say, is small ... It remains to sew the product so as not to spoil it. </p><p>  There is no particular trick here, but it will not hurt to take into account some subtleties.  A thin knit fabric can be sewn on a sewing machine with a zigzag seam.  True, it will be difficult to dissolve a boring blouse, you will have to tear open the seams, but it looks neat (if you select the threads matching in color), and it is done very quickly. </p><p>  Method number two - connecting parts with a woolen thread, a seam behind a needle.  This is quite common, but not the most suitable option.  Such a seam looks too coarse, and it is difficult to dissolve the product. </p><p>  The most comfortable in working with a <span>knitted fabric is a</span> knitted seam.  It is performed quite simply.  First, the parts are swept away, then the product is turned on the front side.  Starting from the first side loop, carefully connect not the loops themselves, but the jumpers between them.  Tighten the thread rather tightly. </p><p>  The process looks like this: you lead the needle from right to left, pry the jumper and return the needle to the opposite side, but already a row higher. <br>  In fact, such a seam is performed quite quickly, and it dissolves completely in a matter of seconds, just pull the tip. </p><p>  And finally, a little about how to knit a pullover collar.  I must say that the <span>processing of the neck</span> is that finishing touch that determines how accurately the finished product will look.  Often, beginning knitters are in a hurry to finish faster and perform the neck in the simplest way, strapping.  If this operation is done with a hook, sometimes it looks good.  But here is the harness on the knitting needles, this is not too good a solution.  When you loop, unnecessary holes form that look sloppy.  And even the first row is not always possible to get.  Therefore, the neckline is better to knit separately, then sewn with a ketel seam. </p>
