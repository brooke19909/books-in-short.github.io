    <p>  A little communication with people who have already managed to stay in a particular place always helps to create a clearer vision of the upcoming vacation.  Immediately it is worth saying that almost all reviews of the Regenta Resort Varca Beach 3 * hotel (now it has been assigned four stars) are positive. </p><p>  Of course, there are some drawbacks - for example, in the rooms you can sometimes see old equipment, the breakfast menu is a bit monotonous, and few of the employees understand the Russian language.  On the other hand, the rooms are spacious and clean, the equipment is working properly, regardless of age, and maids come in every day.  The food is delicious, nobody leaves the restaurant hungry.  The undoubted advantage is the proximity to the beautiful beach.  And employees are always trying to help, despite a certain language barrier. </p><p>  This is a quiet area that is ideal for tourists who want a quiet holiday in the lap of nature.  Accommodation prices, by the way, are also very affordable, which pleases many travelers. </p>
