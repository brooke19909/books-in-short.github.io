    <h2>  Rovinj </h2><p>  Once it was a small fishing village, where, in addition to fishermen, there were famous sailors and even pirates.  The tangled narrow alleys going up and down make up the Old Town, where you will see old streets and houses stretching along the Monte Ross hill.  Above them, as on a throne, rises one of the largest churches of Istria - the Abode of St.  Euphemia.  Its 60-meter bell tower is crowned with a statue of a saint, in whose honor the monastery is named.  On the central square of the city you can also admire the Town Hall, and then visit the city museum located in the Kaliffi Palace.  You can go along the cobblestone streets of the old city to the pier, where you will see a noisy and colorful spectacle of fishing boats, <span>sailing boats,</span> yachts and motor boats, which can be watched until the evening.  There you will get the opportunity to purchase many different souvenirs, leaving yourself a memory of this amazing corner, which Croatia is so proud of.  Istria also has other attractions, which we will talk about later. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lim fjord </h2><p>  Many cruise boats depart from Rovinj, on one of which you can go to the Lim fjord - one of the most picturesque places in Istria.  Be sure to visit the pirate caves, where once the sea robbers were hiding.  Today, travelers come here on excursions.  Adventure films are also filmed here.  The fjord is located between Rovinj and Vrsar, representing a beautiful bay with an excellent greenish tint of waters. </p>

    <h2>  Vrsar </h2><p>  Now Vrsar is a romantic sunny town on the shores of the Adriatic.  From the pier, steep medieval streets lead up to the old part of the city.  It offers a beautiful view of the endless islands of various sizes, among which there are both bare rocky and completely covered with greenery, but for vacationers they are equally magnificent.  The ‚Äúcrown‚Äù of the Old Town can be called a Venetian-style church - the Basilica of the Blessed Virgin Mary, behind which is the rest house of the bishops of Porec of the XII-XIII centuries. </p>

    <h2>  Porec </h2><p>  Porec is a sincere town with many monuments, architectural monuments, an interesting history and endless streams of tourists.  In the evenings, tourists are entertained by street musicians and puppeteers, and at other times everyone is eager to visit the sights of the city: the magistrate‚Äôs building, preserved from Venetian times, the ancient Marafort Square, the Euphrasian Basilica, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, City Fortifications and other interesting places.  Do not miss the opportunity to visit the restaurants and cafes of the city, where seafood is especially popular.  The heart of the town is Dekumanus Street, which awakens only in the evening, when local cafes, shops and discos are filled with crowds of vacationers.  About 1 million tourists pass along the street per year, which is as much as 100 times more than the population of the town itself.  In general, Porec should be on the mandatory list of visits if you decide to spend your holidays in Croatia.  Istria, as you see, is replete with fascinating places.  But we will not stop, we go further. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Pula </h2><p>  The city of Pula stands on the edge of the Istrian peninsula.  It is considered the economic, industrial and commercial center of the region.  On 8 hills, the Romans founded a city called Paula.  During the heyday of the Roman Empire, a remarkable amphitheater was built in Pula, the size of which is simply amazing.  To see it in person, Pula is visited by tens of thousands of tourists annually.  On the hill above the amphitheater stands the Franciscan church, and on the site of the old forum stands the Temple of Augustus with the Corinthian colonnade, where you can see an exhibition of ancient statues.  The road to the archaeological museum and theater, which still gives performances, leads through the <span>triumphal arch of</span> St. Sergius, which is also called the Golden Gate.  Be sure to visit this museum city, with more than 2000 years of history, if you are relaxing in Croatia. </p>

    <h2>  Rabac </h2><p>  Rabac is a bustling tourist area that can be reached through the city of Labin, built on a mountain.  Here, new hotels and villas are being built with terrifying speed, and sailors, surfers, lovers of active marine hobbies and ordinary tourists who come to rest from gray everyday life stop at the bay.  From walking paths or restaurant terraces, you can enjoy watching white ships glide along emerald water.  It is here that thousands of tourists enjoy the warmth of the sun and the caressing waves of the Adriatic, because in Rabac are the best beaches of Istria.  Croatia is not rich in golden sandy beaches, and therefore Rabac boasts only large-pebbled coasts.  Hundreds of marine animals can be seen in clear water, so grab a diving mask with you (or purchase in a nearby shop).  Those who wish to dive to great depths can take part in diving trainings.  There are also nudist beaches in Rabac. </p>

    <h2>  Pazin </h2><p>  Pazin is today the most important economic center of Istria.  The visiting card of the city is a magnificent medieval castle erected on a high cliff.  Gates in the courtyard lead to the ethnographic museum, which has collected many exhibits that tell about the daily life of the inhabitants of the region for centuries.  Among other things, a collection of Istrian bells is surprising.  The castle stands over a 120-meter precipice, in which the Pazinchitsa River disappears (then it flows underground).  In addition to the castle, in Pazin you should visit the Church of St. Nicholas, built in the Gothic style. </p><h2>  Umag </h2><p>  One of the most picturesque <span>cities in Croatia,</span> located in the north-west of Istria, attracts more than a million tourists annually.  Of course, the Old Town deserves special mention, where the buildings of the Middle Ages and even Antiquity are perfectly preserved.  The main attraction of this settlement is rightfully considered the Church of St. Rock, built in the XVI century.  Other architectural monuments include St. Peregrine's Church, a historical museum, a lighthouse in Savudrii and other, no less interesting places.  However, what Umag really attracts is the colorful beaches off the coast of the Adriatic, where travelers from all over Europe and the world have great rest.  Umag can offer vacationers a lot of comfortable hotels, cafes, nightclubs and restaurants, which makes it a first-class resort, which Croatia boasts.  Istria is rich in such towns, but listing them all will take quite a long time, because this region has a very long and rich history, and its geographical location makes the peninsula a tidbit for any traveler. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ul><li>  The Istrian Peninsula (Croatia) is the largest peninsula of the Adriatic, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã18,000 km <sup>2</sup> . </li><li>  The annual number of tourists is about 5 million, increasing with each season. </li><li>  On the territory of Istria is the smallest town in the world - Hum, with only 17 inhabitants. </li><li>  Like all of Croatia, Istria is densely covered with forests.  Oak, elm and pine are the basis of these massifs.  This combination of deciduous and coniferous trees will have a beneficial effect on the health of people who have problems with the respiratory system. </li><li>  The population of Istria is about 600 thousand people (together with the Slovenian part of the peninsula). </li></ul><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  All that is needed by the average tourist can offer the resorts of Istria.  Croatia has long been an attractive tourist destination in Europe, where Istria is a popular region.  It should be noted a pleasant fact: the cost of a good rest in the resorts of the peninsula will cost you many times cheaper than in Italy or, for example, France.  As a rule, the cost of tours ranges from 800 to 1200 dollars per person.  As we wrote earlier, Istria is the most popular tourist region of the country, because here it is as if nature itself created all the conditions for an excellent vacation, and the history of cities, soaked for centuries, only supplements the big picture.  Believe me, Istria, the reviews of tourists about which is more eloquent than the most flattering praises, will not leave you indifferent and will certainly attract more than once. </p>
