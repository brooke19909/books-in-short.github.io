  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get rich an ordinary person and live in prosperity?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Do you know why the vast majority of people do not know how to get rich?  There are many reasons for this, but one of the key ones is the following: "A person does not want or is even afraid to become wealthy."  Belief can be deeply embedded in the subconscious and can be rooted in the past during our childhood.  For example, a child constantly hears from authoritative people (parents, teachers) that wealth, as a phenomenon, is something shameful. </p><p>  We could be taught that people who have a lot of money earn it in unrighteous ways.  Making money honestly is supposedly impossible.  Also, many simply never think about how to get rich, do not set themselves such a goal.  It is easy to agree that they will not become wealthy.  Of course, there are various exceptions.  But a person who subconsciously does not want to be rich, even if he receives an inheritance, then after a while he will again become poor. </p><p>  Some readers are somehow upset by such publications.  Others even cite the example of Jesus Christ, who, in their view, walked hungry and barefoot.  But <span>this is not true!</span>  At birth, Jesus received expensive gifts, including gold.  He walked in sandals, which the prophet John considered himself unworthy to tie.  He also had no problems with food.  In addition, the Bible says that God gives man strength to acquire wealth. </p><p>  How to get rich fast?  To do this, you first need to change your attitude to money and stop considering financial wealth as something abnormal.  Readers believe in supernatural powers and possibilities or not - this is their business.  But if, for example, we talk about the "money tree" (Feng Shui), then it is easy to agree that there is something in it.  What exactly?  A person begins to be interested in the question of how to get rich, reads relevant literature, rearranges furniture in Feng Shui.  In fact, in this way, it is tuned to a specific goal. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, lying on the couch, thinking how to get rich and reading the right books, we will not achieve anything.  Neither amulets nor the money tree will help.  The reader will learn from the relevant books how to get rich, but how can he get involved in investing if he does not have a constant source of income?  First you need to probably find a job in order to have a material base.  In another case, all the money earned goes to the maintenance of the family. </p><p>  In fact, you can start earning today.  If a person pays for staying on the Internet, then there you can find yourself a permanent main job or additional income.  With the help of prayers alone, you won‚Äôt get rich; you will need to rearrange your legs towards your goal.  That is, for a start, a person must form a firm intention - to become wealthy.  In fact, at that moment when you set the appropriate goal, you already cease to be poor. </p><p>  It is advisable to write down the goal on paper, but you can also create a special text file on the computer.  When compiling an intention, one should reconcile it with one‚Äôs physical data, abilities, knowledge and skills.  You will also need to learn something new, study the laws of business.  Today one can often hear such an expression as the "laws of money."  These laws can be read without difficulty by reading the relevant literature.  Feng Shui can also provide real help.  As mentioned above, in this way, we focus on achieving financial well-being. </p><p>  Is it necessary to say that the goals need not only to be recorded, but also to fulfill them?  There will be difficulties on the way to wealth, and for this reason many also stop.  It is possible that one of the major obstacles is the lack of ideas that can bring real wealth.  Just find one idea and write it down, and then start small.  Do not neglect the day of small beginnings, move towards the main goal.  Then, after a short period of time, it will be possible to see certain changes for the better.  Write them down too.  It is possible and even desirable to have a special diary for such entries.  In it, write down your ideas and your reasoning. </p><p>  There are many good books on this subject.  Among them: ‚ÄúThe richest man in Babylon‚Äù by George S. Clayson, ‚ÄúThink and Grow Rich‚Äù by Napoleon Hill, ‚ÄúWork, Money and Love‚Äù by Natalia Grace, ‚ÄúCash Flow Quadrant‚Äù by Robert Kiyosaki and others. </p>
