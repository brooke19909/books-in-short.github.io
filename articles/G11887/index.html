It belongs to the basin <span>of Lake Onega.</span>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe water flow is more than 10 thousand square meters.  km, and the length of the channel is almost 195 km.  Previously, the river was used to transport forests.  Now it is popular with alloy enthusiasts due to its fast flow.  The complexity category is second.  Thresholds are stepped, local, there are about 30 in total, there are many parking lots. </p><p>  Ignoilinskaya hydroelectric power station was built on Shuya.  Its capacity is small, only about 2.7 MW.  It is located near the village of Ignoil.  In 2007, a four-step course was built for representatives of salmon so that they can move freely to spawning grounds. </p>

    <h2>  Hydronym </h2><p>  There are two versions of the origin of the name of the river.  According to one of them, the name of the reservoir was due to the Karelian word "deep".  And according to another version - from the Old Slavonic "left."  In the past, this river flowed through Finland, and the locals called it a swamp. </p><h2>  Characteristic </h2><p>  Shuya is a river that originates from Lake Suoj√§rvi.  Then it flows through the other two - Shotozero and Vagatozero.  The mouth is the Logmozero reservoir, which is connected to Onega. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Its main tributaries include 4 left and 8 right rivers.  Left-handed: Chalna, Kutizhma, Syapsya, Torasyoki.  Right-sided - Vilga, Norik, Svyatrek, etc. </p><h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  Weather conditions in this region are very variable.  In summer, the air temperature does not exceed +30 ¬∞ C, the humidity is high, accompanied by a large amount of precipitation.  Heat does not set for long.  The duration of such a period lasts no more than one month.  In winter, a lot of snow falls, but there are no severe frosts. </p><p>  It often rains in Karelia, sometimes even for several days in a row.  And then the temperature drops to +15 ¬∞ C, after which the water in the river becomes cold - unsuitable for swimming. </p>

    <h2>  Water quality in the Shuya river (Karelia) </h2><p>  The water itself is mostly dark, reminiscent of tea in hue.  But this does not mean that it is dirty - quite the contrary, even very clean.  A characteristic dark color is obtained due to peat bogs, which are surrounded by a river.  The quality of the water is soft, has a small salinity. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  Shuya is a river in which the underwater world is not very rich.  However, fishermen manage to catch a pike or perch.  <span>The riverbed</span> has become a favorite place for salmon.  It is here that this species of fish spawns. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Cloudberries, blueberries, lingonberries and mushrooms (ceps, aspen, boletus) grow in coastal forests in summer.  Therefore, locals or vacationers come here for the harvest.  However, during hiking in the forest you need to be extremely careful, as vipers can get caught. </p>

    <h2>  Rafting on the Shuya river in Karelia </h2><p>  River rafting is very popular.  Of course, it is held in the summer, as well as in late spring and early fall.  The route is 105 km long.  The main watercraft include six- or eight-seater rafts.  If potential customers wish, they can ride on existing catamarans, which are designed for 2, 4 and 6 people, or in double kayaks. </p><p>  Rafting on the Shuya river in Karelia does not last at all one day, but as much as 8 days and 7 nights.  In other words, this is a weekly water tour.  Impressions from such a trip will remain for a long time.  Of course, it will be difficult for tourists in the early days due to unaccustomed and without acclimatization.  But thanks to experienced instructors, these problems can be easily dealt with in order to continue to conquer the water element. </p><p>  It is impossible to spend the whole week in the river, therefore, there will periodically be landings; there are a lot of parking lots along this route.  During the days you can enjoy nature, fresh air, fishing, barbecue, relaxing by the fire.  Equipment for the duration of the alloy is rented.  At the end of the tour, excursions are also offered, for example, to <span>Kivach waterfall</span> or Kizhi island. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The Shuya River, the photo of which is presented in the article, is located at some distance from the settlements.  Therefore, getting to it will be somewhat problematic.  But do not get upset ahead of time.  There are several options to get to the river.  For example, in motor vehicles.  To do this, you need to move from Petrozavodsk through the city of Suoyarvi along the highway that leads to the bridge on the river.  The most convenient way is by personal car, however if there is none, you can use a taxi.  City transport does not go to these places.  If tourists travel in a large company, they can rent a bus in Petrozavodsk. </p>

    <p>  Also, Shui can be reached by rail.  But even in this case, you have to get off at the nearest station, for example, in the city of Suoj√§rvi.  And then - similarly - either take a taxi or rent a bus. </p><p>  Shuya is a river located near the Suovka station, just 1.5 km away.  If tourists go out here (on condition that they know the way), then it will be possible to walk to the reservoir. </p>
