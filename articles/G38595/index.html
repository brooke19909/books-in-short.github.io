This question is one of the most asked among subscribers.  Many are interested in the opportunity to get money from the company on loan at the right time.  And given that they can pay for mobile services or pay at a rate, the relevance of using such a service increases dramatically.  And before describing the instructions on how to take the “Promised payment” on “Tele2”, we will analyze the features and purpose of this feature. </p><h2>  Money from a mobile operator </h2><p>  Different situations occur in life, and sometimes you need to urgently make one call.  The only problem may be an unpaid tariff or lack of funds.  In this case, the Promised Payment service, which offers mini-credit to subscribers, can help out.  The user is given a small amount of money from 50 to 1000 rubles for a period of up to one week.  The subscriber can use these tools for mobile communications, but cannot transfer to other persons and pay for online purchases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="denegproff.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Promised payment" class="if uuid-3138258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3138258.jpg"></div><p>  Do not forget that the service may not be available.  To use it, you need to fulfill a number of requirements that are mandatory.  But we will learn about them a little later, then we will analyze the method of receiving the service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Connection method </h2><p>  How to get the “Promised payment” on “Tele2”?  It is worth remembering that you can use the service exclusively using the USSD command.  Neither the operator’s call, nor the use of the official website will help you resolve the issue of connection.  To use this service, you need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Pick up the phone. </li><li>  Dial the command * 122 #, press the call button. </li><li>  A window pops up on the screen indicating the possibility of using the service and the amount that is available to you. </li><li>  Now you will need to send in response a number from 1 to 3, which will allow you to borrow money. </li><li>  Once everything is completed, you will receive funds and a message indicating the validity of the payment. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="This is how the information on the USSD request looks like" class="if uuid-3138266" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3138266.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, there is nothing complicated about this.  The only problem may be the inability to borrow money or a mistake in recruiting a team.  In this case, you definitely need to call the operator at 611 and explain the problem.  He will advise you and provide recommendations on resolving the issue. </p><h2>  Features of this service </h2><p>  Now you know how to get the Promised Payment on Tele2, but take your time using it.  The fact is that this service is special and has a number of nuances that determine: how much money you can get, for how long and whether it will be available at all.  To understand this issue, it is enough to remember the following: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Your tariff should be from the list of prepaid services.  If you have a preferential or social one, then you won’t be able to use the “Promised Payment”. </li><li>  You must use Tele2 communication services for more than 29 days. </li><li>  You currently do not have a “Promised Payment”. </li><li>  The amount of expenses for mobile services over the past month should be above 50 rubles. </li><li>  When crediting funds, a commission of 10% is always charged. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="tarife.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to take the promised payment on &quot;Tele2&quot;" class="if uuid-3138270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3138270.jpg"></div><p>  The conditions are quite optimal and fair.  But consider one main nuance - the listed items may be different for individual regions.  This also includes the amount and term of payment. </p><h2>  Regional division </h2><p>  To understand the issue in more detail, consider the situation in more detail.  For example, a loan of up to 300 rubles is available for the Chelyabinsk region.  This is the maximum indicator that will not change in the near future.  And if you take into account the Tyumen region, the amount rises to 450 rubles.  A similar situation may arise with the requirement for the period of use of the SIM-card.  In the Chelyabinsk region, it is 29 days, while in other regions the indicator can reach 60 days.  Be sure to check the information on the official website or from the operator at 611 so as not to encounter unpleasant situations.  And given that now you know how to connect the Promised Payment in Tele2, and are informed about the nuances, there will be no problems with the service. </p>
