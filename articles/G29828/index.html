    <h2>  City Formation </h2><p>  The city of Pitsunda became only a few years ago.  Until that time, she wore the status of an urban-type settlement.  But before getting the first, and then the second title, Pitsunda went through the centuries-old historical stage of its formation.  <span>The sights of Pitsunda</span> have witnessed her life, both long-standing and modern.  And it still began in the VI century BC.  Then there was an ancient settlement on this site, on the territory of which Greek merchants built a huge port city.  The name was given to him by Pitius (Pityunt).  Translated, this word means "pine."  Abkhazians themselves call this ancient village of Ldzaa. </p><p>  Pitiunt possessed a highly developed material culture, which was confirmed by excavations conducted in this place.  The sights of Pitsunda also bring this fact.  So, archaeologists have found the remains of water supply, sewers, baths and other objects.  In the first century AD, Pitius was captured by the Romans, who owned the city until 256.  Starting from the 4th century, the port became the place to which the Christians who created the first Christian community in Abkhazia were exiled.  After that, the city survived many wars that destroyed it.  But Pitsunda was rebuilt every time and during the times of the USSR gained popularity of the world resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pizunda Abkhazia Attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/553914.jpg" width="375"></div>

They are under scrupulous protection of the city‚Äôs pine reserve.  It has existed since 1926.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe object is 200 hectares, on which there are 30 thousand trees.  All of them are representatives of Pitsunda pine - a rare species.  This species differs from other breeds by unusually long needles.  A sign with a number is nailed to each tree trunk.  Thus, each tree in the reserve is numbered.  Some pines here are very old - they are 200 years old or more.  And the largest pine in the grove reaches fifty meters in length and 7.5 meters in girth.  And the name of this giant is the Patriarch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pizunda vacation attractions" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/553912.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lakes Inkit and Ritsa </h2><p>  Pitsunda, the sights (photo below) of which are mainly objects of nature, except for centuries-old pine trees, also boasts the presence of two beautiful lakes.  One of them is called Inkit, its length is only 1 km 200 m, and its width is 500 meters.  The maximum depth of the reservoir reaches five meters.  In Inkita, crystal clear blue water that allows you to admire the lake for several hours in a row, and it does not bother.  An incredible amount of legends and myths is composed about Inkit.  So, they say that in ancient times it served as a harbor in which the ships of Alexander the Great himself stood. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second lake is called Ritsa.  It is the greatest legend of the entire Caucasus.  It is located at an altitude of one kilometer above sea level.  The path to the lake lies through the <span>indescribable beauty of a</span> mountain gorge, along the beautiful and turbulent <span>river Bzyb.</span>  In addition, you will have to go through the shining <span>Blue Lake</span> and several fantastic waterfalls.  Having overcome such a distance and drunk from the clean mountain air, on the observation platforms of Ritsa you can enjoy the real Georgian lamb skewers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pizzunda Attractions Photos" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/553913.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Some more sights </h2><p>  The sights of Pitsunda are also the remains of the ancient Pitiunt (related to the 2nd century BC).  Partially they are surrounded by reconstructed walls, and these ruins are located on a rather large territory.  The name of all this is Gorodishche, but there have not been any excavations here for a long time, because a significant part of the object was covered with thorns. </p><p>  And the attention of tourists deserves the lighthouse of Pitsunda.  The iron tower rises next to the coastline, not far from multi-story pensions.  The tower is surrounded by a metal frame.  For several decades in a row, the lighthouse was a faithful assistant to the ships.  He helped them keep their course in the vast sea at night.  When the lighthouse was "dismissed", it became a local attraction, one of the symbols of Pitsunda. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pizunda attractions and entertainment" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/553916.jpg" width="600"></div>
