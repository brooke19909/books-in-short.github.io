With the development of society, people began to have a desire to speed up this process in some way.  But there are laws of physics over which we are not in control.  And for a long time, the housewives had no choice but to wait for the moment of boiling water, and then stand by the stove to prepare food for their family. </p><h2>  Pressure cooker </h2><p>  The situation changed only in the 17th century.  Then, in 1679, the first pressure cooker was invented by the French physicist Denis Papin.  The scientist came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãspeeding up the cooking process after he had been watching the work of <span>steam engines</span> and boilers for a long time.  The physicist invented a device in which increased pressure was created, increasing the boiling point of water.  It was a dish with a hermetically sealed lid.  In it, due to the increased pressure, the cooking process was significantly accelerated. </p>

    <p>  The first pressure cooker was called Varilka Papena.  However, housewives and cooks for a long time did not dare to use this device in everyday life.  Everything was explained by the fact that the first pressure cookers, which were a pan of thick metal sheet with a tightly twisted lid, were not entirely safe.  "Varilka Papena" was supposed to be hermetically sealed.  Otherwise, high pressure tore off its cover, which at high speed could fly away in any direction.  People near the stove were injured.  Another disadvantage of the first pressure cookers was that they did not need to be opened immediately.  After the end of the cooking process, some time should have passed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mass production start </h2><p>  Only with the advent of the 20th century, pressure cookers began to go on sale actively.  For example, in 1912, these devices appeared in the catalog of one of the English trading houses.  At this time, "Varilka Papen" received another name - "Vacuum Samovarka".  In the catalog, it was described as a technical innovation, guaranteeing cooking for two hours. </p>

Many German restaurants were happy to purchase this innovation in their kitchens.  I liked the pressure cooker and the inhabitants of America.  In the USA, they even launched its mass production and released the ‚Äúchef's miracle‚Äù for free sale.

    <h2>  Pressure cooker improvement </h2><p>  The popularity of fast cooking appliances has been increasing every year.  Engineering did not stand in one place either.  As a result, today a convenient and safe pressure cooker is presented in the consumer market.  These devices have several degrees of protection and allow you to independently adjust the pressure.  In addition, the best materials are used to make these kitchen assistants.  There is even a <span>stainless steel</span> pressure cooker <span>, the</span> bottom of which is an alloy of stainless steel and aluminum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Convenience to modern devices give a variety of electronic controls.  Is there a better pressure cooker among the wide range of appliances that you should choose?  Let's consider this question in more detail. </p><h2>  Cookers on the stove </h2><p>  Modern manufacturers offer two types of pressure cookers.  Some of them are installed on an electric or gas stove, while others are autonomous, with electric heating. </p><p>  The material for the manufacture of the first type of pressure cooker is only metal.  In the simplest models, it is aluminum.  What is the difference between pressure cookers and ordinary pots?  The fact that they have thick walls and a bottom.  A tight-fitting cover is also provided in these devices, in which two valves are installed (working and emergency). </p><p>  Valves are needed in order to release <span>excess pressure</span> from the device <span>.</span>  This protects the pressure cooker from breaking.  Between the pan and the lid of the device is a gasket.  It is necessary for sealing.  For aluminum models, the gasket is usually made of rubber.  Such pressure cookers are cheap, but have some disadvantages: </p><ol><li>  The reaction of aluminum with products.  This is hazardous to health, and there are always traces on the walls of the device. </li><li>  Durability of rubber gaskets.  Because of this, the pressure cooker loses its tightness after a certain period of time. </li><li>  Use only for electric and gas stoves. </li></ol><p>  What material should a pressure cooker be made of?  Which is better?  User reviews say that the most perfect option is a steel device.  Its bottom is multi-layered, which allows the device to have good thermoregulation.  It attracts the attention of consumers and the fact that there are various functions of a pressure cooker to control the cooking process.  Among them is a cover lock, which prevents depressurization of the device at high pressure.  This feature greatly improves the security of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Steel pressure cooker (see photo below) has a two-position valve.  This part allows you to adjust the pressure inside the container, which is important when preparing a variety of dishes.  Of course, for safety, this subspecies of devices is also equipped with an emergency valve. </p>

    <p>  Some of the models made of steel have a bowl that allows you to cook food for a couple.  The resulting dishes are very healthy.  Some models have a glass lid, which customers also like. </p><p>  Aluminum or steel pressure cooker - which is better?  User reviews indicate the greater popularity of the second model.  After all, such devices are used not only on gas and electric, but also on induction and <span>glass-ceramic stoves.</span>  In addition, devices made of steel are very high quality and functional.  In addition, such a pressure cooker is a very affordable purchase.  The price for it is relatively low - from a thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Electric pressure cooker </h2><p>  Quite an acceptable option for a kitchen assistant for fast cooking are stand-alone appliances with electric heating.  What is the difference between such a pressure cooker and its "brothers"?  The price for it is higher, but, according to user reviews, such devices will be an excellent choice.  And this can be explained by the high functionality of the device.  In the models of such devices there is an electronic control.  It allows the hostess to escape from kitchen worries.  Simply set the necessary cooking program.  At the end of the process, the device will turn itself off. </p><h2>  Production material </h2><p>  Pots of electric pressure cookers are made not only of aluminum and steel.  Some models use an enameled surface.  There are also stand-alone appliances with non-stick coating.  According to the material of the <span>pan, which electric</span> pressure cooker is better?  User reviews recommend choosing a non-stick coating model.  In such a pan, food will not stick to the walls and bottom, and this will greatly simplify the cleaning of the container. </p><p>  The stainless steel pressure cooker, which has a hard anodized coating, is also very popular with consumers.  The advantage of such a device is its thick heat distribution bottom.  Such a detail allows you to cook food without fat and oil. </p><h2>  Pan volume </h2><p>  It is worth paying attention to one more important parameter of the device.  It is the volume of the pan.  It happens from 0.5 to 40 liters.  If a pressure cooker is selected by this criterion, which is better?  User reviews are advised to dwell on the golden mean.  For example, for a family of 4 people, the best option would be a 5-6 liter pressure cooker (the same parameters apply for cookers that work on stoves).  In addition, it should be borne in mind that the purchased device must have some reserve volume.  After all, it is impossible to fill the pan completely with water when cooking.  It is important to leave a place where steam will form. </p>

    <p>  Usually the empty volume is 2/3 of the capacity.  Their characteristics exist in the preparation of swellable products, such as rice.  In this case, it is forbidden to fill the pan with water above the middle.  All these factors are recommended to consider when choosing a pressure cooker. </p><h2>  Power </h2><p>  When choosing a device, this parameter should be given special attention.  Indeed, the speed of boiling water and the formation of steam depends on the power of the electric apparatus.  Of course, in all models of pressure cookers, manufacturers measure this parameter with the dimensions of the device.  But, as a rule, the most popular devices for instant cooking have a power of 1 to 1.5 kW.  At lower values ‚Äã‚Äãof this parameter, the device will be more economical, but cooking in it will take a longer period of time. </p><p>  There are people living in a fast rhythm.  They are advised to pay attention to a pressure cooker of greater power.  And if you spend most of your time at home?  Then it will be enough to purchase a device with a small capacity.  He will cook food delicately. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  The comfort and convenience of the device during its operation should also play an important role in choosing a home assistant.  In modern models, there is a large set of functions, such as a pasta cooker, rice cooker, cooker, etc. It is desirable that such opportunities be as many as possible.  And therefore, user reviews recommend paying attention to a universal pressure cooker.  She will cook correctly not only the above dishes, but also potatoes, meat, soups and so on. </p>

    <p>  Mothers of young children need frequent cooking cereals.  They are advised to opt for a pressure cooker with a delayed start function.  And in order for the porridge not to run away, it is advisable to choose a device of low power. </p><p>  User reviews suggest that you can also cook yogurt in a pressure cooker.  Fans of this product should opt for a device having a minimum temperature of 40 degrees. </p><p>  There is also a special baking mode in some pressure cookers.  It is desirable that such a function have an adjustable time. </p><p>  A pleasant bonus when buying will be additional accessories that many companies complete their models with.  These include a steam plate that allows you to cook tasty and healthy dishes, as well as a grid for rice. <br>  For some housewives, visual control of cooking is important.  To do this, some pressure cookers provide an inspection window. </p><h2>  Manufacturer's choice </h2><p>  An important factor in choosing a home helper is the fame of the company that released it.  Of course, in the first place it is worth paying attention to those devices that are manufactured by the most famous companies. </p><p>  Today, many manufacturers offer us convenient and safe pressure cookers.  However, the best devices are those that are produced by Mulinex and Panasonic, Redmond and Brand.  The cost of devices of these brands ranges from 60 to 500 dollars. </p><p>  For those who do not have the opportunity to purchase an expensive apparatus, sellers offer Russian-made pressure cookers.  Such devices will cost the buyer only 1200-1400 rubles.  Corresponds to the price and quality of such pressure cookers.  They are made of aluminum, using a rubber gasket to seal the lid. </p><h2>  Pressure cooker "Panasonic" </h2><p>  According to consumer reviews, the most popular model of this brand is the Panasonic SR-TMH18.  She was offered to be one of the first in the home appliance market.  That is why today many consumers have already managed to appreciate the capabilities of the device.  This pressure cooker (see photo below) is quite unpretentious. </p>

    <p>  Despite a small set of functions, the manufacturer equipped it with all possible cooking options.  The disadvantages of this model are its fragility and instability.  However, this problem can be easily solved with a special cooker and spoon. </p><p>  If we describe all models of pressure cookers of the Panasonic line, then we can definitely say about their main advantage - low price.  Attractive for some categories of customers and the ease of use of the device.  Among the shortcomings can be called a small power range (490-850 W), as well as the fragility of the structures. </p><h2>  Pressure cooker "Redmond" </h2><p>  At a higher level, Redmond launches its fast food machines.  Moreover, the brand has many options to choose from.  For example, a Redmond pressure cooker model RMC-M4502.  This is a universal device.  It is equipped with sixteen different functions, thanks to which the Redmond pressure cooker is also able to serve its owners as a crock-pot, yogurt maker, double boiler, bread maker, etc. </p>
