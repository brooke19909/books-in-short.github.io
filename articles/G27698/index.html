In the proposed rating - the best budget televisions that differ not only in low price, but also in good functionality. </p><h2>  What are they - inexpensive, but good TVs? </h2><p>  Low cost plays an important role, however, choosing a model based on its cheapness is not the best option that can lead to serious disappointments.  Therefore, when compiling this rating of the best budget smart TVs, several criteria were taken into account. </p><h2>  Manufacturer </h2><p>  TVs of the <span>Korean brand</span> LG occupy a leading position in the market in terms of price and quality.  Samsung is in the same category, but the products of this brand are somewhat more expensive.  Good TV models are offered by Chinese Supra and BBK. </p><p>  The countries of production of most budget televisions are Belarus, China or Russia.  Reputable brands - Panasonic, Sony - produce their equipment in Europe or Malaysia. </p><h2>  Functional characteristics </h2><p>  The main functional requirements are most often limited by the presence or absence of Smart TV.  The need for this platform is determined individually.  Before purchasing, it is advisable to carefully study the specification in order to know exactly all the functions of the model. </p><h2>  Diagonal and screen resolution </h2><p>  With the first characteristic, everything is clear - the larger the diagonal, the steeper, but this increases the cost.  Image quality depends on the second parameter.  For small TVs, the HD-Ready format is allowed, while the matrix of models with a medium and large diagonal should comply with Full HD or 4K standards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hepsiburada.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best 32 inch tvs" class="if uuid-2939746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2939746.jpg"></div><h2>  Rating of budget TVs up to 15 000 rubles </h2><p>  <span>LG 32LJ510U</span> with a diagonal of 32 inches is the best budget TV in the price category of up to 15 thousand rubles, confirming that functional simplicity is not always a drawback.  The model does not have a network connection and Smart TV, but there are no special ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù of the system, and the affordable cost for many is much more attractive than the availability of Internet options.  The broadcast image is pretty good, stable reception of digital broadcasting is supported. </p><p>  The model appeared on the market in 2017.  The diagonal is 32 inches, the matrix backlight is Direct LED.  External devices are connected through two inputs - component / composite and HDMI.  Media files from a hard drive or flash drive are played through a USB port.  The only drawback is that it is located on the back side, which is extremely inconvenient with the TV wall mounting.

The compact size is ideal for small rooms - bedrooms, kitchens, children's rooms, as the menu has a built-in section of free games. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Large-format display with a resolution of 1366x768 pixels and Direct LED backlight.

The brand originally from Korea does not have such ambitions as its competitors, so the cost of models on the Russian market is low.  The equipment does not have special functionality, however, it is distinguished by high quality of workmanship, good image and modern design with thin frames. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Universal tuner works with cable, terrestrial and satellite broadcasting.  A matrix with a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080 pixels, frequency - 50 Hz, viewing angles - 176 <sup>o</sup> / 176 <sup>o</sup> .  The power of the audio system with two speakers is 16 watts.  Despite the fact that this budget smart TV is the best in the rating, you should not expect any special miracles from it.

It is assembled in Russia, like LG.  A diagonal of 31.5 inches is not the best option for creating a multimedia center, but at the same time the screen resolution complies with HD 720p standards.  The model is ideal for small rooms - a children's room, bedroom or kitchen. </p><p>  The TV was released in 2017 and is considered a fairly recent model in the Samsung lineup.  It does not differ in innovations and functional refinements and in many respects resembles the previous version.  The image is clear, but not perfect, but in comparison with similar models of Chinese, Russian and Turkish production, the quality is decent. </p><p>  There are no smart functions and an Internet connection, which is compensated by the optimal ratio of price and quality, and the cost is considered more significant. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Existence of Edge LED illumination. </li><li>  Slim body. </li><li>  The function "image in image". </li><li>  The tuner reproduces all formats - digital, analog. </li><li>  Child protection. </li><li>  Component jack, USB, HDMI, optical audio output. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Average sound quality. </li><li>  Wall mounting is preferred as the legs do not provide the necessary stability. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.makrostv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best 55 inch budget televisions" class="if uuid-2939769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2939769.jpg"></div><h2>  SUPRA STV-LC40LT0020F </h2><p>  Supra LED TVs are the best budget TVs that match the expression ‚Äúcheap but cheerful.‚Äù  The model‚Äôs functions are limited: there are no ‚Äúsmart‚Äù applications and network connections, but the image is clear, bright and contrasting, the resolution is Full HD, which allows you to watch television broadcasts in high quality. </p><p>  The DVB-T2 / C / S2 tuner receives satellite, digital and cable broadcast signals.  HDMI with 2 connectors allows you to play content from external sources.  For similar purposes, the built-in USB media player reads most video and audio formats. </p><p>  Two 6-watt front speakers provide realistic and powerful sound, there is a built-in stereo tuner A2 / NICAM and an audio output for headphones. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Big diagonal. </li><li>  Affordable cost. </li><li>  LED backlight and Full HD matrix. </li><li>  High image quality. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Viewing angles differ from those stated by the manufacturer. </li></ul><h2>  Rating of budget TVs up to 30 000 rubles </h2><p>  One of the best budget TVs on the Smart TV webOS 3.5 platform with a 43-inch display is the LG 43LJ595V.  In the 2017 lineup there is also a model with a 49-inch screen, which is considered inexpensive in its class and quite profitable in terms of capabilities and characteristics. </p><p>  The sleek and modern TV design is accentuated by a sickle-shaped desk stand.  The backlight of the Direct LED type matrix, which is characterized by less light and more uniform image, significantly increases the body in comparison with similar models on the market.  The standard refresh rate is 50 Hz, resolution is 1980x1020 pixels.  It supports True Motion, smoothing dynamic scenes, and the index of improvement in image quality - PMI 1000. </p><p>  Reception of a television signal is carried out in a digital and analog format.  Smart functions are available: Magic Zoom, application and content store, browser, quick access, audio player. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Functional and intuitive Smart. </li><li>  Resolution Upscaler - scaling an image to FHD resolution. </li><li>  Light level sensor. </li><li>  A large number of interfaces to connect. </li><li>  Audio system with surround sound support Virtual Surround Plus. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  The presence of only optical audio output. </li><li>  The use of unnatural colors in the design. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="imgur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best 32 inch smart TV" class="if uuid-2939773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2939773.jpg"></div><h2>  LG 32LK615B </h2><p>  The versatile 2018 new from the LG brand continues to rank the best 32-inch smart TVs at 32 inches.  The matrix installed in the TV does not have a good resolution - only 1366x768 pixels, which lowered the cost of the model. </p><p>  It‚Äôs worth acquiring the options considered earlier if the priority is a high-quality image and an affordable price.  A good budget 32-inch TV from LG is a more modern, comfortable and compact device that surpasses previous models in terms of performance. </p><p>  LED TV features Smart TV, webOS, resolution scaling, Wi-Fi module and noise reduction system.  Support for Active HDR technology is available.  The manufacturer does not guarantee high detail and elaboration of images characteristic of high-class UHD screens, but an affordable price is the main advantage. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Dynamic color booster. </li><li>  4-core processor ;. </li><li>  Reception of digital and analogue broadcasting formats. </li><li>  Ability to synchronize with a smartphone. </li><li>  Presence of optical audio output, Cl slot, component input, USB, LAN, HDMI and Simplink connectors. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Lack of headphone jack. </li><li>  Truncated Smart Functionality. </li></ul><h2>  BBK 50LEX-5039 / FT2C </h2><p>  One of the best budget televisions that will appeal to those who prefer modern, large and smart LED models, but do not want to overpay for the brand.  A TV with a 50-inch Full HD screen at a low price is a real gift.  Good viewing angles and minimal response time are significant bonuses. </p><p>  The model from BBK is not in vain considered the best by users: for a budget TV, it has excellent image quality.  The tuner receives digital and analog signals.  USB 2.0 port is designed to play videos, photos and audio files from HDD and flash drives, three HDMI connectors, composite and component inputs allow you to connect other external sources. </p><p>  Wireless and wired network function formats are provided.  The Android operating system is not the fastest, but you should not expect more from a budget TV. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Low cost with decent options. </li><li>  Big diagonal. </li><li>  A clear and simple menu. </li><li>  Wide network functionality. </li><li>  Linear and coaxial digital audio outputs, including for headphones. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  There is no support for satellite broadcasting. </li><li>  The system slows down somewhat. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="fastpic.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best budget TV 43 inches" class="if uuid-2939782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2939782.jpg"></div><h2>  Sony KDL-40RE353 </h2><p>  Budget TV model from the eminent Japanese brand.

The real frequency is 50 Hz, the Clear Resolution mode provides clarity of the picture, optimization of contrast is available thanks to the dynamic backlight function. </p><p>  The TV is equipped with all the necessary connectors, including a composite, rear and side HDMI, a USB port for playing and recording files to third-party media.  For sound reproduction, two speakers with a power of 5 watts each are responsible.  Support for DTS and Dolby is possible. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Zoom Function Clear Resolution Enhancer. </li><li>  Live Color Image Enhancement Technology. </li><li>  The unique X-Protection PRO system that protects the TV from moisture, dust and power surges. </li><li>  Audio outputs linear and digital type. </li><li>  Assembly and production - Malaysia. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Flimsy table stand. </li><li>  Lack of satellite receiver. </li></ul><h2>  Rating of the best budget 4K TVs </h2><p>  Korean brand LG has a leading position in the segment of low-cost TVs.  The range offers different models - the best budget televisions at 28 inches, and the most popular model 43UJ634V.  It is rather difficult to name the sixth series budget, but the ratio of characteristics and adequate price is more than attractive. </p><p>  The TV with an attractive and modern design of the case is equipped with a 4K IPS matrix with wide viewing angles and a bright, contrasting image.  Active HDR technology has the added benefit of enhancing content shot in the dynamic standard range.  There is a contrast enhancement mode HDR Effect.  Smart TV platform is based on webOS 3.5 and supports all basic functions.  Available synchronization with a smartphone via DLNA, Miracast and WiDi. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Scaling image resolution to 4K. </li><li>  Image Quality Improvement Index - PMI 1600, dynamic scene clarity - TM100. </li><li>  Standards for receiving digital television DVB-T2 / C / S2. </li><li>  Optical audio output, multiple HDMI interfaces, USB port, LAN, support for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. </li><li>  Option - use the Magic Remote. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Inconvenient management. </li><li>  Inadequate black level. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best 28 inch budget tvs" class="if uuid-2939786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2939786.jpg"></div><h2>  Samsung UE40MU6100U </h2><p>  40-inch smart TV with 4K matrix and HDR support.  The model does not differ in wide viewing angles in comparison with a competitive TV from LG, but has a large margin of brightness, which makes the darkened areas of the image more realistic.  The design is not the most attractive, the price could be lower, but it all depends on the preferences, perceptions and capabilities of the consumer. </p><p>  The TV is equipped with a set of technologies that optimize image quality: Pure Color to improve color brightness, Micro Dimming for detail, Motion Rate 100 to increase the clarity of dynamic scenes.  Image scaling to Ultra HD quality is available.  The TV is equipped with an analog tuner and a 20-watt audio system.  Assembly is carried out at a Russian plant. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  <span>Tizen operating system,</span> support for Wi-Fi. </li><li>  Quad-core processor. </li><li>  Pure Color technology enhances color reproduction. </li><li>  Optical output, the option of broadcasting sound via Bluetooth. </li><li>  Three HDMI sockets, 2 USB ports, Ethernet. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Lack of headphone jack. </li><li>  Frequency - 50 Hz. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.satisport.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best smart tv tvs best" class="if uuid-2939791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2939791.jpg"></div><h2>  How to choose the best budget Smart TV TV: some tips </h2><p>  One of the most important questions when choosing a TV is whether it needs a SmartTV or not.  Not every best 55-inch budget TV is equipped with such a function, but models with a smaller diagonal and, moreover, are often produced without it.  Supporters of the platform are of the opinion that a modern TV must be equipped with network functions, opponents, on the contrary, believe that SmartTV is an extra option.  Their arguments are quite convincing: </p><ol><li>  Smart functions are more expensive, which affects the availability of the TV and its cost - the most important criterion. </li><li>  In the budget segment, smart TVs are practically not equipped with ‚Äúserious‚Äù hardware and modern software, which affects the system‚Äôs speed and causes applications to freeze.  However, this is not limited to such shortcomings: the TV is often controlled more difficult and slower to respond to teams, unlike its competitors. </li><li>  Similar features are available for Android-consoles, which are much cheaper, but have better features. </li></ol><p>  A common marketing gimmick that draws the attention of consumers even to the best models of the best 24-inch televisions is the manipulation of the terms ‚Äú100-hertz, 200-hertz‚Äù.  Most modern LCD TVs are equipped with matrices with a refresh rate of 60/50 Hz, and all stickers indicating an increase in the quality of images in dynamic scenes are only a marketing move.  Budget televisions, as a rule, are not equipped with expensive and powerful processors. </p>
