Can pensioners get loans?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, lending is very popular.  Almost every person at least once in a life made out a loan.  Previously, pensioners did not have the right to receive money from the bank, since there was a high probability that they would not be able to make the corresponding payments for obvious reasons.  In this case, they were refused.  The same was true for some other categories of people who did not satisfy banks according to the requirements.  Today, the situation has fundamentally changed, and there are a huge number of organizations where pensioners and unemployed people can get a loan.  This is good news for those who want to buy equipment, cars or even an apartment.  Let's consider in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Where can I get a loan to a pensioner who has no job </h2><p>  Non-working citizens of the older generation can get a certain loan, which will be calculated on the basis of a monthly installment, and also be correlated with their financial capabilities. </p><p>  If the amount of pension payments is too small, then the monthly contributions may be extended for a longer period of time.  In addition, many banks have programs that allow you to attract a family member as a co-borrower.  A certificate of income and a permanent place of work will be required from him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="banks where you can get a loan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/2049143.jpg"></div>

    <p>  However, consideration of the application is made individually, depending on certain parameters of the borrower.  Where to get a loan for consumer needs?  In two banks: OTP and Sovetsky. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that it will be more profitable to get a credit card.  It has one significant advantage.  During the period from 30 to 50 days, a pensioner can return the money borrowed without additional interest. </p><h2>  Where can I get a loan without providing information? </h2><p>  It is worth considering several organizations where you can get a loan without providing additional documents is quite realistic.  However, it is worth considering that in this case the minimum annual rate will be increased. </p><p>  At Post Bank, the overpayment will be from 16 to 17% per annum.  Also, a similar service exists in SKB Bank.  In this case, the borrower can receive up to 1.5 million rubles for a period of 5 years.  It is also worth contacting Rusfinance Bank.  The maximum loan amount here is 50 thousand rubles.  In this case, the overpayment will be quite impressive and will be 31%. </p><h2>  Where can I get a loan without refusal </h2><p>  To be sure that the credit institution will provide a loan, it is worth considering the banks that are least likely to give a negative answer on loans. </p>

    <p>  In this rating, Post Bank takes the first place.  Only 10% of borrowers refuse this credit institution.  Also, loans are often issued at Vostochny Bank.  In this case, the percentage of loan refusals is not more than 20. And at SKB Bank, 30% of borrowers who want to get a loan do not receive money.  One of the most profitable credit organizations is Home Credit Bank.  In it, only 15% of customers who apply fail.  At BFA, this indicator is even less than 10%. </p><p>  However, before contacting a credit institution, you should carefully study the conditions for issuing loans.  In many banks, you need to provide information about the guarantor or relatives of the potential client.  In other cases, the credit institution may require a pledge in the form of housing or other property of the client. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  When deciding where to get a loan, it is worth considering all possible options.  Of course, it is best to contact a trusted banking institution, as otherwise there is a great risk of stumbling on fraudsters.  It is also worth staying away from microfinance.  The fact is that such loans differ in simply crazy interest rates.  In the event of default, the client risks losing not only a rather large amount of money in debt, but also doom himself to litigation. </p>
