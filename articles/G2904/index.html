  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Segments in history are part of peasant allotments. Abolition of serfdom and land reform in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The segments in history are that part of the land which, according to <span>peasant reform,</span> in our country was taken over by the landlords.  Based on the provision on the <span>abolition of serfdom,</span> a certain norm of the site was established for rural and rural land users.  But if it exceeded the specified size, then the excess went to the nobles. </p><h2>  General characteristics of the reform </h2><p>  In 1861, <span>serfdom</span> was abolished in Russia <span>.</span>  However, despite the fact that the peasants received personal freedom, in many regions they found themselves in an extremely difficult situation in connection with the land issue.  The segments in history are part of the new government policy to maintain the material situation of the noble landowners.  After all, from now on they lost their main source of subsistence - income and duties from the peasant economy. </p><p>  Therefore, the authorities took such a measure to preserve at least some privileges and economic advantages.  And this, of course, had a very bad effect on the situation of direct agricultural producers, who often lost the bulk of their holdings.  Segments in history - this is perhaps one of the most contradictory conditions for peasant reform.  There is evidence that the people themselves were often not happy with such a measure, since for them it was important not so much personal freedom as land. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="segments in history it's" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1294588.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Contradictions </h2><p>  So, the reform of 1861, with all its positive significance, nevertheless contained one very important drawback: the peasants were deprived of allotments.  Since agrarian labor was the basis of their existence, after the release of the provision on their freedom, they found themselves in an extremely disadvantaged position.  And many even in an even worse situation than before.  The sections in history are probably the most controversial and at the same time a sore point in this reform.  However, then the positions of the ruling class of the noble landowners were quite strong, so they had to reckon involuntarily. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But, despite the concession, this estate became very impoverished.  The measure taken by the government turned out to be insufficient to maintain their socio-economic status.  So from this time began the process of mass impoverishment of former large landowners.  Moreover, the very essence of the provisions on segments, many did not even immediately understand.  This was sometimes used by the most practical peasants, who were able to get these lands or, at least, to ease the size of the duties provided for their development. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are the segments in history" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1293255.jpg" width="405"></div></h2><h2>  Effects </h2><p>  It has already been said above that the distribution of land was not in favor of the peasants.  However, landlord tenure also fell into decline, although formally and by law the nobles still remained in a privileged position.  Understanding what segments in history is impossible without taking into account the circumstances in which the natural-geographical and climatic zones were allotments. </p><p>  For example, in chernozem regions, landowners took most of the land from the peasants, since in this region it was more fertile.  Rich nobles could even take on themselves one fifth, which extremely deplorably affected the situation of the village and its inhabitants.  In general, the average size of the allotment was three and a half tithes of land.  It was less than in the pre-reform era.  Naturally, many peasants were unhappy.  There is even evidence that they preferred to remain in serfdom than to lose funds for a full existence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stretches history definition" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1293253.jpg" width="495"></div></h2><h2>  Land tenure issues </h2><p>  So, we have already figured out what segments are.  History, the definition of this concept, as we have already understood, is inextricably linked with peasant reform.  It was assumed that in the case of obtaining an allotment, a few dozen acres greater than the established norm, the landowners had the right to take away "excess" territory from the agrarians.  As a rule, this accounted for eighteen percent of all property, which was quite a lot for rural landowners. </p><p>  In addition, there was still the problem of stalking.  Landowners' lands were often wedged into peasant lands, creating for the latter the problem of grazing, using meadows, and so on.  For all this, they were forced to either pay the landlord, or lease land from him, or work out certain duties for the right to use allotments. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are the segments in the history of Russia" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1293251.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Question about the land </h2><p>  A detailed analysis and interpretation of the question of what segments are in the history of Russia are extremely important for understanding the features of the post-reform development of agriculture in the country in general.  Perhaps the new system at first dealt a blow to both landed estates and peasants.  The latter, of course, was in a more difficult and difficult position also because the people lost the right to use the lands: meadows, grazing areas, and so on.  Now, segments were wedged in whole strips, for the right to use which the peasants had to pay.  Thus, direct producers lost not only their basic holdings, but also additional land resources. </p>
