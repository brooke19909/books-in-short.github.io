Guests recommend not to miss this opportunity and be sure to enjoy great dishes. </p><p>  Alternatively, during the day, travelers can grab a bite to eat at the beach snack bar.

So, according to them, the choice of both non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks is quite wide.

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, the five-star Hilton Nubian Resort Marsa Alam offers its guests a magnificent beach holiday.  So, the hotel complex has its own sandy beach with a large number of sunbeds and umbrellas.  However, entering the sea here is quite inconvenient - at the bottom there are many stones and dead corals.  Therefore, if you want to swim and watch the inhabitants of a living coral reef, then you should go to the neighboring municipal beach.  It can be reached on foot.  On the road, according to tourists, it takes about five to ten minutes.  Also, if you wish, you can always get to the beach or return from the shore to the hotel in an open car with wagons.  Shuttle service is free. </p><p>  The beach is sandy.  True, the coast is full of small shells.  For adult vacationers, this is not a problem, but for kids it is recommended to purchase special shoes.  The entry into the water is sandy.  Over several tens of meters, the depth is minimal.  Parents with young children prefer to spend time here.  Going further, you will find yourself in the depths and will be able to swim to the coral reef.  According to tourists, it is inhabited by a mass of beautiful mosquito inhabitants.  So, here you can see sea turtles, and colorful fish of different sizes and shapes, and stingrays, and crabs.  Therefore, when you go on vacation, be sure to bring a snorkeling mask with you.  By the way, those who wish to go diving can take the necessary equipment in the diving club of the hotel.  There are also instructors who, if necessary, will give you several lessons. </p>
