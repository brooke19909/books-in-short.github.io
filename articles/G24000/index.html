So it happened when the new iPhone 6 was introduced. Millions of sales, thousands of press and social media posts, a huge number of reviews - all this instantly scattered around the world. </p><p>  However, we should not forget about the cost of each of the devices from Apple - it is approximately 800-1000 dollars, depending on the modification, date of purchase and place of order.  Agree, with such a price tag, not everyone can afford to get acquainted with the new product.  But what about those who would also like to purchase a new ‚Äúapple‚Äù smartphone for themselves, but cannot afford it? </p><p>  Everything is very simple!  Many people use copies of devices that were released by little-known companies that produce smartphones semi-legally.  Most often, these are in China.  As a result, the cost of a copy of <span>iPhone 6 (reviews</span> of which, incidentally, are very controversial) will be 10-15 times less.  At the same time, it will be difficult to visually distinguish the device from the original. </p><h2>  What is the point of making copies of iPhones? </h2><p>  First of all, let‚Äôs try to explain what reason Chinese companies (even if working underground) create copies of popular devices.  The initial answer is obvious - so that their customers can pretend that they have a real iPhone and give themselves a higher status in the eyes of others. </p>

    <p>  If we take into account only the case (that part of the smartphone that people around you notice), then giving it the maximum resemblance to the original device is not difficult.  Moreover, there are many phones on the market that have in their design elements of the appearance of the iPhone 6, and most of them are not a copy of iPhone 6. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reviews say that outwardly it‚Äôs quite difficult to say where the real iPhone 6 is, and where is its high-quality copy (or just a device with a similar design).  Moreover, the design of Apple technology has long been recognized as one of the most successful in the market. </p><p>  That is why copies are made.  Their owners can not only deceive others, but also get the opportunity to have a device with an attractive appearance.  Even if it was actually developed somewhere at an unnamed factory in Guangzhou. </p>

    <h2>  What are the differences? </h2><p>  In addition to the design, which can really be identical to the original Apple device, even the most accurate copy of iPhone 6 has a number of differences.  Simply put, they relate to everything: display, camera, processor, build quality, operating system.  We will describe in more detail about each of these points in the following parts of the article.  In the meantime, briefly describe: a copy of iPhone 6 (reviews will confirm this) is essentially a completely different phone, which is ‚Äúdriven‚Äù into a case similar to Apple.  Moreover - the quality of the latter can not be compared with the original smartphone.  There are several reasons for this: a different assembly technology, smelting, a different set of materials, etc.  Due to this, even the best copy of "iPhone 6" is not the <span>iPhone 6</span> in the original version, but only a model, a layout. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Disadvantages of copies </h2><p>  Based on the above, you can guess what flaws are hidden by each copy of iPhone 6. Reviews indicate that we can talk about the unstable operation of the smartphone, the errors that it knocks out and freezes.  In addition, it may be incorrectly functioning functions, faulty modules in the set. </p><p>  Since the phones ‚Äúcopy of iPhone 6‚Äù do not pass certification and verification of compliance with any standards, it is impossible to say for sure how they are created and with the use of which technologies.  Therefore, the materials used in the assembly of the device may not comply with any standards. </p>

    <p>  In addition to such more ‚Äúglobal‚Äù reasons, there are a number of more practical ones.  In particular, if you see that a copy of iPhone 6 is for sale cheaply, it can be so poor in quality that it simply won‚Äôt match the original, even in terms of appearance.  The danger here is that, when you see a photo of the real iPhone 6 on the Internet, you order a copy, thinking that it is identical.  In this case, the device will look completely different: less accurate and accurate than the original.  Do you want to use such a smartphone in public?  Unlikely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Copy Manufacturers </h2><p>  The most common products found in stores are noname companies.  These are one-day firms that operate at some Chinese factory.  On it, they can order batches of devices, after which they simply change their location and continue to conduct activities.  You as a buyer can‚Äôt even return your money if you send low-quality goods. </p><p>  However, there is another group of manufacturers - these are ‚Äúwhite‚Äù brands and well-known companies selling various devices.  For example, the same Lenovo has a product that looks almost like an exact copy of iPhone 6. </p><p>  There is also a whole set of developers releasing devices similar to the iPhone 6: Zopo, Meizu, Xiaomi.  There are many other companies that are not so famous in the world of mobile technology.  And, as you might guess, all of them ‚Äúsin‚Äù by borrowing design from the ‚Äúapple‚Äù company. </p>

    <p>  In order to demonstrate what the best Chinese copy of iPhone 6 really is, we will choose the most ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù of them.  This means that our review will include a model that is officially released by Lenovo.  This is the S90 version, which is a level better than products from other companies.  Although the appearance of the device is not 100% copied: the case is slightly longer than the original.  However, the Chinese concern sometimes produces quite decent smartphones. </p><h2>  Overview of the most ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù </h2><p>  So, in the characteristics of Lenovo S90, of course, it is not indicated that it has anything to do with the ‚Äúapple‚Äù.  However, visually everything is very clear, and you do not need to comment on anything: the phone (especially from afar) is exactly made like the sixth generation of an iPhone. </p><p>  Its cost, of course, is slightly lower - about 17-18 thousand rubles (although at the time of the device‚Äôs release it was 2-3 thousand higher).  But, acquiring this device, one should not expect from it the same that the original iPhone can demonstrate. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  The review will be carried out in stages, starting with the outer shell of the device, housing.  It is also made of aluminum, and judging by the technical descriptions, it is similar in composition to that presented on the original Apple technology.  But when it comes in contact with it, the difference begins to be felt.  For example, if the scratches of a real iPhone are not terrible (due to a special painting technology that is not so easy to remove), then the top ball of varnish comes off a Chinese copy very easily, exposing the base - metal.  It looks like a ‚Äúshabby‚Äù iPhone, of course, not so spectacular. </p>

    <p>  It was not possible to verify this during the tests, but we are inclined to the assumption that in practice the metal of the body of the copy is also not as resistant to mechanical stress as the original device.  And this is a significant drawback, which in the future will negatively affect the practicality of the model. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The ‚Äúfitted‚Äù copy for iPhone 6 (the price of which is 2-3 times lower than the original) is equipped, at first glance, with a high-quality display with AMOLED resolution.  Indeed, on a daily level, the colors transmitted by the smartphone seem very deep and saturated, and when tilted at an angle, the picture does not lose its colors at all.  But at the same time, having looked closely, you can notice a somewhat unnatural ‚Äúblue‚Äù display, noticeable in such screens.  And fonts on the display are often shown not in perfectly ‚Äúsmoothed‚Äù form, but in some chopped, unnatural shapes, shapes. </p><p>  How can this be compared with Apple's Retina screen, which accurately and accurately conveys every pixel?  No, it cannot be called ideal, but such screen capabilities clearly exceed the ability of a copy to display information. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  About the photos and video clips taken with the Lenovo S90, you can also say ‚Äúgood‚Äù, but only if you compare them with other Android devices.  As for attempts to compare the capabilities of the camera with the Apple iPhone 6, they are doomed to failure, and the copy created in the image of iPhone 6 is clearly lagging behind. </p>

    <p>  The price of the original device with an apple on the back cover is unreasonably high - this is understandable;  but nevertheless, the matrix from Sony perfectly fulfills its function, creating excellent pictures in the shortest possible time.  What can not be said about the S90, which is not able to accurately reproduce the color scheme in a poorly lit room. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Judging by the technical characteristics of the S90 model ( <span>Snapdragon 410 quad</span> -core processor with a clock frequency of up to 1.2 GHz), it has a really good response speed.  Small practical tests conducted by specialists with a couple of the most popular (and ‚Äúcumbersome‚Äù in terms of graphics) applications on Google Play showed this.  However, the original still works better and faster than the copy released with a hint of iPhone 6. </p><p>  Taiwan is a country where they make some copies of the ‚Äúapple‚Äù.  What is noteworthy - part of the production of original devices (besides China) was also located here.  So geographically models enter the markets close to each other, but in terms of speed they are located far away. </p><p>  On devices from Apple installed an OS of its own design - iOS, which is ideally optimized for their ‚Äúhardware‚Äù.  About Lenovo, which uses the Android platform, which is open to everyone, the same cannot be said.  The result is slight braking during periods of heavy load. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  A review of one of the best copies of iPhone 6 showed: this device can not be compared with the original under any circumstances.  All that similar phones can offer you is just an appearance similar to an ‚Äúapple‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Alternative </h2><p>  As an option, we can talk about the acquisition of a cheaper and older version of Apple, which is in the hierarchy of the lineup lower than the sixth generation.  So you, on the one hand, get a high-quality and powerful iPhone, on the other hand, save money by choosing not the latest generation of the device.  So many do, realizing the benefits of such a compromise. </p>
