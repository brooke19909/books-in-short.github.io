It is also called Kaiserburg, since in fact it is not one building, but a whole complex of fortresses and other structures located in the German city of Nuremberg.  The oldest building dates back to the thousandth year of our era. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The Nuremberg fortress is a real monument that has come down to us since the Middle Ages.  It includes the Emperor‚Äôs fortress, or Kaiserburg, and the Burggrass fortress.  They are located in the western and eastern parts of the complex, respectively. </p><p>  The Nuremberg fortress is located at the top of a sandstone rock, which, in turn, hangs over the waters of the Pegnitz River, and below, at the foot, the Old Town of Zebaldsk proudly stands.  If you get to the observation deck, you can see the streets of this same Old Town, as well as the houses of the Craft District. </p><p>  It is known that the fortress and Nuremberg during the Second World War were heavily bombed, so most of the fortress was restored, not the original one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="georgiarambler.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruined by the war Nuremberg and the fortress" class="if uuid-2953713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2953713.jpg"></div><p>  Now in castles and museums you can see how German nobles lived in the Middle Ages.  And during the Second World War, the dungeons of the fortresses were used as secret warehouses where the looted wealth was taken from various museums, including the Spear of Fate, known to the whole world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A brief historical excursion </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the history of the complex began in the eleventh century, and in subsequent centuries, due to constant conflicts between neighboring noble courtyards, the fortress was destroyed and restored more than once.  Nuremberg then was located right on the bend of particularly important trade routes, therefore, most often stayed in a prosperous period. </p><p>  When the world reached the late Middle Ages, the city was already one of the central in Europe.  And in 1354, Charles the Fourth issued a special decree, according to which all subsequent emperors of Rome were obliged to hold the first Reichstag in Nuremberg. </p><p>  Actually, this immutable rule was observed until the end of the Thirty Years War, and after the Reichstag moved to the city of Regensburg.  When the empire collapsed, the city, along with its fortresses, moved to Bavaria.  Global perestroika and restoration began here only in the 19th century, and already in the 30s of the last century, Nuremberg became one of the main Hitler cities, where he propagated his ideology. </p><h2>  Burggrass Fortress History </h2><p>  The first of the Nuremberg fortress complex was the Burggraf building.  It is central at the moment.  The fortress is located in the northern part of the city all on the same rocks mentioned above.  In the annals of Nuremberg, the Nuremberg fortress of Burggraf was mentioned already in 1105 AD.  At that time, all the lands located under the fortress walls belonged to the Counts of Raab. </p><p>  In the 13th century, namely in 1219, the ruler Frederick the Second granted freedom to the inhabitants of the fortress according to a document presuming liberties.  From this moment on, the strength of the burggraves gradually decreases, and they lose their significance in the region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hohenzollern-orte.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Burggrass Fortress" class="if uuid-2953737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2953737.jpg"></div><p>  By 1420, burggrafism completely disappeared as such, and all the fortifications passed into the possession of the city.  Unfortunately, little has been preserved in the Burggrass fortress from those times, but you can still unearth the oldest building dating back to the eleventh century - it is a tower with five corners.  The twelfth and thirteenth centuries brought the fortress a chapel named after St. Walpurga.  By the way, she is still active, and priests still conduct services there. </p><h2>  History of the Imperial Castle </h2><p>  From the photo of the Nuremberg fortress, you can see that the largest part of the complex is the Imperial Castle, located in the western part.  It began to be built during the reign of Emperor Conrad the Third, that is, in 1140, but the end of construction was already in the era of Frederick the First. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bavaria.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inside the fortress" class="if uuid-2953654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2953654.jpg"></div><p>  The first building erected was the castle itself.  Its most significant components at that time were two rooms: the Knight's and the Imperial, as well as the residential part, in which the ruler settled with his retinue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Chapels of the Imperial Castle </h2><p>  In the same period, a local chapel was erected - Double.  It consisted of two chapels, which were interconnected by a special overlap with a small hole, since one was on top of the other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chapel in the fortress" class="if uuid-2953726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2953726.jpg"></div><p>  The meaning of the two chapels was that the upper part was intended for the emperor and his associates.  Also, the upper room was heated, so the emperor could rise there at any time of the year and in any weather.  But court workers and guests of the palace could enter the lower one. </p><h2>  Other buildings of the Imperial Castle </h2><p>  On the territory of the Imperial Palace there is also an interesting Round Tower with a viewing platform, which offers fantastic views of Nuremberg and all the surrounding surroundings.  Within the walls of the fortress there is also a well, which once supplied residents with water if the castle was besieged by the enemy.  The depth of the well is forty-seven meters, and they chopped it right in the rock. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Well in the fortress" class="if uuid-2953709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2953709.jpg"></div><p>  Today the Imperial Castle has been turned into a museum and has been thoroughly restored.  In addition, there are wonderful gardens around it, where you can take stunning photographs. </p><h2>  The history of the fortress of the imperial city </h2><p>  Another fortress, part of the Nuremberg complex, belonged to the imperial city and was built later than all.  It also includes several buildings and is located in the eastern zone of the complex.  The status of "imperial city" Nuremberg gained thanks to Frederick II.  The largest building of the fortress is a tower called Luginsland, created in 1377, during the fall of the power of the Burggraves in Nuremberg.  From this tower you can see the Burggrass fortress in all its grandeur. </p><p>  Between the Luginsland Tower and the Pentagonal Tower, located in the Burggrass Fortress, are the stables of the emperor.  The stalls were built in 1495 and had very interesting architectural features: in addition to keeping horses in them, grain storages were organized in the attics of the stables, and in order to ventilate the upper square, large windows were made in the walls.  By the sixteenth century, the fortress had its own bastions. </p><h2>  How to get to the fortresses? </h2><p>  Opening hours of the Nuremberg fortress depend on the time of year.  So, from April to September, the territory opens at 9 am and closes at 6 pm, but from March to October the doors of the complex open at 10 am and close at 4 pm. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="49.4579779" data-lng="11.07625489999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/4/5/9/11459.png"></div><p>  You can buy one full ticket, which includes a visit to all paid areas, it costs 8 euros (570 p.).  Children under the age of eighteen visit absolutely all buildings for free. </p><p>  How to get to the Nuremberg fortress?  There are not many hotels near the complex, so the Old Town will serve as a guide.  To get as close to the fortress as possible, you can use the city bus or train, the stop is called "Nuremberg".  From it to the final goal you still have to walk twenty minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stockphotorejects.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inside the tower" class="if uuid-2953705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2953705.jpg"></div><p>  The address of the Nuremberg fortress will be needed by those traveling by car, since it can be hammered, for example, in Google Maps: Burg 13, 90403 N√ºrnberg. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists' reviews, it is best to set aside a whole day to inspect the complex, since you will have to walk a lot.  Also, many say that it is better to shoe in comfortable sneakers with non-slip soles, as in some places you can slip pretty well on shabby stones. </p><p>  Many were surprised that not everywhere you can go for free.  So, tourists write that you need to be prepared to give a small amount of money when visiting the museum rooms of the Imperial Palace.  Also, a ticket will have to be purchased by everyone who wants to inspect the well.  The observation tower is also paid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stripes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Observation Tower" class="if uuid-2953701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2953701.jpg"></div><p>  According to most reviews, in addition to the Nuremberg fortress, you should definitely go down to the Craftsman quarter, as in local houses the craftsmen are still engaged in their family and hereditary business: glassblowers sit somewhere, blacksmiths somewhere, and jewelers somewhere.  By the way, the Old Town is advised to visit on the eve of Christmas, when a real colorful fair unfolds on the narrow streets. </p><p>  In the reviews, travelers write that a walk along the ramparts, towers and courtyards is best organized in the morning, while the sun illuminates the castles and the photos are not dark.  But it is best to go up to the observation deck after lunch, since by this time the sun is already setting off to the other side and does not shine in the camera lens. </p><p>  The disadvantage for tourists was the lack of information in Russian, both on booklets and in the excursion program. </p>
