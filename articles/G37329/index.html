    <p>  In the 60s of the 19th century, the village of Livadia was acquired by the royal house of the Romanovs.  Of course, soon these places became favorite for the rest of the whole family.  A magnificent palace in the style of the Italian Renaissance was built as a master's house in a picturesque meadow almost near the sea.  Nearby were built estates, houses of aristocracy and noble families.  Once upon a time there was a wonderful mountain forest, then a beautiful park was set up on forty hectares of land, and for 150 years now it has been delighting everyone with its beauty.  It is from here that the famous ‚ÄúTsar‚Äôs Path‚Äù (now called the ‚ÄúSolar‚Äù) originates, stretching 6,700 meters along the sea, from where the most picturesque views of the coast open.  Today, the famous Livadia sanatorium, as well as the Gorny, Border Guard and Black Sea sanatoriums, are operating in several buildings of the palace complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p><strong></strong></p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><h2><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="livadia health resort prices" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/482953.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Livadia architectural ensemble is a unique historical and cultural monument, an achievement of architectural and park art.
