    <p>  If you get acquainted with tourist trips to Dagomys, reviews from visitors to this city will pleasantly surprise you.  Prestigious health centers, high-quality service, proximity to the sea - all this will allow you to enjoy your vacation to the fullest.  Among other things, here you can also often meet representatives of the Russian show business and the elite. </p><p>  For those who do not have enough finances and cannot afford to rent a hotel room, mini-hotels and guest houses work.  You can also rent housing in one of the local apartment buildings, but this is more difficult, because the flow of tourists during the summer season is very large, and the apartments diverge almost instantly. </p><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  The administrative unit, which includes Dagomys, is Sochi.  Reviews of these two cities can be read in almost any travel agency in the country.  Between the two settlements there are only 12 kilometers that can be overcome by intercity bus, as well as with the help of numerous fixed-route taxis. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A railroad passes through the city, on which most of the trains stopping in Adler and Sochi.  Those who plan to travel by plane can fly to Adler airport, and from there go to Dagomys by shuttle bus or by train.  Bus service is very developed here: you can leave from here to all large settlements of the Krasnodar Territory. </p><h2>  How did a small town turn into a resort? </h2>

    <p>  The town itself appeared in the second half of the XIX century thanks to the military, who at that time fought for the Caucasus.  The colonialists of the region began to develop tea production on the newfound land.  After one of the sites was acquired by Nicholas II, the popularity of the city of Dagomys, reviews of which are found only purely positive, increased significantly. </p><p>  As of 2015, about 30 thousand people live in the village, all of them are engaged in entertaining and serving those who come here to rest.  Part of the population follows the centuries-old traditions of their ancestors and continues to engage in the cultivation and processing of tea with its subsequent sale.  The city is very densely built up, so you can build your own housing here only on the outskirts, and even then only after obtaining all the necessary permits and documents. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to stay? </h2>

    <p>  If you want to relax by the sea, feel free to choose the ‚ÄúOlympic Dagomys‚Äù complex: reviews about this guest house are full of mentions of proximity to the coast.  This is one of the most popular resort institutions in the region, where more than 10 thousand guests relax annually.  Located 500 meters from the sea, the boarding house can simultaneously accept up to 800 vacationers. </p><p>  Everyone will be helped to make sure of the high quality of the services provided at the Olimpiysky Dagomys boarding house, the reviews of those who have already visited it.  Despite the fact that this is a three-star hotel, it is one of the best institutions in the city, if we compare them in terms of price-quality ratio.  The complex is quite spacious, which is why you can come here at any time and purchase a ticket from the administrator.  Problems with accommodation, as a rule, do not arise, since management always keeps some of the rooms reserved in case of unforeseen situations. </p><h2>  And if you need to improve your health? </h2>

    <p>  If you are recovering from an injury, surgery, illness, or just decided to put your health in order, pay attention to the Dagomys health complex - reviews of local high-class thalassotherapy have long been distributed throughout the country.  A key feature of this comprehensive treatment using mud, water, air and algae is that anyone can use it.  For the passage of this therapy does not need any recommendations from the attending physician, which is very convenient. </p><p>  Wellness complex "Dagomys", reviews of which are purely positive, differs from all others in that it allows you to be treated without having to live in a local hotel.  It is allowed to purchase a course of treatment or even some separate procedures.  Pediatricians advise parents to bring small children to Dagomys, since it is here that the most high-quality conditions are created for the restoration and strengthening of the young body. </p><h2>  What else to do in Dagomys? </h2><p>  You definitely can not call the <span>rest in Dagomys</span> monotonous <span>.</span>  Reviews of local restaurants and other entertainment venues are a direct confirmation of this.  In addition, local residents will certainly advise you to visit the Caucasus Nature Reserve and <span>Mount Fisht,</span> which offers stunning views of local beauty. </p><p>  A large number of tourists annually goes to the village of Solokhaul - it is a kind of local history museum located on an open area.  According to legend, it was there that women who had divorced their husbands, but did not begin to search for a second half, had previously lived there.  Locals are also advised to go fishing.  The mountain rivers that flow through Dagomys, however, are not very rich in catch, but you can still catch a couple of fish. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2>

    <p>  If we talk about the city of Dagomys, the reviews of its guests will be far ambiguous.  Many tourists note the excessive hospitality of local residents, which, in their opinion, sometimes borders on obsession and impudence.  However, any conflict situation arising here can be easily settled, because this is strictly monitored by law enforcement agencies. </p><p>  If you want to truly enjoy the mountain air, warm climate and sunlight, be sure to go to Dagomys.  Reviews of vacationers are often advised to do this.  Tourists call the main advantage of the city the sea coast, where you can not only swim, but also have fun, since the tourist infrastructure is very developed here: boats, yachts, deck chairs, etc. are available for rent. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The next city you can go to when visiting Dagomys is Sochi.  Reviews of him, as one of the most expensive megalopolises in the country, annually force thousands of Russians to personally come there and see for themselves.  However, if the prospect of spending all your savings deferred on vacation does not please you, you can stay in Dagomys: a large number of attractions, cultural institutions will allow you to spend time with benefit both for the body and for the soul. </p><p>  Most often they come here either on a tour or a ‚Äúsavage‚Äù.  It is difficult to say which of these options is better, it all depends on your personal perception and budget.  The main difference is that if you are traveling on a package tour, you can count on discounted tours.  But in the second case, each visit to any institution will have to pay in full.  However, the likelihood that you will meet here a hospitable local who wants to show you everything for free is very high, so if this happens, be polite and considerate in return.  Have a nice rest! </p>
