    <h2>  Description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Arabian Park Hotel 3 *, like many other hotels in the United Arab Emirates, is new.  He received his first visitors only eleven years ago and is still very popular among tourists from all over the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel belongs to the category of urban, so it can not boast of a large and beautiful territory.  From reviews of Arabian Park Hotel 3 * (Dubai), you can get an idea that the hotel area is not suitable for pleasant evening walks, although it surprises with beautiful trees and exotic flowers.  However, in many places, emerald green is scorched by the sun and looks dry. </p><p>  Arabian Park Hotel is one seven-story building, which houses three hundred and eighteen rooms of various categories.  All of them are equipped with the latest technology and have everything you need for a comfortable stay. </p><p>  The hotel complex is chosen not only by our compatriots, but also by Europeans, who value comfort and low cost of living. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  Location Arabian Park Hotel 3 * - Dubai.  The hotel is not located in the very center of the city, other hotel complexes and numerous shopping centers are lined up around it.  Three years ago, if you focus on reviews about the Arabian Park Hotel 3 *, the hotel was surrounded by construction sites.  Which, of course, really hindered the rest of tourists.  To date, the situation has changed for the better, and guests respond with great enthusiasm about what surrounds them during their holidays. </p><p>  Our compatriots note that from <span>Dubai</span> International <span>Airport</span> to Arabian Park Hotel 3 * can be reached in just ten minutes.  And the most famous shopping centers are located just five minutes drive from the hotel.  This allows tourists to travel independently by public transport, however, walking around the city brings great pleasure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also nearby the hotel complex is a children's amusement park and a dolphinarium.  These facts often become decisive for couples traveling to Dubai with their children.  Despite the fact that they have practically nothing to do in the hotel itself, there will simply be an incredibly interesting world around the kids that is so nice to discover. </p><p>  Arabian Park Hotel 3 * (Dubai) is located in Jadaf, this area is considered the most quiet and calm, as well as rapidly developing.  There are a lot of inexpensive cafes where tourists will be offered a wide selection of dishes of European and Oriental cuisine. </p><h2>  A few words about the beaches </h2><p>  Arabian Park Hotel 3 * is located quite far from the sea, in the tourist catalogs write that it is located on the third coastline.  But this does not spoil the rest, because tourists get access to a large number of beaches that are in Dubai. </p><p>  It is nice that guests can use the free shuttle service to the sea.  Although many prefer to rent a car and explore the resort's beaches on their own.  They are located at different distances from the hotel complex: </p><ul><li>  "Jumeirah" - twelve kilometers. </li><li>  Al Mamzar is thirteen kilometers away. </li><li>  Dubai Marina is twenty-nine kilometers. </li><li>  ‚ÄúSail‚Äù - fifteen kilometers. </li></ul><p>  Some guests try to use taxi services, but it comes out quite expensive.  A day will have to spend at least six hundred rubles on traveling around Dubai, not all vacationers are ready for such expenses. </p><p>  All beaches in the resort are well equipped, so we will not evaluate their condition.  In addition, each tourist chooses a beach area for themselves, focusing on their own preferences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  In our article you can see photos of Arabian Park Hotel 3 *, but they do not give a complete picture of the hotel territory and its infrastructure.  In addition, guests rarely mention it, preferring the characteristics of the number of rooms and the quality of food in the restaurant.  Therefore, we will try to describe in as much detail as possible what you should expect from this hotel complex. </p><p>  The hotel has a large swimming pool, around it there is a relaxation area with sun loungers and parasols.  Usually there are not too many vacationers, because they prefer to spend time on excursions or at sea. </p><p>  The guests with great pleasure describe the restaurant and bar Arabian Park Hotel 3 *, here you can always eat and find something suitable for a small child.  The cooks at the hotel are fiction and always pay great attention to the wishes of the guests. </p><p>  You can keep fit in the fitness center.  It is free for guests of the hotel complex and can please with an abundance of modern simulators. </p><p>  I would like to talk about the employees at the reception separately.  None of the staff speaks Russian, but each employee is extremely attentive to the requests of the guests, and with some knowledge of English you can always understand each other.  It is worth noting that tourists are very polite even when their stay at the hotel is over.  Guests write that in cases where they had to fly by an evening flight, the administrators allowed them to use the free luggage storage and changing room where the shower is located.  Such a humane attitude cannot but provoke positive comments about the rest. </p><p>  At the reception you can change the currency, rent a car and book a tour.  Employees with a constant smile will select a tour for you, taking into account the price category and preferences.  Many tourists purchase excursions at agencies on the streets of Dubai. </p><p>  A conference room and a business center are available for guests.  All services provided there are paid, but many guests noticed that the hotel staff are highly professional and can prepare almost any event. </p><p>  Please note that smoking is not allowed on site.  For this, special places are equipped, for non-compliance with the rule you can get a serious fine. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  Arabian Park Hotel 3 * (Dubai) has only three stars, but in some comments, guests say that the hotel is worthy of four stars.  So in the future he will probably increase his status. </p><p>  First of all, guests note the excellent work of Wi-Fi, it catches in all rooms and on the territory of the hotel. </p><p>  If guests want to get into the room earlier than the time specified in the rules of residence, then they can pay for early check-in.  In this case, tourists will be in their apartments immediately after arriving at the hotel. </p><p>  Vacationers can use the laundry, dry cleaning and ironing services at any time of the day.  Thanks to the hotel staff, tourists will always look great and wear fresh clothes. </p><p>  The hotel provides two types of transfers.  Free transport provides a route to the sea and to the main attractions of Dubai.  This is very beneficial, because tourists save significant amounts of money on moving.  A paid shuttle can be booked for meeting at the airport.  It is worth noting that this service is very popular. </p>

    <p>  Cleaning is done daily.  It includes a change of towels and bed linen.  Russian tourists in their reviews more than once wrote that the maids are very diligent and work in good faith. </p><p>  The only drawback that guests noticed in the rooms of the Arabian Park Hotel 3 * (UAE, Bur Dubai) is poorly regulated air conditioning.  Many complain that the room is very cold, but it does not work to make warmer.  However, this is a hallmark of the country.  In all public institutions, air conditioners operate at full capacity, so tourists often catch a cold. </p>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  From reviews of Arabian Park Hotel 3 * (Dubai), you can make an opinion about the concept of food in the hotel.  Most guests purchase packages with breakfast included.  Vacationers with children take breakfast and dinner.  Usually this is quite enough, because you can have lunch in a cafe. </p><p>  The food in the hotel is very tasty, it is noteworthy that meat lovers and vegetarians can find something suitable for themselves.  It is very pleasant that the chef often offers various compliments to the kids.  Sometimes it can be a light dessert, fruit or pastries.  This attitude towards children is observed throughout the hotel. </p><p>  Of course, our compatriots say that food is not too diverse.  However, for a three-star hotel, chefs try very hard and always take into account the wishes of the guests.  Surprisingly, the restaurant always has a very large selection of fruits.  This is unusual for Arab hotels.  In addition, tourists note that fruits are often served whole, so guests take with them an apple, pear or banana to the beach.  This is not prohibited by hotel policies. </p><p>  It seemed to some guests that the food was a bit monotonous and boring on the third day.  Therefore, they advise taking breakfast only, and the rest of the time eating in a cafe. </p><h2>  Cost of tours </h2><p>  The popularity of holidays in the <span>United Arab Emirates is</span> often due to the low cost of trips.  Residents of Moscow and nearby cities can purchase a ticket for twelve nights for only eighty thousand rubles.  This amount includes flights, breakfast and accommodation for two people. </p><p>  If you plan to relax no more than five days, then the tour will cost you only fifty thousand rubles.  This cost attracts many of our compatriots. </p>

    <h2>  Arabian Park Hotel: reviews </h2><p>  The hotel complex has many reviews.  They are quite difficult to navigate, especially for inexperienced travelers who cannot decide on a hotel to stay in.  They are often confused by the negative comments left by tourists from Russia.  Let's try to figure out what vacationers consider the minuses of a hotel: </p><ul><li>  Seclusion from the sea.  Not all tourists are ready to ride a bus to the sea and back every day.  However, the low cost of the tour speaks for itself, and you can choose this hotel only if you are calm about the constant movements around the resort. </li><li>  Inconvenient location relative to the center.  This fact is recorded in the cons by many vacationers, but do not forget that guests are provided with a free transfer to different points of the city. </li><li>  Poor breakfast.  This is usually mentioned by tourists who are accustomed to a vacation in Turkey.  But guests who know what food is in European hotels never complain about the scarcity and monotony in the Arabian Park Hotel 3 * restaurant. </li><li>  The lack of Russian-speaking staff.  For many guests this is a significant drawback, however, almost everyone knows a few basic phrases in English.  With their help, you can easily solve all the problems that arise, especially since the staff at the hotel is very friendly. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, our compatriots found quite a few minuses, but they noted several times more pluses.  Let's find out why this hotel is often recommended for holidays: </p><ul><li>  Free shuttle service.  Such a service is not always provided even in five-star hotels.  Thanks to transport from the hotel, you can go around and explore almost the entire city without spending a single dollar. </li><li>  Drinking water bottles in room.  In the UAE, it is not customary to provide tourists with free water, but the administration of this hotel complex decided otherwise, for which vacationers are very grateful to her. </li><li>  Quality housekeeping.  Almost all the guests write about it, they are impressed by the hardworking maids who help vacationers to live clean. </li><li>  An abundance of fruit.  We have already noted this fact, but tourists attribute it to the undoubted advantages, so we could not fail to indicate it in this section of the article. </li><li>  Nice pool.  It is always very calm here, and the water is crystal clear.  Therefore, mothers with children love to spend afternoon hours here in the shade of umbrellas.  Many babies even fall asleep on sunbeds. </li><li>  The comfort and cleanliness of the hotel.  It is very pleasant to be in the hotel complex, it is always clean here, and the design works in a relaxing and calming manner. </li><li>  High professionalism of employees.  Despite the lack of knowledge of the Russian language, the staff tries to take an interest in the mood of the guests and always throws a couple of simple phrases with them.  All this indicates the friendliness of all employees. </li></ul><p>  This is not the whole list of advantages of the hotel complex, in the guest reviews there are several times more.  Therefore, this hotel is actively advertised and recommended for recreation.  Our compatriots claim that of the huge number of hotels in the UAE, it is he who combines the low cost and comfort necessary to feel in standard rooms as comfortable as at home.  Not all hotels can provide such an approach, therefore Russian tourists make a choice in favor of the Arabian Park Hotel 3 *.  It is best to go here as an adult company, because in this case, tourists have the opportunity to study the resort and its attractions well.  But it will be comfortable with children at the hotel, so do not hesitate and buy a tour to this hotel complex.  You will recall this magnificent vacation in hospitable UAE for a long time to come. </p>
