According to them, the hotel rooms are spacious, bright, comfortable.  Furniture and appliances are not new, but everything is in good and working condition.  If something went wrong, then our compatriots note that after contacting the reception the issue was resolved as soon as possible.  As for the equipment of the rooms, the guests note that they have everything that is needed.  True, for example, the safe is located not in the apartment, but near the reception.  You are provided with a separate cell for free.  By the way, experienced travelers advise, just in case, to leave passports and valuables in the safe in order to avoid possible problems. </p><p>  Tourists were also satisfied with the quality of cleaning at Bayshore Resort &amp; Spa 3 * <span>(Patong, Phuket).</span>  So, according to them, the maids conducted it quite qualitatively and every day.  Towels were also changed regularly in the rooms.  Maids renew their bed linen here every three days.

    <h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Our compatriots staying at the Bayshore Resort &amp; Spa hotel speak extremely positively about its employees.  So, according to them, the staff here are very nice, friendly, attentive and helpful.  You can ask a question not only to the receptionist, but also to any hotel employee, and he will be happy to help you.  The main thing is to be polite and friendly.  As for the hotel employees' knowledge of foreign languages, then, as guests note, everyone here speaks English.  However, to the delight of our compatriots, several employees also understand the Russian language.  So you will not have any communication problems here. </p><h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  The internal rules of the Bayshore Resort &amp; Spa 3 * hotel indicate that the accommodation of newly arrived guests by numbers is carried out after two in the afternoon.  However, according to tourists who have been here, in most cases the situation is different.  So, many vacationers arrived at the hotel in the morning, but they were given room keys almost immediately, without condemning them to waiting.  This fact, I must say, very pleased travelers, especially those who came here with children.  Also note that upon check-in you will be asked to make a deposit.  Its amount is about 100 dollars.  Upon departure, the deposit will be returned to you. </p><p>  On the last day of your stay, you need to leave your room before noon.  But if your departure to the airport is planned at a later time, then you can extend your stay for a small fee or leave things at the reception, hand over the room keys and continue to relax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bayshore resort spa 3 pics" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1135878.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The price of the hotel in question includes breakfast only.  According to our compatriots, they are standard for budget hotels in Thailand.  So, in the morning you will be offered to eat with fried eggs or scrambled eggs, sausages, sandwich, juice, tea or coffee.  Breakfast is from 7:30 to 9:30 in the morning. </p><p>  During the <span>day, tourists</span> can eat in one of the many cafes and restaurants located both in the vicinity of the hotel and in the city center.  Cooked everywhere, according to travelers, is very tasty.  And the prices in most cases are reasonable.  Experienced tourists are also advised not to be afraid to buy food at mobile kiosks (macauchnas).  Many enjoyed visiting the local grocery market.  Here you can buy the freshest seafood, which will be cooked right there for a small surcharge. </p><p>  As for food and drinks, they can be purchased in one of the many shops and supermarkets in the vicinity of the hotel. </p>
