    <p>  The manufacturer did its best, and the Lenovo P70 phone got a very elegant appearance.  Straight lines in the machine are diluted with pleasant roundness.  The design turned out not only solid, but also stylish. </p><p>  The body of the gadget is made of good quality plastic.  The back cover turned out to be rather thin and, accordingly, fragile.  An unpleasant task will be to install the panel in the grooves, it will require incredible caution.  The small thickness made the lid not only fragile, but also highly susceptible to scratches. </p><p>  Although the predecessors of the Lenovo P70 were quite overall, the thickness of the device case was only 8.9 mm.  Using plastic allowed to reduce weight, but the device is still heavy - as much as 149 grams. </p><p>  The company equipped the phone with a high-capacity battery.  However, a strange feature was that the battery is non-removable.  Sure, the battery does not need to be replaced, but sometimes it is necessary to pull it out.  It is not clear what to do if the device freezes completely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Almost all external parts are in place.  So, the front part sheltered the display, front camera, speaker, company logo, touch controls and sensors.  On the right side is the volume control along with the power button.  The top end got a headset jack, and the bottom - speakers, a microphone, as well as a USB input.  The back is also quite familiar and only posted the logo, flash and camera. </p><p>  The attractive appearance of the smartphone was slightly ruined by the color.  The device is available exclusively in dark blue.  Released only for the Chinese market, the devices are still brown and white. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The installed screen is not the best for Lenovo P70.  The characteristics of the diagonal are 5 inches, but the resolution failed - only 1280 by 720 pixels, which is the minimum for this size.  Also, an IPS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãinstalled on the screen. </p><p>  Impression improves the contrast and saturation of the display.  However, there is also a miscalculation, namely, the problem in the operation of the auto-dimmer.  The owner will be forced to disable this feature and configure the device themselves. </p><p>  Incoming pixels do not particularly affect the operation of the Lenovo P70.  Although the resolution fails, the rest of the characteristics are up to par.  In addition, the phone has got a protective glass <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3. In general, the screen is enough for all needs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  But the "filling" is fully consistent with the class in which the smartphone is located.  Lenovo P70 boasts a 64-bit platform with eight cores.  The device is controlled by the MTK processor familiar to the Chinese.  Naturally, a more advanced SnapDragon would have looked much better, but this is quite enough.  Each core of the device operates at a frequency of 1.7 GHz.  For the graphics of the device, a Mali-T760 chip was installed.  And complements the overall picture of the RAM size of two gigabytes. </p><p>  Actually, claims to the power of Lenovo P70 should not arise.  Tests show that the device‚Äôs performance is slightly above average, but the smartphone will cope with almost any task.  Some problems appear in 3D games, but this is not critical.  The processor has a funny feature: when the device heats up, the "filling" on its own reduces performance. </p><p>  The gadget has 16 GB of native memory.  A small part is occupied by the system, and the owner will get about 12 GB of available space.  The user can expand the memory flash drive up to 32 GB.  With a large volume, some braking is likely to occur. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  They equipped Lenovo P70 with a good 13 megapixel camera.  The camera allows you to shoot as slightly above average.  Photos are quite acceptable, but do not cause enthusiasm. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to the front of the device.  The installed five megapixels allow the owner not only to make video calls, but also to make high-quality self-portraits.  The lack of a flash on the front camera upsets, but using the settings and filters, you can achieve acceptable photos. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The smartphone supports 2G and 3G networks.  In addition, the device also has LTE.  4G is not a special innovation for advanced phones, but the manufacturer often saves on such functions.  The device also has wifi and bluetooth. </p><p>  The presence of two SIM cards consolidates the success.  Actually, the P series is designed to help in the work, and it would be strange not to see the necessary functions in the device. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Long-term work of the gadget is supported by a 4000 maH battery.  There are no claims to the battery, because in standby mode the smartphone will live for two days.  Moderate work will reduce the time to about 12 hours.  Most consume the charge of the game and watching videos.  Using these functions, the phone will work for approximately 6-7 hours. </p><p>  You can extend the duration of the smartphone‚Äôs charge by turning off useless processes, lowering the screen brightness and using the energy-saving mode. </p><p>  It only bothers that the battery is non-removable.  In case of serious malfunctions, sometimes occurring in the "Android", the owner will not be able to restart the system by pulling out the battery. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The instructions, headset, adapter, USB cable and warranty card are supplied with the Lenovo P70.  Although plastic is solid, it will be desirable for the user to secure the device with a case.  Given the thickness of the rear panel, this will be very handy. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  The device comes with the somewhat outdated Android version 4.4.  On top of the system is the Vibe UI interface, already familiar to Lenovo users.  Along with the shell, the manufacturer has installed many applications.  Some programs will be useful, but most simply take up memory. </p><p>  The system is quite stable.  "Android" is perfectly adapted for P70 and does not cause complaints.  The only thing that is a little annoying is the placement of programs on the desktop. </p><p>  It is also expected to upgrade to the fifth version of Android.  But for now, the user will be forced to use an outdated system. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The elaborate design clearly distinguishes among the mass of Lenovo P70 devices.  Reviews express dissatisfaction with the lack of metal elements, but this is a minor minus. </p><p>  The strongest side of the gadget is its "filling."  Performance is enough for a lot of tasks, less is not worth waiting for from this class. </p><p>  A nice bonus will be both cameras of the smartphone.  High resolution and 13 megapixels are great for everyday needs.  Frontalka will also appreciate its quality. </p><p>  Capacitive battery is also a significant plus for the device.  The battery is able to provide the phone with long-term operation, and the user - independence from the outlet. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  Appearance, or rather the back cover, is a very unpleasant miscalculation for the Lenovo P70.  Owner reviews report frequent damage and many scratches to this design element. </p><p>  Instantly striking is the low resolution of the device.  The number of pixels balances on the verge of acceptable for such a diagonal.  The company supplied many of its state employees with similar screens. </p><p>  The version of "Android" will also not cause positive emotions.  Naturally, the system is quite normal, but fresh applications are not available for it. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  With the exception of some problems, the P70 smartphone was completely successful.  All characteristics are in perfect balance, and this makes the device attractive.  The phone will fulfill all the tasks set by the user. </p>
