This bloodthirsty predator had terrifyingly huge toenails.  This raptor (dinosaur) lived during the early <span>Cretaceous.</span>  The first examples of utaraptors were discovered in 1975 by Jim Jensen in the east-central part of Utah, near the city of Moab, but they did not receive much attention.  Later, Carl Limoni found a large claw from the foot.  Radiometric dating has shown that nearby fossils are about 124 million years old. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1192936" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1192936.jpg?1580634010"></div><h2>  One of the largest predators in the world </h2><p>  The raptor is a dinosaur that truly is the king of predators.  The largest of them is rightfully considered a utaraptor from the genus of therapists, which includes the largest known representatives of the dromaeosaurid family.  According to some estimates, the growth of the predator reached 7 meters in length, and the weight was not more than 500 kilograms.  The animal had large bent claws, which confirms the found preserved specimen with a length of 22 centimeters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1192938" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1192938.jpg?1580634010"></div><p>  There are convincing phylogenetic data indicating that all members of the family possessed feather cover.  Large prey was hunted in a flock.  A raptor is a dinosaur that was very agile and could probably outrun most other dinosaurs.  This nimble heavyweight could run fast, he had short but powerful legs, thanks to which he could jump out of an ambush in order to catch his powerful claws on the victim‚Äôs body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dakotaraptor </h2><p>  The research team found the <span>skeleton of a dinosaur,</span> which was named dacotaraptor.  The remains date from 66 million years ago, that is, the late Cretaceous period.  These predators are known as small, fast and agile dinosaurs.  They had stiff tails and sharp claws that helped in the hunt.  Their growth ranged within 5 meters, the dakotaraptor was among the largest and most dangerous predators.  There is no evidence of hunting in packs, the question remains open, and debate continues on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1192928" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1192928.jpg?1580634010"></div><p>  Studies have shown that some members of the family had feathers that at least partially covered the trunk.  The plumage of large species remains a topic of discussion.  Dakotaraptors do not have the so-called pen pen on the surface of the forearm.  These elements indicate the place where feathers are attached to the bones of modern birds. </p><p>  Paleontologists suggest that the presence of plumage took place, but it did not serve to fly, these species lost this ability during evolution.  Prior to this finding, it was believed that the tyrannosaurus is the most formidable predator, however, the young Rex dacotaraptor may well compete and be a formidable adversary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1192934" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1192934.jpg?1580634010"></div><h2>  Dinosaur raptor: a description of the appearance </h2><p>  It was about 2 meters high, 6 meters long.  Its skeletal structure resembles a modern turkey or chicken.  The bones were hollow but strong.  The head was rectangular in shape with powerful jaws with razor-sharp teeth.  The utaraptor had long and relatively thin upper limbs ending with three fingers with claws, of which the middle was the longest.  The long tail was used as a tool to maintain balance.  The legs were short and robust, with four toes on each foot. </p><p>  The first toe was never used anywhere, the second had a retractable claw that could grow up to 24 cm in length and was covered with a layer of keratin for protection.  The third and fourth fingers were used for balance.  Perhaps the dinosaur had <span>binocular vision,</span> like an eagle.  His hearing was also excellent.  Scientists have recently discovered that predators can hear low-frequency sounds better than herbivores.  They are able to smell prey per kilometer.  Feathers covered arms, legs, tail, and the rest of the body was under dense fluff. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1192933" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1192933.jpg?1580634010"></div><h2>  Raptor Weapon </h2><p>  The largest raptor is a dinosaur, which, in addition to size, had many extremely dangerous weapons.  His first weapon was the brain.  Utahraptor was a true master strategist.  His second weapon is the claws that he used to grab and tear his prey, as well as get the best piece of meat.  The third combat weapon was his second finger with a deadly claw, which he used to stab his victim, falling into the <span>jugular vein</span> or spine, causing paralysis or instant death. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1192930" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1192930.jpg?1580634010"></div><p>  The sharp teeth in his jaw were weapons that were used to tear and eat prey.  The decisive role in the hunting process was played by the tail, used for balance during the pursuit of prey.  The predator's menu was not complicated, as a rule, they hunted for everything that was available to them.  Due to the fact that their habitats were characterized by an arid climate, animals had to drink a large amount of fresh water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1192932" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1192932.jpg?1580634010"></div><h2>  Varieties of raptors </h2><p>  What types of raptors - dinosaurs that belong to the dromaeosaurids family - are distinguished? </p><p>  <em>Deinonychus</em> , whose name translates as ‚Äúterrible claws‚Äù.  The fossils of this predator were found in America, according to rough estimates, their age is 110 million years.  This is a small beast, whose growth did not exceed 3 meters. </p><p>  <em>Velotserapator</em> ("fast thief").  These predators were very small in size, the size of a modern turkey. </p><p>  Also stand out: utaraptor (‚Äúthief from Utah‚Äù), microraptor (‚Äúlittle thief‚Äù), pyroraptor (‚Äúfire thief‚Äù), dromeosaurus (‚Äúrunning lizard‚Äù).  The Austroraptor (‚Äúsouthern thief‚Äù) was similar in size to the utaraptor. </p><p>  The Sinornithosaurus (Chinese poultry lizard) and Rachonavis resembled birds rather than dinosaurs. </p>
