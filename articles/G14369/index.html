The shape of the crafts is also different.  Recently, such art has gained extraordinary popularity, in almost every house or interior of an office or a shop you can find small trees in flower pots. </p><p>  Organza toparia have a very festive and solemn appearance.  Crowns of trees are created by painstaking labor, as the craft consists of many tiny elements.  In the article, we will consider several creative ideas for the manufacture of such topiary.  We will acquaint the reader with the step-by-step stages of the work, most often used for the basis of purchased <span>foam balls,</span> cones or hearts.  If you do not have such products in the store, then from the article you will learn how to make the basis for organ topiary from organza yourself. </p><h2>  What is organza? </h2><p>  They brought such a thin but tough fabric, of course, from the East.  The original version made of natural silk was very appreciated by fashionistas.  In our time, an organza made of polyester and viscose was invented in order to reduce the cost of such a popular fabric.  Beautiful curtains, pop or evening dresses are sewn from glittering material, used for gift wrapping.  Handmade craftsmen found hard material and other uses.  This is the manufacture of a variety of crafts for interior decoration.  One of the popular products made from transparent fabric is organza topiary.  Many different types are produced in enterprises.  It is an embroidered fabric with etching, punching and laser cutting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The "chameleon" fabric sparkles beautifully in the sun, which changes colors at different viewing angles.  Since organza is a hard tissue, it is easy to make folds on its surface by simply crushing the material with your fingers.  Masters often use this effect in the manufacture of organza topiary. </p><h2>  Components of the craft </h2><p>  The structure of the artificial tree is very similar to the natural one: </p><ul><li>  He has a crown of various shapes, decorated with small glued elements.  The basis is most convenient to make commercially available <span>foam balls,</span> as in the photo below.  If the shape of the crown is different, then you can buy a cone, heart or ring. </li><li>  From the crown down the tree trunk.  In topiary, any material can be used for the rod.  It can be a simple wooden straight stick, a twisted branch with or without bark, a wire bent by a spiral, or other unusual shape.  In extreme cases, the craftsmen even use a cardboard sleeve from kitchen napkins.  Most often, this detail of the tree is also decorated with wrapping with satin ribbons, hemp rope, twine or burlap.  Sometimes the barrel is simply painted with acrylic paint. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.webareal.sk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Styrofoam Balls" class="if uuid-2549994" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2549994.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The lower part, in which the core is fixed, is most often represented by a flower pot, but the imagination has no boundaries for the selection of capacity.  You can use a large cup with a handle, a jug, a kettle, a sugar bowl, etc. How to strengthen the core in a container, we will tell you more in the course of the article further. </li></ul><h2>  How to make a foundation on your own? </h2><p>  Not in all settlements you can buy everything you need for needlework.  To make organza topiary with your own hands, you can make a ball from a crumpled newspaper.  Several sheets of the printed matter are taken and crumpled into a ball with hands.  When a dense object of a round shape is obtained, the blank is wrapped several times with simple thick threads so that the shape does not deform. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="zkan.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a ball out of paper yourself?" class="if uuid-2550035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2550035.jpg"></div><p>  The barrel is inserted far, preferably a little PVA is poured into the hole. </p><p>  There is another interesting way to make a warp using a balloon.  In the hole of the rubber product, insert the nozzle of the spray can with mounting foam and press the button.  Do not forget that a lot of foam comes out, so that they press the bottle gently and once. </p><p>  If you need a round shape, then the ball is simply suspended until the foam completely hardens.  If a heart is required for the manufacture of topiary, then it is necessary to wait until the foam begins to solidify slightly, and by pressing it to give the necessary shape.  When the base has solidified completely, the rubber ball is simply cut off with scissors and thrown away. </p><h2>  Master Class </h2><p>  Organza topiary is made by cutting the fabric into 9 x 9 or 10 x 10 cm squares and attaching the parts to the foam base.  Small "little ones" are twisted simply, but there are several ways to attach them to the base.  Let us consider in turn all the methods that were invented by the masters in working with organza.  Since the material is hard, a piece of fabric folded several times will stick out to the side, keeping its shape well. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Small organza mushrooms" class="if uuid-2550017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2550017.jpg"></div><p>  Folds need to be folded as follows: the squares are bent diagonally, however, the angles do not have to coincide completely, then folding is repeated again.  Small elements are glued to the base in various ways.  Let's consider them further. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Methods of attaching fungi to the base </h2><p>  There are several of them: </p><ul><li>  Using clear Crystal or Titanium glue and toothpicks.  A hole is made in the center of the folded squares of the organza and a toothpick is inserted.  Then a drop of glue is applied to the foam ball and a toothpick with a small stick is injected into this place.  The fact is that these types of glue do not work instantly, so the inserted toothpicks will help keep the fabric in one place.  Subsequently, they are simply pulled and thrown away. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="nwhistorycourse.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful organza topiary" class="if uuid-2550005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2550005.jpg"></div><ul><li>  If a glue gun is available, then the lumps are attached to a drop of hot glue with a felt-tip pen inserted in the middle of the fabric square.  It is enough to hold lightly so that the element adheres firmly to the foam. </li><li>  You can tie the bottom of each pound with a satin ribbon on a beautiful bow.  Then they immediately paste such a "bouquet".  Such details look original. </li></ul><h2>  Crown decoration </h2><p>  The craftsmanship from such a fabric looks impressive on its own, but usually masters add small decorative elements that harmoniously blend with a plain fabric.  Organza and bead topiary is the easiest way to decorate crafts.  Artificial flowers, <span>roses made of foamiran</span> or satin ribbons, small bright bouquets are often inserted between the pounds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY organza topiary" class="if uuid-2549989" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2549989.jpg"></div><p>  In the photo above, the master went even further and made braided braids from a wire with a bead on top.  Hanks of two contrasting ribbons twisted using the quilling technique also look spectacular.  Voids fill simple pieces of bright satin ribbon folded in half.  The topiary stem is also wrapped with a ribbon matching the decorative elements. </p><h2>  How to strengthen the rod in the pot? </h2><p>  What do you make a rod for a topiary of, you already know, let's consider how to strengthen it well so that the crafts can be transferred from place to place without fear, without risking dropping the crown or losing the pot along the way. </p><p>  The most reliable mount is fixing the stick with a mixture of gypsum powder and water.  The solution is kneaded in an enamel bowl to a thick sour cream.  After the stick is inserted vertically in the center of the pot, pour the solution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to strengthen the rod?" class="if uuid-2550034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2550034.jpg"></div><p>  So that in the process of solidification the stick does not "go" sideways, you need to make a cardboard circle with a hole in the middle where the rod is inserted.  After hardening, the cardboard is simply cut off with scissors. </p><h2>  Holiday crafts </h2><p>  White organza topiary has a very elegant and solemn appearance.  These trees can decorate the wedding hall.  After making and attaching pounds from the fabric, you can decorate the craft with any colors and shades.  Beautiful - attach roses and beads of gold color, as in the photo in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="White Organza Topiary" class="if uuid-2549990" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2549990.jpg"></div><p>  Beautifully decorated and flower pot.  Gypsum is hidden under a layer of sisal threads, a bird of paradise with a feather tail sits on the edge, and gold-colored plastic feathers are inserted with a stick.  Decorating a white organza can be absolutely any color, a combination of two contrasting ones will look spectacular. </p><h2>  Topiary "Heart" </h2><p>  Foam crown in the shape of a heart is traditionally decorated with red or pink colors.  In addition, three roses adorn the craft, golden beads glued directly to the fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Topiary heart" class="if uuid-2550026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2550026.jpg"></div><p>  The rod is made of a thick television cable and wrapped in a white ribbon.  The stem is made of several elements.  They are beautifully curved, forming smooth bends in waves.  Roses are glued at some ends of the wire, and the rest are twisted with curls.  At the place where the crown is attached to the wire, a red satin ribbon bow is tied. </p><p>  The topiary bottom is very original decorated.  A semicircle is cut from the foam and pasted with organza pounds, as well as a heart.  You can give such an organza topiary by February 14 to your soulmate, showing your feelings in full.  A simple ‚ÄúValentine‚Äù card can get lost in a drawer, and a beautiful tree will delight you for many years, recalling the happy days spent with your loved one. </p>
