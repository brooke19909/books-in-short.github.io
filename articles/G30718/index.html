It tells about the evolutionary theory of the organic world.  The scientist believed that changes within species occur randomly and the extinction of organisms depends on their ability to adapt.  It was after a five-year voyage on the Beagle that Darwin developed his groundbreaking theory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Charles Darwin. Shrewsbury Library Statue" class="if uuid-2513430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2513430.jpg"></div><h2>  His Majesty's Ship </h2><p>  In the Royal Navy of Great Britain, this was the second of eight Beagle ships (HMS Beagle).  The name was the breed of hunting dogs, popular among the English nobility.  The order for its construction was given in June 1818 at the Woolwich shipyard, but the ship was launched only in May 1820. The cost amounted to 7803 British pounds, which in translation to today's rate is 600 thousand. </p><p>  Initially, the ship was designed as a brig sloop, but in 1825 it was converted into a bark for scientific research expeditions. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="OTo1X9EzFDQ" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTo1X9EzFDQ" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/3/8/3/7/3837.jpg"></div><h2>  Travel itinerary </h2><p>  On the morning of December 27, 1831, a crew of seventy-three people set sail from Plymouth Harbor on a Beagle ship.  Captain Robert Fitzroy in his notes noted that the ship leaves England, fully provided with everything necessary for the upcoming trip.  All that he requested from the Admiralty was provided. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The direction chosen for travel was a popular ship route in the 19th century.  The Beagle headed south; on January 16, 1832, it reaches <span>the Cape Verde Islands.</span>  Sailing to Cape Horn, moving along the coast of South America, then November 21 anchors off the island of Chiloe.  The next point on the route is the Galapagos Archipelago, after which the ship crosses the Pacific Ocean, heading to Sydney (Australia). </p><p>  Bark swims across the Indian Ocean, and arrives in Mauritius on April 29, 1836.  On its route were Cape Town (South Africa), St. Helena and the Brazilian coast - the city of Bahia de los Santos.  The journey is nearing completion, after the Azores the expedition heads back to England. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eniscuola.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Expedition route" class="if uuid-2513389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2513389.jpg"></div><h2>  South America </h2><p>  Darwin spent most of his research on the southern coast of the continent, where Argentina and Chile are today.  It was in Latin America that the natural scientist made discoveries that influenced his subsequent work. </p><p>  Near Rio de Janeiro, many samples of plants, insects and animals were collected.  The scientist spent a couple of weeks in a small cottage located near Mount Corcovado.  He was engaged in the packaging and preservation of finds, wrote notes and letters to England. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When studying Punta Alta, the scientist‚Äôs prey was the fossil of an animal unknown to him.  She was on a cliff of rock, below the layer of sea shells.  After this discovery, Darwin pondered the questions: "What is the reason for the absence of such animals in South America?"  and "Does the environment affect their extinction?" </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mineralien-fossilienfreunde-inntal.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Petrified Ammonite" class="if uuid-2513402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2513402.jpg"></div><h2>  Galapagos Archipelago </h2><p>  Scientists describe it as a unique, scientifically important and biologically outstanding object on Earth.  Today Turtle Islands are one of the most popular holiday destinations among tourists.  It was here that Darwin personally saw the effects of evolution in isolation.  For example, from which part of the archipelago a turtle sailed, it was easy to find out from its shell. </p><p>  The expedition visited only four islands, but the information gathered was enough for the naturalist to find confirmation of his theory.  He called the Galapagos "a small world in the middle of a large." </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kimkim.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Galapagos tortoise" class="if uuid-2513321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2513321.jpg"></div><h2>  Arriving in England </h2><p>  On October 2, 1836, the ship completed a voyage around the world, which lasted 4 years, 9 months and 5 days.  Anchored in the city of Falmouth (England), where Darwin immediately went to Shrewsbury.  There he met with his family, and spent the next day sending out letters to his friends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shrewsbury. The house where Charles Darwin was born." class="if uuid-2513425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2513425.jpg"></div><h2>  The fate of the Beagle </h2><p>  The ship participated in three more expeditions.  In 1845, it was converted into a coast guard vessel to control shipping routes off the coast of Essex.  In 1870 it was sold to Messrs. Murray and Trainer for analysis. </p><p>  In 2000, Robert Prescott, a professor at the Scottish University of St Andrews, began searching for the Beagle.  And he is absolutely sure that he found it, because the research on the possible location of the dock was successful.  Under the mud, in the estuary of Essex, traces of tree species and an ancient anchor of the 1841 model were discovered.  The image of the GPR shows a ship that is similar in size to a 27-meter brig. </p><p>  In December 2011, it announced the creation of the first full-scale copy of the ship at the Nao Victoria Museum.  Notofagus is used for construction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reconstruction in progress" class="if uuid-2513292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2513292.jpg"></div><h2>  The Diaries and Notes of Charles Darwin </h2><p>  While traveling on a Beagle ship, a naturalist filled innumerable notebooks.  They contain information and significant facts about the animal and plant world, which he investigated.  More than 1,500 different species were transported to his home during the voyage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.utas.edu.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Darwin Geology Memorandum Page" class="if uuid-2513409" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91394/2513409.jpg"></div><p>  Scientists note that the records are very detailed, they contain many important details.  Darwin kept his diary from the beginning of the voyage, and from the first pages the author is interested in theoretical questions.  He often re-read it, after which he reworked his theories, taking into account the new information received. </p>
