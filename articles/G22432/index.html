The powerful and majestic Brandenburg Gate in Berlin is a model of classicism in Germany.  They were erected in 1788-1791 by order of <span>Frederick William the Second</span> - King of Prussia.  The author of the monument is the architect Karl Gottard Langhans, and he led the construction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brandenburg Gate" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/149725.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The building was originally called the Gate of the World.  Their facade was painted white.  He adorned him and designed a six-meter quadriga, controlled by the goddess of Victory - Victoria, Gottfried Shadov.  After Napoleon conquered Berlin, he dismantled the chariot and transported it to Paris, but when his troops were defeated, the goddess Victoria returned to her rightful place and was ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù with the Iron Cross created by Friedrich Schinkel. </p><p>  In the early nineties of the nineteenth century the Brandenburg Gate was met by victorious soldiers, in 1918‚Äì1920 counterrevolutionary soldiers passed through them, and in the forties of the twentieth century they became the scene of national socialist holidays. </p><p>  In World War II, the Brandenburg Gate was seriously damaged after the <span>capture of Berlin.</span>  In May 1945, on the quadriga, which was completely destroyed, the banner of the Soviet Union fluttered and a huge portrait of Comrade Stalin was erected. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the year nineteen fifty-sixth, the damaged Brandenburg Gate began to be rebuilt, and in 1961 they were mounted in the built Berlin Wall, which mercilessly divided the city into two parts: eastern and western.  In 1989, when the Berlin Wall was destroyed, the gates opened and Chancellor <span>Helmut Kohl</span> entered <span>,</span> meeting Hans Modrow <span>, a</span> colleague from East Germany.  Since then, the Bradenburg Gate has been a <span>symbol of peace</span> and unity of the city and country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brandenburg Gate Photo" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/149723.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 2000, the monument was closed for restoration, which lasted two years.  Today, the Brandenburg Gate (photo) decorates Berlin again. </p><p>  Of course, all of Germany is proud of this famous monument.  Berlin, whose sights are of historical, cultural and architectural value for the whole country, is impossible to imagine without the Brandenburg Gate.  Today, the Hall of Silence, which is located in the guardhouse, does not forget about the past here.  Berliners and guests of the capital come here to remain silent and think about the tragic past of Germany. </p><p>  The Brandenburg Gate is a magnificent landmark of Berlin and its visiting card.  This is a masterpiece of architectural art, which for many decades has attracted tourists from all over the world.  Coming to Berlin and not visiting this monument means not seeing the heart of Germany.  Today, the Brandenburg Gate fits perfectly into the city and is completely inseparable from the buildings of Paris Square, where they are located. </p><p>  This is Berlin's most recognizable landmark.  They are located in the center of the capital and adjoin the <span>Linden Alley,</span> connecting them with the former royal residence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Germany Berlin Attractions" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/149727.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Today, a magnificent monument is in danger.  At the beginning of the twenty-first century, construction of the next line of the Berlin metro began near it, and the gate got a crack.  Now they are waiting for another major reconstruction. </p>
