Photosynthesis: light and dark phases</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How to explain such a complex process as photosynthesis, briefly and clearly?  Plants are the only living organisms that can produce their own food.  How do they do it?  For growth and <span>development, plants</span> receive all the necessary substances from the environment: carbon dioxide from the air, water and <span>nutrients</span> from the soil.  They also need energy that comes from the sun.  This energy triggers certain chemical reactions during which carbon dioxide and water turn into glucose (nutrition) and <span>oxygen.</span>  <span>This</span> is photosynthesis.  Briefly and clearly, the essence of the process can be explained even to school-age children. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photosynthesis is concise and clear" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1296569.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  "Together with the light" </h2><p>  The word "photosynthesis" comes from two Greek words - "photo" and "synthesis", a combination of which in translation means "together with the light."  In the <span>process of photosynthesis,</span> solar energy is converted into chemical energy.  The chemical equation of photosynthesis: <br><br>  6CO <sub>2</sub> + 12H <sub>2</sub> O + light = C <sub>6</sub> H <sub>12</sub> O <sub>6</sub> + 6O <sub>2</sub> + 6H <sub>2</sub> O. <br><br>  This means that 6 carbon dioxide molecules and twelve water molecules are used (together with sunlight) to produce glucose, resulting in the formation of six oxygen molecules and six water molecules.  If you depict this in the form of a verbal equation, you get the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>carbon dioxide</span> + water + sun =&gt; glucose + oxygen + water. <br><br>  The sun is a very powerful source of energy.  People always try to use it to generate electricity, warm houses, heat water, and so on.  Plants "figured out" how to use solar energy millions of years ago, because it was necessary for their survival.  Photosynthesis can be briefly and clearly explained in this way: plants use the light energy of the sun and convert it into chemical energy, which results in sugar (glucose), the excess of which is stored as starch in the leaves, roots, stems and seeds of the plant.  The energy of the sun is transmitted to plants, as well as to animals that these plants eat.  When a plant needs nutrients for growth and other vital processes, these reserves are very useful. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photosynthesis light and dark phases of photosynthesis" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1296565.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  How do plants absorb the energy of the sun? </h2><p>  Talking about photosynthesis briefly and clearly, it is worth raising the question of how plants manage to absorb solar energy.  This is due to the special leaf structure, which includes green cells - chloroplasts, which contain a special substance called chlorophyll.  It is a <span>plant pigment</span> that gives leaves a green color and is responsible for absorbing the energy of sunlight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2><br>  Why are most leaves wide and flat? </h2><p>  Photosynthesis occurs in plant leaves.  The amazing fact is that plants are very well suited for trapping sunlight and absorbing carbon dioxide.  Thanks to its wide surface, much more light will be captured.  It is for this reason that the solar panels, which are sometimes installed on the roofs of houses, are also wide and flat.  The larger the surface, the better the absorption. </p>

    <h2>  What else is important for plants? </h2><p>  Like people, plants also need healthy and nutritious substances in order to maintain health, grow and fulfill their vital functions well.  They get minerals dissolved in water from the soil through the roots.  If the soil lacks mineral nutrients, the plant will not develop normally.  Farmers often check the soil to make sure they have enough nutrients to grow crops.  Otherwise, resort to the use of fertilizers containing basic minerals for nutrition and plant growth. </p>

    <h2>  Why is photosynthesis so important? </h2><p>  Explaining photosynthesis briefly and clearly for children, it is worth saying that this process is one of the most important chemical reactions in the world.  What are the reasons for such a big statement?  First, photosynthesis feeds plants, which, in turn, feed all other living things on the planet, including animals and humans.  Secondly, as a result of photosynthesis, the necessary oxygen is released into the atmosphere.  All living things breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide.  Fortunately, plants do the opposite, therefore they are very important for humans and animals, as they give them the opportunity to breathe. </p><h2>  Amazing process </h2><p>  It turns out that plants also know how to breathe, but, unlike humans and animals, they absorb carbon dioxide from the air, not oxygen.  Plants also drink.  That's why you need to water them, otherwise they will die.  Using the root system, water and nutrients are transported to all parts of the plant body, and carbon dioxide is absorbed through small openings on the leaves.  The trigger for starting a chemical reaction is sunlight.  All obtained metabolic products are used by plants for nutrition, oxygen is released into the atmosphere.  This is how we can explain briefly and clearly how the process of photosynthesis occurs. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photosynthesis" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1297891.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Photosynthesis: light and dark phases of photosynthesis </h2><p>  The process under consideration consists of two main parts.  There are two phases of photosynthesis (description and table - hereinafter).  The first is called the light phase.  It occurs only in the presence of light in the membranes of thylakoid with the participation of chlorophyll, electron carrier proteins and the enzyme ATP synthetase.  What else hides photosynthesis?  The light and <span>dark phases of photosynthesis</span> succeed each other as day and night <span>come</span> (Calvin cycles).  During the dark phase, the production of the very glucose, food for plants.  This process is also called a reaction independent of light. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  <em>Light phase</em> </td><td>  <em>Dark phase</em> </td></tr><tr><td><p>  1. Reactions occurring in chloroplasts are possible only in the presence of light.  In these reactions, the energy of light is converted into chemical energy </p><p>  2. Chlorophyll and other pigments absorb energy from sunlight.  This energy is transmitted to photosynthesis systems. </p><p>  3. Water is used for electrons and hydrogen ions, and is also involved in the production of oxygen </p><p>  4. Electrons and hydrogen ions are used to create ATP (energy storage molecule), which is needed in the next phase of photosynthesis </p></td><td><p>  1. The reactions of the extralight cycle occur in the stroma of chloroplasts </p><p>  2. Carbon dioxide and energy from ATP are used as glucose </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  From the foregoing, the following conclusions can be drawn: </p><ul><li>  Photosynthesis is a process that allows you to receive energy from the sun. </li><li>  The light energy of the sun is converted into chemical energy by chlorophyll. </li><li>  Chlorophyll gives plants a green color. </li><li>  Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts of plant leaf cells. </li><li>  Carbon dioxide and water are essential for photosynthesis. </li><li>  Carbon dioxide enters the plant through tiny holes, stomata, through which oxygen leaves. </li><li>  Water is absorbed into the plant through its roots. </li><li>  Without photosynthesis, there would be no food in the world. </li></ul>
