  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Small Business Loans - A Creative Approach.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Starting your own business is not easy in principle, for this you need a special talent, abilities, which not everyone has.  Not everyone can become a businessman, especially if you live in Russia.  Almost every year, international rating agencies locate our country somewhere between Rwanda and Guinea-Bissau in the summary table of states where it is most convenient to do business.  At the same time, leaders, as a rule, do not change.  These are the so-called "Asian dragons" - countries that have made a huge breakthrough in their economic development in recent years, as well as the "old" leaders - the United States and countries of Western Europe. </p><p><br>  It‚Äôs easy to do business there, but it‚Äôs hard to talk with us for a very long time.  There is mentality, and huge distances, and administrative barriers, and corruption, and crime, and more.  All of this must be fought and, if successful, business in Russia may flourish.  However, for any entrepreneur, the most important resource, among other things, is money, funds that can be put into action. <noindex>  <span>Small Business Loans</span> </noindex>  should be affordable and affordable - this is one of the main conditions for prosperity.  In the USA, for example, local entrepreneurs have no problems with this.  A special structure, which is part of the Presidential Administration, is responsible for small business loans. <br>  In Russia, the state is also trying to help business people, but it is not very good so far.  Banks are reluctant to work with those who want to start their own business, moreover, even with experienced company managers who want to get a loan, credit organizations prefer not to get involved.  A particularly risky direction for them is loans to small businesses without collateral.  Such a loan can only be given if you have a good guarantee or a reliable guarantor.  Although usually a person who wants to start his own business does not have one or the other. </p><p><br>  While the situation seems hopeless, the Russian Government is preparing a series of measures that should make loans to small businesses affordable for many in the future.  Moreover, our leaders are well aware that government intervention in natural market processes should be extremely careful.  It‚Äôs just impossible to give out money to everyone who wants it, it‚Äôs unlikely that something good can come of it.  Therefore, it is planned to take the best world models as the basis of domestic reform. <br>  For example, in the United States, the state itself does not issue loans, but it is the guarantor and guarantor of return for the bank.  This allows you to make loans to small businesses without collateral available.  Why would the bank make excessive demands on the borrower if the government compensates your losses (if they certainly follow).  Therefore, in America, banks themselves willingly give out funds to entrepreneurs, because it is impossible to lose here.  True, the state is not ready to learn for everyone.  For Russia, with our level of corruption, this can be a serious problem: <noindex>  <span>loans under state guarantees</span> </noindex>  only "their" people can take.  So it‚Äôs not easy to transfer the American model of entrepreneurship support to solve our problems; a creative approach is needed here. </p></div></article>
