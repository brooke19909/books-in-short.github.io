    <p>  Externally, the <span>Fly IQ239</span> Era Nano 2 is very similar to devices manufactured by HTC back in 2010.  The device has a rounded shape, but with small dimensions it looks rather ridiculous.  The thickness, as much as 11.6 millimeters, does not add appeal. </p><p>  The advantage of this design is ease of use.  A miniature (compared to modern devices) phone fits perfectly in your hand.  It affects the use of low weight, only 99 grams. </p><p>  The device is made entirely of medium quality plastic.  The material definitely does not add presentability to the phone, although what is it about.  The design of the device even among the budget segment models looks strange. </p><p>  The problem for the gadget will be dirt and fingerprints.  There is no <span>oleophobic coating</span> in the device <span>,</span> and this is very noticeable.  Hoping for screen protection is also not worth it. </p><p>  But the placement of parts on the case is quite familiar.  In front of the phone is a display, controls, speaker, sensors and company logo.  Unfortunately, the user will have to forget about the front-end.  The rear panel has got a camera, logo and main speaker. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the right, on the side, is the <span>volume control,</span> on the left is the power button.  A microphone is located on the bottom end, and a USB and headphone jack is on top. </p><p>  Appearance Fly IQ239 Era Nano 2 turned out to be very Spartan.  There are no superfluous and even necessary details.  The number of colors is also very scarce.  The user is prompted to choose between black and white. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The display installed in Fly IQ239, the characteristics are absolutely not consistent with the modern device.  <span>Screen size</span> is only 3.5 inches.  In addition to a small diagonal, the resolution of 480 by 320 pixels also depresses.  Such displays were relevant five years ago, but not in 2014. </p><p>  Also equipped with a TFT-matrix device.  This significantly reduced viewing angles.  With a slight tilt, the image is greatly distorted.  In addition, the picture fades in the sun.  Actually, the brightness of the smartphone is already not enough. </p><p>  Working with the device is quite difficult, because the display is very small.  Small interface elements blur due to 165 ppi.  It‚Äôs even strange to see such a bad screen in an older device. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Equipped Fly IQ239 black with only two megapixels.  Such a camera is now found only as a front camera.  It is also expected that the resolution is 1600 by 1200 pixels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Talking about some quality is simply impossible.  Images are grainy, without detail and with a lot of noise.  It will be easier for the owner to forget about this ability of the phone than to use it. </p><p>  Frontal in the gadget is not provided at all.  Actually, the characteristics of the main camera already hint at the lack of a facial counterpart. </p><p>  In fact, the best solution would be to not install this feature.  Refusal from the camera would allow to slightly improve other parameters of the phone. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  Equipped smartphone Fly IQ239 frankly weak stuffing.  The device is controlled by the Spreadtrum SC6820 processor, which is often found in company models.  In fact, this is an analogue of the Chinese favorite MTK. </p><p>  Has Fly IQ239 black only one core with a frequency of 1 GHz.  Does not improve the picture and 256 MB of RAM.  Even a state employee such memory is not enough to perform most tasks. </p><p>  Hoping for high performance is not necessary.  The phone is able to provide simple applications and undemanding games.  It may even cause freezes in some programs. </p><p>  Depressing and the native memory of the device.  The manufacturer allocated only 512 megabytes to the user.  The owner is simply confronted with the fact of the need to purchase a flash drive.  You can expand the memory with a card up to 32 GB. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  Secures the sad "success" and "Android" in Fly IQ239.  System performance is hopelessly outdated.  The device operates on version 2.3, without any shells from the company. </p><p>  Along with Android, there is a standard set of applications from Google.  Most programs are useless, but you can remove them only by obtaining root-rights. </p><p>  The owner will not have a rich selection of applications, but even such an ancient Android supports the most necessary. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Unpretentious filling increases the duration of the Fly IQ239.  The volume characteristics of the battery are only 1100 maH, but this is quite enough.  The minimum charge consumption allows the device to stretch for two days in standby mode.  Active work will reduce the time to 8 hours of work.  The most "greedy" in the device is Wi-Fi: using it, you can put the battery in 4-5 hours.  In principle, the smartphone shows a good duration. </p><p>  Using the Fly IQ239 settings, you can disable unnecessary programs and functions, which will increase the duration of the work.  Such a solution will allow the user to win several hours of the gadget's life. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In addition to the IQ239, the user will get instructions, an adapter, a USB cable, a battery, a headset and a warranty card.  The buyer should immediately include in the price of the device and a USB flash drive. </p><h2>  Communications </h2>

    <p>  Owners of <span>Fly IQ239 will be pleased with the</span> characteristics of communication.  The smartphone supports two SIM cards and works in a standard GSM network.  In addition, there is support for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and mobile Internet. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of the phone is more than acceptable.  You can buy IQ239 for only 3 thousand rubles.  An incredibly small number of devices boasts such a low price. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The owners did not find many advantages with the device.  The main advantage, of course, is the work with two SIM cards.  For a state employee this is a great quality. </p><p>  The price was also more than attractive.  Of course, the phone lacks power, but this compensates for the cost and communication capabilities. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  Negative sides have accumulated much more.  Users complain about the poor quality small screen and awful camera. </p><p>  Separately, there is a smartphone filling.  In the hardware, there are no advantages, starting with a weak processor and ending with a small amount of RAM. </p><p>  Allocate and device memory.  Installed 512 megabytes is not enough even for the most necessary applications. </p><p>  The old version of "Android" also does not cause delight.  In addition, updates for the phone are not expected. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The smartphone is definitely outdated while still in production.  Almost all state employees have long eliminated most of the shortcomings present in IQ239, and for 2014 such characteristics are unacceptable.  Even Fly has more successful models in the same price category. </p>
