For all this, it is enough to have two manipulators, which are most common - a mouse and a keyboard.  In some cases, you can even do without the first manipulator using a special touchpad (these are installed on laptops in order to increase the compactness of the device). </p><h2>  Graphics Creation </h2>

    <p>  Today, many image files are used.  For example, various icons, images of animals, objects, people and much more.  It would be naive to believe that all these pictures are taken ready-made - most of them are created from scratch by designers by simple rendering.  And, as you understand, it is quite difficult to do this with the mouse: a person simply cannot properly coordinate his actions in such a way as to successfully translate into the graphic form of a computer what he would like to draw on paper.  To understand this thesis best, try to draw some shape yourself with the mouse - and you will see how difficult it is. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, in the world there is such a category of electronic devices as graphic tablets.  They are now quite widespread: many artists and designers have it, as well as in ordinary offices.  The cost of one such device is quite low - approximately, like an average mobile phone or e-book.  And the possibilities that it has vary depending on the model. </p><h2>  What is a graphics tablet? </h2>

    <p>  Outwardly, they resemble tablets of artists, but in fact they are an interactive panel that can receive and process data coming from the onslaught of the pen.  Thus, a person can draw anything and then get a finished image in graphic form. </p><p>  This is convenient, because in the case of paper, say, the designer cannot get the finished picture and edit it in Photoshop or Corel Draw, but the graphic tablet (Wacom Bamboo, in particular, which is the subject of today's review) supports this ability.  With it, everything that you draw "by hand" will appear in the working field of the <span>graphics editor.</span>  Further with this image it is necessary to carry out appropriate actions to adapt it for specific tasks: placement on the site, in the application or elsewhere. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wacom Bamboo Graphics Tablet </h2><p>  However, from the general concept we will pass specifically to the model of the device to which this article is devoted - Wacom Bamboo.  This graphics tablet can be called classified as budget, but, despite this, it has a fairly wide range of features. </p>

    <p>  In addition, if you take into account customer reviews about Wacom Bamboo, the build quality of the tablet as a whole can be described as high enough for such a cost.  The device copes with its tasks, which is why it can be attributed not only to the category of devices for home use, but also to serious design tools used in a <span>professional environment.</span> </p><h2>  Action transmission mechanism </h2><p>  Special attention should be paid to the mechanism responsible for transmitting user actions.  The Wacom Bamboo graphic tablet is actually <span>an interactive whiteboard</span> with a height of only 11 millimeters, having a work surface measuring 14 by 9 centimeters.  The user, in order to draw a picture and receive it in the form of an image on an electronic medium, must outline it on a specified work surface. </p>

    <p>  This, in turn, is done using the Wacom Bamboo Pen.  It comes complete with a tablet and serves as a pen.  In addition to the fact that the user has the ability to draw any figures, he can transfer any information in electronic form.  Such a pen also makes it possible to adjust the thickness of the lines by changing the pressure on the surface of the tablet.  As indicated in the official specifications of the device, it recognizes up to 1024 degrees of force pressing the stylus.  Simply put, by pressing harder or weaker, the designer is able to modify the trace of the pen. </p><p>  It should also be noted that the special software that comes with the kit also has different settings for the graphic trace.  This means that the user can adjust the thickness of the line, the degree of transparency, sensitivity, the mode of interaction with the computer and other parameters. </p><h2>  PC connection </h2><p>  Obviously, since the Wacom Bamboo graphic tablet is used to transfer data to the computer from the ‚Äúsheet‚Äù into electronic form, this will require the connection of this device.  This is ensured by the microUSB cable, the connector for which is provided in the tablet. </p>

    <p>  In addition to a physical connection, a user who wants to work with a tablet must take care of the appropriate software.  This is the driver for Bamboo Wacom, which is also included.  Its installation is a standard procedure by which all software for working with plug-in devices is downloaded.  The role of the driver is to make the computer recognize the device and with the latter you can comfortably work properly. </p><h2>  Scope of application </h2><p>  Speaking about graphic tablets, it is necessary to clarify the scope of their application, since not all ordinary users know why these devices are needed.  In addition to creating images (drawing graphics, drawing some finished objects, modeling sketches), Wacom Bamboo graphic tablet can also be used in office work to create a signature.  Recently, additional tools for protecting rights and personal data, such as electronic signatures, have appeared.  In order to apply it, a person needs to create a sample of his signature (individual protection system) and transfer it to a digital form. </p><p>  Another graphic tablet Wacom Bamboo Touch can be used for navigation as a mouse, endowed with a lot more features.  They can work with a huge amount of data, and with graphs in particular.  Everything that could not be imagined when working with a familiar mouse can be easily implemented with such a tablet (this applies mainly to various professional tasks).  Or, say, this can be a convenient way to take notes on your ideas. </p><h2>  Device price </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the price for a Wacom Bamboo graphic tablet is quite low.  Now it can be purchased for 3,500 rubles.  Despite the fact that this product was released about 4 years ago, it still does not lose its relevance and can serve as an excellent assistant to both the professional and the amateur in a wide variety of tasks. </p><h2>  Where to buy Wacom Bamboo? </h2>

    <p>  As noted, the Wacom Bamboo Pen is an outdated model.  Since equipment stores sell mostly the latest and trending products, most likely you will not find this model in them.  Therefore, we offer to turn our attention to the numerous online stores in which this device is still sold. </p><p>  We draw your attention to the fact that the Russian Federation has the official website of the Wacom company, which offers tablets for sale in the country.  You won‚Äôt be able to buy a device there, as this resource is for guidance only.  But you can download a driver or a new drawing lesson to your Bamboo Wacom. </p>
