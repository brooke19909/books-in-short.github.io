Smartphones with a fingerprint scanner</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The first smartphone to receive a fingerprint scanner was the iPhone 5S.  After some time, other manufacturers began to use a similar function in devices of the middle price category.  At the moment, the scanner can already be found even in budget options.  In the article, we will consider the most interesting phones with the described function. </p><h2>  iPhone 6S Plus </h2><p>  What can be said about the appearance of this model?  This phone looks the same as the previous modification - iPhone 6s.  The difference between the two is that the ‚Äúolder‚Äù model has large dimensions.  The two phones are identical when viewed together.  Buyers do not call this a flaw.  In general, the manufacturer has always succeeded in a good design that plays with interesting notes, which pleases the owners for several years. </p><p>  Because of the frames near the display, the phone seems frivolous, they stand out especially strongly in white on the front.  This part is different from the design of the screen on the iPhone 5S.  The weight of the device has become noticeably more than it was before.  Dimensions are increased slightly (thickness by 0.2 cm, width - 0.1 cm), and weight - by 20 grams.  The total mass of the device was 192 g. The difference seems to be insignificant, but when using a smartphone it is very felt.  But in general, the operation is quite comfortable and convenient.  Owners of the iPhone 6S Plus do not consider this factor a minus. </p><p>  The company is too concerned that it wants to increase the size of the phone, so ergonomics have suffered.  Sometimes it‚Äôs inconvenient to use the side keys - they are too high.  And if the lock button is not used very often, then due to the constant pressure on the ‚Äúswing‚Äù of the volume, which are difficult to reach, the person spoils the impression of a smartphone.  A similar problem was with the iPhone 5S screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The case is made of quality materials.  The side panels and the back are made of aluminum.  There is a special <span>protective glass</span> on the screen <span>.</span>  The assembly is at the highest level, there are no complaints about it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fingerprint phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2007570.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge </h2><p>  The appearance of this smartphone with a fingerprint scanner was created on the basis of phones S6 Edge and S6 Edge +.  However, the company managed to combine all the ideas in such a way that the design did not repeat and had some differences - its own characteristics.  On the front part, you can see that the bend is visible not only from the side, but also from above and below. </p><p>  With this, the South Korean manufacturer was able to raise the level of assembly of the phone.  New technologies have been applied.  There is practically no gap between the metal and glass frame.  It may seem that the latter material flows and is complemented by a solid insert.  Due to this, the panel looks much better, it is more accurate. </p><p>  The back of the phone with a fingerprint is also made of glass.  On the sides it bends.  A similar solution has already been found in the Galaxy Note 5 device. In the same model, it proved to be much better. </p><p>  So, what is the new design of this phone?  The manufacturer used his old achievements, made them more powerful and used them all together in one device.  The smartphone really looks great, attracts the eye, does not bother, and it‚Äôs a pleasure to operate it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The case has rounded edges, so they are not sharp.  However, the phone did not become worse from such a decision.  The metal is rough, so holding the device in your hand is much easier.  It is difficult to call glass tenacious.  Although it is covered with oleophobic material, however, fingerprints are easily collected.  To remove them from the surface, just wipe with a small cloth. </p><p>  The size of the gadget is 15 √ó 7.2 √ó 0.7 cm. The device weighs 157 g. It is much smaller than many other 5.5-inch devices.  The screen occupies only 80% of the surface of the phone.  Due to the curved display, it may seem as if there are no frames.  There is a protrusion needed to protect the screen. </p><p>  This smartphone is not much different from previous options - it also has a fingerprint scanner.  It is located in the "Home" key.  It is difficult not to notice it, since it is located under the screen.  The button is large, it is easy to press on it.  The scanner works perfectly - the response is instant.  It works even when touched with a wet finger - the device is waterproof. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphones with fingerprint scanner" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2007571.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro </h2><p>  The phone described below is not much different from the Redmi Note 3 model. This modification is also sold in several color options.  The case does not disassemble.  There are plastic inserts on the upper and lower parts.  It is difficult to distinguish them from metal in appearance.  They are needed in order for the antennas to function well. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On top of the phone with a fingerprint, you can notice the headphone jack.  Immediately located microphone and infrared port.  On the bottom panel there is a connector for connecting ‚Äúmicro-USB‚Äù.  Next to it is the main microphone.  On the left is a slot that is needed to connect the card of a cellular operator, on the right are the on / off keys of the phone and volume control.  The buttons are touch sensitive, they are located on the main panel and do not take up much space on it. </p><p>  On the back you can see the main matrix, there is a flash right there and a fingerprint scanner is built in.  None of the listed details stands for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro smartphone case. </p><p>  The panel does not understand, so the phone creates a monolithic feeling.  Backlash and squeaks can not be present, because it is impossible to get inside the device, and accordingly, it is difficult to notice any shortcomings.  The ergonomics of the phone are ordinary.  Use it conveniently.  There are no glossy elements, the device is smooth.  It lies perfectly in the palm of your hand, does not slip and does not crash into it. </p><p>  This model, as already understood, has a scanner.  It works perfectly, recognizes quickly - this process takes no more than 0.5 seconds.  Sometimes it may not work, but, as a rule, the fact is that a person incorrectly put his finger.  This disadvantage is uncritical. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 5s screen" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2007572.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Meizu M3 Note </h2><p>  This manufacturer made it a rule to imitate Apple, respectively, potential buyers have not been surprised at this for a long time.  However, the phone, which will be discussed later, was created under the inspiration of several ‚Äúmasterpieces‚Äù.  If you look at the device, or rather, on its front part, it will resemble 6S + from the American "apple".  The back panel is similar to the Chinese Xiaomi, which we described above.  This device is often called a good phone with a fingerprint. </p><p>  The display has a size of 5.5 inches.  On the front part you can notice the speaker, front camera, sensors, as well as a key with a built-in fingerprint scanner, a notification indicator.  All this is located as conveniently as possible.  The scanner, or rather, its button, has a frame of metal.  It is recessed into the hull.  This sensor works great.  It quickly recognizes fingerprints, will not only unlock the screen, but also protect information.  The button itself also performs the function of "Home" or "Back".  This functional part will appeal to all users of the gadget who are accustomed to a small screen and constant misses on the interface elements. </p><p>  On the right of the phone with a fingerprint, you can see the keys.  They are mechanical type.  They stick out strongly from the body, the maximum stroke.  Claims to the smartphone are small - those who are used to the ‚Äúswing‚Äù of the volume located on the left side will have to relearn.  At first, many people are annoyed that when you make a call you get confused how to reduce or add sound.  Below on the device are a speaker and a microphone.  There are also screws connecting the device panel (fit perfectly into the design), and a connector for working with a USB cable.  Lot with SIM cards "nano" is on the left.  If there is no second mobile number, then you can install an external drive into the port instead. </p><p>  The back of this smartphone with a fingerprint scanner is streamlined.  It seems to many that the phone is all made of aluminum, but this opinion is erroneous.  In order for the antennas to work without failures, plastic inserts are located at the top and bottom.  They have a metal color and a matte appearance.  Masking collapses only when a person touches the surface - there is no specific chill that is characteristic of durable material.  The rest of the fixture is made of aluminum. </p><p>  On top is a camera module with a flash, you can immediately find the company logo.  The device in my hand lies perfectly.  It does not seem thick, although its width is 0.8 cm. The device weighs 163 grams.  The battery received a capacity of 4100 mAh.  There are several different colors on sale - a combination of gold, white and silver, as well as dark gray, black and white. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how does the fingerprint on the phone" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2007573.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Oneplus 3 </h2><p>  Previous versions of OnePlus stand out from the competition.  They have a distinctive appearance, especially if you disassemble the gray modifications.  They have a rough surface.  But after the second generation of the phone came out, the developers realized that it was time to change the design.  OnePlus 3 received a not very intricate design, but no less interesting.  The smartphone seems a bit like Huawei and Meizu.  But we are not talking about complete copying of the design. </p><p>  Changing the basic aspects of the appearance of the phone with a fingerprint has benefited both the company and the model itself.  The case is thin, the edges are rounded.  Thanks to this, the device lies perfectly in the hands.  Two color options are on sale: gray with a black front and gold with white. </p>

    <h2>  Phone Details </h2><p>  The manufacturer paid a lot of attention to details.  All keys are comfortable, have a great move, build quality.  A slot for SIM cards is installed.  They must be of the nano type.  The port inserted into the chassis is excellent.  The connectors and speaker are on the bottom. </p><p>  Under the screen, you can immediately notice three keys.  They are touch type.  Central, as expected, has a small depression.  This device supports fingerprint lock.  Scanner in the middle button.  Side keys are backlit.  It works when you click on them, after a couple of seconds it turns off. </p><p>  If a person wants to use the on-screen keys and he likes them more, then you can activate them in the settings.  Immediately allowed to change the order.  Above the screen are sensors along with a special indicator.  It switches its color depending on the selected setting. </p><h2>  Elephone s3 </h2><p>  The design of this inexpensive fingerprint phone has its own characteristics.  The device is recognizable, presented in various price options: black, pink, white.  The case is thin: 0.8 cm. Made of solid metal.  The case itself has a curved shape, the corners are rounded, and the chamfer is made of chrome.  It weighs a little, only 145 g. The ratio of the screen to the case is 5.2 inches.  Because of this, the device seems convenient.  It fits perfectly in the palm of your hand, does not slip out.  You can easily control with one hand.  Its successful ergonomics resembles the sixth iPhone.  However, the screen here is a bit larger. </p><p>  There is a protective glass on the front panel, you can notice a rounded edge.  Touch buttons of a separate type are not used.  Built-in on-screen - they are easy to hide with the usual swipe down. </p><p>  There is no screen frame on the sides.  More precisely, it is present, but its width (less than one millimeter) allows us to say that it is not there.  2.5D glass creates the effect of a rounded display.  The screen is actually flat type, and this adds benefits.  Thanks to this, you can use the side keys with maximum convenience. </p><p>  On the top panel there is a speaker, a front camera and two sensors.  There is no notification indicator.  The phone has all the necessary ports, outputs and slots.  On the top you can see the mini-jack, a slot for an external drive and one SIM card, or for two subscriber numbers.  Removable storage should not exceed 128 GB.  At the bottom of the phone is a loud speaker, a microphone and a port for connecting a USB cable. </p><p>  The back side received a camera, a backlight and a fingerprint sensor.  A small hole was located right there, but the manufacturer does not specify what it is.  Buyers suggest this is a noise canceling microphone. </p><p>  If we talk about design, then it should be said about the assembly.  She is of good quality.  The manufacturer did not spare the funds to create a construction of solid metal.  The body is pleasant to the touch.  It is also quite durable, so it can maintain its appearance in perfect condition for a long time. </p>

    <h2>  Ulefone power </h2><p>  Continuing the review of phones with a fingerprint scanner, it should be said about Ulefone Power.  The device weighs 200 grams and this is the first thing that people pay attention to, taking it in their hands.  For other factors, everything is standard, although the width is slightly larger than usual - 0.9 cm. </p><p>  For those people who have previously worked with large phones, this will not seem uncomfortable.  But ordinary users, whose gadgets have a screen diagonal of up to 5 inches, will have to get used to it at first.  The device is sold in several color options: white, dark blue and light with a matte panel.  Two of them (the first and second versions) have a glossy back, it is made of plastic, which is varnished.  Fingerprints remain, but they are difficult to notice. </p><p>  On the top back of the phone is the main camera, flash and a fingerprint scanner.  It works great.  It is installed as conveniently as possible, has a recess in the housing.  Sometimes he is mistaken, but especially nothing critical.  But if you compare with the Xiaomi model described above, then the speed of the functional is less.  In the settings you can work with the calibration. </p><p>  The frame has aluminum faces.  It contains all the basic components necessary for convenient work with the Internet.  If the phone falls on the corner of the case, the screen will not be affected. </p>

    <h2>  Scanner Setup </h2><p>  Most smartphones have a similar way to configure the scanner, the only differences are in the interface.  Therefore, we consider a universal technology to answer the question of users: how to install a fingerprint on a phone.  First you need to go into the general settings of the device, and then follow the steps described below. </p><h2>  Instruction manual </h2><p>  You should go to the menu, which is responsible for changing scanner options.  Most likely, it is called ‚ÄúLock Screen‚Äù.  There will be a sub-item, the functions of a fingerprint scanner are contained.  Now click on "Manage fingerprints."  If the phone does not have an alternative unlock method (PIN, password or graphic), the system will automatically offer to configure it.  It is necessary. </p><p>  After installation, a menu will open where the instructions are described.  "OS" will ask you to "scan" your finger at different angles several times.  As soon as the system completely remembers the fingerprint, it will immediately save it and notify you of the successful process.  This completes the setup.  Now any user can answer the question of how the fingerprint works on the phone and how to install it. </p>
