    <p>  <span>3 star hotels</span> in this country are the most popular because they have the opportunity to find a budget option.

Secondly, due to the environmental cleanliness of nature.  It is the unique ecology that is the reason that pregnant women come here to bear a child in decent and favorable conditions.  Thirdly, the nature of the country is very beautiful.  Fourth, it is very quiet in terms of the political situation.  And fifthly, Montenegro hotels for families with children have long beaches that are equipped with all the necessary equipment and are always kept clean. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Which hotel to choose? </h2>

    <p>  A comfortable stay depends on how carefully the hotel is selected.  Most hotels in Montenegro have recently opened or been renovated.  Accordingly, here you will find unique conditions for relaxation in clean and comfortable rooms.  It is best to choose <span>5</span> star <span>Montenegro hotels</span> that are family oriented and offer a full range of services. </p><p>  For example, the all-inclusive system operates the Splendid Conference &amp; SPA Beach Resort in Becici.  The unique location directly on the beach and the modernity of this hotel attract many tourists, despite the fact that the cost of the permit is rather high.  It focuses on the development of an active beach holiday, so the hotel can hold a wedding, <span>honeymoon</span> or organize a holiday.  The hotel has its own beach, there are tennis courts, saunas, baths, beauty and spa salons.  We did not forget to pay attention to the children - animation and a games room work for them.  In addition, children can be left in the mini club or with the nanny (for an additional fee). </p><h2>  Popular resorts </h2>
