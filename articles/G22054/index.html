The reviews about CTP in the Renaissance will allow you to find out whether it is profitable to purchase a policy, the insurer pays in case of an accident or not, as well as get information about the features of insurance in the office and online. </p><h2>  About company </h2><p>  Renaissance Insurance JSC in Russia since 1997.  From the moment of development, the insurer from the "middle management" company has grown into one of the leaders in the country's insurance market.  In 2018, Renaissance took 13th place in terms of insurance premiums in the Russian Federation with revenue of 30.2 billion rubles. </p><p>  The insurer's offices are located in 19 regions of Russia.  The main branch is located in Moscow.  The insurance company is universal, that is, it provides services to protect the interests of customers in many areas, including car insurance. </p><p>  CTP is one of the most sought after Renaissance Insurance policies, which customers can issue online since 2008.  The insurer is the leader of Russia in 2018 in the sale of policies without intermediaries due to the progressive development of its own channel Renaissance Direct. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thebalance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="osago renaissance reviews" class="if uuid-3255921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3255921.jpg"></div><p>  The sale of insurance policies and comprehensive insurance through the Internet is one of the main channels for the sale of insurance products in 2019-2020.  Due to successful sales, including car insurance policies, as of the 2nd quarter of 2018, Renaissance Insurance occupies 2.23% of the insurance services market share in the Russian Federation (according to the Banki.ru website).  In the future, the insurer for the next 5 years is to occupy at least 5% of the Russian insurance market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to reviews, the Renaissance Insurance group for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance has been one of the best insurers since 2016.  In 2018, the profit was almost 2 times higher than the cost of paying for repairs and compensation for damage to life and health. </p><h2>  Reliability indicators </h2><p>  When choosing a reliable insurer for the purchase of OSAGO, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the results of the analysis of financial activities.  The insurers' ratings, compiled by reputable agencies, will let you know whether to protect the interests of the selected organization. </p><p>  As of June 21, 2018, the Renaissance Insurance group of companies has a high level of financial reliability ruAA-.  The degree of resilience was estimated by the Expert RA rating agency, the leading rating agency in the Russian Federation. </p><p>  The ruAA- indicator is not the maximum value, but it is slightly inferior to the highest degree of reliability - ruAAA.  The maximum degree of financial stability as of May 1, 2019, according to the analysis of Expert RA, is with Sberbank Insurance, IJSC Ingosstrakh, VTB Insurance. </p><h2>  Insurer profit </h2><p>  When analyzing a company, one of the criteria of trust is stable profit.  As of the 2nd quarter of 2018, the profit of the Renaissance Insurance Group exceeded 7 billion rubles, while the share of insurance premiums from the sale of OSAGO policies amounted to almost 2 billion rubles. </p><p>  According to reviews, CTP in Renaissance Insurance does not cause the company losses of more than 47% of profit.  This is important, since a loss-making insurer may not always be able to guarantee payment for repairs on time.  Example: regular losses in the OSAGO market caused Rosgosstrakh financial problems, because of which the company sharply reduced the volume of sales of policies since 2018.  Until 2016, Rosgosstrakh held a leading position in the OSAGO market with a total share of policies sold over 16%, and at the end of 2018, the insurer was only in 5th place (market share - 8.5%). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of the acquisition of OSAGO in Renaissance Insurance </h2><p>  Obtain compulsory car insurance in the Renaissance, customers can online or at the company‚Äôs office.  Insurance purchased through the Internet is not inferior in importance to the policies that were purchased at the branch of the insurer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.turtlemint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance insurance osago reviews" class="if uuid-3255922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3255922.jpg"></div><p>  Features of the purchase of OSAGO in Renaissance Insurance: </p><ul><li>  Discounts for regular customers.  If the car owner has previously insured OSAGO in the Renaissance, buying a new policy will cost less than 30%. </li><li>  Options for legal entities.  Policies are available in the same section on the official website of the insurer. </li><li>  Online calculation.  The calculator allows you to find out the preliminary price accurate to the ruble.  Counting is free.  After using the calculator, the client can immediately purchase the policy according to the specified parameters. </li></ul><p>  MTPL can be issued at Renaissance at any time of the day: the site works without breaks and weekends.  Addresses and working hours of the company‚Äôs branches are presented on the website, section ‚ÄúOffices and contacts‚Äù.  To find the right branch, you need to set the region of residence. </p><p>  It‚Äôs more profitable to buy car insurance online: the policy will be sent to the email address immediately after paying the insurance premium.  According to reviews, CTP in the Renaissance will cost up to 50% cheaper if the client has more than 10 years of experience and has not incurred losses to the insurer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Buying insurance online: reviews </h2><p>  The number of CTP insurance that customers draw up via the Internet is increasing annually.  Vehicle owners want to evaluate the benefits of the insurer before applying for a policy.  The study of reviews about compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in the Renaissance made it possible to form an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe site. </p><p>  What do customers who tried to purchase insurance online write: </p><ol><li>  Online calculator is stable.  The calculation is correct, except when the client made a mistake in the parameters (for example, indicated the wrong vehicle model).  Calculating the cost of OSAGO using a calculator on the site takes about 7 minutes. </li><li>  Policies arrive by mail immediately after paying the insurance premium.  According to the law on compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, as soon as the client has paid the amount for the policy, the insurance company must send a copy of the document to the e-mail indicated by the client.  Except for the rare problems that were resolved in favor of customers after they contacted the company, Renaissance sends a copy of E-CTP without delay. </li><li>  Contact center managers are polite and competent.  In case of difficulties with purchasing insurance or entering your personal account, a citizen can contact the support service.  Applications are considered within 24 hours from the moment of registration of the appeal online or by phone. </li><li>  The cost of the E-MTPL policy is one of the most profitable in Russia.  The insurer does not exceed the parameters specified by law and offers the best options for insurance coverage. </li></ol><p>  Renaissance Insurance Company was one of the first in the Russian Federation to implement online policies.  Therefore, the insurer has been holding the position of the leader in the direct insurance market (without intermediaries) of Russia since 2018.  According to reviews, CTP in the Renaissance is one of the most profitable policies among similar offers in the car insurance market.  The process of applying for a policy through the site will take no more than 15 minutes. </p><h2>  The cost of E-OSAGO from the Renaissance Insurance group of companies: an example of calculation </h2><p>  To assess the real benefits of the insurer, you need to know how much it will cost to buy a policy at Renaissance and other insurance companies.  For preliminary calculation, the following vehicle parameters were used: </p><ul><li>  Hyundai Accent car; </li><li>  2012 year of release; </li><li>  engine capacity 1.5 l .; </li><li>  power 90 l.  from.; </li><li>  body type - sedan; </li><li>  Automatic transmission. </li></ul><p>  The car is registered and used in Moscow.  The owner is a citizen whose KBM = 0.95. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.huffpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance osago customer reviews" class="if uuid-3255923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3255923.jpg"></div><p>  MSC - bonus-malus coefficient, used to calculate the number of accidents due to the fault of the driver, for which the insurer suffered losses.  In the absence of an accident due to the fault of the driver during the year, due to which the company suffered losses, the KBM is reduced by 5%.  As an example, we used an indicator characterizing accident-free driving during the previous period (prior to insurance). </p><p>  The calculation was made using the online service "Compare.ru".  The results are presented in the table.  The client can calculate CTP in the Renaissance independently.  The service is available on the insurer's website or other specialized sources. </p><p>  The cost of CTP in the Renaissance and other companies for better clarity is presented in the table below. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Name of insurer </p></td><td><p>  The cost of the insurance policy, in rubles </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Renaissance Insurance Group </p></td><td><p>  7608 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Tinkoff Insurance </p></td><td><p>  7608 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Alfa Insurance </p></td><td><p>  7825 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Ingosstrakh </p></td><td><p>  7825 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Zetta </p></td><td><p>  8477 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  "Consent" </p></td><td><p>  8951 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The cost of policies is current information as of May 1, 2019.  The size of insurance was taken into account, taking into account the specified parameters, without buying additional insurance services (CASCO, protection of life and health). </p><p>  According to reviews on mandatory car insurance in the Renaissance Insurance, the cost of insurance in the office may vary.  It is recommended that you check with the insurance agent or by calling the contact center about the cost of classic OSAGO. </p><h2>  Documents for the purchase of OSAGO </h2><p>  The acquisition of a policy in the Renaissance does not differ from the execution of insurance in other organizations.  To buy or extend the CTP policy in the Renaissance, you need: </p><ol><li>  Passport. </li><li>  Driver's license. </li><li>  Diagnostic card or coupon confirming passing inspection.  The condition is relevant for vehicles whose service life has exceeded 3 years. </li><li>  Certificate of registration cars or passport, if the car is not yet registered. </li><li>  Statement.  When registering at the office, the client fills out together with the insurance agent, and on an online purchase - on their own. </li></ol><p>  If the insurance in the Renaissance is drawn up for several drivers (an unlimited policy), everyone should bring a passport and driver's license with them.  According to the Law on Compulsory motor third-party liability insurance dated 04.25.2002 No. 40-, the insurer has the right to demand inspection of the vehicle upon conclusion of an insurance contract.  But, as a rule, when purchasing OSAGO, Renaissance Insurance employees do not require customers to provide a car for reconciliation. </p><h2>  Office insurance: features </h2><p>  In 2019, more than 75% of customers prefer to buy insurance policies in person.  But in the Renaissance Insurance, every 4th policy is issued online. </p><p>  Purchasing OSAGO at the office takes up to 3 hours, depending on the queue and the workload of agents.  A prerequisite for completing the policy is the availability of all documents from the previously submitted list.  The insurance agent has the right to refuse to sell an insurance policy if the vehicle owner does not have a passport or other binding document. </p><p>  Registration of insurance for a third party is allowed in the presence of a notarized power of attorney.  The client may enter his name in the policy of another person, if there is a power of attorney to drive the vehicle from the owner of the car. </p><h2>  Reviews on the work of managers in the offices of Renaissance Insurance </h2><p>  The acquisition of compulsory insurance coverage at the Renaissance branch is one of the reasons why citizens become permanent policyholders of the selected organization.  According to customer reviews of CTP in Renaissance Insurance, branch managers are interested in resolving customer issues.  Clients have practically no complaints about the work of insurance agents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mexperience.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="osago insurance renaissance reviews" class="if uuid-3255924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3255924.jpg"></div><p>  What do the managers of Renaissance write on the services of Sravni.ru, Banki.ru and specialized forums: </p><ol><li>  Specialists are distinguished by politeness, neat appearance. </li><li>  Agents are sympathetic to customer problems and try to do everything so that the driver is satisfied with the service. </li><li>  Managers do not impose ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù insurance if the client himself does not express a desire to purchase additional insurance protection.  If the buyer wants to issue not only OSAGO managers offer the driver the maximum possible discount. </li><li>  Thanks to well-coordinated work in the branch, there are practically no lines of 3 or more people. </li></ol><p>  Sometimes a visit to the Renaissance office for a CTP policy leaves a negative impression on customers.  In negative reviews on compulsory motor third-party liability insurance about the Renaissance Insurance group, buyers write that they were not satisfied with the process of acquiring insurance.  The main complaints are related to: </p><ol><li>  Failure to recalculate the KBM.  If the client has made changes to the policy during the year, the calculation of KBM can be applied taking into account the data of the previous year.  The problem is also observed when moving from another insurer: in this case, sometimes the client‚Äôs bonus-malus is calculated based on an average value of 1. </li><li>  Refusal to take out insurance.  If clients do not have the necessary document, agents do not have the right to accept an application for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, but some vehicle owners regard this as a negative example of a policy purchase. </li><li>  Incompetence and haste of workers.  An incorrectly executed policy, errors in calculations cause indignation among attentive customers. </li></ol><h2>  Error in the policy: what to do? </h2><p>  Sometimes, customers may be denied damages.  One of the reasons may be an error in applying for a policy. </p><p>  You can detect a defect using the website of the Russian Union of Russian Auto Insurers: the RSA database contains information on all OSAGO policies.  If the client did not find his insurance after entering the documents, it is required to verify the correct spelling in the OSAGO sample.  Information on the status of compulsory car insurance is presented in the section "CTP". </p><p>  If during the check it turned out that the policy is defective, you should: </p><ol><li>  Contact the insurer.  The client can create an appeal in his personal account or come to the office of the company. </li><li>  Submit copies of documents. </li></ol><p>  Errors associated with incorrect character entry (typos) can be corrected within 24 hours.  A policy with an incorrectly calculated period must be replaced.  Information on the issuance of a new, revised document is entered into the SAR database.  The client will receive a copy of CTP within 1-2 days from the date of application to Renaissance Insurance. </p><p>  According to customer reviews, CTP in Renaissance can be corrected within 2 hours at the insurer's office and 5 hours when purchasing E-CTP.  The insurer does not charge an additional fee if a mistake was made through the fault of an employee of the company or as a result of a technical malfunction. </p><p>  Users of the Banki.ru and Compare.ru portals wrote that occasionally there is a delay in sending E-CTP.  But company representatives always respond to customer requests and resolve similar issues within 24 hours. </p><h2>  Customer opinion: how to find out about the company? </h2><p>  Sometimes customers leave complaints about employees on the Internet using the popular services ‚ÄúCompare.ru‚Äù and ‚ÄúBanks.ru‚Äù and other specialized pages.  In the reviews about the Renaissance Insurance group under compulsory motor liability insurance, vehicle owners write which agents and in which city caused outrage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thestar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ruppa renaissance insurance osago reviews" class="if uuid-3255925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3255925.jpg"></div><p>  Such a ‚Äúpublicity policy‚Äù brings results: more than 90% of appeals and complaints on the Web do not go unanswered.  CTP in the insurance Renaissance, according to reviews, is one of the key products, so the company is interested in maintaining a good reputation. </p><h2>  Cost of CTP in Moscow and other regions </h2><p>  Insurance in large cities does not differ from the acquisition of Renaissance Insurance policies in regional centers.  The difference is only in the cost of insurance: depending on the territorial coefficient of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in regions it is paid differently.  According to the clients of Renaissance Insurance, in Moscow OSAGO will cost 2 times more than, for example, the small city of Kuznetsk in the Nizhny Novgorod Region, since CT in the capital is the highest in the country, and equal to 2. </p><p>  The regional coefficient is set by the state annually.  The calculation is based on information about the frequency of accidents depending on the region and traffic congestion. </p><p>  Information is presented in an official document - Bank of Russia Ordinance No. 3384-U dated September 19, 2014.  It contains not only territorial OSAGO ratios, but also information for calculation on other indicators, except for tariffs set by insurers. </p><p>  The client can find out how much it costs to buy compulsory insurance at Renaissance online, at the office, or by calling the support service.  Information is provided free of charge. </p><h2>  Compensation for CTP: customer reviews </h2><p>  One of the key indicators that characterize the work of the insurance company is the percentage of CTP insurance payments.  It shows how drivers can be sure of damages, and how the insurer behaves, if necessary, to fulfill financial obligations. </p><p>  Most of the negative reviews about the Renaissance CTP insurance are related to the payment of funds in the event of an accident (according to the comments of users of the Banki.ru financial portal).  What users did not like: </p><ol><li>  The insurer may delay payment.  Repair funds were paid to customers after not 20 days, but 2-3 months.  Negative reviews are related to compensation before the amendment of the OSAGO law.  Under the new rules, the insurer no longer reimburses funds in the event of an accident, but pays for car repairs.  The money is transferred to the account of the organization that the client chose to restore the vehicle.     ¬´¬ª     . </li><li>  ,   "."  ,          .         .          40   .   ,  - ""            ,   . </li><li>   .       99% .               .        ¬´ ¬ª,   3  10     .  80%       ,      ,    . </li><li> Refusal to accept documents.  In the event of an error in the policy or the provision of expired compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, customers cannot count on damages.  Some citizens regard this as a bad work of the insurer, forgetting about the terms of the contract.  In Renaissance Insurance, like any insurance company, auto repair funds are paid only to customers who are the owners of the policy with a valid term.  In an accident due to the fault of the client, the victim will be paid compensation for the repair, but the insurer will apply a regression claim (refund for damage). </li></ol><p>  An error in the policy leads to a discrepancy between the information and the AIS CTP base.  In order for the repair to be paid at the expense of the insurer, the policyholder must correct the errors in the policy in advance. </p><h2>  Does the company pay for CTP? </h2><p>  If we evaluate the general picture of compensation for damage by the Renaissance Insurance group of companies, the owner of the CTP insurance policy can count on repairs at the expense of the insurance company.  But, according to reviews, CTP payments in the Renaissance are not always made in accordance with the law. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiansearchmarketing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance osago" class="if uuid-3255928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3255928.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews from customers left on the inguru.ru portal, managers in Yekaterinburg are not entirely conscientious.  So, some are trying to impose services, not giving the opportunity to get an application form for payment. </p><p>  In the reviews on compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in the Renaissance Insurance of Yekaterinburg, vehicle owners sometimes mention that they were called to repair cars in a company not listed in the list of partner service stations. </p><p>  In general, the insurer can sometimes violate the terms of the insurance contract, but does not shy away from financial obligations to customers.  At the same time, in 2018, Renaissance Insurance was not included in the list of unprofitable organizations: income from the sale of compulsory motor liability insurance policies is 47% higher than the cost of car repairs for injured citizens. </p><p>  Payments for total CTP in the Renaissance, according to reviews, are not always made on time.  Clients from Nizhny Novgorod often complain about negative aspects associated with delayed payments (according to inguru.ru).  According to reviews about the Renaissance Insurance in compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, in Nizhny Novgorod, some people were not paid compensation for the complete loss of the car for almost 2 months.  The funds were transferred only after complaints: the insurer associated the delay with a technical malfunction. </p><h2>  Reviews about service stations and repair for CTP </h2><p>  In connection with the replacement of monetary compensation for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance with a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù indemnification in the form of car repair at the expense of an insurance company, customers have yet another problem - high-quality repairs at a service station (STO).  According to the Law on OSAGO dated 04.25.2002 No. 40-, the client cannot choose where to send the damaged vehicle - the right to choose is assigned to the insurer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chicagoinsuranceonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="extend the policy of osago renaissance" class="if uuid-3255926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3255926.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes the services provided by the service station do not meet the expectations of customers.  An example is customer reviews of Renaissance CTP insurance in St. Petersburg (according to inguru.ru).  The owners of the vehicle faced a problem: the service station selected by the insurer did not have a license, in addition, the car service did not meet the requirements of the client.  In the selected service station, it was not possible to make high-quality car repairs, which led to dissatisfaction and an increase in the time for fulfillment of obligations by the insurance company. </p><p>  Another negative experience with compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in the Renaissance of St. Petersburg is that car owners cannot always repair vehicles from an authorized dealer, although this is indicated in a statement when contacting the insurer.  From a legal point of view, Renaissance Insurance does not violate the law by choosing a car service at its discretion.  But the example explains the lack of customer focus: vehicle owners sometimes have to go to 2 centers to make a complete repair, since the selected service station sometimes does not have the necessary equipment or a master. </p>
