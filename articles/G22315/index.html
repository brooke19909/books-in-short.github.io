    <p>  A significant date in the life of Georgia was the day of August 16, 1932.  Then the country launched the first electric locomotive. </p><p>  Electrification in Georgia was fully completed in 1967. </p><p>  The Georgian railway until 1991 was an integral part of the Transcaucasian. </p><p>  After the referendum of 1991, which resulted in the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Transcaucasian Railway was divided.  And as a result of this, the formation of three branches took place: Abkhaz, Armenian and Georgian.  The Samtred and Tbilisi branches carried out maintenance work on the site where the Georgian road was located. </p><p>  Since the days of the Soviet Union, the railway has been used as a testing ground.  Here <span>rolling stock was</span> tested <span>,</span> in particular electric locomotives, which were produced and operated both in the USSR and outside the country.  The branch between Zestafoni and Khashuri, which runs along the Suram pass, was considered the main test site.  In 1932, the railway branch of the Suramsky Pass was the first in the USSR to be electrified and used to transport goods by rail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Development plans </h2><p>  The Georgian railway has plans to reconstruct the main highway of Tbilisi - Batumi to improve the possibility of high-speed traffic. </p><p>  The construction of the second route of the Samtredia-Batumi branch is planned, due to a significant increase in cargo turnover in this direction. </p><p>  Reconstruction of many Georgian railway stations is planned, the state of which is currently not the best. </p><p>  It is planned to build the Northern Railway Bypass of Tbilisi in order to get <span>dangerous freight</span> transport out of the city center.  The central railway station will also be transferred.  It is planned to build two main stations.  Trains will run westward from Didube Station, and from Samgori eastbound. </p>

    <p>  In order to completely modernize the main railway line of Georgia, the plans pay special attention to the strategic project ‚ÄúFast Railroad‚Äù.  To this end, they will build a new direct branch through the Rikot Pass. </p><p>  The Tbilisi-Batumi expressway will be 450 km long.  This will cause trains to be on the road less time.  And you can get from Tbilisi to the Black Sea coast in 3 hours.  The project plans to lay new rails here.  Will make a complete electrification.  The project includes the construction of new bridges, tunnels and other engineering structures. </p><h2>  LLC Georgian Railway </h2><p>  In 2011, the Georgian railway plans included raising external financing through the placement of shares in Georgian Railway.  But later it was decided to abandon this.  All its authorized capital is in state ownership. </p><p>  Georgian Railway plans to introduce SAP technologies.  She will be the first company among the CIS and Transcaucasia.  This will allow to control the business processes of production at the present stage and will effectively simplify the process of making decisions regarding basic business issues. </p><p>  After the introduction of cutting-edge SAP technologies, there will be an increase in operating income, a reduction in reserve inventory, financial and repair costs, and receivables. </p><h2>  Railway station of the capital </h2><p>  Tbilisi Railway Station is located on Station Square.  It is located in the northwestern part of the city. </p><p>  In 1872, when the construction of the branch between Zestafi and Tiflis was completed, it was opened in Tiflis (Tbilisi). </p><p>  In the 50s of the XX century, the old station was demolished and the building of "Stalinist" architecture was built. </p><p>  The modern train station in Tbilisi consists of two passenger terminals: Central and Borjomi.  His building was redone.  Now here is the shopping mall Tbilisi-Central.  At the box office and in the waiting room, reconstruction was made. </p>
