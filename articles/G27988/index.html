The social system of the ancient Slavs, Kievan Rus</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The main aspect determining the legal capacity of people in Ancient Russia was the position of their personal freedom.  Based on this, the population was conditionally divided into slaves (slaves) and free.  In addition, there were intermediate classes of enslaved people.  They were considered legally free, but in reality they were economically dependent (debt or land).  As a result of this, they still infringed on their rights. </p><h2>  Social order </h2><p>  This concept includes the organization of society, which is due to a certain degree of development of production, as well as the exchange and distribution of products.  In addition, the features of the social system depend on the consciousness of people and traditions enshrined in laws and protected by the state.  Its structure consists of several elements, including political, economic, social and cultural-spiritual relations. </p><h2>  Ancient Russia </h2><p>  In the surviving chronicles it is recorded that the social system of the Slavs, who settled on the lands in the region of the East European Plain, was a clan community.  This meant that all power and property were in the hands of the foreman.  <span>The ancient Slavs</span> professed a clan cult honoring their ancestors. </p><p>  Since the VI century, in connection with the appearance of tools made of metal, as well as with the transition from slash agriculture to arable farming, the old relations began to disintegrate.  Now it was necessary to combine the efforts of all members of the clan without exception in order to successfully conduct the household.  Thus, a separate family came to the fore. </p><p>  The social system of the <span>eastern Slavs was</span> constantly changing.  Over time, <span>tribal communities</span> became neighboring or territorial.  They preserved common ownership of arable land, pastures, ponds and forest land.  Now, separate families began to give allotments.  They had to cultivate such plots of arable land on their own and with their own implements of labor, leaving almost all of the harvested crop.  Then the redistribution ended, and the allotments became permanent property owned by individual families. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Further improvement of the tools entailed the appearance of surplus products, and then the development of in-kind exchange between families.  In this regard, a new social system of the Slavs gradually began to appear, which led to the differentiation of the community, property inequality and a significant accumulation of wealth by elders and other nobles.  At this time, the main governing body was the veche, at which all important issues were jointly resolved.  But gradually it began to lose its significance. </p><p>  As you know, the Eastern Slavs constantly fought with their neighbors.  In addition, they also reflected the numerous raids of nomadic tribes.  As a result, the importance of the military leaders who were the princes began to increase.  They were the main persons who ruled the tribes.  The surplus of products allowed the prince‚Äôs communities to be kept with his devoted retinue - detachments of soldiers.  Gradually, all power and the bulk of wealth was concentrated in their hands.  They appropriated their lands and taxed their fellow tribesmen.  Thus, in the VIII-IX centuries, the social structure of Ancient Russia again began to change.  A sharp stratification of property began to give prerequisites for the formation of the state. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Main groups </h2><p>  The social system of Kievan Rus consisted of four main groups of the population, called feudal lords, peasants, serfs, and urban (or <span>posad) residents.</span>  They all had different rights. </p><p>  The division of people into classes, according to most historians, testified to the rapid development of feudal relations.  At the same time, former free community members turned into a dependent population over time.  It must be said that at this stage in the development of feudalism there was still no serfdom, which involved the attachment of peasants to the land and personally to the master. </p><h2>  Free population </h2><p>  The state and social system of Kievan Rus was an <span>early feudal monarchy.</span>  The head of state was the great prince, and in turn, others, smaller ones, obeyed him.  In order to resolve disputes arising between them, for example, on the division or redistribution of land, as well as cases concerning the conclusion of peace or the conduct of war, special congresses were held. </p><p>  The princes ruled through their squads - detachments of professional warriors.  The soldiers collected tribute, and at the expense of it they also received maintenance.  Senior warriors, led by the prince, took part in the creation of laws and, together with him, entered the council called the Duma. </p>

    <p>  Administrative functions were transferred to the military elite, due to which the so-called decimal management scheme appeared.  Over time, it will be replaced by the palace and patrimonial system, based on feudal ownership of land. </p><p>  The warriors gradually became landowners and received some kind of immunity, which gave them the right to manage their territories without any interference in their affairs from the princely administration. </p><h2>  Feudal class </h2><p>  The social system that existed in those days was a kind of ladder, at the top of which the Kiev prince sat with his elite - the feudal lords.  The most privileged was to know.  She, in turn, was divided into several subgroups.  Among them are the boyars.  These were the names of retired senior combatants who once served the Grand Duke of Kiev.  Since the XI century, they become large feudal lords-landowners.  They also participated in public administration (most often as governors.) </p><p>  Princely men are the closest entourage of the head of state.  They were his political advisers, and also were in the so-called Council under the prince.  These people did not have land ownership and lived on dependents.  They were the descendants of the great and bright princes, as well as the elders of the tribes. </p><p>  Ognschany called large officials involved in the management of various areas of the state economy. </p><p>  The people who managed the personal affairs and property of the prince were called princely tyuns, i.e.  servants.  As for their legal status, they were at the level of ordinary slaves. </p><p>  There were also youths - junior ranks from the military staff of the Grand Duke.  They were considered feudal lords and took part in government. </p>

    <p>  The main privilege enjoyed by senior combatants, namely the boyars, was land tenure with a special immunity right, which allowed them the following: </p><p>  ‚óè not obey not only community authorities, but also feudal in the localities; </p><p>  ‚óè enjoy the support of the prince‚Äôs jurisdiction; </p><p>  ‚óè levy various taxes and adjudicate against dependent people. </p><p>  Later, several more rights to protect life, health and honor were recorded in the letters.  Also, a special inheritance procedure became available to them, according to which property could be transferred not only along the male, but also along the female line.  In addition, the responsibility for the murder was significantly increased, where it was noted that the life of the feudal lord was then worth 80 hryvnias. </p><h2>  Dependent population </h2><p>  As is already known, the social system of the Eastern Slavs gradually changed, which led to its stratification and division into classes.  A dependent population appeared, which included stinks, purchases and rank and file.  It accounted for most of the inhabitants of Ancient Russia. </p><p>  Smerdy called personally free peasant communes.  They owned property with the right to inherit it, and also could enter into a contractual relationship.  The perpetrators had to pay the full fine.  They had the right to participate in trials both as a plaintiff and as a witness or defendant. </p><p>  Procurement included smerds, who somehow became dependent on their debts to creditors.  They were obliged to work them out until they can recover the debt.  Purchases retained their property, which was inherited by relatives, but their debts were not transferred.  They could enter into contracts and be held criminally liable, as well as participate in legal proceedings in the role of both the defendant and the plaintiff.  However, the procurement did not have the right to leave the lender's economy or refuse to work for him.  Disobedience was punished by slavery.  The procurement also could not act as a witness in court hearings, as it was dependent on its creditor. </p>

    <p>  The social system on the basis of legal aspects determined the factors by which the procurement could be released.  The first of these is debt repayment.  The second - release on the basis of a court decision if the creditor transfers the debtor's obligations to a third party.  And finally, the last one, when the purchase was beaten by the creditor. </p><p>  Debtors were called row-soldiers, who, on the security of their freedom, didn‚Äôt take money, but some things. </p><h2>  Non-free population </h2><p>  The social system of Ancient Russia was arranged in such a way that it had a class of people who were completely bonded and powerless.  They were called slaves.  They had no personal legal status and property.  They were considered incompetent and did not have the right to participate in litigation and to be prosecuted. </p><p>  There were several reasons why people could become slaves (slaves): </p><p>  ‚óè By birthright.  This means that if at least one of the parents was a slave, then the child also became him. </p><p>  ‚óè Marriage to a slave. </p><p>  ‚óè Self-sale.  For this, a document was compiled, which was signed with witnesses. </p><p>  ‚óè Capture during hostilities. </p><p>  ‚óè Escape purchase.  In this case, his whole family was turned into slaves. </p><p>  ‚óè A criminal offense punishable by confiscation of property.  In addition, the whole family became slaves.  Such punishment was imposed for murder, robbery, arson, horse-stealing and bankruptcy. </p><p>  It should be noted that the social system of Kievan Rus with its laws did not allow slaves to become free.  Moreover, letting them go was considered a terrible insult to free people.  The only exception could be the fact that a slave had a child from her master.  And when the owner was dying, she became a free man. </p><h2>  Posad residents </h2><p>  The social system, which was formed on Russian lands in those days, suggested the absence of servility in cities.  Posad residents had full legal equality.  Only in the XII century in urban society began to manifest signs of stratification (differentiation) of the population by property. </p>

    <p>  People began to be divided into two groups: elders and blacks.  The former included merchants and ‚Äúguests‚Äù engaged in foreign trade, and the latter, artisans.  The <span>socio-economic system</span> began to emerge <span>,</span> in which legal inequality appeared in cities.  At the same time, blacks could be sent without their consent either to the militia or to community service. </p><h2>  The emergence of cities </h2><p>  During the period of the birth and further development of the feudal system, some of the artisans who were part of the community began to become dependent on wealthy landowners.  Others began to leave their villages and go to a new place of residence.  They settled under the walls of princely fortresses and castles.  So, the social system of Russia was replenished with another group of the population - posad, or urban people. </p><p>  The lifestyle in these settlements was significantly different from the traditional way that prevailed in rural communities.  The world, consisting of endless steppe spaces, swamps and impenetrable forests, was replaced by a more reliable fortified place, which at first was a kind of rule of law and order. </p>

    <p>  Around the middle of the 10th century, when the strengthening of the Old Russian State began, urban settlements gained the ability to perform not only administrative and military tasks.  With the adoption of Christianity, cultural centers began to appear. </p><p>  The then political and social system of Russia primarily affected the emergence and development of cities such as Kiev and Novgorod.  Archaeological research and excavations confirm that these settlements had an already formed structure, where there was a concentration of power, church management, as well as all the necessary manor buildings. </p><h2>  State management </h2><p>  The socio-political system of Kievan Rus can be called an early feudal monarchy, since there was one ruler at the head of the country - the grand duke.  The legislative power was concentrated in his hands, he set taxes and resolved all the most important financial issues.  It was the Grand Duke who was the head of the state administration system and the supreme judge, and also gave orders to his armed forces. </p>

    <p>  In addition, other mechanisms were involved in the manual: </p><p>  ‚óè Council under the prince.  It was considered an informal authority and consisted of military ranks - senior combatants, representatives of the higher clergy, city elders, etc. </p><p>  ‚óè Veche.  This is the highest official authority in the country, consisting of free citizens.  Veche could be convened both at the national level and at a lower level.  His competence included issues of domestic and foreign policy.  The strength of the veche‚Äôs influence always depended on the power or weakness of the prince‚Äôs power. </p><p>  ‚óè Feudal congresses.
