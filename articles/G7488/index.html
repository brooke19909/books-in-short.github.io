    <h2>  <span>Transport tax</span> is ... </h2><p>  Before you pay for something, you need to know what kind of payment you received.  Indeed, often citizens simply do not understand what kind of fees they pay to the state treasury.  Has a payment document arrived?  So you have to pay it.  This is the wrong position, especially with regard to transport tax.  Practice shows that it is very often sent to "everyone in a row." </p><p>  Transport tax is an annual mandatory payment for vehicle owners.  An important point here is that your vehicle must have a motor.  So, for example, a bicycle does not require tax.  And a skateboard too. </p><p>  <span>Transport</span> tax is levied in certain amounts and is regional.  Settlement rules in each district are established individually.  What is the transport tax for (in Bashkiria and not only)?  For registering a car on the road.  This payment allows you to travel to cities and countries.  You cannot drive without him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Whether it is necessary? </h2><p>  Do I need to pay the <span>transport tax (Moscow</span> and other areas)?  Many citizens are puzzled by this question.  Answer here definitely will not work.  And all this is because each subject of the Russian Federation has its own exceptions.  And more precisely, the categories of citizens who can take advantage of the discount or not pay the payment document at all. </p><p>  However, if you are not a beneficiary, you can say one thing - you must pay.  Without fail.  But only when you own a car or any other vehicle.  For driving thereof by proxy, you will not be charged this tax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="2014 transport tax calculator" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201025.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Preferential categories </h2><p>  Transport tax 2014 (Bashkiria and not only) has several categories of beneficiaries.  They, as already mentioned, are either completely exempted from payment, or only partially.  Who can hope to "evade" from paying legally? </p><p>  Firstly, they are disabled.  Citizens with a disability group of 1 or 2 are fully exempt from transport tax.  By the way, the organizations that serve them (transport, and so on) - too. </p><p>  Secondly, these are veterans and heroes of the USSR.  This also includes military personnel who have ever taken part in hostilities.  In other words, they were at war. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thirdly, firms and companies involved in the creation and restoration of roads may not pay transport tax in Bashkiria.  In fact, there are very few such beneficiaries. </p><p>  Fourth, large families.  They are also exempted in full from the payment of transport tax.  Please note: there must be more than 3 minors in the family.  Otherwise, this unit of society will not be considered large. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="2014 tax rate" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201026.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Old men </h2><p>  What about older people?  Pensioners are eternal beneficiaries.  But, as practice shows, when it comes to property payments, some of their privileges simply disappear.  Transport tax (Moscow and not only) is no exception. </p><p>  The thing is that people who have gone on a well-deserved rest must pay this contribution to the state treasury.  With the exception of parallel entry into the category of beneficiaries exempted from payment.  For example, if a person is disabled or a veteran. </p><p>  Otherwise, the payment will have to be made.  But not fully.  And only 50% of the amount indicated in the payment document.  It turns out that pensioners are entitled to a discount.  If you own several vehicles, this privilege is granted only for one of them.  You yourself determine which one.  To receive a discount, you will have to contact the tax office.  Without this, you will have to pay your bills in full. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to find out? </h2><p>  How to know exactly how much you should pay for your transport?  This issue is very worrying for all citizens.  And there are several ways to answer.  Firstly, a transport tax calculator (2014-2016) will help.  This application helps to calculate the exact amount for payment, based on several parameters of your car.  True, this method is not too accurate.  He has errors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201027.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Secondly, the <span>tax</span> will help <span>.</span>  <span>Transport tax,</span> like any other, you can find out here.  Just call the tax authorities in your area, and then ask your question.  After a while, you will be informed of the necessary information.  It‚Äôs not worth contacting on the Internet - the process will drag on for about a month.  That is how much you need to wait for an answer. </p><p>  Thirdly, everything can be calculated independently.  If you know certain input data.  And a few calculation formulas.  This is not so difficult to do.  The transport tax calculator (2014-2016) will not give you such accuracy.  Therefore, many choose precisely personal counting.  Now we have to figure out how to conduct it. </p><h2>  Components </h2><p>  First you need to find out what is required for the calculations.  Transport tax (Moscow region and not only) has at least 4 formulas that will help you deal with the task.  Honestly, they will not cause difficulties.  Especially if you have all the necessary data. </p><p>  The first and most important component is the transport tax rate.  2014 or for any other take it?  This tax rate is assigned annually new.  So, you must recognize it for the period that you need.  <span>The tax rate</span> (for transport) is the cost of one horsepower. </p><p>  The second component is engine power.  Just it is expressed in the form of horsepower.  The more power a car has, the higher the payment. </p><p>  The third component is the number of months of ownership of the vehicle.  This value is only useful when you own a car for less than a year.  Otherwise, it is irrelevant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="2014 transport tax Bashkiria" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201028.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The last thing that can only come in handy is none other than the so-called up-factor.  It applies only to cars that are luxury.  Of course, directly related is only to cars. </p><h2>  Formulas </h2><p>  Well, now you can find out exactly how all the calculations are made.  The transport tax in Bashkiria and other areas has the same formulas for the implementation of the task.  The difference is only in <span>tax rates.</span>  They are different in each region. </p><p>  The standard formula is when the horsepower in the engine is multiplied by the vehicle tax rate.  It turns out the exact amount that is due for payment.  Nothing difficult, right?  If you have a luxury car, then the proposed formula should be multiplied additionally by the specified increase factor. </p><p>  What to do with vehicles that are owned less than a year?  Divide the number of months of ownership by 12. And now multiply this indicator by the engine power of the car and the tax rate.  In the case of luxury and expensive cars, you also need to multiply the amount received with a raising factor.  Luxury cars cost more than 3 million rubles.  And for the exact calculation of transport tax in this case, it is better to use a special online calculator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax transport tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201030.jpg"></div>
