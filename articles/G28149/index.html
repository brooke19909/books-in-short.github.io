At school, a 14-year-old future sociologist actively participated in the campaign against Nazism, compiled leaflets.  His father in these years worked underground.  However, he was again arrested after the failure of the "conspiracy of the generals", when on July 20, 1944 an unsuccessful attempt on the Fuhrer took place.

    <p>  The main themes of the foundation that Darendorf promoted are freedom, property, civil society and the rule of law. </p><p>  Its main goals are to strengthen civil society.  This is achieved, first of all, by a certain influence on the level of discussion in society.  It is also accompanied by democratic and macroeconomic processes through cooperation with institutes and research centers. </p><h2>  Scientific works </h2><p>  The philosopher Darendorf Ralph, whose biography is closely connected with modern science, is well known as a researcher in the theory of social conflict.  The scientist notes that conflict is inevitable in any management system. </p><p>  The basis of social conflict, in his opinion, lies in different social positions of different people.  Some have power and the ability to control, while most have no such privileges.  The consequence of this confrontation is the aggravation of internal contradictions in society, ‚Äùnotes Darendorf. </p><p>  Injustice arises during the final distribution of power, this is especially pronounced if there is no working vertical social elevator in society. </p><h2>  How to deal with conflicts in society? </h2><p>  Darendorf believes that it is possible to solve the problem of social conflicts in society.  Moreover, they need to be regulated and redirected in the right direction.  The main role in this is assigned to special public institutions, which need to develop an appropriate sequence of actions for each of the parties. </p><p>  There are several points in resolving a social conflict.  The first step is the recognition of self-interest by opposing groups.  The second is unification.  And the third and most important thing is the redistribution of power.  The result of each conflict should be social social change. </p>
