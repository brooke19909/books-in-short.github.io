One of these is the city of Wernigerode (Germany).  Over its long history, the city has retained the atmosphere and architecture of antiquity.  When you get here, you feel like in the fairy tale of the Brothers Grimm: half-timbered houses, narrow streets, a castle on a hill, it seems that around the corner you will meet Little Red Riding Hood or the Bremen Town Musicians. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.83681130000001" data-lng="10.78442659999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/5/0/3/11503.png"></div><p>  The ancient city of Wernigerode (Germany) is located at the foot of the northern Harz Mountains.

Wernigerode is part of the administrative district of Harz and is located near the capital of the Halberstadt district.  The city is almost adjacent to the National Park, it is surrounded by dense forests, mountains, two rivers - the place is completely idyllic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="podlinnik.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wernigerode Street" class="if uuid-2953941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2953941.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  For the first time Wernigerode (Germany) is mentioned in documents from the middle of the 9th century.  Since the 12th century, the city has been the location of the residence of the local prince; the first castle fortress was built for him.  In the 16th century, the city was badly damaged by fire, later it was damaged by invaders during the Thirty Years War.  However, part of the buildings has been preserved since that time.  In the 19th century, part of the neighborhoods was destroyed by another fire.  But during the Second World War, the city went around the bombing, and today the city center retains its historical appearance, and therefore is protected by UNESCO.  Currently, about 35 thousand inhabitants live in Wernigerode, and thousands of tourists come here every year to see this toy city with their own eyes.  For Russian moviegoers, he may seem vaguely familiar, because they shot the film ‚ÄúThe Munchausen‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In Europe there are a lot of small towns dating back to the Middle Ages, they have a special charm, travelers from different parts of the Earth seek them.
