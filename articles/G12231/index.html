    <p>  One of the <span>islands of French Polynesia,</span> Bora Bora, is located in the center of the most beautiful lagoon on the planet, which can rightfully be considered as such.  The island itself is small in size, its area is only about 30 square meters.  km  But the lagoon formed by the atoll is three times larger.  She, in turn, is surrounded by coral islands, which act as a breakwater, protecting the island from the stormy waters of the Pacific Ocean, so there is peace and quiet inside the lagoon. </p><p>  So where there is the island of Bora Bora, there are the most magnificent hotels in French Polynesia, because it is a favorite vacation spot of most world celebrities. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  It is known that in the 4th century A.D.  the first people appeared on this island.  However, there is practically no data on its ancient inhabitants, their culture and way of life.  The first European to land on Bora Bora was James Cook.  This happened in 1769. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A little later, in 1786, Louis de Bougainville, a seafarer from France, arrived on the island of Tahiti and declared it, as well as other islands located in the area, including Bora Bora, the possession of France.  Thus, French Polynesia was founded. </p>

They turned this island into their base, installed military equipment there and built a runway.  By the way, this strip has long been a connecting link between the islands of French Polynesia and other countries.  Only in 1961, an airport was built in Tahiti.

    <h2>  Amazing resort island </h2><p>  The tropical climate with refreshing sea breezes makes the island a year-round resort.  There are clearly defined two seasons.  From November to February, the island is hot and humid, from March to October - cool and dry.  Bora Bora - where is it?  Where the average temperature throughout the year is 27 ° C, and where you can relax with great comfort all year round. </p><p>  By the way, the first hotel opened on the island only in 1961.  But now there are more hotels there than on all the islands of French Polynesia combined.  They like to rest the stars of politics, cinema, business. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

They offer a romantic getaway and the small islands of Bora Bora, where bungalows are located right on the water, on special stilts.

    <h2>  Nature is like in a fairy tale! </h2><p>  And this is not an exaggeration.  Bora Bora - where is it?  Where there is an emerald lagoon with clear water, a scattering of cozy coral islands called motu, palm groves, <span>orchards, a</span> mountain range with three peaks ... </p><p>  The three mountains are Pachia, Mataihua and Otemanu.  The latter is the highest (727 meters).  But all three are highly eroded edges of the crater of an extinct volcano.  The rest of the island consists of basaltic lava, and small motu - from the remains of corals and layers of sand. </p>

The passage is called Teavanui, and in its transparent depth you can often see an interesting sight - an accumulation of gray sharks and barracudas.  However, the underwater world of the lagoon is very diverse and entertaining.  Therefore, to those who are perplexed: “Bora Bora - where is it?”, One can answer: “Where there is an opportunity to swim with dolphins and sharks, observe stingrays and moray eels, admire the most beautiful tropical fish.”

Most of them (about 5,000 people) live in the only large settlement and administrative center of the island - Waitap.  There is even a Christian church. </p><p>  Residents of the island speak Thai and French.

    <p>  For example, many vacationers on the island are happy to go on an excursion to a Polynesian village.  There you can get acquainted with local customs, see and hear dances and songs traditional for these places, taste national dishes and even learn how to cook them.  This is famous for the resort of Bora Bora, where there are a number of modern hotels and there are many interesting places for an active beach holiday. </p><h2>  Traveling around the island </h2><p>  A ring road along the coast goes around the whole island, its length is 32 kilometers.  Public transport is represented by a single bus that runs approximately once per hour. </p><p>  The best way to travel around the central island is to rent a bike, scooter or car.  Only during the trip it is necessary to beware of domestic animals: pigs, chickens, dogs that freely run around the neighborhood. </p><p>  It is even better to travel around Bora Bora on foot, simultaneously visiting all the sights of the island.  In such walks, the local guide will not be amiss, which will tell you a lot of interesting things and lead you to the most inaccessible places of Bora Bora, where it is possible, of course. </p><h2>  Island Attractions </h2><p>  The lagunarium is located in the central part of the island's lagoon.  This is an open aquarium with a lot of tropical fish.  In a conventional aquarium, you can watch fish only on the other side of the glass.  The difference between an open aquarium is that you can take a mask and snorkel and swim among stingrays, sharks, turtles and other tropical fish.  And under the supervision of instructors, you can even feed these marine predators - sharks and stingrays. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bora bora where is the country" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15681/512974.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The coral garden can be found on a small island with the English name Sofitel Motu.  The water here is absolutely transparent, and between the beautiful coral placers floating colorful fish are clearly visible.  But it is best to wear a mask and flippers and keep company with stingrays, moray eels, <span>sea ​​urchins,</span> black sharks and other tropical fish.  You can swim over the coral garden and in a kayak. </p><p>  Another of the attractions makes the island of Bora Bora famous.  “This is where the pearl farm is located!”  - lovers of exotic relaxation will immediately exclaim.  Indeed, there you can see the whole process of pearl birth inside the oyster.  Then you can go to the store and purchase local pearls. </p><p>  Mount Otemanu is a popular hiking destination on the island.  True, you can climb only on the "shoulders" of the mountain, its vertical peak is inaccessible, primarily because the soil on it represents a scree.  It is necessary to go up the mountain on a clear day so that the beauty of the surroundings is clearly visible and that dirt does not squelch under your feet (if rain stops, this is possible).  But it is better to take a local guide with you on the road.  And then you can see the remains of ancient settlements, ceremonial sites, religious sanctuaries, try exotic fruits. </p><p>  Of course, not all the sights of the island are described here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bora Bora resort where is located" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15681/512971.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Now you know a lot about Bora Bora.  Where is the country of which the island is located?  Recall that French Polynesia is not even a country, but an overseas community.  But how to get there? </p><p>  Of course, by plane.  Although the path is not close for him, especially since there is no direct flight.  First you need to fly about 9.5 hours from Moscow to Tokyo.  Then another 11.5 hours from Tokyo to Tahiti.  And finally, another 45 minutes to Bora Bora. </p><p>  The last leg of the journey can also be done on a high-speed catamaran, simultaneously making a photo on the way to the lagoon and the island of Bora Bora;  where the Teavanui passage is located, one can observe remarkably beautiful landscapes. </p>
