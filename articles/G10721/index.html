After all, the history of mankind knows many geniuses who distinguished themselves by outstanding discoveries and achievements in the field of science and the creation of cunning devices that make our life easier.  Einstein‚Äôs surnames come to mind, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most famous inventor" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/241041.jpg" width="368"></div>  Newton, Tesla.  However, without detracting from the merits and contributions of these minds, they nevertheless worked more to comprehend the physical laws of the world and the fundamental properties of the universe.  Speaking about which inventor is the most famous, we, as a rule, mean those who created the devices that are commonplace today, but revolutionary for their time, designed to serve us in our everyday life.  For example, a light bulb, a ballpoint pen, a door lock mechanism and many other little things, without which we can not imagine our life.  Of course, it is difficult to answer unambiguously which inventor is the most famous in the history of the creation of technological innovations.  However, we highlight the most sonorous names.

    <p>  The first of the most famous </p><p>  And perhaps the most <span>famous inventor.</span>  And he is famous not only for his inventions.  Which is paradoxical, not even so much by them.  Everyone knows Leonardo da Vinci as a brilliant painter, author of the Mona Lisa and Madonna, sculptor and thinker.  However, not everyone knows Leonardo the inventor.  But he owns the most primitive mechanical structures of the first tank, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="most famous inventor 100" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/241044.jpg" width="600"></div>  bike, parachute and even a robot.  The latter was a mechanism imprisoned in knightly armor and forcing armor to independently make movements inherent in man.  Unfortunately or fortunately, most of his developments were significantly ahead of their time, and therefore did not bring much practical benefit during the life of the scientist.

    <p>  The name of Ivan Petrovich Kulibin is known, probably, to each of our compatriots.  Being a native of a petty bourgeois family, he already in his youth showed an outstanding ability to mechanics.  And throughout his life he created navigation instruments innovative for Russia in the mid-17th century, water-powered engines, and a <span>pocket watch</span> with an alarm clock that played various tunes. </p><p>  Of course, these three personalities, in spite of all the power of their creativity and design abilities, this pantheon cannot be limited.  The names of Henry Ford, Mikhail Kalashnikov, <span>Alexander Popov,</span> Rudolf Diesel, Jacques Cousteau and many, many others are widely known throughout the world. </p>
