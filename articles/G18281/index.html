    <p>  Aya Lake Nature Reserve, its purity is protected by the state.  Symbol of Altai - Katun is born on mountain glaciers.  The water is cold for swimming, but is great for adrenaline lovers: Katun rafting is a huge success.  Here, beginners try their hand at easy routes, and professionals hone their skills, because there are areas of the highest level of difficulty - rapids, tortuosity, rapidity of flow. </p><h2>  Pastime </h2><p>  Ways to relax with the bulk of tourists are traditional.  Horse rental from its own stable, horseback riding training attracts a huge number of tourists to horseback riding.

    <p>  You can also explore the surroundings with a rental bike.  At the sports grounds, the resting camps "Altai Heart" willingly play volleyball, football, tennis.  Katun rafting, paragliding, fishing are all pleasures for relaxing in the fresh air.  There are billiard rooms for those who do not want to go far or are tired.  And, of course, a huge demand for interesting excursions. </p><h2>  “Damn finger” </h2><p>  To view the panorama of the Katun river valley, you need to make a small climb to the site for such a review.  Rock “Devil's Finger” is one of such popular places.  The rocky ledge is similar to a lonely finger sticking out of the ground with a sharp and long unclipped fingernail.  From here the view opens up simply magnificent, besides everywhere mountain silence, broken only by the magical singing of birds.  Romantically inclined people very often watch sunsets or see sunrises here. </p><h2>  Mount Camel and others <strong></strong></h2><p>  Also, the panorama of the Katun valley against the background of the northern foothills can be viewed by climbing one of the two humps of the “Camel” among the bizarre rock formations. </p>

And there is also “Stone Gate”, “Bogatyr Bobyrgan” and many other walking and automobile routes.

This is a visit to numerous beautiful museums and inspection of monuments - local history, archaeological, historical.  Excursions to Chemal and the temple on the island of Patmos especially impress tourists from different parts of our vast homeland and foreign countries. </p><p>  The eight-meter <span>Kamyshlinsky waterfall,</span> healing springs, the famous Tavdinsky caves, as well as wildlife - red deer, bison, Altai camels, sika deer and <span>black foxes</span> - all this is almost impossible to see during one vacation.  That is why there are so many regulars in the “Heart of Altai”.  Mountain Altai collects a huge number of admiring reviews everywhere. </p><h2>  Homeland of Shukshin </h2><p>  Right on the Chuysky tract, the famous village of Srostki is located on the banks of the Katun.  The tour “Heart of Altai” here strongly recommends planning a tour, especially if the rest falls on the second half of July.  At this time, the color of the country's writing and artistic life gathers here - the Shukshin annual readings commemorate the most famous actor, director and writer his most famous admirers. </p>

    <p>  Here, during the readings, the results of the Shukshin Film Festival and the Shukshin Literary Prize are announced.  But even if the vacation turns out at a different time, you still need to visit Srostki: climb to Vasily Makarovich’s favorite place - Mount Picket, take a walk along those streets of the village where his legs also walked, visit the historical and memorial museum, sit at the monument to Shukshin.  "Altai Heart" provides excursions at any time of the year, since it has its own transport. </p><h2>  Pearl and legends of the Altai Mountains </h2><p>  <span>The Golden Lake,</span> or Teletskoye, as many call it, to which automobile excursions offer almost all recreation centers in Altai, is famous no less than Baikal and is equally transparent.  Here you will find a trip on foot along the shore to the waterfalls, as well as to the Third River.  A walk on the lake by boat is also supposed.  This lake is cold, clean and very deep.  The shores are incredibly picturesque, the eyes do not tear.  Teletskoye lake is rightly called the pearl of Altai and Altai Switzerland. </p>

    <p>  <span>Passes are justifiably</span> related to legends <span>: Seminsky,</span> Chike-Taman, the place where Katun and Chuya merge, the Kalbak-Tash tract with its oldest cave paintings, and also the history of the Chuysky tract.  You can join the revelations of shamanism and the origins of Orthodoxy in Altai land, as well as the history of ancient cities and villages - Gorno-Altaysk, Biysk, visit the native places and the museum of the wonderful artist Choros-Gurkin, writer Bianka, corners marked by presence (and paintings in the museum ) Roerichs in Altai.  It is possible to study many kilometers of the earth completely untouched by civilization in a nature park, where almost no human foot has stepped.  And also to survey the Turkic mounds, petroglyphs and sites of ancient people. </p>
