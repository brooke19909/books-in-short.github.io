    <h2>  History </h2><p>  If you want to visit the oldest park in the Urals and Siberia, then be sure to come to Yekaterinburg.  Mayakovsky Park has its history since the end of the XIX century.  Even then, on this place was a grove where festivities were held.  The foundation of the recreation park was laid in 1930, and three years later it was inaugurated. </p><p>  Then it was a suburban area, and walking paths, ponds were laid out on the territory of the park, a dance floor and three children's attractions were built.  In 1936, it was supplemented by a cinema and a summer circus, increasing attendance to the maximum possible.  With the outbreak of war, the park zone was transferred to a training ground for a motorized rifle reconnaissance battalion, and a new heyday for it began in 1950. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Global reconstruction has changed the look of the park.  The main avenue shifted, arches were erected at the main entrance, the construction of large attractions began.  Already in 1957, the park was among the best, this title remains with him until now.  Every year, about 2.5 million people visit it, including locals and visitors who came to see Yekaterinburg.  Mayakovsky Park regularly organizes concerts of pop stars, city holidays. </p><h2>  Park Attractions </h2><p>  Thanks to the festival of landscape gardening sculpture, held here in 2006, the alley was replenished with thirteen original creations.  Everyone can admire them.  Another event was timed to coincide with this festival - the opening of the color music fountain.  It is worth admiring this beauty, because there are no analogues in all of Siberia.  The original illumination gives overflows of 20 different shades, and the ingenious design allows you to change the height and shape of the jets, which form 25 pictures.  Add to this gentle melodic music, and you will realize that you can sit for hours near the fountain.  A year later, the main avenue was decorated with three more color musical fountains, but smaller.  Mayakovsky Park in Yekaterinburg is famous for its colorful evening shows. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In 2008, the festival of landscape gardening sculpture was repeated, a literary alley decorated with busts of famous writers and a retro alley dedicated to the times of the Soviet Union and the achievements of athletes opened in the park. </p><p>  Since 2009, the park has become a favorite place for newlyweds to register.  A wedding avenue with a <span>carpet path, a</span> small stage for a registry office employee and a huge number of flowerpots with fresh flowers was opened. </p><p>  In 2010, deer, goats, rabbits, as well as many birds settled in the park: ducks, rabbits, peacocks, ostriches.  A trip to the park was an unforgettable adventure for children.  Almost at the same time, RusCom announced the launch of a social project: anyone can use free Wi-Fi access to the Internet.  This brought the service of the city of Yekaterinburg closer to the world level.  Mayakovsky Park makes it very convenient to sit with a laptop or tablet not at the table in a stuffy apartment, but in the green zone. </p><p>  In 2011, a new embankment was opened by the lake with a floating fountain.  In winter, the park‚Äôs life does not freeze, because a huge ice rink of 5000 m2 is poured here.  This is more than enough to want to visit Mayakovsky Park in Yekaterinburg. </p><p>  2014 will be a new turn in its history.  It is planned to carry out a complete reconstruction, as well as prepare the site for football fans in view of the upcoming competition. </p><h2>  Family Fun Opportunities </h2><p>  If your children are growing up, then a trip to Mayakovsky Park will be your favorite pastime.  In Yekaterinburg, 2014 was marked by some changes in the structure of the park, and a playground near the lake was expanded and improved.  Now there is enough entertainment for children of all ages: a huge sandbox, where intricate castles are built, a <span>pirate ship</span> on which you can climb the ropes and nets, sails, feeling like a real filibuster.  For older children there are platforms for basketball, volleyball, football and mountain climbing.  A large number of sports equipment and simulators are presented, so parents can also find something to do for themselves. </p>

    <h2>  Amazing nearby, or How to visit the forest without leaving the city limits </h2><p>  Mayakovsky Park in Yekaterinburg occupies a large area.  Those who always visited only its central part should try to go deeper.  Smoothly urban noise moves away, wide paths pass into narrow paths, and as if by magic you find yourself in a different world.  This is a real looking glass, a dense thicket with a barely noticeable path, swampy lakes, rare spills with thickets of grass and flowers.  Here, the feeling of reality is lost and it is already hard to believe that you are in the center of the metropolis.  An amazing opportunity to be alone with nature and relax from the bustle of the city!  Traveling in this part of the park can take about two hours. </p>
