    <h2>  Essential Accessories Overview </h2><p>  The good suction capacity of the Samsung SC20F30WA is determined by the presence of a cyclone filter with centrifugal force.  Spinning at a certain speed, it draws in dust and larger debris. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Accessories include three nozzles for various types of cleaning and other additional items.  During operation, the brush is easily adjustable with respect to the pipe.  In addition, it is very convenient to use, because it allows you to make the necessary movements without any tension at any angle. </p><p>  A removable dust bag is quite voluminous.  When it is full, it is easy to replace it with a new one.  It is easily removed, the accumulated dust does not spread around the room.  Even with timely cleaning, vacuum cleaner bags can be changed once a month. </p><p>  The appliance is equipped with a reliable HEPA 13 microfilter, which traps allergens.  An improved cleaning system keeps the air fresh and promotes healthy breathing. </p><p>  Equally important is the fact that the unit operates silently.  It can be used by older people and those who can not tolerate loud sounds. </p><p>  There is a special compartment for the cord, with an automatic device for tightening it.  For the convenience of cleaning on various surfaces, the vacuum cleaner is equipped with a regulator for changing the position of the villi. </p><p>  On the case there is a handle designed to transfer the vacuum cleaner to another room.  Samsung SC20F30WA reviews say that it is better not to use it during operation, as this causes some inconvenience due to its location.  To adjust the power on the housing has a lever. </p>

    <h2>  The role of the cyclone filter </h2><p>  The main objective of this design is high-quality air purification in the room.  This type of dust collector frees from frequent cleaning of dust bags.  This is important for people with allergies, as they do not have to breathe dusty air. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Due to the formation of a vortex, the filter performs two functions.  With a strong swirl of air flow, larger debris is pressed against the walls of the housing.  A sponge fixed at the exit traps the smallest particles of dust. </p><p>  The dust collector is made of hard plastic and is reliable to use.  It is also convenient that it is transparent, because this allows you to see the garbage accumulated in it. </p><p>  The simplicity of the device simplifies its operation and proper care of it. </p><p>  Its disadvantage is that when it is filled with garbage, it loses suction power.  The engine heats up, and you have to turn off the vacuum cleaner. </p><p>  The design with a cyclone filter cannot perform washing functions. </p>
