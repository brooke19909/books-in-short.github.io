This activity is very exciting.  Collectors study the history of coins of various states.  Many of them are engaged in treasure hunting. </p><p>  The first collections of valuable coins began to appear in ancient Rome.  At that time, only very wealthy people could get involved in this occupation.  After all, then only valuable specimens were collected.  Coins were given as a gift for a birthday, wedding or other significant event.  Expensive collections were inherited.  Currently, collecting is not expensive. </p><h2>  Collecting coins in Russia and the USSR </h2><div class="photo" data-original="k0m.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thematic album" class="if uuid-2650924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88575/2650924.jpg"></div><p>  The first Russian coin was made in 1654.  This is a silver ruble.  Soon the <span>minting of coins of</span> lesser denomination began. </p><p>  The fashion for collecting coins in our country arose during the reign of Peter the Great.  The collection of the emperor himself is kept in the Kunstkamera.  At that time, people tried to fill their collections with any available means.  Copies of antique coins were ordered at the mints.  Sometimes whole collections were made in this way.  The production of remodels was completely stopped only at the end of the 19th century.  Many coins of that period were transferred to the Hermitage.  His collection contains more than 1 million copies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the USSR, buying coins was equated with speculation.  But this did not stop collectors.  In the 60s of the XX century, the issue of commemorative coins began in the Soviet Union.  This greatly increased the interest in collecting among young people.  The first commemorative coins were issued in honor of the twentieth anniversary of the Victory in World War II.  For collectors issued several thousand coins of improved coinage.  Each of them was packed in a paper envelope.  The largest collection of coins of the USSR was issued for the Olympics in Moscow in 1980. Commemorative coins were also issued from gold, silver and other valuable metals.  The first commemorative coins of the Russian Federation were issued in 1999 in honor of the bicentenary of the birth of A.S. Pushkin.  The development of the Internet has greatly simplified the search for valuable copies of coins.  Now collectors do not need to spend a lot of time.  Rare coins can be purchased at special online auctions. </p><h2>  How to store coins at home? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cointalk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Storage device" class="if uuid-2650890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88575/2650890.jpg"></div><p>  Beginning numismatists often face the problem of storing a collection.  Indeed, in the air, metal coins oxidize quickly, rust and plaque appear on them.  Returning them to their original form is very difficult.  How to store coins? </p><p>  Coins should be stored in a dark place at ordinary room temperature.  Direct sunlight can damage their surface.  The storage method depends on the properties of the metal from which they are made.  Coins from expensive metals are less demanding to care for.  Today, most coins are minted in steel.  They lose their original appearance after a couple of months. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Oxidation and Patina </h2><p>  The causes of metal oxidation were elucidated only at the beginning of the 19th century.  The metal combines with oxygen.  As a result, oxides are formed on its surface.  The development of chemistry has allowed the development of protection methods.  Copper and bronze coins are covered with patina over time.  This is a natural greenish coating on coins.  Experts believe that it protects the coin from oxidation.  Patina gives the coin extra beauty.  Coins coated with a patina are especially appreciated by numismatists. </p><h2>  Storage </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cointalk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Proper storage" class="if uuid-2650919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88575/2650919.jpg"></div><p>  How to store coins?  The cost of storage should not exceed 30% of the price of the entire collection.  Many banks provide similar services for particularly valuable exhibits in collections. </p><p>  With proper storage, the following tasks are solved: </p><ul><li>  isolation of the collection from environmental influences; </li><li>  accessibility of inspection of the specimen from all sides; </li><li>  compactness of its packaging. </li></ul><h2>  Improper storage </h2><p>  The results of improper storage manifest themselves after a few years.  Coins darken and change their original color.  Some collectors store metal products in one box.  As a result, contact occurs between them. </p><p>  Each copy must be kept in separate packaging.  Do not keep the collection in a plastic bag.  Polyethylene vapors have a negative effect on the metal.  It is also not recommended to use foil as packaging. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Do not store coins in the clear.  Air and high humidity will quickly ruin their appearance.  In museums, coins undergo special processing with special compositions.  They are exposed in airtight cabinets with a constantly maintained microclimate. </p><h2>  Albums </h2><p>  Many companies release albums for coins.  When choosing them, you need to be very careful.  The album should not have open cells, have a pungent smell.  Do not wrap copies of adhesive tape, cover them with varnish and paraffin.  Chemical compounds will damage the metal. </p><h2>  Storage Tips </h2><div class="photo" data-original="storage.miscellaneous-inc.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Case with tablets" class="if uuid-2650922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88575/2650922.jpg"></div><p>  It is not recommended to take coins with bare hands.  It is better to use gloves or plastic tweezers.  When working with coins, you must use a gauze bandage.  It is better to take the exhibit for the edge.  It is least oxidized. </p><p>  Coins are washed from fingerprints in warm water with a neutral soap.  Then they are dried.  After placed in an album or sealed package.  In this form, it can be stored for several years. </p><p>  The collection should be systematized.  When viewing a copy, do not remove it from the album.  Avoid contact with moisture and insects on the metal.  Packed coins are removed from polyethylene and placed in capsules.  Coins of improved minting are stored only in capsules, ordinary coins are not removed from blisters. </p><h2>  Storage methods </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinnaclecoin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tube set" class="if uuid-2650909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88575/2650909.jpg"></div><p>  How to store coins?
