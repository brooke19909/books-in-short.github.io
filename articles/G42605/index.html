The first mention of it belongs to Chinese and Indian sailors and dates back to the 9th century AD.  However, it was inhabited by residents much earlier - presumably 2000 years BC.  e. </p><p>  Europeans found themselves on these lands in the 16th century.  Having fallen in love with the local life and native nature, some of the sailors refused to return to their homeland.  And today, many tourists, having been here once, return to the expanses of the island again and again.  What to see in Bali?  Bali Attractions Rating will be presented to your attention in the article. </p><h2>  Natural wonders </h2><p>  For those who feel like a part of nature and want to plunge into the world of unusual shrubs, trees and fragrant flowers, since 1959 the Kebun Raya Eka Karya Botanical Garden has been opened for visiting.  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 150 hectares and is located on the slope of the Pohon massif at an altitude of about 1,500 meters above sea level.  The main highlight of this park area is fern. </p><p>  The park gained popularity among travelers thanks to a wide range of related services.  On its territory is the rope park Bali-Tritop, which provides its customers with a guaranteed dose of adrenaline and extreme sports.  Six cableways, bungees, crossings and bridges will give an unforgettable experience to the gambling youth.

Greenhouses and nurseries are open throughout the day.  Paved alleys will lead to the most interesting plants.  They all have signs and are signed.

Their location falls on the crater of the oldest volcano Chatur in an elevated area.  Previously, according to legend, they were combined into a single body of water.  However, the forces of nature made them independent.  These natural sites are revered by the locals due to their freshwater.  They are a source of crystal clear water, which is supplied to absolutely all the inhabitants of this land.  According to the legend of the indigenous people, the sanctity of water lies in the possibility of transforming into higher beings, helping people with their troubles and tribulations. </p><p>  An exclusive addition to a walk near the ponds is the temple of Ulan Danu Bro.  Elegant multi-tiered pagodas growing from the waters will impress every tourist.  It is surrounded by a walking park, where it is incredibly quiet and calm.  Fertile lands, magical waters determined the plantations built here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tamberlingan Lake is shrouded in a mass of legends.  On the one hand, it is considered the beginning of civilization in these parts, and on the other hand, they believe that it is bewitched. </p><p>  Photos of Bali's attractions are also presented to your eye in an article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallup.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bali island in malay archipelago attractions" class="if uuid-2331539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42603/2331539.jpg"></div><h2>  Seven-jet miracle of Indonesia </h2><p>  And we continue to talk about the sights of Bali, the description of which is supplemented, of course, by the photo.  The island has gathered more than twenty waterfalls that deserve the visit of travelers.  In the northern part, among the real jungle, seven graceful jets of water flow at a considerable distance from each other.  They are united in a single name - Secumpul Waterfall.  Its height reaches 80 meters.  Being close to constantly bubbling streams cannot be described in words, this must be felt. </p><p>  The most favorable period for visiting are the months from November to April.  During this period, the maximum amount of precipitation falls, making the spectacle more impressive and exciting.  Cascades at this time are full-flowing and incredibly picturesque.  Their distinctive feature is pure water and its healing properties. </p><p>  This attraction can be reached by one of two possible paths, one of which leads to the observation deck, and the second to the pool of cascading jets.  Both roads are considered difficult for a massive influx of tourists, so only true connoisseurs of fabulous natural places visit this waterfall. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="putubalidriver.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bali Attractions Rating" class="if uuid-2331544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42603/2331544.jpg"></div><h2>  Waterbourne Waterpark </h2><p>  In the very center of Kuta, on a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã3.8 hectares, the amazing Waterborn Waterpark is located - one of the best attractions in Bali, which is visited annually by hundreds of thousands of tourists.

They make contact easily. </p><p>  It is very important to follow the rules of conduct, remove hats, jewelry and bright accessories.  The kingdom of wildlife envelops visitors from the first steps through the forest.  However, despite this, toilets, various cafes and a temple were built here.  The relationship of monkeys, a unique flora that has incorporated a number of exotic plants, as well as stone sculptures covered with moss, will take people walking to another world.  The cleanest air, freshness and silence will not only allow you to relax, but also to know the pristine world of nature. </p><p>  Entrance to these miraculous open spaces is paid.  You can leave the car in the parking lot at the entrance to the ticket offices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="traveldigg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bali photo attractions" class="if uuid-2331566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42603/2331566.jpg"></div><h2>  MountKawi and its sacredness </h2><p>  One of Bali's beautiful and spiritually rich places is Mount Kawi, a 40 km drive from Ubud.

Its discovery took place thanks to the active participation of the artist Rudolf Bonnet.  The structure itself was built for several years.  Most of the works are associated with the display of myths and have a religious orientation. </p><p>  In 1972, two buildings were completed: eastern and western.  There are exhibits of young talents, as well as household items of the ancient Balinese.  Often exhibitions are held here, but the practice of knowledge transmitted through dance and music is no less popular.  Such excursions are unexpected for tourists, but they are impressive and memorable for a long time. </p><p>  Visiting children under 15 years old is free of charge.  All rooms are air-conditioned.  A nice bonus is the exchange of a ticket after the end of the excursion for a soft drink.  Around the buildings are fragrant flower beds, a restaurant and artificial ponds with lotuses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="allindonesiatourism.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in bali bali attractions rating" class="if uuid-2331574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42603/2331574.jpg"></div><h2>  Unique castle and its features </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful sights of Bali, an island in the Malay archipelago, is a unique castle on the water - Ujung Palace.  Its construction was started in 1919 and lasted two years.  Local hard workers and Dutch architects created a masterpiece that has been popular with tourists for many years in a row.  The architecture is represented by the Balinese trend, subtly combining European trends.  Its main purpose was the meeting of senior officials. </p><p>  However, the palace was overtaken by natural disasters in 1963 and 1976.  He was almost wiped off the face of the earth.  Significant funds and forces were spent on its restoration, and today it appears before visitors almost in its original form.  Inside the institution, benches of past years were preserved, on which only important persons could sit. </p><p>  The park area for walks is well-groomed, lawns are trimmed.  Spreading palm trees and fragrant flowers give guests a good mood.  There are benches to relax. </p><div class="photo" data-original="latitudes.nu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best sights of bali" class="if uuid-2331578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42603/2331578.jpg"></div><h2>  Royal Water Palace </h2><p>  No less interesting is a walk around the Tirta Ganga water palace, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich reaches 1.3 hectares.  A unique labyrinth of water pools and exclusive fountains surrounded by a green-saturated garden, complemented by statues and stone objects.  Its main purpose is to supply rice fields with water. </p><p>  However, nature is not merciful.  This landmark of Bali, an island in the Malay Archipelago, suffered from a volcanic eruption in 1963.  And only in 1979, work began on the restoration of the palace.  The painstaking work of craftsmen recreated an architectural masterpiece. </p><p>  The palace itself is represented by a three-tier structure, which symbolizes the world of gods, people and demons.  In the central part of the courtyard is a fountain surrounded by statues of Hindu gods.  To entertain holidaymakers, a font was built where you can come in contact with holy water.  The water maze leads adults and kids to an unprecedented delight. </p><h2>  Healing Temple of Titra Empul </h2><p>  One of the goals of visiting the island of Bali is to improve and improve immunity.  For this, in addition to sacred waterfalls, the temple of Titra Empul is widely known, which is rich in sources of life-giving water.  Three bathing pools have been built here.  The purpose of such an immersion is to purify the mental and physical dirt of travelers. </p><p>  Before contact with a powerful element, you must visit the temple.  You can enter the waters of the spring, dressed in a sarong.  Only men are allowed to bathe with an open torso. </p><p>  One of the traditions of tourists is the delivery of various delicacies, with which they delight water spirits, having refreshments along the pool perimeter.  The washing under each particular fountain has its purpose: from the evil eye, from ailments, the expulsion of demons and others. </p><h2>  Antonio Blanco Museum and its treasures </h2><p>  The works of the greatest artist Antonio Blanco come to admire tourists from all over the world.  This is one of the main attractions of Ubud.  The artist himself lived here.  The chic mansion is surrounded by greenery and the beautiful singing of numerous birds.  During the life of the creator, every traveler could get to know him personally.  The magical nature and beloved woman are the main inspirers of his works.  A unique combination of colors, provocative plot and drawing of every small detail are the main secrets of the success of his work. </p><p>  Each masterpiece is decorated in an individual handmade frame.  The artist created a frame from improvised materials, giving the whole work of art a special charm. </p><h2>  The world of miniature beauties </h2><p>  Butterfly Park is one of the unusual attractions of the island of Bali.  There are few similar objects on earth, but visiting them is always interesting, entertaining and impressive.  In a small area, the eyes of the visitors are delighted by the countless number of small winged creatures that are incredibly colorful and beautiful.  They soar above their heads, sit on their hands and live their own lives, which can be observed with the naked eye.  The process of transforming a cocoon into a butterfly is presented, which is interesting and unusual. </p><p>  The natural habitat, the bug room and the opportunity to take pictures with a giant butterfly are curious not only for kids, but also for adults. </p><h2>  Bali's Green Heart </h2><p>  An amazing place for walking is located in the central part of the island - rice fields Jati Louvi.  Rice is grown in an organic way that has been relevant for many centuries.  Amazing landscapes, the mountain Batukaru rising on the horizon and foggy clouds enveloping the mountains, not only fascinate, but also attract with its beauty.  At different times of the year, the color palette of the fields changes, but there remains a single beauty that allows you to plunge into the world of peace and tranquility. </p><h2>  TrickArt 3DGallery </h2><p>  The 3D museum, where the image on the wall and floors turns into a single whole, leads to an unprecedented delight.  It is located in Seminyak and was opened to travelers in 2014.  More than 80 three-dimensional expositions will allow you to create unique photographs that will remind you of a wonderful vacation for a long time.  Among them are parodies of the work of great painters, favorite cartoon characters, as well as realistic paintings. </p><p>  Visiting this place is recommended with a fully charged camera. </p><h2>  BajraSandhi Monument and Fresh Air </h2><p>  One of the pleasant places for walking is a park with an amazing monument dedicated to the Balinese struggle for independence.  He is majestic and graceful.  It is possible to climb the stairs to the highest tier of the monument.  An observation deck allows you to admire the views of Denpasar.  It is located in the area for walking - a clean park with many benches. </p><p>  The article presented the best sights of Bali.
