  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get standard deductions?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We all pay taxes.  And, having carefully studied the payroll sheet of our salary, we sadly notice that taxation significantly reduces our already small salary.  However, this can be corrected if you take advantage of the tax credit - these are standard deductions.  They get them most often for several reasons.  The main ones are: <span>disability</span> or the presence of 1 child or several children. </p><p>  In order to receive standard deductions, you must submit an application to the tax organization.  However, this document alone will not be enough.  You will also need all the help you can provide.  It is necessary that the content of the certificates confirms the fact that you require benefits.  About the package of documents that are attached in this case, we will talk below.  Now everyone is interested in the standard deduction application form.  So, you can download it on any of the legislative tax sites for this year, or you can come to the <span>tax office,</span> where you will be kindly provided with a blank form in which you write everything according to the sample given to you.  In fact, the second option is much simpler than the first. </p><p>  How to get standard <span>deductions for children?</span>  We provide you with step-by-step instructions.  Collect a package of documents.  This privilege can be used only by those parents whose children have not reached the age of 18.  If they become adults, then they must study full-time at some educational institution.  Then the standard deductions you still rely on.  So, you provide the tax authority with a birth certificate to confirm the fact of your parenthood.  Then, if he is an adult, attach a certificate from the educational institution in which he is studying.  Next, you need to go to the financial department of the company where you work, and take documents from there confirming that you regularly paid taxes and did not receive standard deductions earlier.  Here, in fact, all the papers.  It is worth noting that there are not many of them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Take all this to the tax office, write a statement and attach the collected documents to it. </p><p>  By the way, both parents can receive <span>standard tax deductions</span> , so you will significantly increase your family‚Äôs income if both father and mother apply for this benefit. </p><p>  If a child is over 18 years old and is studying full-time, then you will receive deductions for him until he is 24 years old.  After that, the benefits end. </p><p>  Many people want to know what is the amount paid by standard deductions, and is the game worth the candle?  We answer: according to 2012 data, the rate of 1 standard deduction for 1 child is 1400 rubles.  It turns out that if the father and mother apply, they will increase the family budget by 2800 rubles.  The amount is provided for each child.  Therefore, if you have 2 minor children, you will receive 2800, and together with the second parent with whom you are legally married, you will receive 5600 rubles.  By the way, for the third child and each subsequent child, the amount of the standard deduction is already more than 3 thousand.  Consequently, your income will increase even more.  When a child becomes a student, deductions also increase to 3,000 rubles.  If you have a disabled child, then provide the tax authority with a certificate of his disability and again receive money in the amount of 3,000 rubles or more.  In general, the money is quite large, especially when it comes to a large family. </p><p>  Whether or not to write a statement is up to you.  However, if there is an opportunity to increase your income at least a little, then why not do it?  In addition, the procedure is legal and does not require any efforts from you.  Having collected an insignificant package of documents, you will be able to receive tax deductions for the whole year.  By the way, next year again bring all the certificates, write a statement, and again you get all the money.  Deductions are accrued to your salary, you do not have to go separately for the money. </p>
