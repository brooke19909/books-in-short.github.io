New refrigerator: instruction manual</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A large number of consumers after acquiring new household appliances have to pay for additional services of specialists in the installation or installation of the device.  Although some work can be done independently, without the help of qualified craftsmen.  For example, installing a refrigerator, especially a freestanding one, does not require special experience.  Even the built-in device can be mounted without skills, it is enough to familiarize yourself with the general recommendations and expert advice. </p><h2>  Installation of a free-standing refrigerator </h2><p>  Installing a conventional refrigerator does not imply complicated manipulations, so everyone can cope with such a process on their own.  The main rule is to ensure a regular supply of electricity.  Therefore, in the first place, it is better to connect a separate uninterruptible power supply to a conventional outlet.  It is better to spend an additional few hundred rubles and be sure of the safety of the device, since all refrigeration equipment is difficult to repair. </p><p>  Before you go to the store, you need to measure the amount of space into which you plan to fit the device.  It is important to understand that in no case should a new refrigerator be placed in close proximity to a stove or other heating elements.  It is also recommended to avoid direct sunlight.  This is due to the fact that work efficiency can also be reduced. </p><p>  Do not install the refrigerator close to the wall.  The minimum distance from the device to the wall is at least 9 cm. The legs and other supporting elements must fit snugly to the floor, this will contribute to the quality of the compressor and minimize noise during operation of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Built-in refrigerator:</span> installation features </h2><p>  Such devices are becoming more popular among buyers.  The built-in equipment saves space, in the process of its work creates less noise, with its help you can preserve the unity of the design.  The quality and functionality of the installation often outperforms traditional appliances. </p><p>  Built-in appliances have their own characteristics, which should be taken into account when installing the case and the device itself.  Self-installation of the built-in refrigerator should be carried out in accordance with the following requirements: </p><ol><li>  The front support (as a rule, it is made in the form of small legs), it is necessary to untwist it a bit so that the door closes tightly and the cold does not go outside.  The slope should be about 1-2 degrees. </li><li>  If there is a hob or oven nearby, the installation of the built-in refrigerator should be carried out at least 7 cm apart. Closely located heaters will interfere with the full operation of the compressor. </li><li>  The platform on which the device is installed should provide an even surface horizontally and vertically, this will help to avoid loud noise and buzz during operation. </li><li>  The niche into which the device is integrated must ensure free air circulation in order to avoid overheating of the device.  Therefore, when constructing the cabinet, it is necessary to have a margin of several centimeters in width, depth and height relative to the dimensions of the refrigerator. </li><li>  In accordance with the instructions for installing the refrigerator, all wires must be earthed. </li><li>  It is best if the niche into which the device is built in does not have a back wall. </li></ol>

As a rule, some modern models may have additional requirements that are mandatory.  For devices that support the latest features (for example, smart refrigerators), additional installation conditions are required to optimize their performance.  Before you buy, you should study the requirements for the place of their installation. </p><p>  Before installing the refrigerator directly, be sure to check the power cable for factory defects and damage.  If deep scratches or other defects have been noticed, it is recommended not to use it, but to replace it immediately.  This will prevent a power outage, which can lead to serious damage.  The refrigerator is installed in a prepared place.  The most important thing is that it is smooth (to avoid skewing). </p>

    <h2>  Refrigerator installation rules </h2><p>  If the device is freestanding, then the connection will not take much time.  If the installation site has already been prepared, then immediately after delivery it can be put in place.  Here you should definitely adjust the horizontal level so that the door can be slammed shut without much effort.  It should be noted that the refrigerator should always remain in a stable position.  It is necessary to double-check whether the ice maker and other components are connected correctly.  Improper installation of the refrigerator in terms of level is the main cause of uncharacteristic noise during operation of the device.  Therefore, masters recommend paying special attention to this moment. </p><p>  Before connecting a new refrigerator to the network, let it stand in the room for at least 12 hours in order to adapt it to the microclimate. </p><p>  It is possible to lay products only after three hours from the moment of connection. </p>

    <h2>  Instructions for use the new refrigerator </h2><p>  It includes five main steps: </p><ol><li>  The correct transportation process.  It is not recommended to tilt the device at 40 degrees so that the new refrigerator does not fail.  The device must only be transported in an upright position.  If such transportation is not possible, the refrigerator should be transported on its side.  After installation in place, let it stand for at least 24 hours so that the entire refrigerant stack. </li><li>  Accommodation in a prepared space.  The installation site should be selected so that the distance from the heating elements is at least 7 cm. Also, do not put the refrigerator close to the rear wall, air circulation should be free. </li><li>  Installation process.  After the device has been unpacked, it is not recommended to immediately release the loaders.  First you need to check all the components and the presence of factory defects.  If defects were found, then the problem must be resolved on the spot. </li><li>  Cleaning in the interior.  Of course, before starting operation, all shelves should be wiped with a solution containing soda, or with a special disinfectant. </li><li>  Timely defrosting.  This process will help get rid of excess ice in the freezer kilometer (in the case of a drip defrosting system) and bring the compressor to normal operation. </li></ol>
