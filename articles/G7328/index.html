    <h2>  Dining at the hotel complex </h2><p>  About the food in the hotel in the reviews mentioned very often.  It is at its best here, so it’s difficult to stay hungry in a hotel complex.  Keep in mind that Hotel Sinatra 4 * operates on an all-inclusive basis.  But there is always a six-hour break between lunch and dinner.  During this period, you can take any drinks and various types of cookies at the bar.  But full-fledged dishes and snacks before dinner will not be served.  Many guests find this extremely inconvenient and advise the hotel administration to introduce at least fruit snacks. </p><p>  Breakfast at the hotel is quite tasty, although not too varied.  Cooks make fresh omelettes and pancakes in front of the guests, and vacationers often choose vegetables with various sauces and pastries from the offered dishes.  Lunches and dinners are much more diverse.  On the table there are always meat dishes.  They are made from chicken, beef and lamb.  Often guests are pampered with the most delicate trout, as well as other seafood.  Of the side dishes, holidaymakers note rice and bulgur, often various types of potatoes appear on the menu.  The guests are pleased with the abundance of fruits and vegetables, they can be enjoyed daily. </p><p>  The only drawback of the restaurant is tourists consider a small selection of pastries and sweets.  If you do not have time to take them at the beginning of the dinner, then by the end of the choice there may no longer be any. </p><p>  All reviews noted that the restaurant is very clean.  Waiters quickly bring appliances and change dirty tablecloths.  All staff are extremely polite and smiling. </p>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The most common room type at Sinatra Hotel 4 * is standard.  Kemer is distinguished by an abundance of similar rooms in various hotel complexes.  The hotel described by us has about forty-eight such apartments, in addition to them, there are twelve more corner rooms and two suites. </p><p>  Each room has a minibar and a safe.  However, you must pay for using them.  For example, one day of using the safe costs two dollars.  They also include air conditioning and satellite TV.  Usually vacationers spend a lot of time in the evening on the balcony, but in this hotel it will be impossible to do this - the balcony is so small that it can accommodate only one person. </p><p>  The bathroom has a shower and hairdryer.  However, quite often, guests note that the shower is extremely narrow, so overall people will be very uncomfortable there. </p><p>  The beds in the rooms are quite wide and it is very pleasant to sleep on them.  Guests rate the apartment cleaning very highly.  Towels and bed linen are changed daily, this is not always found even in five-star hotels. </p>

Therefore, comments are collected by tourists for the current vacation season.  The vast majority of reviews are positive.  The advantages of our compatriots include the following points: </p><ul><li>  cleanliness on site and in rooms; </li><li>  delicious food; </li><li>  calm and relaxing environment; </li><li>  helpful staff; </li><li>  interesting interior; </li><li>  the possibility of early settlement. </li></ul><p>  You can find a few disadvantages in the hotel, but they still exist: </p><ul><li>  lack of water on the beach; </li><li>  diluted alcoholic drinks in the bar; </li><li>  small showers; </li><li>  not quite clean sun loungers by the pool. </li></ul><p>  After all the above, I want to say that the hotel is fully consistent with its category and is designed for people who dream of peace and comfort away from the hustle and bustle.
