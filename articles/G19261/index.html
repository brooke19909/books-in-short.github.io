Where to relax in March abroad</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What to do if there is a vacation in the month of March and an irresistible desire to plunge into the warm sea waves, take sunbaths?  Three decades ago, it was practically impossible to combine these conditions - the waters of the Black Sea coast and the reservoirs of some friendly countries that hosted compatriots did not warm up to a comfortable temperature in early spring.  Today, the services of the Russians - the whole globe.  And this creates a new problem - to choose among a huge number of proposals.  Southeast Asia will be a good solution when looking for an answer to the question of where to go on vacation in March. </p><h2>  Thailand </h2><p>  The most famous resort in this direction for Russian tourists is Thailand.  From November to March, the high season lasts - at this time the minimum amount of rain falls here, and the water in the Gulf of Thailand, the Andaman and South China Seas warmed up to 28-35 degrees.  Buying tours <span>to Thailand in March, it is</span> not necessary to opt for the noisy and, frankly, dirty Pattaya.  There are more interesting places on the mainland, for example, Hua Hin.  The numerous islands of Phuket, Koh Lanta, Koh Chang, Krabi, Koh Samet will comfortably accommodate guests in excellent hotels and offer the maximum number of services at pleasing wallet prices, service is a strong point of Asian residents. </p><p>  Travelers appreciate the beaches of Klong Chao on the island of Koh Kood and Maya Bay on the island of Pee Ley, advertised by the movie "Beach" with Leonardo di Caprio. </p><p>  Thai massage, popular all over the world from qualified specialists at ridiculous prices, is another reason not to think for a long time about the question of where to go on vacation in March.  Massage parlors are located at every step. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In early spring, Thailand hosts festivals (magic tattoos, kites) and various holidays (Thai elephant day, Thai boxing day Muay Thai, etc.). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thai islands pi pi pi don" class="if uuid-2357176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68143/2357176.jpg"></div><h2>  Cambodia </h2><p>  Is Thailand studied up and down?  A tour in March to neighboring Cambodia is inexpensive, and will add a vivid impression to the trip.  The benevolence and smile of the inhabitants is the first thing you encounter when entering this country.  First you need to explore the famous temple of Angkor Wat, which gained fame due to the filming in the film with Angelina Jolie.  Then - happy pizza with secret additives of dubious legality: try a slice, but not get carried away.  For beaches with white sand and a clear sea, the temperature of fresh milk must go to the Sihanoukville Peninsula or the islands of Koh Rong, Koh Rong Samloy, Ko Tmei. </p><div class="photo" data-original="traveldaily.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Angkor Watt Cambodia" class="if uuid-2357184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68143/2357184.jpg"></div><h2>  Laos </h2><p>  Another interesting country that you can add to your trip by choosing tours to Thailand in March is Laos.  There is no sea, just like the ocean.  But in abundance is the jungle, where everyone can feel like Tarzan (or a gibbon, by the name of the tour).  Gibbon tour includes a trip to the jungle with accommodation and spending the night in tree houses, moving using the zipline system (steel ropes stretched over the tops of trees and special devices for moving around them), visiting waterfalls and observing wildlife.  Tours take place in the Nam Kan National Park year-round, but the driest months are from November to April. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.klook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gibbon Tour Laos" class="if uuid-2357244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68143/2357244.jpg"></div><h2>  India </h2><p>  If we ignore other stunning places of India, the coast of the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea in Goa and the Andaman Islands will fully satisfy the office worker who has longed for a long winter on sunny days.  Tours in <span>Goa in March</span> are in demand among compatriots.  The weather at this time is hot and dry, water temperature + 28 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  In March, India celebrates Holi - a celebration of spring and vibrant colors.  On the first night of the celebration, the effigy of the demon Kholiki is burned.  The next two days, an enchanting procession takes place on the streets with songs, dances and showers of everything that moves with colored powder.  Fun will not be complete without the traditional Tandai drink, which contains marijuana. </p><p>  Going on a tour to Goa in March, it is better to take clothes light and spacious, not forgetting about a hat, sunscreen.  Drinking water should be bought to avoid infections, it is not recommended to use tap water for drinking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cntraveller.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Goa Coast" class="if uuid-2357192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68143/2357192.jpg"></div><h2>  Vietnam </h2><p>  March in Vietnam is a dry season, the temperature at the resorts is kept at thirty degrees, the water in the South China Sea is not much behind the air (+28 ¬∞ C).  Last minute tours in March to Vietnam travel agencies offer constantly, since at this time there is no large flow of tourists.  The resort cities of Fukuok, Nha Trang, Phan Thiet will plunge into the atmosphere of exotic.  Local cuisine will delight you with original dishes, before ordering which tourists should learn the phrase ‚Äúnot spicy, please,‚Äù in several languages. </p><h2>  Malaysia </h2><p>  Island Malaysia is a great place for those who want to explore the rich underwater world and master the art of diving.  The islands of Langkawi, Redang, Penang, Borneo, Tioman, and the <span>Perhentian Islands</span> will create conditions for measured relaxation away from the bustle of the city and provide an experience until the next trip. </p><p>  The beach with the romantic name "Blue Lagoon", which is located on the Perhentian Islands, is one of the best in Malaysia.  There are all the components for a beach holiday - the finest white sand, clear water, tropical greenery.  Its second name is Turtle Bay, or Turtle Bay.  Turtles come to this place to lay eggs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.animalhi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turtle malaysia" class="if uuid-2357201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68143/2357201.jpg"></div><h2>  China </h2><p>  Add color to boring weekdays in March <span>tour to China.</span>  Hainan Island has long been mastered by Russian travelers.  The city of Sanya, located on the south side of the island, is surrounded by cliffs and has access to the picturesque beaches of the South China Sea.  The air cleanliness is highly estimated by experts, according to this parameter Hainan takes the second place in the world due to a large percentage of greenery and tight control over production.  Residents of China are anxious about health, so here you will find healing procedures in the range: from traditional medicine with banks and leeches to modern diagnostic centers with the latest equipment.  The average air temperature in March is +28 ¬∞ C, water + 25 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  Maldives </h2><p>  Many travelers do not like the Maldives for a ‚Äúlazy‚Äù vacation and isolation from civilization, but this is the reason for the trip: a hammock in the shade of coconut palms, an ocean with a light breeze, hundreds and thousands of marine life and unobtrusive service.  This is the perfect gift for your beloved woman on a famous spring holiday.  The secret is that a burning tour in March to the Maldives will not hit your pocket very hard.  Night fishing under the starry sky - what could be more romantic.  The most visited atolls are Ari, Baa and Raa, Male, North and South Male. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fourseasons.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maldives" class="if uuid-2357208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68143/2357208.jpg"></div><h2>  Sri Lanka </h2><p>  Where to relax in March abroad for those who like to explore new lands through constant movement?  This is the island of Sri Lanka.  Fans of various modes of transport will be especially impressed: buses traveling at a frantic speed to the deafening rhythms of national songs, steam locomotives driving onto the platform directly from Indiana Jones films, cars tacking and masterfully dodging their larger brothers.  From the windows of these vehicles there is an opportunity to see landscapes of stunning beauty: mountains, cliffs, tea terraces, vegetation of all shades of green, which exist in the palette.  Having passed through the island, you should stop on the coast and recharge with the power of the Indian Ocean.  Add to your tour in March in Sri Lanka a visit to the small fishing village of Mirissu, where you can have dinner, sitting on the ocean in one of the cafes, freshly caught fish, shrimps and marine reptiles.  In a noisy Kut, you can have fun with a big company and choose a professional instructor to learn how to manage surf. </p><h2>  Indonesia </h2><p>  Forgot to make a wish for the battle of the Kremlin chimes?  Tours in March from Moscow and other cities in the direction of Indonesia will help catch up.  Indonesians celebrate New Year or Nyepi in the first spring month.  True, the airport does not work on this day because of the evil spirits that come to the surface, so it is better to arrive a little in advance.  March is the beginning of the dry season.  Therefore, lush tropical vegetation and deep waterfalls saturated during the rainy season are guaranteed. </p><p>  The most popular place is the island of Bali.  Ocean surfing, diving, island walks among rice terraces, coffee and chocolate trees, excellent infrastructure, shopping, more than six thousand hotels and one of the best water parks in the world are waiting for guests thinking about where to go to the sea in March. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.epicgapyear.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Surfing bali" class="if uuid-2357226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68143/2357226.jpg"></div><h2>  Philippines </h2><p>  From January to May is a great time to visit the Philippines to relax on the leading beaches of the planet, which are located on the islands of Boracay and Panglao.  This is a classic beach holiday: palm trees, hammocks, white sand and the gentle ocean.  A room in a luxury hotel here can be booked at a price of one hundred and thirty dollars a day.  Watching magnificent sunsets to the sound of the Pacific waves with a cocktail in hand is a pleasant picture that arises in response to the question of where to relax in March abroad.  Do not forget to tighten the fight against drug trafficking and at your own risk take any suspicious substances from the merchants for the sake of a few minutes of dubious pleasure. </p><h2>  Myanmar </h2><p>  Mysterious Myanmar (formerly known as Burma), which recently opened the borders for tourists, is also ready to compete for the title of owner of the best beaches in Southeast Asia.  Hotel construction in Ngapali is at an accelerated pace.  Compared to Thailand, there are much fewer people here, so there is an opportunity to see the country's original culture.  Tours in March to Myanmar will allow you to combine a beach holiday with energy recharge in one of the ‚Äúplaces of power‚Äù - the Shwedagon Pagoda, where relics of four Buddhas are stored: a staff, hair, part of a tunic and a water filter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="9to5less.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shwedagon Pagoda" class="if uuid-2357229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68143/2357229.jpg"></div><h2>  Singapore </h2><p>  On the southwestern coast of the island of Sentosa, in the Republic of Singapore, artificial beaches Siloso, Palawan, Tanjon have been created, which are in no way inferior to natural ones and will completely satisfy the request where a beach vacation in March is best.  This state is constantly following its motto: "Forward, Singapore."  Since 1959, an incredible leap has been made from a third world country to one of the states with the highest standard of living.  In addition to the beaches, there are a large number of interesting places, including a magnificent zoo, the Gardens by the Bay nature park, Universal Studio amusement park, fountain shows and a shopaholic paradise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Singapore giant trees" class="if uuid-2357231" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68143/2357231.jpg"></div><p>  Where to go in March to the sea, based on this diversity?  In any of the proposed places, taking into account personal preferences and the thickness of the wallet.  It is worth remembering that Southeast Asia is not only paradise beaches, a comfortable climate and a gentle ocean.  Poisonous snakes and fish, <span>sand fleas,</span> scorpions live in some places, dangerous plants grow.  An unpleasant discovery may be the fact that a cute little turtle easily clings to the finger, and a funny monkey will take away a banana and an expensive gadget.  The bite of a small mosquito threatens malaria.  Indonesia is still fighting rabies among dogs.  This is not a reason to refuse a trip, but before heading to a particular country, it is better to familiarize yourself with the safety rules so as not to spoil the vacation. </p>
