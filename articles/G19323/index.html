There are several translation options, we will analyze each of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="overclocked.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank logo" class="if uuid-3075649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3075649.jpg"></div><h2>  Service benefits </h2><p>  When connecting to the Mobile Bank service, Sberbank customers have the opportunity to: </p><ul><li>  Receive instant alerts on personal debit and credit card transactions; </li><li>  make payments and transfers using SMS commands. </li></ul><p>  It is about the second possibility that the information is presented in the article: how to make a mobile transfer to Sberbank by sending a short SMS message, knowing the recipient's phone number or the recipient's card number. </p><p>  You can connect the service using any ATM. </p><h2>  Transfer by phone number </h2><p>  As already described above, it is possible to transfer funds from your card to another client of Sberbank, knowing only his phone number attached to the card.  This allows customers not to give a bank card number to third parties, but to receive money thanks to a mobile phone attached to the card. </p><p>  Mobile transfer from Sberbank by phone number is as follows: </p><ol><li>  You must send an SMS message with the text "TRANSFER 911ABVGDEI 100".  In this message, the mentioned option "911ABVGDEI" represents the recipient‚Äôs mobile phone number (the one to whom you want to transfer funds), 100 - the amount to be transferred, indicated without kopecks. </li><li>  There is a single space between the word TRANSLATION and 911ABVGDEI.  There is also a single space between ‚Äú911ABVGDEI‚Äù and ‚Äú100‚Äù so that the system can determine the request correctly. </li><li>  SMS must be sent to 900. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money transaction" class="if uuid-3075645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3075645.jpg"></div><p>  Note!  An SMS message sent to 900 is charged as a standard outgoing message.  The exact cost must be obtained from the mobile operator.  Mobile transfer from Sberbank can also be done by card number.  And how to do this is discussed below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transfer by card number </h2><p>  So, Sberbank allows customers to transfer funds from their own card to another person‚Äôs card by its number located on the front side. </p><p>  For this, the client also needs to send an SMS message to 900. What should the message include?  Text "TRANSFER XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 100": </p><ul><li>  "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" - indicates a sixteen-digit bank card number, the combination of numbers is indicated without a space. </li><li>  "100" - the amount to be transferred, indicated excluding cents. </li></ul><p>  A single space is inserted between the words "TRANSFER" and "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX".  There is also a single space between "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" and "100" so that the system can determine the request correctly. </p><h2>  Money transfer by name </h2><p>  Sberbank allows you to make a mobile money transfer even more conveniently by assigning a name to the phone number.  To do this, send an SMS message to 900. In the message, type the following combination: "CALL 911XXXXXXX FAVORITE." </p><p>  Moreover, in this combination, ‚Äú911XXXXXXX‚Äù is the phone number of the person to whom the name is assigned, and ‚ÄúFAVORITE‚Äù is the short name associated with the phone number.  Moreover, customers are allowed to write a name both in Latin and Cyrillic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oplatezhah.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile Bank" class="if uuid-3075650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3075650.jpg"></div><h2>  Limitations </h2><p>  For transfers, the following restrictions are introduced: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Transactions are made in national currency - rubles. </li><li>  Transfers between currency cards are prohibited. </li><li>  The amount of transfer / receipt of funds per day should not exceed the amount of 8 thousand rubles. </li><li>  A maximum of 10 mobile operations are allowed per day. </li></ol><h2>  Other ways to transfer funds </h2><p>  A mobile transfer in Sberbank can be carried out not only by means of SMS messages, but also carried out in a mobile application.  Moreover, the utility also allows you to perform an operation by phone number and card number.  You can also select any person from your phone book so as not to enter contact information yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="obankax.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile app" class="if uuid-3075647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3075647.jpg"></div><p>  In the mobile application, all previous mobile transfers are saved.  Sberbank offers to repeat regular payments in automatic mode.  To do this, the Dialogs function is provided to the client, in which all previous customer transfers to each other are saved and visible immediately. </p><p>  Customers can also send requests for funds transfers.  For example, you have borrowed a certain amount.  After that, you can unobtrusively remind the borrower that the funds must be repaid. </p><p>  Mobile transfer from Sberbank is a convenient feature that allows you to make transfers in just a few seconds.  And this does not require either an ATM or an appeal to a bank branch, the client just needs an absolutely standard mobile phone with the function of sending SMS messages.  If you have a modern smartphone, money can also be transferred in the official mobile application. </p>
