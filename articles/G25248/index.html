    <h2>  Where is located </h2><p>  This hotel is located almost in the center of the main tourist zone of Nha Trang (500 m).  Although the hotel is a city hotel, the distance from it to the seashore is only about 100 m. Not far from this hotel there are several popular tourist attractions - the city sailing club, Tram Huong Tower, <span>Nha Trang</span> night <span>market.</span>  Various shops, bars and restaurants are located next to this hotel. </p><p>  Quite conveniently, this hotel, according to many tourists, is located in relation to the airport.  Maple Leaf Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang) vacationers who rented rooms here do not have to get to the hotel for too long.  Domestic tourists arrive, who decided to relax in Nha Trang, of course, usually to Kamran airport.  This air hub is located only about 25 km from the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourists attribute some of the minuses of this complex to the fact that the transfer buses of tour operators never reach the very entrance to it.  A few tens of meters, tourists who rented rooms here have to walk on foot with luggage in their hands.  The fact is that the Maple Leaf Hotel is located at the very end of a rather narrow lane.  And, unfortunately, the bus simply cannot turn around here.  When leaving the hotel, some vacationers give its administrator some money.  And those in this case organize the delivery of luggage of guests directly to the place of transfer stop. </p><p>  Of course, the fact that the bus does not reach this hotel can be attributed to its disadvantages.  But some tourists, on the contrary, consider this arrangement a great advantage of the hotel.  After all, the hotel is located in the very center of the vibrant tourist life of Nha Trang and at the same time in a very quiet place. </p><h2>  Maple Leaf Hotel Apartment 3 *: general hotel description </h2><p>  This complex took its first guests recently - in 2016. That is, this hotel is currently completely new.  From all sides this hotel is surrounded by other Vietnamese complexes.  Therefore, the views from the windows of her rooms usually open onto the walls of neighboring hotels.  But at the same time, the Maple Leaf building is quite large in comparison with the houses located next to it.  Therefore, tourists who check into the rooms of this hotel, starting from the 7th floor, can still enjoy either the city or the sea. </p>
