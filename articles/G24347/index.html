    <p>  Holidays in Tunisia will bring endless pleasure to everyone, because here everyone will find something to their liking.  You can learn <span>scuba diving</span> or ride a yacht, ride on purebred Arabian horses or meet the dawn during a jeep safari in the Sahara.  Some spend hours in thalassotherapy centers or simply sunbathe on wonderful beaches while sipping tropical cocktails. </p><h2>  Tunisia: hotels </h2><p>  Dessole Ruspina Hotel occupies a leading position in the rating of four-star hotels.  Since 2010, hotels in Tunisia have been classified according to the generally accepted international five-star system.  However, since such a division into categories has been introduced relatively recently, the level of hotels may actually not coincide with the declared level.  Therefore, when choosing a tour, you should give preference to that hotel, which belongs to a well-known large network. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  To imagine what level of service a particular hotel offers, it is worth looking at the cost of living.  One hundred and fifty dinars will cost a day of staying in the best five-star hotels, and one hundred and four-star, for example, at the Dessole Ruspina Hotel, which you can buy a tour to from any Russian tour operator today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dessole Ruspina Hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/499315.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  For children </h2><p>  Young guests of the hotel are given the opportunity to play in the outdoor playground, for them there is a swimming pool with fungus and water slides, where the baby can splash in fresh water.  If necessary, you can also get a high chair for visiting the restaurant and an extra bed in the room (on request). </p><p>  At the children's pool there are always Lifeguard - lifeguards.  Many tourists rate their work at five with a plus: guys with strong nerves are constantly busy with active kids, preventing them from being naughty and doing harm to themselves. </p><p>  In addition, Dessole Ruspina has a mini club, a room where the baby watches cartoons, and great children's animation. </p><h2>  Excursion program </h2>

No less interesting are the sights.  Once upon a time there was a Roman ancient city Ruspinna in its place.  It was from him that the name of the hotel went. <br>  In the fifth century, the Byzantines erected a powerful fortress protecting the commercial port.  The garrison was mainly monk warriors.  You can see everything and listen to the stories of guides by ordering a tour at the hotel.  You can go on a laser show, as well as on a safari, both on camels and jeeps.  The most popular excursion trip in Tunisia - to Carthage will not leave indifferent.  Walking through the ruins, many feel the unique atmosphere that once reigned here.  It was an unforgettable era, which can be learned from the stories of guides.

    <p>  Some excursions are more convenient to make with local guides, but if you want to explore the coast on your own, inexpensive car rental will help make the trip simply unforgettable. </p><h2>  Dessole Ruspina Hotel 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  In some matters, the opinions of vacationers differ.  Some consider the territory on which the hotel is built to be small, while others admire its thoughtfulness and design. </p><p>  Most of the opinions on food are unanimous: it is very tasty and varied: turkey, lamb, chicken, etc. A lot of vegetables and fruits.  And most importantly - there is plenty of everything, therefore, even if you come to dinner last, you will not stay hungry.  There are especially many enthusiastic reviews about fish, in particular tuna, as well as cakes, which, according to some, are simply divine.  There is, of course, dissatisfaction with the slowness of the waiters, as well as the fact that sometimes tables remained uncleared. </p>

    <p>  Opinions are different regarding the rooms, although all as one they say that this is not the main thing. </p><p>  Sea ... Almost everyone is warned about the beach: there is an opportunity to run into poisonous jellyfish, so many parents strictly monitor that children swim only in the fenced area. </p><p>  The animation at the hotel is good.  A lot of praise has been written about the staff, who, although they do not understand the Russian language, accurately capture the problem and fix it instantly. </p><p>  In short, the hotel can have a good rest with and without children. </p>
