This location is very good in terms of choosing a vacation program.  After all, you can stay in a sanatorium, and spend time outdoors on the beach in a park or enjoying the beauty of the reserve. </p><h2>  What does the Green Island base in Berdsk offer? </h2><p>  The territory of the complex is a pine forest, in which a lot of interesting things for children and adults are hidden.  First of all, these are comfortable double wooden houses.  They can comfortably spend several days.

The beach is sandy, there are no stones, but trunks of trees that have fallen into the water often come to the surf.  This is not surprising, because almost the entire coast is densely covered with pine forest, due to which there is an unusually clean and "tasty" air. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zelenyj-ostrov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sports field in the park &quot;Green Island&quot;" class="if uuid-2423296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75478/2423296.jpg"></div><p>  The bottom is safe, and even near the surf shallow.  This is one of the reasons why people loved to come here for a swim and sunbathe with their young children.  Kids can splurge freely in shallow water, without fear, a stone's throw from the coast to go headlong into the water.  But, of course, adults need to look after the kids very carefully. </p><h2>  What should you worry about before going to the park? </h2><p>  Entrance to the territory of the Green Island park in Berdsk is paid year-round.  Cost in 2018 - 50 rubles.  per person, for children - free of charge.  And then it all depends on how exactly visitors want to spend their time.  Often guests are located in free areas with tents and barbecue facilities.  In this case, the administration will charge a fee for the rental of space and equipment.  In other words, money must be taken with you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zelenyj-ostrov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paintball Field in Green Island Park" class="if uuid-2423302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75478/2423302.jpg"></div><p>  Given that for the most part the Green Island park in Berdsk is a forest belt, here you can encounter all the "charms" of outdoor recreation.  So, it is worth taking care of the supply of water with you, a snack for the whole company, as well as insect repellents.  If there is a desire to fry shish kebabs, then it is not necessary to carry a barbecue grill, but a means for ignition, coal, and meat - this must be bought in advance.  The park has its own bar and cafe, where you can have lunch or dinner if you wish. </p><p>  Although Novosibirsk is far from the south, you can sunbathe on the beach at the height of summer for your pleasure.  And this means that not only swimwear will be useful, but also towels, panamas, and flip flops for swimming.  For the kids, put sandcastle toys in the bag.  It is clean here, so they will certainly enjoy such entertainment. </p>
