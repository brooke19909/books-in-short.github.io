    <h2>  Negative hotel reviews of Aldemar Royal Mare Suites (Greece, Crete, Hersonissos) </h2><p>  It is worth noting that an objective impression of a resort can be made only on the basis of traveler reviews.  Holidays in Aldemar Royal Mare is a cherished dream of many tourists.  Nevertheless, in order not to be disappointed, you should know about some of the negative characteristics of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  the furniture and plumbing in the rooms are a bit dated, and therefore require replacement; </li><li>  going into the sea a few meters, you will find that the bottom is strewn with sharp stones; </li><li>  maids do not pay any attention to balconies and terraces during cleaning; </li><li>  for many guests, the dress code in the restaurant comes as a surprise (if you do not have the appropriate clothing, that is, the possibility of delivering food to your room); </li><li>  in the sand on the beach there are a lot of cigarette butts, candy wrappers and other garbage; </li><li>  there are a lot of ants in the rooms (especially the problem is relevant for the first floor); </li><li>  guests of neighboring hotels are allowed on the territory of a private beach, which often causes crowds and conflicts; </li><li>  old metal deck chairs; </li><li>  lamb dishes are poorly pickled, and therefore practically do not chew; </li><li>  there is practically no animation at the hotel (with the exception of entertainment for children and live music in the evenings); </li><li>  ordering a room with a double bed, you are likely to get a couple shifted; </li><li>  shabby bathrobes; </li><li>  very slippery and cold tiles on the bathroom floor; </li><li>  there are always strong waves on the hotel beach (it is possible to find a quieter place, but the entrance there is paid); </li><li>  there is no normal bar on the beach (of all amenities - a tent with water and beer); </li><li>  paid tea, coffee and drinking water in the restaurant (although you can go down to the bar for free drinks); </li><li>  slippery tiles by the pool; </li><li>  mini-cars that drive around the hotel emit a disgusting smell of gasoline and make a lot of noise; </li><li>  the bottom of the pools is not cleaned; </li><li>  Carpets in the corridors of the hotel almost never vacuum. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Hotels with a large green area are very popular among travelers.  That is why in this institution the rooms are booked for several months in advance.  Here you can admire beautiful architecture, a huge number of plants, as well as numerous pools.  Hotel workers deserve special attention.  They will give you a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat Cretan hospitality is.  The main feature of the resort complex is the luxurious thalasso center.  In one of the best spa salons in the world, you can undergo many anti-aging treatments, restore your health and improve well-being.  A delicious addition to the rest will be a delicious and satisfying meal.  Here you will have no shortage of fresh vegetables and fruits, as well as meat and fish dishes prepared according to original recipes. </p>
