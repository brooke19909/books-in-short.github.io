    <p>  Children liked the unusual shapeless mass, which could be fearlessly thrown against any wall, wrinkled in hands, crushed, torn to pieces, and it subsequently assumed its original form. </p><p>  They created the first version of handgam in the USA in 1976.  Translated from English, this word means "manual chewing gum."  The mass is viscous to the touch, does not melt, does not leave spots, can have a different color.  A child who constantly kneads a jelly-like base develops the motor skills of fingers and hands.  Handgam has a relaxing effect on the baby‚Äôs nervous system. </p><h2>  Clever plasticine </h2><p>  Now many variations of this toy are thought up.  Clever or nanoplastic, lizun, hendgam fell in love not only with children, but also with adults.  Its properties are unusual and varied.  The slime is like a viscous liquid flowing smoothly from one hand to another, when squeezing it seeps between the fingers.  If thrown on a wall, it will slowly drain off a jelly-like mass.  At the same time, the wallpaper remains clean, without oily stains and traces.  That's why mothers are not against <span>pampering children.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you make a lump and put it on the table, a puddle will soon form.  But with firm crushing into a ball, a lizun can even bounce off the floor like a ball.  In this case, the mass behaves like a solid.  It can also be stretched out like an elastic band.  With strong tension, the slime will crack and rupture. </p><h2>  Variety of handgams </h2><p>  Many subspecies of handgam have been created: ordinary, glowing in the dark and even magnetic lizun.  It is sold in boxes and plastic packaging along with a small square magnet.  From clever plasticine, you can sculpt various figures, divide into parts, combine colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make magnetic slime" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1799707.jpg" width="472"></div>

    <p>  At the same time, the hands do not get dirty at all, unlike a simple analogue.  Children, playing, learn to fantasize, remember colors and shades, while the mood rises.  The game unites all members of the family. </p><p>  Many adults are interested in the question of what ingredients this polymer consists of; is it not dangerous to play with it and whether it is possible to make a similar composition at home. </p><h2>  Preparing for an exciting job </h2><p>  In the manufacture of a solution for this toy there is nothing complicated.  All components can be quickly found if you wish.  But before you make the mixture for magnetic lizun, you need to prepare the basis for ordinary nanoplastin.  To do this, you need to take a glass bowl in which the mixture will be mixed, a wooden or plastic stick.  In the stationery store you need to purchase PVA glue.  It must be thick, otherwise the desired consistency will not come out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself magnetic lizun" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1799709.jpg" width="478"></div>

In another way - borax or sodium tetraborate.  This is an antiseptic that is freely and inexpensively available at your local pharmacy.  It is better to take this solution in 20% glycerol.  Thanks to him, then the slime does not stick to his hands.  No prescription required. </p><h2>  Cooking basics </h2><p>  In a prepared bowl you need to pour 100 grams of glue and 3-5 drops of food coloring.  Add a vial of sodium tetraborate.  Mix well again, until the solution begins to thicken, the mass acquires a jelly-like consistency. </p><p>  After this process, the resulting nanoplastic is placed on clean paper and blotted from all sides.  As a result of such manipulations, excess fluid is released.  The last action remains: put it in a plastic bag and carefully crush it with your hands to make the mass more elastic.  It will be enough 5 minutes. </p><p>  If the first time did not work, do not despair.  You just need to increase the proportion of borax and repeat the action again.  The process will take several additional minutes. </p><h2>  Rules to Know </h2><p>  If you decide to do the chemical experiment yourself and make a toy, you need to understand the details well, watch the video, for example, on the China Bugaga. Magnetic Slime channel.  On the Internet sites described many versions of this mixture.  And on YouTube, the manufacture of both a smart handgam and magnetic slime at home is shown in detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cognitive magnetic slime" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/1799612.jpg" width="585"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But there are some caveats in working with the material: </p><p>  1. If a child suffers from allergies, then dye is not recommended.  The toy can be left colorless. </p><p>  2. Immediately after mixing, it is better not to take the composition with your bare hands, as it is very sticky and will be difficult to remove later.  Wearing rubber gloves is recommended. </p><p>  3. After adding borax, a quick thickening occurs, so stir should be started immediately. </p><p>  4. Smart plasticine is inedible, so do not allow young children to play without adults.  They like to taste everything, and this is dangerous. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  The kid after the game may forget to hide the jelly-like mass in a bag or jar.  This happens often with children.  As a result, the slime may harden.  The child was upset, what should I do?  The answer is simple.  You need to put the mass in a glass jar with a lid, add a few drops of water to the bottom.  During the night, the liquid is absorbed, and the mass acquires its original appearance. </p><p>  If after preparing smart plasticine it is impossible to form a ball, and when stretched, individual threads are obtained, this means that a lot of sodium tetraborate is added to the composition.  It does not matter, it will be enough to dilute it with a small amount of glue or water. </p><h2>  What is magnetic slime? </h2><p>  A pinch of iron oxide is added to the nanoplasticine and thoroughly mixed.  It turns out a jelly-like mass, which has the properties of a metal.  It is attracted by a magnet, forming elongated parts.  The closer you bring the magnet to the toy, the faster the reaction.  If you leave a magnet, especially powerful, not far from plasticine, then the lizun will gradually and smoothly creep onto the metal, which will be inside the mixture. </p><p>  With magnetic slider you can fantasize and play.  Plasticine acquires a certain dynamics of movements.  The trunk of an elephant can be moved.  The hands of a stuck man will rise and fall.  The tentacles of an octopus can examine the bottom of the ocean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="china bugag magnetic lizun" class="if" height="492" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/1799619.jpg" width="588"></div>

    <p>  Such a toy will bring a lot of pleasure to children, will immediately cheer up a little cognizer. </p><p>  Magnetic lizun is a training tool for the study of the properties of metals and magnets.  Children in a playful way comprehend the basics of physics and chemistry.  It is advisable to invite a child to <span>make a magnetic</span> slime with his own hands, so that he also participates in the process of creating a handgam.  Only wear gloves and goggles for your baby in case the solution splashes when mixing. </p><h2>  How to make magnetic slime at home? </h2><p>  There are several manufacturing options.  But the basis for any mixes will be prepared and previously described clever plasticine.  It is clear that the mixture is magnetized, you need to add small particles of metal there, but where to get them?  The roughest and easiest way will be to rub the file with a metal rod.  But at the same time, a lot of time and effort will be spent.  If possible, it is easier to add a little powder of iron oxide.  But not everyone knows where to look for him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="magnetic lizun at home" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/1799613.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The easier option for cooking is the developer available to many users of laser printers.  It is a fine black powder that mixes easily with a jelly-like mass.  It is not difficult to order it on the Internet or buy in a computer equipment store.  If desired, <span>phosphoric paint</span> can be added to the mixture <span>.</span>  Then, in the dark, plasticine will glow, which will cause enthusiastic cries of the kids.  Before going to bed, you can tell fairy tales to your child in the dark, accompanying their performance with luminous characters. </p><h2>  Plasticine experiments </h2><p>  If the plasticine is open for a long time in a warm room, the moisture from it completely evaporates, and the properties change.  It hardens and becomes extremely dense.  By the way, such a mass can be used as a sealant in the household. </p><p>  A thin film made from the mixture draws in dirt and sucks in pieces of debris.  You can clean the surface of the keyboard for laptops or rugs. </p><p>  From hardened plasticine, you can make casts of objects: keys, small parts of the designer, dolls, etc. Even a child will cope with this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make magnetic slime at home" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1799711.jpg" width="454"></div>

    <p>  When buying a finished product, you never know what it is actually made of.  When purchasing plasticine in a jar, be prepared that it contains harmful chemicals.  Making the mixture on his own, a person understands what his child is going to play with.  But unlike factory, home-made material will be short-lived.  After a few weeks, it begins to dry out and lose its basic qualities.  Will have to make a new composition.  Decide and choose the buyer what is best for his children. </p>
