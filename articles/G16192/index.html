Many people have already managed to visit the island and left their impressions of the time spent.  About them and the main aspects of entertainment described in the article. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Holidays in Sicily are quite expensive, especially in high season.  Travel companies promote an unforgettable time on the largest island in the Mediterranean.  The climate here is quite mild, which is typical of the region.

The island is washed by three seas at once, although most people prefer to rest near the Mediterranean.  The reason lies in the pleasant sandy coastline.  The Ionian Sea and Tyrrhenian are famous for their stony volcanic beaches.  This is observed mainly in the north of the region, and in the south there is a place on the soft sands for all comers.  Sicily is famous for its resorts, each of which is somewhat different.  For example, Taormina is considered the most attractive place for young people, where life in the dark only flares up with renewed vigor.  A film festival takes place here in the summer, and there are a large number of cultural attractions.  This place has long been called the capital of the region in terms of the availability of historical monuments.  Such versatility attracts a large number of people from all over the world to the fashionable resort. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.massimovillas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in sicily reviews" class="if uuid-2317806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2317806.jpg"></div><h2>  Other resorts </h2><p>  If tourists are interested in architecture and monuments, then hotels for relaxing in Sicily are best looked for in Syracuse.  It is an incredibly beautiful city where every corner breathes history.  A large number of buildings in this place have their own unique plot, which may interest lovers of attractions.  In terms of beaches, Syracuse does not lose to other resorts.  Natural sandy spaces stretch for many kilometers. </p><p>  In addition to the cultural part, tourists will be able to plunge into a more modern atmosphere.  The infrastructure of entertainment facilities, cafes and restaurants is also well developed.  Young people and couples with children will be equally comfortable here.  Messina Resort is distinguished by its location, where people are protected by the Peloritan Mountains.  In addition to all the advantages noted above, this place for relaxation boasts also vivid music shows.  In any case, rest in Sicily can be arranged on your own at the end of the season, when prices will be much lower.  It is enough to rent a place of residence for yourself, and there will be no problems with the program. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sicilytours.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sicily vacation with children" class="if uuid-2317810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2317810.jpg"></div><h2>  Cultural rest </h2><p>  Not a single person is mistaken if he decides to spend the best vacation in Sicily watching architecture and other historical places.  Here the primacy is held by the capital of Palermo - a port city with a powerful history and many historical monuments, such as temples, cathedrals and other things.  Of particular note is the Church of St. John the Hermit, which, thanks to the red domes, cannot be confused with another building.  Here you should definitely pay a visit to the Norman Castle and the Massimo Theater, popular among travelers.  Magnificent buildings are simply asked to take some photos in the background. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next stop for cultural holidays on the island will be the city of Syracuse.  Even in ancient times, this place was a large settlement, which developed from a political and cultural point of view.  Archimedes himself was born here and Plato lived in his time, who created several of his creations in Sicily.  The attention of users are presented theaters and amphitheaters of ancient times, the cave of the Ear of Dionysius and much more.  From here you can go to the island of Ortigia - a place with a long history.  The last stop on this road will be Montreal with the Benedictine Cathedral, built in the twelfth century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lagazzettaitaliana.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sicily is the best vacation" class="if uuid-2317812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2317812.jpg"></div><h2>  Other attractions </h2><p>  Holidays with children in Sicily can be devoted not only to viewing memorabilia.  The child will definitely like the local water parks with a huge variety of entertainment.  For an unforgettable experience, it is recommended that travelers rent a yacht and feel like real captains.  The season for walking on the calm sea lasts from April to November.  The natural nature of Sicily can also interest any tourist.  Around the highest volcano in Europe, called Etna, a reserve of the same name was formed with its unimaginable beauty.  And these are far from all the sights.  In every, even a small town, there is a place that will amaze a person to the core.  Even simple hikes along the coastline and watching the sunset promise to be remembered for a long time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.island-on-map.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays in sicily tourists reviews" class="if uuid-2317815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2317815.jpg"></div><h2>  Great cuisine </h2><p>  In addition to enjoying the surrounding beauties and a beach holiday in Sicily, every traveler will enjoy the local cuisine.  It has been formed over the past millennia and each people that lived on the island brought something of their own to it.  The cuisine in this region is rightly considered similar to Italian, but the gourmet will notice the influence of other nationalities.  In many dishes, the influence of Spanish, Arab and Greek culture in the field of food processing is visible.  Every tourist should try here branded rice balls stuffed with aranchini, pasta alla norm, which is prepared with a special frying of vegetables and ricotta.  And do not forget about the signature Sicilian pizza, the recipe of which they tried to inherit around the world.  Do not lose in this regard and desserts, which are also diverse in their recipes.  There is a traditional fruit combination called frutta martorana, a round cake with nuts of all kinds of bucchellato and delicious wafer rolls with incredibly tasty cheese inside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="adventuredaze.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sicily vacation hotels" class="if uuid-2317821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2317821.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews about relaxation and atmosphere </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that travel companies do not embellish in the description of the magnificent spending time on the island.  Reviews of holidays in Sicily on behalf of different tourists confirm this.  Every person who visited this magical place was as satisfied as possible, most say that even a few weeks becomes too little.  All people are fascinated by the atmosphere of measured life and local color.  The island slowly wakes up, fishermen go to sea to start catching a variety of delicacies, which are very popular.  Residents do not look like Italians from the peninsula, because they are calmer and always open for conversation.  Travelers note a poor knowledge of English among the population, but they do their best to help when they are contacted.  A measured rest is supported by the presence of a huge number of historical buildings.  They are well preserved and at first glance carry people to those times when the construction was just completed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.italianluxury.consulting" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sicily sea holidays" class="if uuid-2317822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2317822.jpg"></div><h2>  Sea, sand and entertainment </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists about holidays in Sicily did not pass by and the main reason for the trip is the beautiful beaches of the Mediterranean Sea.  They attract natural views of the coastline, as well as warm water.  It‚Äôs warm enough to swim even in the middle of autumn; the water temperature is kept at twenty degrees.  Tourists noted that the beaches in different places can be very different from each other, and therefore stay in one place here is not worth it.  This fact applies to other entertainment.  If a person came to Sicily, then it is worth looking at it from different angles.  Small cities are very different from large settlements of the Palermo type.  Life in the capital never stops; markets are teeming with people.  Fresh seafood and other foods can be bought without problems.  Establishments for evening entertainment are also enough here, the infrastructure is at the highest level.  Prices for buying branded items are much lower than in the CIS countries, and therefore shopping can be another entertainment. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  From all of the above, it becomes clear that a vacation at sea in Sicily will appeal to every person, regardless of their preferences.  The island is so multifaceted that every person can find entertainment here.  Young people are advised to pay attention to the vibrant nightlife, as well as regular festivals that take place in the region.  Culture lovers should visit Palermo, Syracuse and Montreal, where there are an incredible number of attractions from different eras.  For families, cafes and restaurants with original cuisine are provided.  Children will remember trips to the sea on a yacht for life, as well as time spent in local water parks.  According to the reviews of travelers who have visited the island, we can conclude that this is one of the most magical places in the world.  You will want to come back here after the first trip, and during the departure you will get longing and memories of how good it was these days. </p>
