Every day it is visited by hundreds of thousands of guests, tourists, businessmen.  Of course, when planning a trip, you need to take care of the accommodation in advance. </p><h2>  District features </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.6238902" data-lng="37.54814499999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/2/2/4/8224.png"></div><p>  Of course, the choice of hotels in the capital is huge, but in this case, choosing one option or another, you should first of all start from the goals of the trip, as well as the location.  So, say, if you decide to enjoy the beauties of the city, get acquainted with all its sights, it is better to be located in the center.  For a longer stay, it is worth taking a closer look at the more budget options located in sleeping areas.  The south-west of Moscow is quite a profitable place in every respect.  There are no problems with transport, because you can get to anywhere in the city using both underground and ground transportation.  At the same time, it is relatively quiet, a lot of greenery and vegetation. </p><p>  As part of this material, we will consider the best hotels in the south-west of Moscow.
