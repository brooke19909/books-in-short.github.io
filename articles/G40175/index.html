    <p>  The building was built in the old German style.  Its interior has been preserved almost in its original form, with the exception of the Prussian coat of arms above the ticket office, which has been replaced by Polish.  Particular attention should be paid to ceramics floors and stained-glass windows, which depict the coats of arms of neighboring ones.  Overhaul of the building was completed in 2014 and today it delights with its majestic beauty.  Today, there is a tourist information center.  Therefore, immediately after arrival, you can pick up a city tour at a convenient time for you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Malbork Castle </h2><p>  This huge, largest castle complex in the world rises on the right bank of the Nogat River.  <span>Marienburg (</span> Mary's <span>Castle</span> ), today more often called Malbork.  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã20 hectares.  And today it is of interest to amateurs and specialists in the field of castle architecture and history.  And not only.  It strikes with its beauty all the guests of the city, even those who are not too susceptible to the splendor of ancient palaces. </p><p>  Malbork Castle (Poland) was included in the UNESCO list in 1997.  Tourists from Europe visit it with pleasure. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  <span>Malbork Castle</span> (Poland), the photo of which you see in this article, is surrounded by three levels of brick high walls.  It consists of three parts: Low, Middle and High castles.  In addition, the church of St. Lawrence and administrative premises are located on the territory.  The courtyard of the Middle Castle is decorated with statues of the great masters of the Teutonic Order.  Tourists are amazed at the multitude, like sculptures soaring in the air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malbork poland photo" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1396272.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The High Castle is the oldest part of the complex.  Once its buildings served as a meeting place (Capitulation) for the supreme rulers of the Teutonic Order.  There is a legend, not documented, that in one of the many dungeons of this castle, the innumerable riches of this organization are stored. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The castle buildings were divided according to their purpose: monastic knights lived in the High Castle, the premises of the Middle Castle were intended for officials and guests, and the Low Castle housed utility rooms - bakeries, workshops, stables and other services.  After the end of the thirteen-year war of the Poles with the crusaders, the castle became one of the residences of the kings of Poland. </p><p>  At the end of XIX, Malbork (Poland) was reconstructed.  An interesting fact - funds for this were collected using lotteries.  During the war with the Nazis, the castle was badly damaged and was partially restored in the postwar years.  Restoration work continues to this day. </p><h2>  Museum </h2><p>  Since 1960, a museum has been operating on the premises of the castle, which displays several exhibits.  The most extensive of them is devoted to the history of a grandiose structure.  The attention of visitors is attracted to collections of amber products, armor of different eras and weapons. </p><p>  The museum often hosts theatrical performances and concerts, various celebrations.  According to visitors' reviews, the silhouettes of the ancient structure at night are very impressive when they are illuminated by spotlights.  Here you can often see jousting tournaments and historical dramas, which are usually accompanied by sound effects.  After these activities, guided night tours are provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="poland malbork hotels" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1396270.jpg" width="600"></div>
