Unfortunately, many of us do not have the opportunity to travel all year round, so we really expect a lot from the long-awaited vacation.  Some tourists are so tired that their only desire is to be in a heavenly place surrounded by the sea, lie on a warm sand and in this position spend all the days of their planned vacation.  Other tourists prefer a more active vacation, are open to everything new, are happy to go on excursions, walks.  Well, most of us want to combine beach and sightseeing holidays within one trip.  So which direction to choose?  Greece is a great resort that will suit many. </p>

    <p>  You can prepare breakfast, lunch or dinner in the kitchenette, equipped with a stove, mini fridge and a set of household appliances.  Moreover, each room of The Residence Family &amp; Fun Hotel 4 * has a balcony.  In the mornings, many tourists settle in comfortable wicker furniture with a cup of coffee and enjoy the sound of the surf. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some tourists claim that the Hotel Residence Family &amp; Fun 4 * (Ialyssos) from the outside looks much more impressive and presentable than from the inside.  Indeed, in some places there are traces of fresh repairs, and not of the highest quality.  Furniture is not the newest, but quite high quality and comfortable. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Of course, all vacationers are concerned about the infrastructure of The Residence Family &amp; Fun 4 * (Rhodes).  Reviews of tourists confirm that the territory is impressive, it has everything that is needed on vacation: a reception open 24 hours a day, its own restaurant, a floating bar, a fresh water pool, as well as several shops and souvenir shops.

    <p>  The pool is big enough, they clean it every day.  For all vacationers, the use of sunbeds and umbrellas by the pool is free. </p><p>  The spa is the pride of the Residence Family Fun 4 * hotel.  It is equipped with the latest technology, which makes it a favorite place for guests to relax.  It has a heated indoor pool, massage room and a range of beauty treatments. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  A 4 * hotel should impress with its service.  Many tourists coming to the Residence Family Fun 4 * hotel note the courtesy, attentiveness and hospitality of the staff.  Some populate even before the designated time.  Agree, after a tiring flight, I want to get the room keys as soon as possible, put things out, change clothes and go to the sea.  The hotel staff can be contacted for any questions, here you will definitely be helped to decide on an excursion program, options for organizing your leisure, and also in the shortest possible time will eliminate all problems. </p><p>  Now for the cleaning of rooms at the Residence Family &amp; Fun 4 * hotel.  The hotel administration promises excellent service, but the rooms are cleaned disgustingly.  For a week stay, the staff comes only a few times.  The cleaning is superficial: obviously no one has heard about plumbing cleaning and floor cleaning.  Towels and bed linen are changed every 2-3 days, sometimes only once for the entire stay.  For a 4 star hotel this is simply unacceptable.  The hotel administration needs to eliminate this drawback if they do not want to lose tourists. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The Residence Family and Fun 4 * Hotel (Rhodes) offers all-inclusive meals.  All vacationers are waited by refined European and national Greek cuisine.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served in the hotel's buffet restaurant.  The bar offers non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks of excellent quality and a fairly wide range. </p>

    <p>  Food is the hotel‚Äôs strength.  The food here is excellent: the tables literally "tumble down" from the abundance of dishes - no one will remain hungry.  There is no need to come early, take seats - tables are constantly replenished. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Going on vacation, especially to the resort, each of us plans to spend most of the time at sea.  So, I would like it to be as close to the hotel as possible. </p><p>  An excellent sandy beach is a 5-minute walk away.  The sea is clean, sometimes not the most pleasant entry into the water - but just walk along the coast, as the problem disappears.  There is a rental point for water and sports equipment, as well as a bar where you can enjoy refreshments and snacks. </p>

    <p>  In general, the beach is quite clean.  Here you can meet many vacationers with young children.  Moreover, many note a comfortable climate, a fresh and cool breeze, which makes relaxing on the beach unforgettable. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  In general, The Residence Family and Fun 4 * hotel is a good option for a family vacation.  The hotel is located in one of the most developed areas of the resort in close proximity to all infrastructure.  Of course, this option is not without drawbacks, first of all, the dirt in the rooms, but it offers good living conditions: spacious rooms, excellent food, equipped territory, proximity to the sea. </p><p>  If you are staying in Rhodes, take a look at this option.  Many tourists and vacationers noted that this is an excellent combination of price and quality of services provided. </p>
