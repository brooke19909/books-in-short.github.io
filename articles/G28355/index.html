    <h2>  Object Overview </h2><p>  The airfield "Chkalovsky" refers to the first class.  The complex can accept all types of helicopters, as well as light aircraft.  For example, Tu-154, Il-62, An-124 and the like.  State Airline "223rd Flight Detachment" is based on it.  This organization is an enterprise that carries out commercial transportation using military aircraft.  In addition to the aircraft of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, the complex has every reason to accept aircraft of Roscosmos, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as well as civilians.  The latter - only by prior agreement.  The complex is an aerodrome of joint distribution.  A base is deployed on it, which includes special forces: 206, 353 and 354. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of Chkalovsky airfield </h2>

    <p>  In the past, a separate test and training aviation regiment of special purpose No. 70 was located on the territory of the complex. This formation named after V. S. Seregin was included in the RGNII CPK.  The military unit was armed with such models as L-39, Tu-154, Il-76MDK and Tu-134.  Research Institute of the CPC named after Yu. A. Gagarin was formed several years ago.  It was created on the basis of the 70th aviation unit.  At her disposal were flight technical elements and aircraft of the former regiment.  Also earlier on the territory was the 8th Special Purpose Pilot Division, which was disbanded in 2010.  The units that the Chkalovsky airfield takes today <span>(military unit</span> 42829, other military units) include four security and maintenance battalions. </p><h2>  Development and operation </h2><p>  V.S. Chernomyrdin approved a special Government Order.  From that moment, the Chkalovsky airfield, the address of which is indicated above, became open for flights of military aircraft.  The object received international status.  Air cargo and charter civil passenger flights passed through it under one-time orders.  At the end of the 20th century, OJSC Chkalovsky Airport was organized and it was also planned to open a special passenger terminal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="military airfield Chkalovsky" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448632.jpg" width="400"></div>

It was assumed that the aircraft of the Russian Air Force will be flown in two flights per week.  However, a prohibition order was issued by the relevant authorities.  It was a refusal to issue a license for this type of aviation security activity to Chkalovsky Airport.  The official reason was the non-compliance of the applicant with the necessary conditions and requirements. </p><h2>  Empowerment </h2><p>  The airline complex is one of the contenders for the fourth international airport of the capital.  However, the Chkalovsky airdrome has a big drawback in the struggle for this important status in the Moscow air hub.  Transport accessibility makes it less competitive.  This year, a final decision was made on this issue.  To address this shortcoming, an official permit was obtained from the Ministry of Natural Resources.  In order to be able to build a double of the six-lane Shchelkovo highway, you will have to cut down more than forty hectares of forest.  Also among such objects will be Elk Island, which is part of the national park.  The length of the new road will be more than twenty kilometers.  The route is planned to be laid to bypass settlements.  The journey by car will take less than fifteen minutes (from the Moscow Ring Road to the point "Chkalovsky Aerodrome").  How to get to the object, it will be clear at the end of construction work.  Now the object can be reached by public transport.  Access to the Chkalovsky Aerodrome sign is as follows: from the bus terminal of the capital (Central) (metro station Shchelkovskaya) by minibus or bus number 375, 321, 380, 320, 378. By car, the route runs along the Shchelkovo highway. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chkalovsky airdrome address" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448634.jpg" width="559"></div>

The idea belongs to Rainier de Graaf, an architect from Holland.  It was assumed that one of the networks was intended for electric public transport, and the other for high-speed rail.  They were supposed to connect the periphery around the Vnukovo, Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo and Chkalovsky complexes.  The latter, according to the Dutchman, needs to be reorganized into a cargo air port.  Thus, he has every chance of becoming one of the largest in the world. </p><h2>  Reconstruction Options </h2><p>  At the beginning of last (2013), the third international conference "The Jet Fuel Market of Russia" was held.  One of the most significant speeches at it was the speech of <span>Vladimir Nazarov.</span>  In his speech, the vice president of Transnefteproduct said that negotiations with another leading company are in full swing at this time.  In case of their successful outcome, the Chkalovsky military airdrome will be connected to the branch from the ring main oil pipeline.  This element has been around for quite some time.  However, the last pumping through it from KNPP to the airline complex was carried out for a long time.  The Moscow ring oil pipeline is a structural connection, which consists of three looped pipeline threads.  They transport diesel fuel, gasoline and kerosene.  In this case, the substances do not mix with each other.  KNPP is connected to the Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo and Vnukovo airlines.  There are also special pipelines from the Ryazan oil refinery and the capital's refinery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chkalovsky airfield in the Moscow region" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448635.jpg" width="522"></div>

    <h2>  Crash of An-26RT <strong> </strong></h2><p>  This event <strong> </strong>  happened in 1988.  The aircraft made a training flight, the purpose of which was exercises in take-off and landing at night without the use of headlights and searchlights.  After making a successful landing, the crew members decided to perform an unplanned take-off from the conveyor.  To carry out their plan, they had to make a sharp movement of the engine control knob according to the position indicator of the fuel handle.  Immediately before takeoff itself, the blades of the propeller of the right engine rotated to a position in which the effect of this element on the drag of the aircraft becomes minimal.  However, the aircraft crew could not notice this in time and continued to take off.  At a sufficiently high altitude at a speed of about 200 km / h, the engine stopped.  The personnel tried to launch <span>an auxiliary power plant.</span>  Unfortunately, all three attempts were performed incorrectly.  The crew did not follow the requirements of the instructions and launched the right engine at unauthorized low speed and altitude.  The device switched to stall mode.  As a result of this, the plane crashed into a small pond, touching the roof of a summer house during the fall.  Then it collapsed and burned.  The tragedy occurred in the village of Kudinovo, fifteen kilometers from the Chkalovsky aviation complex.  Six people died - all crew members (ship commander, flight engineer, flight technician, assistant commander, radar operator and navigator). </p><h2>  The collapse of the IL-75DT </h2><p>  In the summer of 2001, this cargo plane owned by Rus Airlines flew to the city of Norilsk.  Take-off was completed at a speed that significantly exceeded the allowable.  The ship's commander, at an altitude of about ten meters, began to make a right turn with a roll of several degrees to compensate for a deviation to the left of the take-off course.  Having gained altitude during these actions, the crew shifted the stabilizer in the absence of a compensating deviation of the height lever.  The sequence of these manipulations is in violation of the norms and recommendations of the flight operation manual.  The reason for the loss of control over the stabilizer is probably its installation in a position that actually does not correspond to the value of centering and weight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chkalovsky airfield military unit 42829" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448636.jpg" width="550"></div>  A special commission conducted a detailed investigation of the accident.  As a result, it was found that control of the stabilizer during take-off is a regular and characteristic violation of the ship's commander.  In addition, it turned out that the crew often performed similar actions when the aircraft was torn off.  A few seconds before a collision with an obstacle, which was a tree at the take-off course, an attempt was made to deflect the elevator.  Unfortunately, there was not enough time to complete the maneuver, and a clash was inevitable.  At a height of twenty-two meters, the ship collided with trees.  As a result of the incident, the third and fourth engines failed, and the landing gears were also severely damaged.  As a result, the aircraft crashed into the ground and collapsed.  Before the plane was dispatched, its loading scheme was not drawn up.  During the investigation, the commission was able to establish that the take-off mass of the vessel exceeded the maximum allowable rate by several tons.  After the crash, ignition of <span>aviation kerosene</span> from the tanks occurred.  To prevent the outbreak of the fire, all the forces of the Ministry of Emergencies were used.  The fact that the board fell in the forest, and not at one of the many nearby settlements, can be considered a happy coincidence.  All people on the plane died.  Among them were two passengers and eight crew members.

    <h2>  Accident Prevention Tu-154 </h2><p>  Three years ago, a plane crash in the Moscow region was prevented.  This is a merit of professionalism and skill of military pilots.  This <span>aircraft has</span> been parked for more than ten years.  It was decided to move it from the airfield to carry out major repairs.  During takeoff, a complete failure of the ship control system occurred.  The crew managed to keep the plane in horizontal position with the help of engines.  The personnel alternately changed the position of their ailerons and traction.  Despite all efforts, the ship was losing altitude and heavily inclined.  During the second attempt, the pilots managed to make a safe landing on the strip of the Chkalovsky airfield.  Thanks to the skillful actions of the crew members, it was possible to prevent a crash and avoid human casualties.  A special audit established the cause of the incident.  It was the wrong connection of the structural element of the automatic on-board control system to the power system.  A presentation has been submitted on elimination of violations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="airfield Chkalovsky Kaliningrad" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448637.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Airfield "Chkalovsky".  Kaliningrad </h2><p>  This object is the best in the <span>Kaliningrad region.</span>  <span>The runway of the</span> Chkalovsky <span>airfield</span> is sixty meters wide and three thousand meters long.  In addition, the runway has no weight restrictions on aircraft.  Its territory exceeds the mark of seven hundred hectares.  The complex can be used by absolutely all types of existing aircraft.  It has no equal number of dispersion sites, zones for group and individual sites.  At the end of the last century, Chkalovsk was a base airfield for two naval aviation formations.  However, this did not affect the decision to stop using the complex.  The units located there were disbanded, and the equipment was transported to Chernyakhovsk. </p>
