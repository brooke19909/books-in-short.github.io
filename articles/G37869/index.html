    <p>  Limited liability company is a popular form of ownership.  The founders are given several advantages during its formation.  One of them is providing the legal entity with the right to choose the type of taxation.  There are four in total.  Consider in detail <span>the tax system of</span> LLC. </p><p>  1. Simplified.  This system is recommended for companies whose activities are just beginning.  A firm cannot yet accurately predict its earnings.  How to switch to simplified taxation of LLC?  Even in the process of paperwork, the founders must notify the registration authority of this desire with the help of a statement.  A simplified system is allowed for firms with no more than 100 employees.  At the same time, the company's revenues should not exceed 20 million rubles.  in year.  Under the simplified taxation system, the following deductions are not paid: property <span>tax, income tax, single social tax,</span> VAT.  But the organization is required to pay personal income tax, single tax and insurance premiums. </p><p>  Simplified taxation of LLC involves the choice of one of two bases.  The most profitable of them is the use of <span>net income.</span>  This value is involved in calculating the amount of tax.  The second version of the base is ‚Äúincome minus expenses‚Äù.  It is difficult to <span>calculate tax,</span> since not all costs can be used for deduction.  For example, the costs of repairing a director‚Äôs personal car at the expense of the organization cannot be taken into account to reduce revenue. </p><p>  The interest rate for determining the tax also depends on the chosen base.  When using "net income" the organization is obliged to pay 6% of the taxable amount.  In the second case, the <span>tax rate</span> is 15%.  Which base is better to use if the organization has high costs?  In this case, it is more profitable to take ‚Äúincome less costs‚Äù for taxation.  At low costs, the firm is better off using "net income." </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. The traditional or <span>general taxation system of</span> LLC.  It is one of the most difficult to determine the base.  Even the accounting process itself is difficult, so the organization must have an excellent specialist in its staff.  The company will need serious software for reporting (1C Accounting, etc.).  OSNO is used by enterprises, where relatively constant amounts of income and expenses, as well as a large cash flow.  The organization, choosing the traditional system, pays the property tax (2.2%), profit tax (20%), VAT (18%), UST (26%) to the budgets. </p><p>  3. Unified agricultural tax is applied by organizations that produce agricultural products.  Single agricultural tax replaces VAT, UST, property taxes and profits. </p><p>  4. UTII is used for enterprises that engage in certain types of activities.  That is, a <span>single tax on imputed income is</span> imposed not on the entrepreneur or legal entity, but on his work.  When calculating UTII, account is taken not of actually received income, but of imputed income.  Government officials determine the amount of tax on their own.  In other syllables, UTII is a kind of quitrent imposed from above.  There are few organizations wishing to work with this system. </p><p>  Thus, the taxation of LLC occurs in one of four systems.  The last two of them are used by enterprises that conduct specific activities.  Therefore, they cannot choose their own tax system.  Simplified taxation of LLC and the traditional system of founders are chosen independently.  In these cases, the state cannot influence the management of the enterprise.  The founders of a limited liability company should seriously approach the issue of choosing a tax system. </p>
