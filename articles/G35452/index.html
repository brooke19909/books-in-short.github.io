German helmets of the Second World War have great similarities, and this is important to consider when trying to determine the type of model.  Small changes may be the only difference between one type of helmet and another.  Knowing the details that make up the German helmet helps you figure out which model you have on hand. </p><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  During the 1920s and 30s, the German government began redesigning the steel German helmets of World War I in an attempt to improve their appearance and function.  The vast majority of steel helmet models were destroyed in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.  Some helmets remained in active service to meet Germany's small military needs.  As a result, a significant deficit was formed. </p><p>  The M1917 was rebuilt and introduced as a specially patented ‚Äútransitional" model for parades and general use.  The remaining stocks of wartime (M1916, M1917, M1918) were restored for the military and police.  They were used before the National Socialists came to power in 1933. </p><p>  In 1935, the military approved the new Stahlhelm <span>combat helmet</span> , known as the M1935.  It resembled the M1917, but was lighter, more functional, and also significantly updated. </p>

    <p>  The geometric dimensions of the German helmet of the Second World War decreased, compared with the models of the First World War.  The helmet has become more compact.  The M1935 helmet evolved several times during WWII.  Each change led to several newer variations, although each model had the same basic design.  At least three models were made exclusively for combat: M1935, M1940, M1942.  All three versions of this helmet were worn during World War II. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <span>German helmet of the</span> Second World War.  Price </h2><p>  At auctions, the cost of helmets can reach several thousand dollars.  But you can find more profitable options.  For example, on Avito their cost starts from 1000 rubles.  Price depends on condition.  Avito also has helmets worth both 5,000 rubles and 150,000 rubles. </p><h2>  M-42 helmet - prototype for the Luftwaffe </h2><p>  In Germany, during World War II, resource problems began to appear.  In addition, bombing plants reduced the ability to produce large quantities of weapons.  As a result, it was decided to develop a new helmet that would be easier to produce.  Then the M-42 was born.  The original color is gray.  The cost of the German helmet of the Second World War M-42 varies from 1000 rubles.  But usually rusted helmets are sold for up to 10,000 rubles. </p><p>  This helmet was made from a combination of metal and leather.  It has a very interesting story.  This is one of the helmets that were made and used in two world wars.  Their design and shape have become the inspiration for creating some modern ones. </p>

Its design was so perfect for the time that the German government decided to reuse it during World War II. </p><h2>  Luftwaffe Prototype - M-35 Helmet </h2><p>  Stahlhelm translates from German as "steel helmet".  The imperial <span>German army</span> began to replace the traditional Pickelhaube (needle combat helmet) with a Stahlhelm during the First World War in 1916. The original color is dark blue. </p>

    <p>  In 1934, tests began to improve Stahlhelm, the design of which was a development based on models of the First World War.  Eisenh√ºttenwerke has been designing and testing prototypes. </p><p>  The new German helmets of World War II were pressed from molybdenum steel sheets in several stages.  The visor was reduced in size and the large protruding ears for the obsolete armor shield were removed.  The ventilation holes were retained, but small hollow rivets were added. </p><p>  The edges of the sheath were moved to create a smooth edge along the helmet.  And finally, a completely new leather liner was made, which greatly improved helmet safety, adjustment and comfort.  These enhancements have made the new M1935 helmet easier.  It has become more compact and comfortable than previous designs. </p><h2>  Reference literature </h2><p>  "German helmets of the Second World War" (author Branislav Radovich) - these are two illustrated volumes, in which helmets such as, for example, the famous German Stahlhelm are examined in detail.  The publication contains many color photographs, showing details in close-up.  The price of a German helmet during World War II will be easily determined by you if you familiarize yourself with this guide. </p>
