    <p>  In order to more specifically show what one of the products of this brand is, we will conduct a short review of one of them.  Meet us, we present you the tablet SM-T311 (also known as <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Tab 3 8.0).  The device has a number of its features that it boasts to its potential buyer.  We will talk about them, as well as many other positive and negative aspects in this device, in this article. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Of course, we will start with its appearance.  After all, it is with this criterion that we encounter every time we take this device in our hands.  Immediately I would like to note that the device has a rather unpretentious design, reminiscent of the appearance of similar models.  However, the SM-T311 design makes such an impression on those who are not at all familiar with the device.  In fact, the appearance of the device has a certain style.  Take at least a glass screen that covers the entire front of the tablet, giving it a glossy shine.  The shiny back of the tablet also creates the same effect.  It is made of plastic and has a similar texture with the front of the tablet.  On it we find only the inscription of the manufacturer of the device SM-T311 (Samsung) and the camera window, about the characteristics and capabilities of which we will discuss in the future. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Due to the fact that the gadget has rounded edges, its entire body looks quite stylish, this is in perfect harmony with the glossy texture. </p><h2>  Navigation </h2><p>  With elements that allow you to navigate in the capabilities and functionality of the device, everything is pretty standard here.  The tablet has standard physical buttons ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, located under the screen.  They are equipped with additional lighting, which makes it possible to work with them in a dark room.  Some users complain that the virtual form of such buttons could become a more convenient solution, as this would save space at the bottom of the phone. </p>

    <p>  In addition to these, it is also worth mentioning the painted ‚Äúunder the metal‚Äù buttons to turn on the device and adjust the sound.  They are located on the side faces.  This is a standard circuit, which is complemented by an <span>infrared port</span> for exchanging information. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, we can say that Samsung made the SM-T311 control as classic as possible so that users do not have to relearn for working with this model. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  By the name of the gadget <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Tab 3 8.0 SM-T311 it is immediately clear what screen it has.  We are talking about an 8-inch display, which works on the basis of the matrix (PLS technology).  The screen resolution, according to the technical parameters, is 1280 by 800 pixels.  As the instruction describing the SM-T311 tablet notes, the image on the tablet‚Äôs display has a density of 189 dpi square.  This, of course, is very small, if we talk about direct competitors like the <span>Nexus 7</span> or Amazon Kindle, equipped with stronger matrices with FullHD-picture. </p><p>  In this regard, of course, you can bet only on a non-standard screen size, because all these gadgets have a display with a diagonal of 7 inches, but not at all 8. The closest to him in this case is the 7.9-inch iPad mini, but the level of prestige is here , of course, completely different. </p>

    <p>  However, the tablet SM-T311, whose technical characteristics can not be called the most outstanding, also boasts a high screen brightness.  Due to its image seems more saturated and at the same time it is more adapted to work in bright sunlight or in a well-lit room.  The content of the screen does not fade, but remains completely readable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Describing how productive our SM-T311 tablet is, the characteristics of which we have already begun to cite earlier, we should note its ‚Äúheart‚Äù.  This is a processor that drives the entire operating system of the device.  In this case, we are talking about Samsung Exymos - a dual-core processor, the clock frequency of each of which is 1.5 GHz.  These are quite good indicators, giving good performance of processor power and graphics.  This is noted by both ordinary users and specialists.  For example, in the rating table on the processor interaction speed, the device we are describing overtook Asus Transformer Prime TF201, Motorola Atrix, Samsung Galaxy Tab 10, Samsung Galaxy Nexus and others.  User reviews confirm this: the tablet works fast enough, while some freezes (even in the case of launching more ‚Äúdemanding" software) are minimal. </p>

    <p>  RAM SM-T311 is somewhat expanded (in comparison with the parameters of many similar devices).  So, the developer installed here 1.5 GB of RAM so that the user can more freely open various applications without worrying about stability. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  As reviews describe, often tablets released under the Samsung brand have endurance problems.  As the characteristic shows, an SM-T311 battery was installed with a capacity of 4450 mAh.  Using this power element, the capacity indicator of which, it should be recognized, is at a fairly high level, the tablet can work up to 11 hours, given the fact that the user will sit on a WiFi network and watch videos. </p><p>  The maximum load on the system gives 4-hour work, after which the smartphone completely consumes its battery.  This, again, is a good indicator given that we are talking about the work of a colorful, large display and a serious iron ‚Äúfilling‚Äù on one device. </p><h2>  operating system </h2>

    <p>  As you might guess, the Android operating system (version 4.2.2) is installed on the tablet.  It has a special graphical shell designed exclusively for Samsung devices.  It has a standard appearance, but differs mainly in a set of additional functions.  For example, such an opportunity to limit the output of information on the display of the device.  This option is useful if you are driving and do not want unnecessary alerts distracting you from the road.  Another example is the ability to display different active applications in two windows by resizing them.  Such options can actually make working with the tablet much easier in some situations. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  As you know, the best way to find out what an electronic device is is to read reviews and recommendations about it.  Characterizing the SM-T311 tablet (the photo of which we presented in this article above), it should be said that we managed to find many recommendations from the buyers of this device.  And most of the reviews about the tablet are positive, estimates range from 4 to 5 points.  Why do users rate the tablet so highly? </p><p>  First of all, we can say that the device was awarded such a mark because of the presence of certain advantages.  These include: </p><ul><li>  light weight, which allows you to carry the gadget with you always and everywhere; </li><li>  convenient housing, working with a tablet is a pleasure, many buyers write about it; </li><li>  a good screen, many indicate that the quality of it is consistent with HD-displays. </li></ul><p>  Such properties make it possible to consider it as an affordable device for daily use.
