    <h2>  What you need to know when starting to use a slow cooker </h2><p>  A crock-pot is a complex technical device, work with which requires some precautions: </p><ul><li>  the device is not intended for operation in an industrial environment; </li><li>  the multicooker must be used strictly for its intended purpose, otherwise it can lead to a technical malfunction; </li><li>  Before using the device, you need to make sure that the surface on which it is installed is absolutely dry and even; </li><li>  Before connecting the multicooker wire to an outlet, make sure that the voltage is within the acceptable limits; </li><li>  After completing the operation of the device, as well as during cleaning, it must be disconnected from the mains.  Do this only with dry hands, while holding the plug; </li><li>  make sure that the cord does not touch sharp corners and objects, as well as sources of high temperatures;  the wire should not be twisted or broken, otherwise it will lead to technical malfunctions; </li><li>  do not place the slow cooker in rooms that are characterized by high humidity; </li><li>  make sure that children do not touch the device during its operation; </li><li>  DIY repair of the Redmond RMC-4503 multicooker is strictly prohibited (in case of malfunctions or interruptions in the operation of the device, contact the nearest service center for help); </li><li>  Do not touch the device or move it during operation; </li><li>  It is strictly forbidden to turn on the multicooker if it does not have a bowl, or if the container is empty; </li><li>  if you notice any malfunctions, immediately stop using the device; </li><li>  Before using the appliance for the first time, it is recommended that it is completely cleaned to ensure food safety and to prevent deterioration of smell and taste. </li></ul><h2>  How to care for a slow cooker </h2><p>  For kitchen appliances to last as long as possible, special attention must be paid to keeping them in proper form.  The multicooker Redmond RMC-4503 is no exception.  The instruction says that any actions related to cleaning the device should be started only when it is disconnected from the network and completely cooled. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Traditionally, special attention is paid to washing the bowl, because it is in it that the main process of cooking takes place.  You need to wash it using gentle detergents and a soft cloth.  It is strictly forbidden to use aggressive powder detergents, as well as hard metal scrapers, otherwise it may damage the non-stick coating.  Before installing the bowl in the multicooker again, you need to make sure that it is completely dry, and also wipe the outside of it with a dry cloth. </p><p>  The multicooker housing itself also needs regular cleaning.  For this purpose, you can not use any additional means, except for water and soft tissue.  The use of any detergents is strictly prohibited.  It is necessary to squeeze the rag very well before starting work so that water does not get into the device.  This is especially true for cleaning the control panel area. </p><p>  In exactly the same way as the bowl, it is necessary to clean the moisture collector after each operation session, in which condensate drops accumulate.  To remove it, you need to press hard on its lower part.  After that, wash the container, completely dry, and only then install it in its place. </p><p>  Another part that needs regular cleaning is the steam release valve that the Redmond RMC-4503 multicooker is equipped with.  The instruction manual says that you need to carefully remove it, completely disassemble and thoroughly rinse each part, keeping it under running water.  When all the elements have dried, reassemble the valve and reattach it to the multicooker. </p>

    <h2>  Cons of the model </h2><p>  The Multicooker Redmond RMC-4503, like any other kitchen equipment, in addition to the positive aspects, also has some disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  the auto-heating function cannot be turned off forcibly; </li><li>  there is no clock on the screen, because of which it is not possible to track the cooking time of certain dishes; </li><li>  the inner lid of the multicooker cannot be removed, which greatly complicates the process of cleaning it; </li><li>  in the first days of operation of the device, a pronounced smell of plastic is noted; </li><li>  There are some questions to the quality of the cooking cup, in some cases the cup can be replaced. </li></ul><h2>  How to cook pilaf in a slow cooker </h2><p>  It is worth noting the wide range of culinary opportunities that the Redmond multicooker RMC-4503 provides its owner.  Recipes for such devices are very numerous, but perhaps the most popular of them is pilaf. </p><p>  In order to cook a delicious dish in the Redmond RMC-4503 multicooker, you will need the following products: </p><ul><li>  300 grams of oblong rice; </li><li>  a pound of pork; </li><li>  one large carrot and one onion; </li><li>  a pair of garlic cloves; </li><li>  350 grams of pure water; </li><li>  salt and spices. </li></ul><p>  All ingredients must be preliminarily prepared (rinse, peel, grind, and so on), after which they must be placed in a multicooker bowl.  Care must be taken to ensure that the products are at a level lower than the extreme mark located on the walls of the bowl.  Now you can close the lid (until it clicks) and connect the multicooker to a power source. </p><p>  On the control panel of the device you need to press the "Programs" button and select the "Pilaf" function.  By default, the dish is cooked for 1 hour, but you can change it in the direction of increase or decrease (minimum 5 minutes, maximum 2 hours).  If you are sure that everything was done correctly, you can click the "Start" button.  Remember that after the cooking process is over, you should not leave the pilaf for a long time in the mode of maintaining the temperature, otherwise it risks becoming dry. </p><p>  It is not necessary to adhere to the standard recipe in the preparation of this delicious rice dish.  You can continuously experiment with ingredients and proportions, as well as over time, creating your own unique pilaf. </p>
