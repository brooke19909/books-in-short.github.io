    <p>  Animation events are held throughout the day.  A tour desk is available on site for tours of local attractions.  There is also a night club, and guests can play billiards, minigolf, volleyball and tennis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Golf <span>Residence Hotel 4 *</span> is located 600 meters from the beach.  Every twenty minutes there is a shuttle on the coast.  Walking distance is about twenty minutes.  The beach is sandy and equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas.  It has a bar where guests can enjoy refreshing drinks. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  As we have already mentioned, the Golf Residence Hotel 4 * is located almost in the center of Port el Kantaoui, which is considered to be an elite suburb of Sousse.  The best complexes with modern thalassocenters, chic golf courses and equestrian clubs have been built in the city.  Here is the port of Marina, which houses up to three hundred pleasure yachts and boats.  Life at the resort is in full swing.  An incredible number of shops, shops, bars and restaurants are open.  Local guides actively offer boat trips, diving tours.  It is believed that local beaches are no worse than the coast of Mahdia and Hammamet.  Fine sand and a wide coastline will conquer any lover of sea holidays. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  Golf Residence 4 * <span>(Port El Kantaoui)</span> provides its tourists with a shuttle service, however, you can also reach your destination on your own, due to its convenient location.  From Russia to Tunisia there is communication with only three airports located in the <span>cities of Tunisia,</span> Enfide and Monastir.  Next you need to get to Sousse.  To do this, you can use the train, taxi or bus. </p>

    <p>  And from Sousse to get to Port El Kantaoui is not at all difficult.  Between them runs a lot of buses (municipal and taxis).  Ticket prices are about the same. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Local beaches </h2><p>  The beaches of Port El Kantaoui are the best beaches in the Sousse area.  They are not as overloaded as in other resorts, and at the same time incredibly wide.  The best stretch of coast is located in the Marina area.  The sea here is usually clean and transparent, and the excitement is not so often.  Sometimes algae appears that tourists do not like, but there are not so many that they cause particular inconvenience.  Each hotel guards its beaches from local residents for the comfort of vacationers. </p><h2>  Shopping and entertainment </h2><p>  Port El Kantaoui is a large shopping area.  You can buy souvenirs for relatives both in small shops near hotels and in large shopping centers.  You can also go shopping in Sousse, which has an impressive Soula center. </p><p>  In Port El Kantaoui itself there are no architectural and historical sights.  The resort area began to rebuild only in the nineties, and therefore is quite young.  History buffs can safely go to Sousse, where there is a colorful medina, a huge mosque and the Caliph Tower, the museum of the Tunisian family Dar Essid and many other attractions. </p>

    <p>  In Port El Kantaoui itself, you can set aside time for walks in the resort area and the medina.  Also, numerous travel agencies in each hotel offer guests trips to the laser show "Elzahra Medinar" in El Jem or Monastir.  In addition, you can visit <span>Carthage, Tunisia,</span> Sitdi-bou-Said or go on an amazing two-day trip to the Sahara. </p><p>  In the marina, vacationers can choose several types of boat trips: a trip on a pirate ship, a boat trip with a transparent bottom or diving trips in the vicinity.  Horse lovers can visit the Mabrouka ranch, on the basis of which an equestrian school operates.  Here you can ride and get lessons from experienced instructors. </p><h2>  Golf Residence 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I would definitely like to refer to the reviews of those tourists who recently rested in it.  Golf Residence 4 * (Port El Kantaoui), undoubtedly, has a favorable location, which makes it easy to find it if you do not book a transfer to the hotel.  Near the complex there are many shops, cafes and restaurants that you may need during your vacation.  In addition, the General supermarket is nearby, which is the only chain where you can buy alcohol in Tunisia. </p><p>  According to guests, Golf Residence 4 * (Port El Kantaoui) is located far from the coast.  You can walk to the beach in twenty minutes.  The hotel has a shuttle that runs every twenty minutes.  However, in practice, waiting for it is not always convenient.  Therefore, people of advanced age and kids to overcome the path on their own will not be very comfortable. </p>

    <p>  According to tourists, the hotel's beach is not very large, in the season there are too many people on it.  In addition, for mattresses for sunbeds on it you must pay.  On the shore there is a breakwater that blocks the seascape, as a result of which any feeling that you are on the beach is lost.  Therefore, many vacationers prefer the coastline to the right of the port.  It is not equipped with sunbeds, but you can use your own towels and rugs, especially since the hotel does not have any marine accessories at all. </p><p>  Hotel Golf Residence 4 * is located in a rather noisy place, as evidenced by numerous complaints of tourists.  Nearby there is a water park, from which noise comes in the daytime, and in the evenings a night club begins to work until the morning.  It is difficult to say which rooms are quieter, but at the reception you can change apartments (if available are available).  On all three floors the rooms are very different.  In general, they are spacious and bright, but with old furniture, which has long been in need of replacement.  Plumbing is working properly.  The spacious balconies have a clothes dryer.  Towels are changed daily, but the bed is changed once a week.  Experienced vacationers recommend leaving a maid tip of one dinar to improve the quality of cleaning.  All linen in the hotel is shabby and needs to be replaced. </p>

    <p>  The staff here is normal, but sometimes it‚Äôs difficult to explain to the employees, since they obviously do not know Russian, and few people speak English.  But at the same time you are smiling.  However, if you need something, you must independently apply for reception, otherwise you can not wait for the promised. </p><p>  As for food, hotel guests express rather conflicting opinions.  Given all the reviews, we can conclude that the food in the hotel is quite acceptable, but not varied.  The range of dishes becomes much wider in season.  Then a lot of meat, seafood and fruits appear on the tables.  Sweet and baked goods are always present in normal amounts.  There is no All Inclusive system as such, since free drinks in the form of tea or coffee are only available for breakfast.  At lunch and dinner, they must be paid separately.  The same situation is typical for bars.  They have only paid drinks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel golf residence 4" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1548461.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a nice pool.  In the evenings, entertainment events are sometimes organized (animation only works in high season).  The most active vacationers travel to Sousse and other cities on their own to fill the rest with positive impressions.  Tourists highly recommend a two-day trip to the Sahara. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Golf Residence 4 * (Port El Kantaoui) can be described as a budget hotel for unassuming tourists who are not spoiled by more luxurious hotels.  The complex can be a good place for young people to relax, as there are many noisy entertainment venues nearby.  But with small children it is probably not so convenient to relax here, as the kids need silence and regular sleep. </p>
