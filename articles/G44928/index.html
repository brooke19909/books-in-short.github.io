The evidence is everyone's attention, which was focused exclusively on <span>the iPhone</span> 6 <span>model</span> , released in the fall of 2014.  The whole world literally froze in anticipation of this smartphone, which cannot be observed on such a scale, for example, with the release of the new Samsung S6 or any other device.  This skill provides multi-million dollar sales of each new iPhone. </p><h2>  IPhone 6 Sales </h2>

    <p>  After the release of the new version of the smartphone from Apple, its sales, of course, began around the world.  This happened unevenly: at first the Apple Store took orders exclusively in the most developed countries - the USA, Great Britain, Germany, Japan;  Further, the ‚Äúwave‚Äù of sales went through Europe, Asia and began in our country.  Some owners had the iPhone 6 in their hands before Russian stores started selling it thanks to acquaintances and friends who came from the United States.  This is not surprising: people who are able to purchase such an expensive device, as a rule, have the opportunity to visit another country in such a short time and at the same time ‚Äúbuy‚Äù a couple of additional gadgets in order to present them as a gift here, at home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sales in Russia </h2><p>  As you know, Apple has a Russian branch of its store.  Of course, it was here that the iPhone 6 began to be sold for the first time.  At the time of the device‚Äôs release (September 2014), the cost of its budget configuration was about 33 thousand rubles.  If you pay attention to prices now, then a phone with a memory capacity of 16 GB and a screen of 4.7 inches will cost about 49 thousand rubles (about 900 dollars).  At the same time, the most expensive equipment (model 6 Plus) with a memory capacity of 128 GB will cost 70 thousand rubles (about 1300 dollars). </p>

    <h2>  Cost on the official website </h2><p>  It is believed that buying Apple products in its homeland - in the US - is more profitable.  There are several reasons for this: </p><ul><li>  firstly, a more developed market for electronic products and, accordingly, high competition among manufacturers; </li><li>  secondly, a more developed pricing system and the market for mobile operators in general. </li></ul><p>  In connection with the last paragraph, I would like to note the contract form of interaction between the user and the seller of the mobile device, according to which the cost of the phone is invested in the price of the contract signed with the operator.  Thus, a person receives almost two years of free communication in exchange for the purchase of iPhone 6. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Finally, it should be said about the "locality" of the market for Apple.  Despite the fact that the products are manufactured in China, in the USA the company is still considered a national manufacturer. </p><p>  All these and other factors led to the fact that ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù 6 is being sold there for an order of magnitude cheaper. The price in America, available on the company's official website, can amaze - this is $ 649 for the cheapest model and 949 for the most expensive.  And this is without taking into account purchases under the contract, under which the cost of the phone reaches $ 199 altogether. </p><h2>  Cost in online stores </h2>

    <p>  Here is the answer to the question of how much iPhone 6 costs in America.  The price is clearly lower: the difference is about $ 250 in the cost of a budget model and 350 - the most expensive version.  Obviously, this situation is very advantageous for domestic resellers who buy and sell phones in the United States, since the difference in cost allows you to set it at a lower level without giving up any minimum profit. </p><p>  And let's see for the sake of interest, how much is iPhone 6 in America if you buy through online shops.  Let's go to the largest online store in the world "Amazon" and find this model there.  On the price tag in the catalog - $ 619 for the cheapest model.  The same situation on eBay.com: suppliers set the price at $ 625, which is also clearly cheaper than ours. </p><h2>  Chinese suppliers </h2><p>  We turn to online shopping from another area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe globe.  We go to the famous Aliexpress.com, where Chinese sellers also offer the latest phones from Apple.  Please note: if we are going to look for the Chinese ‚ÄúiPhone 6‚Äù, then we do not mean a cheap copy running on Android, but an original device intended for the Celestial market. </p>

    <p>  A large number of sellers work here, who set a variety of prices.  However, the cheapest that we managed to find is 48 thousand rubles (about $ 890) for the basic version of the 6 GB model.  Thus, unfortunately, I could not find a cheap Chinese iPhone here.  Its price is absolutely identical to the price indicated on the official website of Apple in Russia.  And this, as you know, is not a copy.  ‚ÄúIPhone 6‚Äù is here offering the original. </p><p>  If we talk about a fake iPhone, then it will cost much cheaper - from 10 to 15-17 thousand rubles, depending on the functionality and build quality.  However, do you need it?  Isn‚Äôt it easier to get a normal smartphone from another manufacturer for the money? </p><h2>  How to buy cheaper? </h2><p>  Thus, having analyzed what the price for iPhone 6 is in America, we can draw an obvious conclusion about where it is more profitable to buy it.  <span>True, this</span> does not mean that you need to run a ticket to the States and fly to get to the Appstore and pick up your iPhone 6. If you consider how much you spend on the flight, all the benefits of ordering a phone in the USA are lost. </p><p>  If you want to save on buying, taking into account how much iPhone 6 costs in America, you can use one of the services that deliver goods from overseas.  In fact, there are many of them now, and finding one that would suit all the criteria is quite simple. </p><p>  These companies are an organization that operates both in the United States and in the Russian Federation.  If a customer from Russia wants to order a thing, he simply buys it, indicating (as a delivery address) the contacts of an intermediary company in the States.  There they take the package and forward it to your home.  Of course, a certain commission is taken for this, but, given how much iPhone 6 costs in America, it will be quite profitable.  In the end, you will overpay $ 30-40, but save as much as 250. </p>

    <p>  You can buy this way not only iPhone 6. The same applies to other things that will cost more in Russia, but are cheaper in their homeland - in the USA.  Many people use intermediary services for shipping and save on branded clothing, electronics and other categories of goods.  It's simple and convenient, and if you want to try it too, then start now.  You might like to save by getting quality products. </p>
