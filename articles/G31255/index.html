What is the main occupation of Dobrynia Nikitich?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The main occupation of Dobrynia Nikitich is the defense of Russia from external enemies.  This Russian hero in importance takes the second position after Ilya Muromets.  Together with Alyosha Popovich, they form the famous three heroes.  In addition, the epic about Dobryn Nikitich mentions him as a relative of the prince.  In other legends, the hero is called the nephew of Vladimir.  Of all the warriors, he most often fulfills the prince's instructions: to marry Vladimir to the bride, to negotiate with passers-by, to check Duke's praise.  The hero Dobrynya Nikitich goes as a companion to Vasily Kazimirovich on an important task - to collect tribute in the horde. </p>

    <h2>  Where does the hero come from? </h2><p>  In some epics, the merchant origin of Dobrynia Nikitich is mentioned.  Bogatyr from Ryazan, is the son of Nikita Romanovich.  The father dies early, so the mother brings up the boy.  She gives her son to study, where they teach "clever literacy."  Bylin about Dobryn Nikitich constantly mentions his upbringing and knowledge of manners.  The hero knows how to sing, play the harp.  He is a skilled chess player, even a connoisseur of this game cannot defeat him - the Tatar khan.  The qualities of Dobrynia Nikitich are crowned by the ability to shoot excellently: there is no equal to the hero in this art. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Battle with the Serpent Gorynych </h2><p>  In one of the epics, the main occupation of Dobryni Nikitich in childhood is mentioned: the opposition to the snake tribe.  Even then, the "young Dobrynyushko" rides a horse in the field of "small snakes to trample."  In the legend ‚ÄúDobrynya Nikitich and the serpent‚Äù, the main heroic deed of the hero is narrated.  Before the battle, the main character goes to the Pechay River, where the Serpent Gorynych lives.  Contrary to the warnings of his mother, he enters the river water.  As soon as unarmed Dobrynya is in the middle of the river, the Serpent appears.  Hanging in the air, Gorynych sprinkles with rain and fiery sparks.  The brave hero dives into the water and gets to the shore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="exploits of Dobryni Nikitich" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/133/551791.jpg" width="370"></div>  There he enters into battle with the Serpent, as a result of which he crushes the enemy.  Having fallen to the ground, Gorynych begs for mercy, asks not to chop his head.  The hero decides to let go of the defeated enemy.  However, taking advantage of the kindness of Dobrynya, the insidious Serpent flies over Kiev, abducting the prince's favorite niece - Fun Putyatishna.  The exploits of Dobrynia Nikitich include the rescue of Fun.  According to the prince's instructions, he goes to the snake hole and frees the girl.

    <h2>  Baptism of Russia as the basis of the plot of the struggle with the Serpent Gorynych </h2><p>  There is an opinion that in the feat of Dobrynia Nikitich, describing the confrontation with the serpent, the event of the <span>baptism of Russia</span> is reflected <span>.</span>  This is due to some motives: bathing a hero in the river, the battle of a snake with the help of the ‚Äúcap of the Greek land‚Äù, and as you know, Christianity came from Greece.  In the legend, an analogy is drawn between the actions of Dobrynia Nikitich and the uncle of the prince, who took part in the baptism of Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Other exploits of Dobrynia Nikitich </h2><p>  The confrontation between the hero and the snake has analogies with other battles.  In the role of the hero's opponents are a malicious creature in the image of Baba Yaga and the polar meadow.  The hero Dobrynya Nikitich also fights against the Danube, Ilya Muromets, Alyosha Popovich - soldiers of his circle.  After the fighting, their reconciliation follows, which means the formation of a "cross brotherhood." </p><p>  The plot is very symbolic: Dobrynya Nikitich and Marinka.  Marina Ignatyevna lures the hero into her house, after which she offers him to marry her.  In response to the refusal, the woman resorts to the help of her witching charms, as a result of which the hero turns into a ‚Äúbay tour‚Äù.  According to one version, the sorceress still manages to marry Dobrynya.  To help the hero comes his mother.  However, Marinka does not abandon attempts to become the wife of Dobryni Nikitich.  Having turned into a bird, she flies to the hero‚Äôs house and insists on getting married again, offering in return to return his human appearance to him.  Dobrynya agrees to the conditions, but only in order to become a hero again and cruelly execute a seducer.  According to another version, the mother of Dobryny turns Marinka into a magpie. </p><p>  In this story, an analogy is again drawn with a mythologized image - Marina Mnishek.  She also practiced witchcraft and led a dissolute life.  Traditions tell that she also managed to escape, turning into a magpie. </p><h2>  Finding a bride for the prince </h2><p>  Since the main occupation of Dobrynya Nikitich was inextricably linked with the fulfillment of princely instructions, the epic about finding a bride for Vladimir is important.  According to the declared qualities, Opraksa was suitable.  Together with Danube Ivanovich, the hero obtains a bride for the prince. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="qualities of Dobrynia Nikitich" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23608/551080.jpg" width="306"></div>  This episode is associated with a historical event mentioned in the annals.  According to him, Vladimir instructs Dobryna to go to Polotsk and ask Rogvolod‚Äôs daughter to become the prince‚Äôs wife.

    <h2>  Guest at the wedding of his wife </h2><p>  It is also worth mentioning the famous episode of the matchmaking of Alyosha Popovich to the wife of the hero Nastasya.  The main occupation of Dobrynia Nikitich is to protect the Kiev people from external enemies.  Leaving for a foreign land in search of an adversary, Dobrynya punishes his wife to wait for his twelve years.  However, the cunning Alyosha Popovich soon brings Nastasya the news of the alleged death of her husband.  The prince himself acts as a matchmaker asking Nastasya to marry Alyosha.  Under pressure from Vladimir, she has no choice but to agree to the wedding.  During the feast, Dobrynya Nikitich appears, dressed as a buffoon.  After asking permission, he begins to play the harp.  At this moment, Nastasya recognizes her husband as a mysterious guest.  Dobrynya Nikitich deals with Alyosha for a vile deception.  Ilya Muromets intervenes in their quarrel.  Reminding both of them that they are all ‚Äúcross brothers,‚Äù he plays the role of a conciliator between the warriors. </p>
