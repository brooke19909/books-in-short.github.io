Anyone can leave feedback on this organization.  Opinions about the company, which will be studied later, are often left on various otzoviks.  Therefore, you should pay attention to them.  The thing is that it is reviews that help form a general impression of a particular corporation.  One should not be surprised if opinions differ somewhere.  Everyone has their own requests for <span>non-state pension funds.</span>  Therefore, what someone likes is not to everyone's taste at all.  So what do clients and employees think about NPF Blagosostoyanie?  What are the pros and cons of this organization you need to pay attention in the first place? </p><h2>  About Activities </h2><p>  For example, what constitutes the organization being studied in principle.  What is Welfare (NPF)?  Everyone can leave a review of this company, so you should not trust everything written.  But in one thing all opinions agree - in the description of the organization‚Äôs activities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wealth NPF review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1428016.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Welfare is a <span>private pension fund.</span>  He suggests that citizens make contributions to form a future pension.  Or rather, its cumulative part.  Some storehouse of money set aside for old age. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is nothing surprising in this.  That is why "Well-being" (NPF) receives positive customer reviews.  But this is only the beginning.  This organization should be considered from all sides.  After all, she will be responsible for pension savings!  This is a rather important moment in the life of every citizen. </p><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  It is worth noting that Welfare is a rather large <span>non-state pension fund.</span>  According to statistics, he is one of the ten most successful private pension funds in Russia.  So, you can trust him. </p><p>  It is very problematic to identify a specific position.  Different data are indicated everywhere.  It‚Äôs enough to just remember that ‚ÄúWelfare‚Äù is a large, one of the leading funds in the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Another nuance that needs to be taken into account is that since 2015 this organization has been renamed.  And now she often appears as "The Future."  Therefore, it should be borne in mind that these names designate the same organization.  This must be remembered so as not to get confused in the reviews. </p><h2>  Customer confidence </h2><p>  "Welfare" (NPF) customer reviews earns a variety of.  But at the same time, potential investors still carefully study the statistics.  One of the rather important indicators is the level of trust.  It indicates how much investors trust the organization.  To form a rating, this component is extremely important. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="NPF welfare customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1428018.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And in this area there are no complaints.  The thing is that NPF Blagosostavost has the highest level of trust.  However, like all other non-governmental pension funds from dozens of leaders in Russia.  At the moment, customer confidence is rated as A ++. </p><p>  Based on this, it can be concluded that the pension fund is stable and reliable.  That is, it will not close just like that.  And this cannot but rejoice.  Therefore, many are eyeing this company.  It is likely that she should entrust her retirement savings. </p><h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  NPF RZD-Blagosostoyanie receives not the best reviews for its profitability.  Many potential investors choose a pension fund precisely for this indicator.  The main feature of any non-state pension fund is precisely the so-called return.  The money that is stored in the account of the depositor increases by a certain percentage annually.  It is called profitability. </p><p>  This indicator of "Welfare" is not the highest.  Today it makes up about 8-8.5% per year.  It is noted that initially the managers of the company promise a higher return - up to 12-15%.  That is why many feel cheated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf welfare Voronezh reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1428019.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Nevertheless, a similar logical explanation can be found for such discrepancies.  The blame is inflation.  Due to it, the yield of the studied pension fund is reduced.  Therefore, attention should be paid to this.  Blaming Welfare for lying is clearly not necessary.  By 8-8.5%, funds will still increase.  This is not so much, but more than some non-governmental funds from dozens of leaders in the country can offer. </p><h2>  Distribution in Russia </h2><p>  The change of company name of some potential investors led to the idea that ‚ÄúWelfare‚Äù is a scam.  This is actually not the case.  The thing is that the studied pension fund has been working successfully for more than 16 years.  It is distributed throughout Russia.  So, you should trust such an organization. </p><p>  Frankly, many reviews indicate that it is the scale of the corporation that inspires confidence.  NPF Blagosostoyanie gets good reviews from employees and customers because there are a lot of branches of the organization in every city.  This means that the company is not fraudulent.  Especially when you consider the fact that it has been working for many years. </p><h2>  Quality of service </h2><p>  What can be said about the work of the organization as a whole?  How good is the customer service here?  The city in which one of the regional units of NPF Blagosostoyanie is located is Ufa.  It receives various reviews.  Moreover, it should be noted that the situation in this area is approximately the same in all regions of the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf welfare ufa reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1428017.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There are no complaints about the service as a whole.  The only thing that many reviews emphasize is the slow work of the staff.  Along with this, answers to all questions asked to employees will still be received.  Educated and knowledgeable staff work here.  Not always everyone is friendly, but this nuance does not seriously affect the quality of service. </p><p>  The availability of virtual services is very pleasing to many.  More precisely, "My Account".  It helps to monitor the status of the personal account without any problems, as well as order extracts and certificates of available funds. </p><h2>  About "My Account" </h2><p>  What else should you pay attention to?  Another city, which also has a branch of NPF Blagosostoyanie, is Voronezh.  Feedback on the work of the "Personal Account" of the depositor must be taken into account, regardless of which region of Russia we are talking about.  Indeed, this is the way many customers choose information about their account. </p><p>  In this area, not everything is as simple as it seems.  After all, at "Welfare" "My Account" works with some failures.  Therefore, customers do not respond to this opportunity in the best way.  The thing is that authorization in the system is not always possible.  You often have to repeat login attempts.  You can order extracts from your personal account, but they will have to wait a long time.  Therefore, it is recommended that you independently come to the offices of a non-state pension fund in order to receive information about the available funds. </p><p>  These are the only disadvantages that will have to be considered.  Otherwise, when no malfunctions occur, the ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù at ‚ÄúWelfare‚Äù functions perfectly.  You can not only get the bill details, but also find answers to all questions regarding service and payment of pensions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="welfare NPF employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1428020.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About Payments </h2><p>  NPF "Welfare of OPS" receives generally positive reviews.  In any case, for its reliability and stability.  Nevertheless, special attention should be paid to such a component as cash payments. </p><p>  Why?  This area does not receive a clear customer assessment.  Some indicate that wealth does not pay money.  It takes an extremely long time to wait for them; to achieve payments is almost impossible.  Other reviews say the exact opposite.  This means that the non-state pension fund Blagosostoyanie pays pensions on time.  No delays or other surprises. </p><p>  And what really to believe?  A neutral point of view is recommended.  The thing is that the "Welfare" is trying to make all payments clearly on time.  But some delays in this area are still observed.  Therefore, one should not be surprised if pension payments did not arrive on time.  These problems are not so rare, but it is important to know about them.  Indeed, for some, delays are a serious flaw.  Even if they occur once a year.  In any case, all the money will still be credited to the depositor. </p><h2>  Surprises </h2><p>  Also, some negative, as a rule, is connected with the fact that quite often depositors find out that their money was secretly transferred to the Non-Profit Fund ‚ÄúWelfare‚Äù.  This is not too good.  Some are inclined to believe that this company has a shadow policy and that its actions are illegal. </p><p>  The city in which negative comments about the NPF "Welfare" are often left is often referred to as Yekaterinburg.  Reviews of a similar nature exist in other regions.  Indeed, the pension fund does not send notifications of opening a deposit.  This, of course, is a drawback.  But along with this, attention should be paid to another nuance. </p><p>  The organization‚Äôs actions are completely legal.  After all, as practice shows, "Welfare" (NPF), the reviews of which we are currently studying, concludes contracts with various employers.  Automatically, all employees become participants in the studied pension fund.  And notification of the transfer of pension savings, as well as approval for the operation, is the chief's concern.  Not "Welfare."  Therefore, all claims should be presented to the authorities. </p><p>  By the way, if you believe the reviews, then officially unemployed citizens of this kind of surprises do not happen.  They, of their own free will, can begin to form their funded part of the pension in this company.  No one is forcing to open an account, much less doing so without the participation of one or another depositor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf welfare ops reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1428021.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Legal Opinion </h2><p>  What do lawyers think about the fund under study?  Many also listen to their opinion.  Jurisprudence workers, as a rule, do not express a clear negative attitude towards the company.  She conducts her business quite legally.  Does not deceive anyone, offers a detailed contract for the provision of services.  If necessary, employees provide advice.  The only thing advised to pay attention to is the conditions that are spelled out in the agreement.  Especially regarding losses awaiting a potential contributor if he decides to transfer the funded part of the pension to another pension fund. </p><p>  From all that has been said above, it follows that NPF Blagosostavoste‚Äôs reviews of lawyers earn mostly positive ones.  You don‚Äôt have to worry that the rights of investors will be violated. </p><h2>  Opinions of the staff </h2><p>  Often, the opinions of subordinates are able to point out the shortcomings of an organization.  It doesn‚Äôt matter which company is involved.  What NRF "Welfare" has employee reviews? </p><p>  One cannot call opinions unambiguous.  The thing is that a lot depends on the region in question.  Indeed, the earnings of subordinates depend on this indicator.  It is the main evaluation criterion. </p><p>  Basically, there are no significant complaints.  As an employer, NPF Blagosostoyanie is handsome.  It offers comfortable working conditions, a full social package, and also paid vacation once a year.  Plus, a stable wage.  Often it is not too high - about 15-20 thousand rubles, but this is said at the interview stage.  No cheating or fraud.  This is not to say that Welfare is an ideal company.  But if you want to work in the pension system, then consider the organization as a potential employer. </p><h2>  Schedule </h2><p>  Also, "Welfare" (NPF) receives positive feedback from workers in terms of the proposed work schedule.  Stable, shiftable.  And it pleases.  Sometimes you have to stay overtime to work, but this does not happen so often. </p><p>  The schedule is clearly stated in the employment contract.  Usually they offer work from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.  It all depends on the duration of the branch of the pension fund.  But there is no strong tension.  And it pleases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf welfare employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1428022.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing?  Welfare (NPF), reviews of which are of interest to every citizen who is thinking about a future pension, is one of the leaders of non-state pension funds.  In Russia it is stable and reliable.  With its flaws.  But investors can be sure that the organization will not be closed suddenly. </p><p>  It is very pleasing.  As an employer, the company under study is also stable in work.  You should not shy away from the NFP "Welfare".  Although, if the main criterion for choosing a place of storage of pension savings is profitability, it is recommended to look for another place of investment.  Pension fund returns are not very good. </p>
