  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chinese robotic vacuum cleaners: review, specifications, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Regardless of the location of manufacturers of robotic vacuum cleaner manufacturers, almost all of the production of these home assistants is concentrated in China.  Despite the fact that the American company iRobot is the recognized world leader in the production of autonomous vacuum cleaners, Chinese manufacturers are building up their own potential in the design and manufacture of this equipment for the home. </p><h2>  Market leaders </h2><p>  Today, famous developers include companies such as Xiaomi Corporation, xRobot, Ilife Innovation limited, Guangdong Joy Intelligent Technology Co and others. </p><p>  We offer a brief overview of the best Chinese robotic vacuum cleaners.  The characteristics and quality of work of these products will be considered.  The rating for 2018-2019 is based on the popularity of models and user reviews. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi Roborock Sweep One </h2><div class="photo" data-original="china-gadgets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Mi Roborock Sweep One Robot Vacuum Cleaner" class="if uuid-3143186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3143186.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most powerful mid-range models.  The Li-Ion battery with a capacity of 5,200 mAh allows you to work autonomously for up to 150 minutes.  During this time, the unit is capable of cleaning the floor area of ‚Äã‚Äã250 square meters.  m. Smart robot vacuum cleaner Xiaomi Mi Roborock Sweep One is able to build a map of the room, so it selects the best routes for moving.  Main functions: dry and wet cleaning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In their positive reviews about this model, users note almost silent operation, economy in energy consumption, a long service life without complaints, an ergonomic design.  Thanks to its functions and quality characteristics, the Xiaomi Mi Roborock Sweep One robot vacuum cleaner is considered one of the best representatives of Chinese models and occupies the top line in the ranking. </p><h2>  Ecovacs DeeBot DM88 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ecovacs DeeBot DM88 Robot Vacuum Cleaner" class="if uuid-3143194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3143194.jpg"></div><p>  This unit occupies the fourth position.  It allows for dry and wet cleaning.  The Li-Ion battery with a capacity of 3,000 mAh ensures operation for 90 minutes and allows you to tidy up an area of ‚Äã‚Äã60 square meters.  m at a time.  A suction power of 30 W is sufficient to remove small chips from the floor surface.  Equipped with a 0.38 liter cyclone filter.  The quality of cleaning and functionality is not inferior to the iRobot Series 7 while it is much cheaper.  He takes the second line of the rating. </p><h2>  XrobotXR-210A </h2><p>  This unit has a small dust collector (cyclone filter) with a capacity of 0.35 L, but it is enough to carry out cleaning for 90 minutes.  It is possible to program by day of the week.  In addition, the device is equipped with a spare side brush, a rag and a membrane.  In a small room, this Chinese robot vacuum cleaner cleans up quickly enough. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, users who have managed to evaluate its work, note that often it leaves dirt in the corners.  The battery runs out quickly and loses its ability to fully charge in about six months.  Therefore, in the ranking, he took third place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.istockphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="XrobotXR-510A Robot Vacuum Cleaner" class="if uuid-3143196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3143196.jpg"></div><h2>  XrobotXR-210E </h2><p>  As a dust bag uses a bag with a capacity of 0.37 liters.  It is controlled remotely by remote control.  The display has a backlight.  This Chinese robot vacuum cleaner is equipped with optical sensors.  The kit comes with a panel for wet mopping.  However, the announcement of the capabilities of the latter function is more likely to resemble a marketing move, since the small size of a cloth that is not wetted by water during operation does not provide wet cleaning. </p><p>  As a drawback, users note that when entering obstacles, the garbage container may spontaneously separate.  Long hair is wound on the brush and quickly clogged, and the short hair of animals is cleaned well.  Being at a considerable distance from the base, the device finds it poorly.  Users rated this vacuum cleaner fourth in the ranking. </p><h2>  XrobotXR-510A </h2><p>  Designed for dry cleaning of small areas.  Continuous operation time is about 2 hours.  Optical sensors are used to orient this Chinese vacuum cleaner robot in space.  0.35 liter cyclone filter  convenient to service.  If an obstacle arises along the path of movement, the vacuum cleaner does not reach 2-3 mm.  If collision is impossible to avoid, then the rubber bumper softens the force well and muffles the sound of the blow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about Chinese robot vacuum cleaners" class="if uuid-3142838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3142838.jpg"></div><p>  Crumbs well from the floor.  He overcomes ground obstacles not bad, but he doesn‚Äôt see the ones located above (about 1 cm) and tries to drive under them.  He finds the base with difficulty.  As a result, it is faster and easier to bring it to the base yourself.  Like all models equipped with bristles, it winds six hairs on it. </p><h2>  XrobotX1 </h2><p>  The model of the Chinese robot vacuum cleaner has an additional function for collecting liquids.  Oriented to dry and wet cleaning.  Powered by a Li-Ion battery for 2 hours.  Has a capacious cyclone filter - 0.45 liters.  Equipped with fine filter.  Quite quiet (compared to other representatives of Xrobot), but not silent.  The route selection process is not adjusted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chinese robot vacuum cleaner Ilife" class="if uuid-3142844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3142844.jpg"></div><p>  Some users note in their reviews that this vacuum cleaner can carry out cleaning in one part of a small room for a long time, up to the discharge of the battery.  During factory assembly, the bumper may be poorly attached to the body of the vacuum cleaner.  Robot cleaning with a vacuum cleaner of this model is quite decent.  However, in a complex configuration room, it is often necessary to correct the trajectory of movement using the remote control. </p><h2>  Xrobotair </h2><p>  Affordable robot vacuum cleaner from China, powered by a 2200 mAh NiMH battery.  and designed to clean a small room.  The battery lasts for up to 120 minutes.  The capacity of the dust bag is 0.35 liters.  Equipped with fine filter.  The vacuum cleaner has a two-level separate system for collecting large debris and dust.  The suction power allows the absorption of small particles of dirt and dust. </p><p>  However, due to the presence of blind spots during analysis by the side sensors of the surrounding space, the apparatus often crashes into furniture.  May get stuck on obstacles.  During cleaning, he does not analyze the location of his own base and often knocks it down.  The same goes for the virtual wall. </p><h2>  XrobotHelper </h2><p>  Equipped with a backlit display, controlled remotely from the remote control.  The dust collector is quite capacious - 0.37 liters.  Power of absorption is 55 W.  Powered by a 2200 mAh NiMH battery.  The kit includes a nozzle for wet cleaning.  The vacuum cleaner has a two-level separate system for collecting large debris and dust.  Side brush sweeps well. </p><p>  But there are significant disadvantages.  During harvesting, when driving through wide obstacles about 2 cm high, it may hang on them with the lower part of the hull.  He hardly overcomes carpets, even with short hair.  Stopping due to any obstacle, it beeps until it is discharged.  With a complex configuration of the premises, the cleaning logic is poor, rests on the thin legs of the chairs and stops.  Sometimes he does not see the base.  In short, the presence of a person is desirable during his work. </p><h2>  Chinese robot vacuum cleaner iLife V55 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gearbest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ILife V55 Robot Vacuum Cleaner" class="if uuid-3143195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3143195.jpg"></div><p>  This is the last unit in our rating and the most budgetary of all the presented models.  It supports wet cleaning.  Equipped with a 2600 mAh Li-Ion battery.  This apparatus has a cyclone filter with a capacity of 0.3. Battery life up to 110 min.  There is a function for calculating the time required for cleaning the room.  The case is equipped with a backlit display. </p><p>  The basic package includes: additional brushes, a water container, rags for wet cleaning, an electronic wall, and a fine filter. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, in the process of working on small bedside rugs it is difficult to drive in, in most cases it crushes them, despite the fact that it drives well on a large carpet.  Relatively noisy.  Dried mud washes off with difficulty, sometimes leaves dirty areas. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  This rating is based on user reviews of robot vacuum cleaners from Chinese manufacturers.  Summarizing the considered possibilities of these models, it is possible to highlight individual design advantages, for example, the absence of a dust bag, capacitive lithium-ion batteries, and an attractive and ergonomic design.  Many in the reviews note the availability of prices.  This is perhaps one of the main advantages of Chinese models.  The quality and functionality of this technique is in no way inferior to expensive robotic vacuum cleaners.  Autonomous vacuum cleaners can be purchased at a price of 17 thousand rubles, although there are models that cost from 11 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  How to choose a home appliance </h2><p>  Those wishing to purchase a robot vacuum cleaner can be recommended to look at it as a device consisting of four main structural elements: </p><ul><li>  Navigation block. </li><li>  Mechanical drive. </li><li>  Cleaning block. </li><li>  Battery. </li></ul><p>  The most important element is not the cleaning unit, but the navigation device.  There are four fundamentally different ways of orienting this machine in space: </p><ul><li>  An optical camera located on the top cover of the robot cleaner.  The device analyzes its position on the floor, focusing on information read from the ceiling and walls. </li><li>  Internal sensors located around the perimeter of the housing and under it.  With an increase in the number of these parts, the capabilities of the robot also increase.  Sensors on the bottom of the vacuum cleaner can prevent falling from tall objects, such as stairs.  Also, the vacuum cleaner can detect more dirty areas of the surface, cleaning them more thoroughly.  The more sensors installed around the perimeter, the better the robot is guided in areas of complex configuration. </li><li>  External sensors (virtual walls).  As such, infrared radiation sources or magnetic strips can be used, which are installed as barriers that the robot should not cross. </li><li>  The most advanced system is laser.  Using it as a range finder, the robot builds a map of the room and saves it in its memory.  Further cleaning is carried out on the basis of the data.  Such a system allows the use of various passage patterns for the harvested area. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="9to5mac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacuum Cleaner" class="if uuid-3142851" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/3142851.jpg"></div><p>  The cleaning unit is represented by various types of brushes.  He is responsible for picking up and throwing litter in the garbage bin.  The suction power is not significant. </p><p>  The design and material of which the brush is made is the basis of the quality work of the machine.  A rubber brush is best for cleaning hair and wool. </p><p>  The mechanical drive affects the surface of the vacuum cleaner and the noise of the apparatus as a whole.  Rubber coated wheels have optimal grip on the floor and do not scratch it. </p><p>  Non-memory lithium-ion and polymer batteries are much more durable.  Their large capacity allows cleaning for a longer time without the need for additional recharging at the base. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Based on a review of Chinese robotic vacuum cleaners, compiled on the basis of user reviews, it can be noted that among many worthy companies, the xRobot brand stands out, focusing on the offer of inexpensive and at the same time high-quality products.  XRobot company manufactures products under its logo at its own production facilities located in the Chinese Silicon Valley, thereby fully responsible for the quality of the production and assembly process. </p><p>  Should I buy a Chinese robot vacuum cleaner?  It is up to the user.  In any case, when choosing a home assistant, you should focus on individual wishes and conditions in which the operation of the device is planned. </p>
