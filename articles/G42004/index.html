    <h2>  Adler </h2><p>  This resort village is located south of Sochi and is almost a fifteen-minute drive to Abkhazia.  From the latter it is separated by <span>the Psou River.</span>  And it borders with the regions of Sochi along another water stream - Kudepsta.  There are many sanatoriums and boarding houses since Soviet times, and the last Olympics in 2014 gave the resort a new impetus in development.  Modern roads were built here, infrastructure was updated, and many hotels and restaurants were opened.  The cheapest way to go here is in early autumn.  Holidays in Adler in September will not only please you with an extension of summer, but also with a great offer of housing and a drop in prices. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Most travelers arriving to rest in the Krasnodar Territory fly here by plane.  You can use <span>the Adler Airport</span> directly <span>,</span> or Sochi.  In this case, you will arrive at the resort by express.  The Emerald Guest House (Adler), the address of which we provide in this article, is easily accessible both from the station and from the airport.  A lot of transport goes here, and there is a stop near the mini-hotel.  Regular bus number 100 leaves <span>from Adler Train Station</span> to the guest house. The stop where you need to get off is called Brick Street.  If you arrived by plane, you can get from Adler Airport by bus number 105. In this case, you need to get off at the Vodokanal stop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and water recreation </h2><p>  Walking to the beach from the guest house on foot is quite far - about half an hour, and not too convenient.  But next to it is a bus stop.  Public transport in Adler drives well.  And to get to the beach from the hotel by bus no more than five minutes - just one stop.  The beach closest to the hotel, which can be reached on foot, is not too crowded, but not equipped.  And the places on the sea coast where the bus goes are quite well-maintained, but there are a lot of them.  But you can sunbathe right at the hotel.  On the roof of this multi-story leisure complex, which is the Emerald Guest House (Adler), there is a paid pool and a solarium. </p>
