    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Probably, all motorists who executed compulsory motor third-party liability insurance faced situations when in the UK they tried to impose additional services when buying a policy.  Often, not intending to do this, policyholders nevertheless agreed with the arguments of the agents and acquired what was offered to them.  But now you don‚Äôt need to specially devote time to go to the office to take out insurance or make a purchase decision that was not planned.  Go to the Internet at any time and electronic CTP to issue on the website of the insurance company. </p><p>  All information passes through an automated database, so all kinds of errors are eliminated. </p><h2>  What is an electronic policy? </h2><p>  Payment via the Internet is not a completely new mechanism for Russian motorists.  And before it was possible to leave applications on the site, after which a letter with a policy came by mail.  However, now this procedure has been greatly simplified.  The process is fully automated, and data verification is carried out through a single database. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

However, it is up to the car owners to decide whether to use the service or not.  If desired, they can come to the office of the UK in the old fashioned manner and purchase insurance there. </p><h2>  Registration via the Internet </h2><p>  After the entry into force of the decision of the Government of the Russian Federation, an electronic policy can be bought, but only to those who have at least once already bought it in the usual way.  Then information about this fact is contained in the PCA database, on the basis of which it becomes possible to purchase insurance through the Internet. </p><p>  Thus, for those who have just received a license or purchased a car, CTP insurance is not available.  The motorist will have to go to the office of the company and draw up a document there.  When buying a policy, you should pay attention to whether the UK is a <span>member of the</span> <span>Russian Union of Auto Insurers.</span>  If not, then you will not be able to purchase a policy via the Internet next year either.  Online purchase can be carried out in large companies such as Alfastrakhovanie, Uralsib, Renaissance, Rosgosstrakh.  Electronic CTP, however, is becoming available for an increasing number of insurance companies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  If a traffic inspector stops on the road </h2><p>  If a traffic police officer stops on the road, in addition to standard documents, the driver must submit an insurance policy.

    <p>  When buying online, the driver has in his hands only a copy of the policy, and its original is stored in the PCA archive. </p><p>  You can check it through a special resource IMTS.  The same information, in principle, will show the official website of the PCA.  If it turns out that he is holding a document that is not properly executed, then the driver will be fined 800 rubles. </p><h2>  The order of receipt and some features </h2><p>  CTP insurance electronic is issued simply.  First they go to the SK site (which, as indicated, is part of the SAR).  Then they go to the section of policies where you need to go through the authorization procedure.  At the same time, a message with a verification code will be received on the phone, which is entered in the corresponding field.  As a result, a list of insurance policies that were previously purchased appears. </p><p>  The contract that is planned to be renewed is selected from them.  Then you need to answer a number of questions and pay the invoice.  Payment can also be made via the Internet in any usual way.  After it is confirmed, a message will be sent by e-mail immediately, in the annex to which the policy is contained.  It remains only to print it and carry along with the rest of the documents to the car. </p>

    <p>  So, getting insurance online is very simple.  After all, the insurer will not need to submit documents such as: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  registration certificate (if the vehicle is registered with a legal entity); </li><li>  vehicle <span>registration certificate</span> ; </li><li>  driver's license; </li><li>  diagnostic card about the passage of MOT. </li></ul><p>  All this information is already contained in the database after the purchase of the previous policy. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons </h2><p>  The fact that CTP insurance is electronic can be acquired quickly and at any convenient time, of course, is a great advantage when choosing a purchase method.  Nerves and time, usually leaving for this procedure, are protected.  Plus, you can easily make a purchase even when the driver is in another region of the country or even beyond its borders.  You only need to set aside ten minutes, and the new MTPL insurance is already in your pocket. </p><p>  However, this method has its drawbacks.  Since the issuance procedure is new, it still requires technical improvements.  Sometimes, due to a large number of people, the system can be overloaded, a failure or error is displayed. </p><p>  On the other hand, one cannot but note the prospect of this innovation.  In addition to the convenience for drivers, SKs greatly benefit from the system.  The company "Rosgosstrakh" electronic CTP is already widely used.  Apply it and other companies.  You can purchase an electronic insurance policy "VSK", "Reso-Guarantee".  Those companies that mainly built their work on <span>insurance agents</span> remain in the red.  Therefore, most likely, the list of ICs included in the SAR will increase so that they can trade in policies via the Internet. </p>

    <p>  However, in addition to the convenience of acquiring insurance, drivers should pay attention to other parameters.  After all, the essence of insurance is the possibility of receiving insurance payments, if such a need arises.  And in some companies, according to car owners, there are problems with this.  All ICs are interested in paying less.  But in some of them, monetary compensation is especially often underestimated. </p>
