The first mention of it dates back to 1576. Now this area belongs to the Eastern Administrative District of Moscow and is called the intracity municipality.  The index of the Ivanovo district (Moscow) <strong>is</strong> 111558. </p><h2>  The name of the village is Ivanovskoye </h2><p>  Ancient scribe books have survived to this day, in which the village of Ivanovskoe was first mentioned.  But to establish its exact owner is not possible, since there are many gaps, and the pages are very confused.  Most likely, the owner of the village was Ivan, nicknamed "Reut".  He lived in that area at the beginning of the sixteenth century.  He received the nickname for a loud and very loud voice.  As a result, the village where Ivan lived was called Reutovo, and the nearby village - Ivanovskoye. </p><p>  Some scribal books contain more detailed descriptions of landowners.  Half of the village belonged to the landowners Belavins.  The apple orchard, the villages of Reutovo and Berun and the wasteland of Verkhovyna were owned by the landowner Pozdeev.  In those days, there was a good tradition of settlement owners to build churches in honor of the saints.  Therefore, in the village of Ivanovo was built the Church of St. John the Baptist.  Thanks to the church, the status of the village was assigned to the area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivanovo district, Moscow" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1641381.jpg" width="600"></div>

Now this place is a municipal capital formation.  And earlier, the village of Ivanovskoye was located here.  At the beginning of the seventeenth century it was severely destroyed and was reborn only after fifty years.  The village of Ivanovskoye became part of the Izmailovo sovereign estate.  Its owners were the Romanov dynasty. </p><p>  Thanks to the efforts of Aleksei Mikhailovich, the subject territories turned into an agricultural academy.  Experimental fields, vegetable gardens for pharmacists, and greenhouses in which southern plants grew were created.  And also many orchards have been planted.  Forty ponds have been dug for fish farming and household needs.  In 1812, the village of Ivanovskoe fell into the combat zone and suffered from the robberies of the French. </p><p>  At the end of the XIX century.  Zemstvo school of the first stage was opened.  Literacy has increased dramatically.  During the peasant reform in 1861, four shops and taverns, two drinking houses, a candle factory and a weaving factory were opened in the village.  Around the same years, the Vladimirskoye Shosse was laid near the village, which in 1919 was renamed to Sh.  Enthusiasts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wao moscow" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1641383.jpg" width="596"></div>

By 1926, there were already 218 households in the area, of which 169 were peasant households.  Then a state farm appeared from the Hammer and Sickle factory, which subsequently merged with the Forward collective farm.  All these territories entered Moscow in 1960. Modern construction began in 1971. Today, the Ivanovo (Moscow) district occupies 1,150 hectares, of which 520 are residential buildings.  The rest of the territory is a forest park zone. </p><h2>  The advent of the modern district </h2><p>  In 1960, after the Moscow Ring Road was built, one half of the village moved to the Moscow region and entered Reutovo, and the other part was given to the capital.  The northern territory of the modern region became part of Stalin, later renamed Pervomaisk.  The southern part of the village began to relate to Kalininsky, and since 1969 - to Perovsky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia Moscow Ivanovo District" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1641382.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  In 1991, administrative reform took place.  Municipal districts appeared in the capital.  They were part of the administrative.  In September 1991, Ivanovo District appeared, which became part of the Eastern Administrative Okrug (Moscow).  In December of the same year, due to territorial features, a separate okrug, Yuzhnoye Izmailovo, was "split off" from it.  In 1994, he was abolished by order of Luzhkov and re-entered the Ivanovo District, and in 1995 received the status of the Moscow region. </p><h2>  Location of the Ivanovo region (Russia, Moscow) </h2><p>  Ivanovo district is located along the Moscow Ring Road in the east of the capital.  The municipality stretches along the ring from north to south, and from west to east crosses the highway of Enthusiasts.  Previously, it was called the New Vladimir Road.  The Enthusiasts Highway is one of the main metropolitan highways that divides the district into Ivanovo and South Izmailovo proper. </p><h2>  Flag </h2><p>  The Ivanovo municipality (VAO, Moscow) has its own flag.
