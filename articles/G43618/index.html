    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  Do you constantly restart your phone?  Remember what programs and applications you installed recently.  They can be the cause of this problem. </p><p>  The fact is that sometimes incorrectly installed programs cause system crashes.  As a result, the phone starts to reboot.  The only right solution is to detect a "malicious" application and then delete it. </p><p>  If you really need a program, just try to erase it and reinstall it.  Also a good way, but it does not give any guarantees of success, keep this in mind.  Most likely, you will have to get rid of the software once and for all.  Usually this is not such a problem - you just need to find an analogue of a remote program that will not cause crashes and malfunctions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone constantly reboots samsung" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1347251.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Does the phone constantly restart (Samsung or any other)?  Do not be alarmed or panic.  Understanding the causes of this phenomenon is not so easy, but it is possible to do it without outside help. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Pay attention to the battery of the gadget - this is a very important element for the operation of the device.  If something is wrong with her, the phone will start to behave in an unpredictable way.  As practice shows, in the event of a battery malfunction, either a spontaneous reboot of the device or its shutdown for no reason usually occurs. </p><p>  What to do in this case?  If you are sure that the cause of the problem with the gadget is the battery, replace it.  Just purchase a new battery and insert it into your device.  Charge the battery and look at the behavior of the phone.  Most likely, the problem will disappear.  Not?  So, the reason for the reboot of the smartphone was something else.  What other scenarios are there? </p><h2>  Moisture </h2><p>  Is your Sony phone constantly rebooting?  Anyway, any other smartphone?  The reason for this may be moisture.  In rooms with high humidity, gadgets can behave unpredictably.  And if you recently wet your phone, then there‚Äôs nothing to be surprised at!  Why?  Because the device, in principle, could not turn on.  And rebooting in this case would not seem like a problem at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony phone constantly reboots" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1347256.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If you have any suspicions that the smartphone is starting to restart due to high humidity, just try to quickly return to normal.  As soon as you leave a place with high humidity, the gadget will work fine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Is the phone constantly rebooting?  What to do if the cause of this is moisture getting on the device?  There is only one way out - to dry your smartphone as soon as possible.  Take it apart.  Next, wipe all parts well with a towel or napkin.  In some cases, you can use a hairdryer to dry quickly.  Once all the parts are 100% dry, assemble the gadget and see if it worked out to fix the problem.  Usually, with operational actions, the result will not be long in coming.  Now many phones tolerate moisture well.  Therefore, there is no particular reason for panic. </p><h2>  Settings </h2><p>  Does the LG phone reboot constantly (and in general, any other gadget model)?  In this case, pay attention to the system settings of your device.  Often they cause many problems with smartphones.  The phone can turn off, reboot, slow down.  All this indicates a lost setting. </p>

    <p>  You can edit them yourself so that the system does not reboot.  It is difficult to do this, so many people prefer the radical way - flashing.  The most difficult and most efficient process.  It is not recommended to independently implement it, turn to specialists for help.  If the reason for constant reboots lay precisely in the failed settings, then after flashing this phenomenon will disappear. </p><h2>  Space </h2><p>  What else can you pay attention to when the phone is constantly rebooting?  The amount of information on the gadget.  Take a good look at how much space is left on the memory card, and on the built-in "place" for storing information.  What for? </p><p>  The problem is that often full memory in any gadget leads to problems.  Fortunately, correcting the situation is easy and simple - just clean the smartphone.  Remove all old and unnecessary applications, media files and programs.  And make it a habit to clean your phone space from time to time.  So you can return the device to the right track, and also prevent the recurrence of the problem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the phone is constantly rebooting" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1347254.jpg"></div>

    <p>  By the way, if you are wondering why the phone constantly reboots, look at the total size of your memory card, if any.  Each smartphone runs smoothly only with a certain additional space.  If a larger memory card is inserted into the gadget, performance is impaired.  As a result, crashes appear, sudden reboots and the gadget shuts down.  Therefore, use only memory cards that correspond to the maximum allowable size for the model of your phone. </p><h2>  Overheat </h2><p>  There is another not very dangerous and easily removable reason for the sudden restart of the smartphone.  In principle, the same option is relevant for other gadgets (like computers).  It's about overheating.  As soon as the device heats up to a certain temperature, it either shuts down or reboots.  It is quite normal - this is how the system saves itself from failure. </p><p>  The solution to the problem is simple - just stop bringing the device to overheat.  Turn off programs running in the background, do not use the phone continuously for too long.  This is the only way you can normalize the work of the gadget.  Try not to keep it in the sun. </p><h2>  Viruses </h2><p>  Is your phone constantly rebooting?  What to do in this case?  Check it for viruses.  Phone infection often causes a device to reboot spontaneously.  In this case, a variety of antiviruses will help.  Or service centers. </p><p>  If you find viruses on your mobile phone, delete them.  After treating the phone, all problems will disappear by themselves.  Viruses are found every day on smartphones more and more.  Therefore, this option should be checked first. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone constantly reboots what to do" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1347253.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Time </h2><p>  In some cases, if the phone is constantly rebooting, you just need to change it.  Each device has its own life.  And when it comes to an end, various failures and malfunctions appear.  Correcting them will not work.  In order not to lose time, take the phone to a service center - there they will help you find the source of the problem, and also let you know if it makes sense to fix it. </p><p>  Depreciation of equipment is inevitable.  Therefore, if your phone has been working for about 5 years, and then suddenly started to reboot, it is quite possible that it needs to be changed. </p>
