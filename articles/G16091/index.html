What does this word mean?  What does this subject matter?  What is the history of this designation?  How did the invested meaning change?  These, as well as a number of other, but similar issues, will be considered as part of the article. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Recently, such a designation has been used for banknotes with a face value of 10 rubles, as well as for coins of the same denomination.  But not everyone can explain where this word came from and how the object looked like 100 or 300 years ago, which was indicated by it.  Let's scroll through the pages of our own history and find out what the chervonets is, the way of its formation and development over the centuries. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ma-shops.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="golden chervonets nikolai" class="if uuid-3028506" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3028506.jpg"></div><p>  The first mentions date back to the reign of Ivan the Terrible.  Then the word ‚Äúchervonets‚Äù began to supplant ‚ÄúUgric‚Äù.  So for a long time called golden European ducats, which fell from Hungary.  Although not necessarily it was chasing this country.  They mainly went to pay for the labor of foreign mercenaries.  What is chervonets from an entomological point of view?  By this is meant a coin made of "pure gold."  But this is not about the color of the metal, but about its quality.  In other words, so-called high-grade coins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The modern more popular analogue is red (square, damsel, corner).  From the jewelry itself, one should recall the minting of gold kopecks, which took place before the Time of Troubles.  But the real royal chervonets appears in the time of Peter I.  Then capital monetary reform was carried out.  As a result, the appearance of the coins has completely changed.  In addition, the basis is not a penny, as it was before, but a silver ruble coin.  It was then that the first real chervonets appeared (including double ones).  They were gold coins that did not have a face value.  Their weight and sample corresponded to Dutch ducats.  The difference was the presence of the portrait of Peter I. </p><h2>  Imperial period </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.numista.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is chervonets" class="if uuid-3028488" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3028488.jpg"></div><p>  Initially, at the time of the reorganization of the state by Peter I, when Russian gold coins were settled with foreigners, you had to pay crap.  This is a certain percentage, which is associated with a weak demand for domestic money abroad.  Surprisingly, then even means of payment fully secured by precious metal could not compete in full force with the products of Dutch coinage.  Although the created coins in all respects could claim the title of full participants in the circulation (which was practiced in the country).  Chervonets without a face value were minted with small interruptions until the end of the 18th century.  Then there were two-, five- and ten-ruble coins.  The first was characterized by a slightly higher weight, but a smaller sample.  The latter was called imperial.  It was necessary to solve the problem of the lack of demand for the imperial currency. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In its own way, an adventurous and interesting decision was introduced in 1768 by its instruction Catherine II.  Then secretly began to mint replicas of popular Dutch ducats.  Moreover, they were used not only for foreign purchases, but also when equipping Russian companies and providing the army.  These coins were nicknamed pinches.  It is believed that this is due to the applied image.  Such is a knight archer with a helmet pulled over his forehead.  In 1849, the coinage of these coins was stopped by Holland.  Although in the Russian Empire they continued to be created until 1868, until a note of protest was received by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  For another 17 years, coins of three ruble denomination were minted, which had a similar weight.  This is what the chervonets is during its formation. </p><h2>  Changes in the late empire </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fr.numista.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="royal chervonets" class="if uuid-3028491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3028491.jpg"></div><p>  The Nikolaev gold chervonets has a number of features.  Formally, he was an imperial.  But in fact - only 2/3.  Why is that?  The gold dime "Nikolai 2" in the Witte era was turned into a transitional coin.  The reason is simple - the Witte reform led to the fact that the content of the gold ruble "dried up" 1.5 times.  What caused this situation?  The fact is that the circulation of gold and silver coins was disrupted due to inflation.  But for gold this process is not relevant.  There was a situation when coins of this metal went at the market rate as a parallel currency.  The main stake was made on simple paper money (credit cards).  To equalize the value of candy wrappers and gold, it was just necessary to cut coins one and a half times.  The silver ruble did not change due to the fact that the price of the precious metal fell significantly at the end of the nineteenth century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Soviet period </h2><p>  Perhaps, the most famous coin-chervonets belongs to this period.  After the civil war, the country's financial situation was unenviable.  Therefore, it was decided to carry out the reform.  As a sample, Witte invented the changes.  It was planned to resume circulation in the country of hard money.  There was a question about the designation.  To use the official imperial name "imperial" did not allow ideology.  Everything was moving towards being called the "federal."  But then they remembered about the chervonets.  We decided that this could be limited.  And the gold content was similar to a 10-ruble coin from the time of Nicholas II.  The coin until the 25th year was quite actively used on the exchanges of Harbin, Rome, Berlin, London. </p><h2>  How the chervonets saved the situation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rmegold.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin chervonets" class="if uuid-3028510" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3028510.jpg"></div><p>  In the initial period of the Soviet Union, a gold coin played a big role.  Due to the outbreak of inflation, getting wages lost their meaning.  For example, before the revolution, a family had 20-30 rubles for a month, and in the fall of 1921 only one pound of potatoes cost twenty thousand.  Settlement bonds have gained popularity.  True, their course was constantly changing.  We must not forget that in the territory not controlled by the Soviet government, their money was also printed.  All this diversity had one unifying property - the chervonets was highly valued.  The year of issue of Soviet coins has not yet arrived, therefore, they paid with imperials with the image of Nicholas II.  In 1922, it was decided that it was necessary to create a parallel currency using the gold standard.  Then they decided that the amount of pure precious metal should equal what it was in ten rubles since the time of Nicholas II.  This money was dubbed chervonets. </p><h2>  Implementation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.coinshome.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="golden chervonets nikolay 2" class="if uuid-3028511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3028511.jpg"></div><p>  It must be understood that not only coins were minted, but also banknotes were issued.  Their gold content was indicated on the tickets.  At the same time, exchange for a precious metal was carried out freely.  In 1923 (and, presumably, in 1924) more than two million coins were minted.  Also in 1925 there was another 600,000 circulation, but for the most part it was re-melted.  From 1975 to 1982, the same coins were additionally re-issued.  Their number ranges from 6.6 to 7.4 million units.  Coins issued during the Soviet Union are also known as the "Sower", thanks to the image of a peasant who is engaged in planting seeds.  The second major release was dedicated to the 1980 Olympics.  Now they are considered, as a rule, from the position that these are investment coins.  Separately, it is worth mentioning the one hundred thousand pieces of gold that were created for collectors and are distinguished by improved quality. </p><h2>  How valuable is it </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.coinshome.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolaev chervonets golden" class="if uuid-3028515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3028515.jpg"></div><p>  Chervonets - how much is it in modern money?  If we talk about analogues of Dutch ducats, then they contained 3.48 grams of pure gold.  Soviet chervonets contain 7.74 g of precious metal.  If you evaluate by weight of gold, then you need to multiply the value in grams by the price.  That is, Soviet chervonets cost about 20,000 rubles.  But in practice, their price is a little more, something about 21-24 thousand rubles.  This is if we talk about coins issued in the 70s and early 80s.  Money from the beginning of the Soviet Union is estimated at about three times more expensive.  And if we talk about royal coins, then their price is even higher, due to the cultural significance and a significant number of collectors who want to get them.  That is, the value is formed not only because of the availability of valuable metal (although it is possible to sell and, proceeding only from this), but also because of cultural and collecting desirability and value. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vcoins.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chervonets is how much" class="if uuid-3028517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3028517.jpg"></div><p>  What interest are the chervonets?  What is it they contain that attract people today?  First of all, you need to understand that they are investment coins.  Of course, they are of collectible value, but it is better to consider them from the point of view of investing your own funds.  Why so?  The fact is that since the cancellation of gold security, the real value of this precious metal is constantly growing.  Not very fast (only half over the past half century), but if you are interested in saving money, this is probably the best option.  He is not afraid of time, the amount of gold is limited, so the price will rise.  But the issues of preservation and protection from lovers encroach on someone else's are relevant.  If a few chervonets were purchased, then this can be solved on their own.  And if you bought a hundred or second coins?  In this case, even a home disguised safe may not be reliable enough, especially if many are aware of its existence.  This is dangerous and you should carefully consider this approach.  If you rent a bank cell, then almost the entire increase in value will go to conservation.  Everyone is looking for answers to these questions on their own. </p>
