Some users are quite satisfied with the classic push-button ‚Äúhandsets‚Äù.  Many people believe that such phones are useless and no one needs.  But this is far from the case.  Otherwise, they would simply not have been released.  But many companies are engaged in the production of such devices.  And one of them is the legendary Nokia.  There are very interesting and simple models in the arsenal of this manufacturer.  One of them is Nokia 105 Dual Sim.  The characteristics of this phone are, of course, far from smartphones, but this does not make it any less interesting.  And now let's recall the main milestones of the development of the Finnish giant. </p><h2>  A brief history of Nokia </h2><p>  The Finnish company Nokia was founded in 1896.  And then she was engaged in the production of paper and cardboard.  After a couple of decades, the company's main profile was various rubber products (including galoshes).  But the manufacturer began to produce electronics only in the eighties of the last century.  And their business went so well that they decided to create a separate unit for the production of mobile phones.  That is how the very Nokia that everyone knows and loves appeared.  Phones from the Finns were very popular.  At that time, these were high-tech devices, which, incidentally, cost a lot.  But our hero today is the Nokia 105 DS.  Its characteristics are such that it cannot cost much on the background of modern smartphones. </p>

    <p>  In 2010, something unimaginable began to happen with Nokia.  The company simply could not compete with "Apple" and "Samsung" in the smartphone market.  Attempts were made to release a modern smartphone on the Windows platform, but they failed.  In the end, the production became so unprofitable that the management decided to sell the Nokia mobile division to Microsoft with all the guts.  But Microsoft has managed to finally bury the legendary brand, this often happens in life.  And only relatively recently it became known that the legendary Nokia is returning.  And not with anything, but with a smartphone on Android.  And the Nokia 105 model, whose technical characteristics are rather modest, is nothing more than a test of the pen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Phone positioning.  Who needs it? </h2><p>  A perfectly fair question, considering that now is the age of smartphones.  However, people with dangerous work, old people and just fans of retrotubes are the target audience of the Nokia 105. The characteristic of this phone is that it is perfect for the elderly: convenient buttons with large numbers, large letters on the screen, a notebook with a decent number of numbers, no various unnecessary options.  And for those who have a dangerous job, this phone is just what you need.  Even if you accidentally break it, then there will be nothing wrong.  You can just go and buy a new one, because it costs a penny, but you still have to try to break it. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  Let's start with the appearance of Nokia 105. The design characteristic is as follows: strong, reliable, plastic, color.  And indeed it is.  The phone case is made of sturdy plastic, which is also quite pleasant to the touch.  There are several color options for the device: black, blue and white.  The gadget in black looks best.  It is also incredibly practical, as the dirt on black is less noticeable.  It is worth noting that the keyboard is completely rubber.  Like the navigation button.  This allows them to last a little longer.  Yes, and wet the phone is not scary.  A distinctive feature of the design of this phone is the case.  It seems to be classic, but it has rounded edges that allow you to comfortably carry the gadget in your pocket, without fear that sharp corners will dig into the body.  At the top end of the device is a charging socket (thin and round, in the style of Nokia), a flashlight and a headphone jack.  At the bottom there is only a conversational microphone.  Nothing more.  On the back cover there is only a speaker grill.  No camera, flash, or other unnecessary components.  This is an ultra-budget <span>push-button telephone.</span>  That‚Äôs the way it remains. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Product Specifications </h2><p>  Now let's look at the Nokia 105 stuffing. The phone‚Äôs specifications do not allow us to dwell on the processor and RAM for the simple reason that they are not there.  The device is based on the classic operating system from Nokia S30.  The gadget is equipped with an internal drive of 16 megabytes.  But this ridiculous figure can be increased with a Micro SD memory card.  Flash drives up to 16 gigabytes are supported.  For music, this is enough.  The screen in the device is extremely small.  Its diagonal is only 1.4 inches.  Screen resolution - 128 by 128 pixels.  Naturally, with such display parameters, viewing pictures on it will be extremely inconvenient.  However, this miniature miracle has one advantage: on a sunny day, information is perfectly visible on the street. </p>

    <h2>  Gadget Features and Features </h2><p>  The built-in operating system adds a number of functions to the Nokia 105 2017. The OS feature does not allow counting on the availability of particularly advanced options, but all that is needed is here.  Firstly, a contact list.  It allows you to accommodate 500 units.  You won‚Äôt be able to set a separate melody for each, but you can use a personal image for each subscriber.  Secondly, SMS storage.  It allows you to accumulate up to 700 text messages.  Thirdly, the device has a radio.  It only works when you connect the headphones.  They are used as an antenna.  Other features include the availability of a calculator, alarm clock, flashlight, timer, stopwatch, currency converter.  There is also a very interesting program called "Consumption".  It helps keep track of finances and other resources spent. </p>

    <h2>  Connection quality </h2><p>  In such phones, the quality of communication plays a special role.  It should be on the level.  What about Nokia 105?  The reception characteristic of the device is decent.  Where modern smartphones do not catch the network, this phone works as it should.  The gadget‚Äôs antenna is powerful.  As for the quality of voice transmission, there is a snag.  The interlocutor hears you perfectly, but you do not hear him very well.  This is due to the design of the phone.  It uses a single speaker for playing music and for talking.  As a result, the sound during the conversation is extremely quiet, as the speaker is located closer to the back of the gadget.  You can, of course, increase the sound, but then your conversation will be made public.  And this is not good. </p><h2>  Battery life and battery </h2><p>  Phones like the Nokia 105 should have a good charge.  This phone has a removable battery with a capacity of 800 mAh.  This is enough for the device to work for four days in normal load mode.  It seems that the battery has a small capacity, but let's not forget that this is not a smartphone.  This device uses energy extremely sparingly.  Hence, such a battery life.  For many, it is this that is the decisive factor when buying this phone. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the classic push-button phone Nokia 105. It is very simple, made in the classic candy bar format, has all the necessary functions and perfectly catches the network.  But its most important advantage is the battery life.  Its cost is such that in the event of a breakdown of the device it will not be difficult to go and buy a new one.  Definitely a decent device that many will enjoy.  In terms of reception quality, modern smartphones are not suitable for him. </p>
