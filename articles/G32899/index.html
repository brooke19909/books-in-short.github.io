    <p>  Many needlewomen who love to sew always have pieces of fabric.  Do not rush to throw them away, they can be useful.  For example, <span>these shreds</span> come in handy to make a patchwork bedspread.  With your own hands, this product is easy to sew.  For work you will need shreds of various sizes and different fabrics (silk, cotton, satin).  These segments are sewn into a single fabric with a specific pattern.  The thing turns out bright and unique. </p><p>  If you liked this technique, then try to start with a simple little thing.  For example, make a bedspread on a bed.  Patchwork is easy to learn.  You do not need to be a professional seamstress, it is enough to have skills in handling a sewing machine and a needle with a thread. </p><h2>  Patchwork: Varieties </h2><p>  The following types of patchwork techniques are distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Traditional.  This is the creation of a single piece of cloth from individual rags.  The front side of this product is made using the patchwork technique, and the lining is made from a single piece of fabric.  Pillows in the kitchen are usually sewn in this style, pillowcases. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork cover for beginners" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/358748.jpg?1396007812043" width="499"></div></li><li>  Crazy patchwork.  For sewing, shapes of arbitrary shape, non-standard applications or curved stripes are used.  The seams are masked with braid, lace, ribbons, beads or buttons.  Handbags, clothes, and <span>decorative panels</span> are made using this technique <span>.</span> </li><li>  Knitted.  Shreds in this style are not sewn, but crocheted.  Most often, <span>patchwork quilts</span> on the bed, bags, clothes are performed in the <span>patchwork</span> technique. </li><li>  Japanese.  <span>Silk fabrics</span> are used in this patchwork technique <span>.</span>  Segments are cut in the form of geometric shapes: squares, triangular rhombuses and corners.  Clothing, decorative panels and bedspreads are made in this style. </li><li>  Quilting.  A soft pad of sintepon or batting is laid between two canvases and everything is connected with a machine line.  Pillows, kitchen potholders, clothes for children are made using this technique. </li></ol><h2>  Sewing technique </h2><p>  It seems to many that the patchwork technology is very simple: cut and stitch.  But this is simple at first glance.  In fact, the patchwork technique requires skill, artistic taste, perseverance, hard work, accuracy and most importantly, the ability to sew.  The following methods of stitching tissue segments are distinguished: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  "Fast squares."  This technique is named for a reason, since squares are cut from previously stitched strips of fabric.  Four types of matter are taken.  First, two strips of the same color are sewn together, and then two more of the other.  Face-to-face strips are applied and stitched together.  It turns out in this way "sleeve".  Then an angle of 45 degrees is measured.  That is, a ruler is taken and applied first to the upper edge of the "sleeve", and then to the bottom.  Such an action is performed along the entire length.  Thus we obtain squares. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork bedspreads schemes" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/363848.jpg?1396278304222" width="570"></div></li><li>  "Watercolor".  A minimum of seven types of fabric are taken as a basis; square shreds from light shade to dark are combined.  This creates the effect of drawing in watercolor. </li><li>  "Strip to strip."  A product is assembled from multi-colored stripes of matter.  Pieces are laid with rhombuses, zigzag, ladder or corners. </li><li>  "Log hut."  This technique is based on stripes.  They are sewn in a spiral around the square, which is located in the center of the canvas. </li><li>  "Magic triangles."  This item is convenient to use.  Triangles make simple squares or complex patterns, for example, “Diamond”, “Mill”, “Star”. </li><li>  "Chess".  Squares are staggered. </li><li>  "Russian square."  Assembling the pattern is complicated.  The canvas is based on a square.  In the upper and lower tiers isosceles triangles are made.  The remaining rows are assembled from triangles and stripes. </li><li>  "Honeycombs."  Going pattern of hexagons.  A flower is made of them, and a button is sewn into the middle and covered with fabric. </li></ol><h2>  Patchwork technique: blanket for beginners </h2><p>  If you decide to sew such a product for the first time, then you should know the following stages of preparation for this process: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__6nz"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__6nz"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__6nz"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__6nz"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__6nz"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  In the manufacture of bedspreads you will need to stock up on patience and free time. </li><li>  When sewing, use high-quality threads.  Choose them to match the fabric. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork baby bedspreads" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/358749.jpg?1396007886489" width="375"></div></li><li>  Before you start sewing, prepare patterns on which flaps will be cut out. </li><li>  Be sure to sort workpieces that are useful for sewing by color and texture. </li><li>  Then proceed to create a product outline.  Please note that for beginner needlewomen who are going to sew in the patchwork technique for the first time, it is better to use ready-made patterns.  They can be taken in the magazine. </li><li>  For sewing you will need the following tools: roller knife, pins, chalk, cardboard (for making a pattern), sewing needles, pencil, sewing machine, knitting hook. </li></ol><h2>  How to make a template </h2><p>  Take a thick cardboard, draw on it the outline of a square of the required size.  Do not forget to make allowances for the seams, on each side, one centimeter, set aside and draw the second line of the contour.  Take a sharp knife.  Start cutting the inner, and then the outer contour.  You have a template in the form of a frame.  Put the workpiece on the wrong side of the fabric and draw a chalk around all the contours.  For example, for the standard size of the bedspread (150 by 200 centimeters), it is necessary to cut 180 square shreds measuring 15 by 15 centimeters (taking into account allowances for the seams). </p><h2>  Application of patchwork </h2><p>  Any items of interior and wardrobe (except shoes) can be made using the patchwork technique.  Thus, original blouses, skirts and vests are obtained from the crazie fabric, quilting technique is quite suitable for sewing an autumn jacket, you can also make bags, kitchen gloves and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork patchwork bedspreads" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/361775.jpg?1396277529750" width="570"></div>
