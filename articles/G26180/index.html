  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Sicily</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Holidays in Sicily is a wonderful opportunity to see with your own eyes an absolutely unique mini-state, which, formally being the autonomy of Italy, safely continues its amazing, unlike anything, vibrant existence.  The non-trivial historical path of this beautiful island is reflected not only in architecture, dialect and culture - the special spirit of Sicily hospitably envelops tourists, forcing them to return here again and again. </p><p>  Last-minute tours to Sicily can be purchased at a fairly reasonable price, which means that every lover of the sun, sea and amazing experiences can visit the pearl of the Mediterranean Sea. </p><p>  Here you will get acquainted with samples of completely different culture and art: the majestic remains of Roman cities, magnificent theaters and temples erected by the ancient Greeks, proud medieval cathedrals, amazing baroque buildings, exquisite Byzantine mosaics.  The most beautiful thing is that all these and many other architectural wonders harmoniously coexist next to each other, giving travelers the feeling of a fairy tale.  And perhaps this is not only a sensation.  After all, it was in this now popular resort that the mythical Cyclops Polyphem lived more than a thousand years ago, and the bloodthirsty <span>Scylla and Charybdis lurked</span> in the coastal waters <span>.</span> </p><p>  In addition to wonderful examples of skillful architecture, a vacation in Sicily promises tourists all kinds of beach pleasures.  Where else can you soak up the unique <span>black sand,</span> which, in fact, represents the crushed lava of another pride of the island - Mount Etna.  For lovers of more standard coastal areas, there are beaches with the usual white sand, pebbles or stones.  And sea bathing in clear warm water the <span>color of turquoise,</span> scuba diving in the wonderful underwater world of corals will not leave indifferent. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can get a powerful charge of vivacity and positive emotions by visiting the island‚Äôs numerous entertainment complexes.  For example, Etnaland, the largest amusement park in Europe, will give you an unforgettable experience: <span>water slides of</span> different heights and steepness, springboards and towers for every taste, a laser show, dinosaur valley, river walks, which are accompanied by real crocodiles and hippos on your boat.  Charm and smiles - this is what awaits travelers in the house of tropical butterflies.  These motley fluttering creatures will give you a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãjoyful and wonderful minutes.  But outdoor activities in Sicily are not limited to discos, water parks, zoos and diving.  Sports enthusiasts will appreciate skiing from snowy Etna. </p><p>  Holidays in Sicily are a great occasion to think about the eternal.  This is facilitated by a visit to the Museum of the Dead, which is located in the main city of the island - Palermo.  In the 16th century, a terrible plague raged on this blessed land.  Struck by a terrible epidemic, they were betraying open burials in specially designated catacombs, fashionable at that time.  The funeral duty lay on the shoulders of the Capuchin monks, whose representatives became the first "inhabitants" of the death caves.  The plague eventually receded, and the habit of burying the dead in the monastery catacombs remained for several centuries.  In 1926, the last burial occurred.  And now, 30 km of the labyrinth awaits the travelers with strong spirits, from the walls of which with dead eyes I look at thousands of mummies, inspiring me with my whole mind: remember death. </p><p>  If you fortunately acquired last-minute trips to Sicily, get ready to adopt an <span>orange tree,</span> visit the oldest puppet theater and taste the tastiest and most beautiful sweets in the world - Martorano cakes.  This means that the trip promises to be exciting, interesting and enjoyable, and also tasty and healthy! </p>
