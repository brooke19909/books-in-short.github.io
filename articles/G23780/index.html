The main advantages of such new buildings: good ecology, European standard apartments, low prices.  All these advantages are possessed by the Vesna residential complex, being erected from the Moscow Ring Road only 27 km.  The construction and commissioning of the residential complex are divided in turn.  In the first, people have been living for a long time, in the second they are preparing to move in, and the third phase is still under construction.  We offer an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of this complex, based on the feedback of residents and equity holders. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The residential complex "Vesna" (Aprelevka) has the following address: Naro-Fominsky district, the city of Aprelevka, Yasnaya street.  It separates the LCD from the village of Cromino.  A little further, immediately beyond <span>the Desna River, the</span> land of the village of Martemyanovo spreads.  The microdistrict in which the Vesna residential complex is being built is called by analogy with the nearest village - Martemyanovo-7.  There is another street in the complex - Jasminovaya.  It is much shorter than Yasnaya, but it‚Äôs indicated in the mailing address of some buildings.  Near the residential complex there are no large urban buildings, only gardening associations "Pensioner" and "Summer", as well as a new modern cottage village in Kromino.  The city itself with all its infrastructure lies on the other side of the Kiev highway, to which the complex is no more than 200 meters.  If you move along the highway, to the Moscow Ring Road from the Vesna complex 27 km, and to Naro-Fominsk 28 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential complex Spring" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1745693.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Vesna residential complex was built at some distance from Moscow, the Kiev highway allows motorists to get to the Salaryevo or Rumyantsevo metro stations in just a quarter of an hour.  Convenient parking lots are arranged here, which makes it possible to safely leave the car and move on by metro.  For those residents of Vesna who use public transport, recently introduced a new bus route number 22, which stopped immediately at the exit of the LCD.  This bus goes from the village of Martemyanovo to Aprelevka station, where you can catch an electric train and in 50 minutes get to Moscow, to the Kiev railway station.  In addition, literally 1600 meters from the LCD there is another railway.  node - platform "Country".  The interval of movement of buses No. 22 according to the established schedule is 30 minutes.  Those who are not very comfortable can go to Moscow or Naro-Fominsk by other buses.  Their stop is 400-700 meters (depending on the location of the residential building).  8 routes stop here, 4 of which go to the metro stations Salaryevo and Yugo-Zapadnaya. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  In a beautiful and environmentally friendly place the residential complex "Spring" was built.  Aprelevka used to be famous throughout the country for its gramophone record factory.  Nowadays, diverse offices are located in its building, and the plant itself has not been working for more than 20 years.  There are no large enterprises polluting the atmosphere in the city.  The only problem that the residents of the first stage of the RC ‚ÄúVesna‚Äù encountered was the old treatment facilities that could not cope with their load. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex Spring Aprelevka" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1745687.jpg" width="498"></div>  According to many homeowners, for the first time there were unpleasant odors in the complex.  Nowadays, reconstruction of these structures is underway, so all the bad aromas literally disappeared.  However, the problem has not yet been resolved, since long-term runoff to Desna, whose MPC was exceeded tenfold, significantly polluted the river.  They were carried out near Martemyanovsky bridge, not far from the complex.  The second source that reduces environmental performance is Kievskoye Shosse, which is less than 200 meters from the nearest Vesna buildings.  With the exception of these two positions, the environmental situation in the complex is quite favorable.  It was built surrounded by gardens, not far from the forested area, which makes it accessible for its residents to regularly take interesting walks, have picnics in nature, and most importantly, breathe clean air.

The Moscow region now offers customers dozens of excellent LCDs, but only this one is the winner of the "Real Estate Market Records" contest, which the complex won in 2013.  35 hectares of land have been allocated for its development, where it is planned to erect a total of 16 multi-section buildings with 6-12 floors.  They are located in such a way as to form a cozy courtyards in which there are no parking areas.  Parking will be built outside the territory.  According to the general plan, it will be multi-level, accommodating 2500 units of vehicles.  They plan to decorate the adjacent territory with green spaces, establish benches, and plant flower beds.  For children in each courtyard, colorful playgrounds are already equipped for games, and for sports enthusiasts, bicycle paths have been created, sports grounds have been built.  It is noteworthy that the entire territory of the complex is fenced, entry to it is through a checkpoint equipped with a barrier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments in a residential complex Spring" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1745700.jpg" width="482"></div>

    <p>  The buildings of the complex are being built using monolithic-brick technology.  The facades are finished with ceramic tiles.  All of them have spectacular glazing of balconies.  The entrance areas in the houses are bright and spacious, equipped with high-speed safe lifts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure on the territory </h2><p>  It is not without reason that the Vesna residential complex has been recognized as the best among similar housing projects.  Its creators have tried to include in the general plan all social amenities needed for a comfortable life.  A supermarket, a small grocery store, two kindergartens have already been built on the territory of the residential complex, a school is being built at a rapid pace, which will accept the first students in 2018.  In the future, a large shopping center will be opened here.  The first floors of some (not all) buildings are also given for office premises, where they are going to place a dental clinic, a kids club, a cafe.  Opinions of the residents of the complex on this issue differ.  Some people think that social facilities are needed, while others want to see only the most necessary things in their residential complex ‚Äî kindergartens and a school, because they are afraid that there will be a lot of fuss and noise from other institutions. </p><h2>  Infrastructure in the area </h2><p>  Residential complex "Spring" is being built next to the already inhabited areas of the city, where there is a developed infrastructure.  So, within a radius of 500 meters from the residential complex there is a kindergarten, two supermarkets, an ambulance hospital, a credit bank, a restaurant, and within a radius of 1000 meters there is a Vozrozhdeniye bank, construction shops, several cafes, a restaurant, school No. 4, and a clinic.  All these institutions are located so close that the residents of Vesna can walk there, but they will have to cross the constantly busy Kiev highway, which causes some inconvenience. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="housing estate spring reviews" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1745675.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  A fairly high rating of 7.8 out of 10 points has a residential complex "Spring".  The reviews of those who have already moved into their apartments are mostly positive.  The advantages of the project marked by tenants and interest holders: </p><p>  - environmentally friendly area; </p><p>  - convenient transport interchanges; </p><p>  - high-quality construction work; </p><p>  - beautiful design of the complex; </p><p>  - kindergartens and shops were commissioned; </p><p>  - good improvement; </p><p>  - large panoramic windows; </p><p>  - excellent playgrounds; </p><p>  - fenced area. </p><p>  Shortcomings noted by residents: </p><p>  - in the apartments in the winter is pretty cool; </p><p>  - Too high utility bills that must be paid before settling in the apartment; </p><p>  - while there is no parking declared in the project, there are difficulties with parking; </p><p>  - poor quality security; </p><p>  - the arrangement of offices on the ground floors, although the project should have residential apartments there. </p><p>  Interest holders who have not yet received the keys note one drawback: the deadlines for the delivery of the second stage of the second stage have been postponed several times, but as a result the buildings have not yet been delivered. </p>
