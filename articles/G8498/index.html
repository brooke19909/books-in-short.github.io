The most popular resorts in Vietnam</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Vietnam is a small country that deserves close attention from tourists.  Most of our compatriots go to the country for the sun and warmth.  Beginners often wonder where to go in Vietnam.  The choice of resorts in the country is quite large.  The entire east coast is washed by the sea, the coastline is more than 3 thousand kilometers.  The most popular resorts in Vietnam offer varied vacation options. </p><h2>  Best time to travel </h2><p>  Where to go in Vietnam?  It all depends on how long your vacation is.  Many of us can not always choose the desired time to relax.  Therefore, to give preference to a particular place is, given all the circumstances.  Knowing the features of different resorts, you can choose the most successful option. </p><p>  It should be understood that Vietnam is a country with a very contrasting climate.  Here the seasons are quite clearly delineated.  Therefore, choosing the time is not so difficult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tour.dulichvietnam.com.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang in March" class="if uuid-3164277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3164277.jpg"></div><p>  In the summer, a time comes in the country that is not suitable for rest.  And with it come tropical rain.  In such weather, it is difficult to talk about a good pastime.  For people who are not used to such weather conditions, it will not be very comfortable.  Many people think that the period from May to October is not the best time to relax.  But from the end of November to April comes the time of the high season, that is, increased demand for trips to this region.  During this period, the weather is incredibly favorable for relaxation.  It is for this reason that our tourists travel to Vietnam in the winter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Winter in the south of Vietnam is very hot weather.  Temperature invariably exceeds +30 degrees.  There is absolutely no rain during this period.  A clear sky gives hot weather.  But in the north of Vietnam at the same time quite cool.  Air temperature does not exceed +15 degrees.  Showers do not happen here, but small rains happen. </p><p>  The spring in Vietnam is very hot, and the sea resembles fresh milk.  Until the end of April, rains are not observed.  Showers come with the onset of May.  In the central regions of the country the weather is quite comfortable, the air temperature reaches +27 degrees.  The closer the summer, the more often it rains.  In spring you can swim in all resorts of the South China Sea.  It is well warmed up for a comfortable stay. </p><p>  The weather in the summer is incredibly rainy.  Heavy rains begin, which sometimes go on the wall, but at the same time, it is incredibly hot in Vietnam.  The temperature does not drop below +35 degrees.  In the north of the camp, summers are even hotter, and showers are as strong as in the south.  Relatively dry weather at this time in the country is observed only in the central part.  But in August, a period of typhoons begins, which are raging throughout the central region.  After them, the roads become so blurry that it‚Äôs impossible to get anywhere. </p><p>  Autumn weather in Vietnam is not conducive to travel.  In the south of the country until November there are heavy rains that leave at the end of the month.  In the northern regions, the rains gradually subside, but typhoons rage until the end of autumn.  In the central part of Vietnam, hurricanes begin, because of which rest can be dangerous. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to go in July? </h2><p>  Where to go in Vietnam in the summer if you want to swim in the sea?  It is best to opt for the central part of the country (from Hue to Nha Trang).  During this period, there is a comfortable temperature of water and air, and the humidity level is the lowest than in other regions. </p><p>  In the north of Vietnam, it is incredibly hot in the summer, you can‚Äôt count on the arrival of night coolness.  The water is very warm, but it often rains.  The sea becomes very muddy due to storms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.secretescapes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in Vietnam in February" class="if uuid-3164287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3164287.jpg"></div><p>  In the south of the country it is also very humid and rainy.  Therefore, relaxing here in the summer is uncomfortable.  From all the above, it is obvious where to go in July.  Vietnam has a very elongated and extended territory, making the weather different in different regions.  The central part of the country remains the only most comfortable region in the summer.  You can opt for the resort of Hoi An.  The air temperature here reaches +31 degrees.  Slight winds from the sea bring coolness.  It rains sometimes in the evenings.  You can also go to Da Nang, on the territory of which the weather is practically no different from Hoi An, but it rains more often. </p><p>  In Nha Trang, the dry season is in full swing.  Air temperature reaches +31 degrees, and water - +28 degrees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Where to go in the winter? </h2><p>  The temperature in Vietnam in January reaches +30 degrees and is conducive to relaxation.  The weather is getting dry, no rain.  Experienced travelers recommend heading to the south of Vietnam in winter.  At this time, the air temperature here is in the range + 25 ... + 28 degrees, and the water in the sea has the same indicators.  If you believe the reviews, then in winter it is most comfortable to relax on the islands of Fukuok and Kondao, in the resorts of Mui Ne and Fantiet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestvietnamtours.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The temperature in Vietnam in January" class="if uuid-3164292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3164292.jpg"></div><p>  If you do not know where to relax in Vietnam in February, choose Nha Trang.  Some tourists believe that in the winter the resort is a bit windy and damp.  But this is completely wrong.  In Nha Trang you can sunbathe, swim and go boating.  If you wish, you can even set aside time for sightseeing. </p><p>  But it is not worth going to the northern regions of the camps, because there it is too cool (+15 degrees).  In Hanoi, it is cloudy and cool, which only favors sightseeing. </p><p>  The central areas of Vietnam are much warmer.  But swimming is unpleasant due to strong waves.  In addition, it often rains.  As you can see, not every region of Vietnam is good for a beach holiday.  Where it is better to go in the winter, depends on the goals pursued by you. </p><h2>  Nha trang </h2><p>  <span>Where to go to Vietnam?</span>  The choice of resort largely depends on what time of the year you want to go on vacation.  The most famous resort of the country is Nha Trang, located in the south of the country.  The advantage of the region is that it is always warm here, except for the period from October to January.  In November and December, the temperature may not be very comfortable for swimming.  In addition, it rains at this time.  However, it is worth noting that it is impossible to give an accurate forecast as to what the winter season will be.  Every year it is different. </p><p>  And yet, if the question is where it is better to go to Vietnam in the winter, then we can recommend Nha Trang.  For most tourists, the resort is the best choice.  The region has several advantages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vietnam-guide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours in Mui Ne" class="if uuid-3164298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3164298.jpg"></div><p>  Where to go in Vietnam if you want to know all the delights of relaxation?  Definitely the choice will fall on the famous Nha Trang.  Noisy and crowded resort offers a wide selection of entertainment, excursions and other pleasures.  In addition, the road from the airport to the city takes a little time (the distance does not exceed 35 km).  This is one of the most important benefits.  Not every resort boasts proximity to the airport.  And not every tourist will want to overcome 200 kilometers after the flight, especially if there are children in the family. </p><p>  Nha Trang boasts a developed infrastructure, large shopping centers, numerous restaurants, bars and other facilities. </p><p>  Many tourists believe that in March Nha Trang is truly magnificent.  At this time, the weather is most comfortable to relax.  There is no rain at the beginning of spring, and the air temperature is quite comfortable.  In March in Nha Trang, the thermometer does not exceed the indicators: + 29 ... + 32 degrees.  April and May are also good for relaxing, but the weather is getting hotter.  As for March, this is the perfect time for a comfortable stay. </p><h2>  Nha Trang Hotels </h2><p>  Nha Trang is a large city, so it‚Äôs difficult to find a secluded vacation here.  All the resort hotels, except for one (ANA MANDARA RESORT 5 *), are located across from the beach.  Hotel complexes are built right in the city, which has its pros and cons.  Behind the gates of the hotel you will find all the temptations of the metropolis. </p><p>  Experienced tourists believe that Nha Trang is wonderful because in its territory you can find a lot of hotels of different levels.  The choice of housing is huge.  Among the good hotels, tourists recommend paying attention to: Balcony Seaview Nha Trang, Sheraton Nha Trang, The Light Hotel &amp; Spa, InterContinental Nha Trang. </p><p>  No less good are more budgetary establishments: Seaway Hotel, Euro Star Hotel, New Sun Hotel, Golden Tulip Hotel, Dendro Hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.sekaiproperty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hanoi-Moscow" class="if uuid-3164282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3164282.jpg"></div><p>  If you want peace and quiet, then you should choose expensive hotels or complexes located outside the city.  Please note that the <span>beaches of Nha Trang are</span> free, however you will have to pay for renting a sunbed and umbrella.  The coast is always crowded.  Not only tourists, but also Vietnamese have a rest here. </p><p>  In addition to the spontaneous beaches in Nha Trang, there are organized beach clubs: Louisiana and Gorky Park.  The latter is equipped with several pools, a restaurant, a bar and other amenities.  Its territory is protected. </p><p>  Many resort hotels are located on the coast, but they do not have their own beach.  If you want privacy, then you need to opt for the best hotels in Vietnam with their own beach: </p><ol><li>  <span>Vinpearl Nha Trang Resort.</span>  The luxury establishment is located on Hong Che Island, which is connected to Nha Trang by cable car.  Among the 500 rooms of the establishment there are presidential suites, bungalows with sea views.  Guests can choose one of 80 comfortable villas to stay.  The hotel has amazing conditions for relaxation. </li><li>  Vinpearl Luxury.  The hotel is also located on Hong Che Island.  Each of his villas has a private terrace and pool. </li><li>  MerPerle Hon Tam - Located in Nha Trang Bay. </li><li>  Mia Resort Nha Trang.  It offers free yoga classes. </li><li>  Six Senses Ninh Van Bay Tro.  Hotel with sea views, luxurious villas and pools. </li></ol><h2>  Muyne </h2><p>  Among lovers of beach and sea vacations in Vietnam, tours in Mui Ne are very popular.  The resort village is 15 km from Phan Thiet.  Very often, when tour operators offer trips to Phan Thiet, in 90% of cases we are talking about Muyne.  Representatives of companies often themselves do not know the exact location, so it is in your interest to check the exact address and reviews. </p><p>  Directly in Fantiet there are only a few hotels where Russians are accommodated.  All other hotel complexes are located far from the center.  Such remoteness from tourist life has its pros and cons.  Just in advance you need to know exactly where you are going to avoid unpleasant surprises. </p><div class="photo" data-original="true-beachfront.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hoi An, how to get there" class="if uuid-3164304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3164304.jpg"></div><p>  The main difference between Mui Ne and the famous Nha Trang is that it is a resort village that can offer you an atmosphere of peace and relaxation.  Here you will find leisurely resort life and beautiful beaches.  Each hotel has its own stretch of coast.  In <span>Mui Ne, the beach</span> is near hotels, so there is no need to cross the road.  The resort has everything for a wonderful holiday.  According to experts, Mui Ne is not only the southernmost village, but also a place with a unique climate.  The village is deservedly called the sunniest place in the country. </p><p>  If you are going to Mui Ne in the winter, teach that there are often waves that interfere with swimming.  This is especially noticeable after dinner.  The resort is incredibly popular among kitesurfers who come to Mui Ne in the winter. </p><p>  The main drawback of the region is its significant remoteness from airports.  Wherever you go, a shuttle bus to the village takes about six hours.  It is this fact and the reviews of tourists that it is boring in Mui Ne, led to the fact that there are few people in the resort.  Most tourists prefer to choose Nha Trang.  Local authorities are trying to solve this problem.  Currently, a highway is under construction, thanks to which it will be possible to get to the resort much faster. </p><h2>  Phu Quoc </h2><p>  If you dream of a quality beach vacation and are willing to pay for it, you can go to the southernmost resort of the country - Fukuok Island.  It is most convenient to get to it by plane from Ho Chi Minh City.  Island hotels are more expensive than on the mainland.  The infrastructure is not so developed, but it is more than compensated by clean and clear water, relaxation and beautiful nature.  Of course, Phu Quoc is not the Maldives.  The local climate is very reminiscent of Mui Ne. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nl.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="North Vietnam where to go" class="if uuid-3164306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3164306.jpg"></div><p>  The coast of the island is washed by the waters of the Gulf of Thailand.  Island holidays will appeal to those people who crave peace and solitude.  Before you go to Phu Quoc, you need to soberly assess whether only a beach holiday will suit you.  If you want entertainment, there simply aren‚Äôt any on the island.  Local hotels are scattered all over the coast.  And to get to the market, which is the center of nightlife, will have only a taxi. </p><h2>  Danang </h2><p>  Another very interesting place to stay is the city of Danang.  It is the third largest metropolis in Vietnam.  It is located in the very center of the country.  Its magnificent beaches boast white sand.  According to Forbes magazine, they are among the top ten.  The coast stretches 30 km from Hoi An. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.accorhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go to Vietnam in summer" class="if uuid-3164309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3164309.jpg"></div><p>  Holidays in Da Nang can combine a pleasant swim in the sea and interesting excursions.  The advantage of the resort is the proximity of the airport, so the transfer takes a minimum of time. </p><p>  The best time to relax in Da Nang is the period from February to May.  At this time, the sky is clear, the sun pleases throughout the day.  In the summer months, the air temperature does not fall below +33 degrees.  High temperature combined with humidity is a real test for the body.  The low season is characterized by long and heavy rains. </p><h2>  Hoi An </h2><p>  If you are looking for a resort for families with children, then it is worth paying attention to Hoi An.  A feature of the Vietnamese city is an amazing Chinese atmosphere.  Its one-story Chinese houses with tiled roofs and narrow streets are very reminiscent of Chinese villages.  Hoian offers tourists endless white beaches and excellent diving.  The gently sloping coast is very convenient for families with children.  For this reason, couples choose the resort.  It boasts ancient architecture.  Its attractions are listed by UNESCO.  How to get to Hoi An?  The resort is located near Da Nang, which has a train station and airport.  Therefore, getting to Hoi An is easy.  Taxis and buses are available. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vietnam-guide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best Vietnam hotels with private beach" class="if uuid-3164312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3164312.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that with all the advantages of the resort, there is one significant drawback.  The fact is that the city is located on the river, and the nearest beach from the center is three kilometers away. </p><p>  It is better to visit the resort during the high season, which occurs in winter and early spring.  However, according to experts, the period from May to July is no less beautiful.  Rains happen quite often, but the temperature is kept within 30 degrees.  And the prices in local establishments are invariably pleasing in comparison with the high season.  By the way, in Hoi An, the hotels do not close during the rainy season and willingly receive guests. </p><h2>  Halong </h2><p>  North Vietnam is no less attractive for tourists.  Where is it better to go if you want to swim and sunbathe?  Beach holidays are possible in the city of Halong.  The island's resort beaches are made of imported sand, so the water on the coast is often muddy.  And yet, many tourists are attracted by unusual miracle islets.  In the town itself there is nothing special.  Its only advantage is a beautiful promenade, from which picturesque landscapes open onto the bay.  Here you can watch the inhabitants of floating villages and climb Mount Bai Tu.  The best time for a beach holiday in Halong is April - October.  If you want to see the sights, it is better to visit the resort from December to March. </p><h2>  Katba </h2><p>  A small, picturesque island is located in Halong Bay.  It is the largest in the archipelago.  Island beaches have a nondescript covering of tan sand.  But tourists are always happy with clean water without algae and garbage.  The best time to relax on Katba is autumn, as it storms in the summer. </p><h2>  How to get to Vietnam? </h2><p>  To get to Vietnam, tourists will have to choose between Moscow - Hanoi and Moscow - Ho Chi Minh flights.  Not so given appeared a new flight to Nha Trang.  Of course, cheaper and more convenient for our vacationers is the flight to Hanoi.  But it should not be considered in the case when you fly to rest in the southern resorts of the country: Mui Ne, Phan Thiet, Nha Trang.  However, if you want to visit the northern or central regions of Vietnam, the Hanoi - Moscow flight will be the best option for you. </p>
