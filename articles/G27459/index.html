    <h2>  Basic tank classifications </h2><p>  The classification of tanks did not take place overnight.  Moreover, in the period between the two world wars, the concept of using these military vehicles has repeatedly changed.  To create unique armored vehicles that can operate in different climatic conditions, in different areas and to perform a variety of tasks is a very difficult task.  Therefore, first of all, when creating tanks, they rely on the need for this type of weapon, the conditions for its use, and economic factors, that is, the ability of the state to spend a certain amount, are necessarily taken into account. </p><p>  It must be emphasized that in different countries the classification of tanks was different and to a certain extent was conditional.  For example, in the Soviet Union, she pointed to the combat weight of the machine and in many ways to its purpose.  In Germany, the caliber of weapons was paramount.  In the UK, the division of armored vehicles was carried out according to its main purpose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The outbreak of hostilities, or German weapons </h2><p>  In the thirties, fundamental changes occurred in the combat use of tanks.  This led to the fact that they turned from a purely auxiliary means into one of the main striking forces of the ground forces.  Due to the large theoretical research in the use of armored vehicles, huge amounts of exercises, experts have found that by concentrating tanks in a specific area, you can use them to solve some operational problems.  German armored vehicles of the Second World War at the beginning of 1939 were already assembled into entire tank groups. </p>

    <p>  Then in Germany there were several types of tanks.  In their designation, the rather complex alphabetic abbreviation PzKnfw was used, but in literal translation it is an armored fighting vehicle.  The first tank adopted by Nazi Germany was the light T1. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  With a length of about 4 meters, the combat weight of the car was 5.4 tons.  She had bulletproof armor with a sheet thickness of 6 to 13 millimeters.  Two machine guns were installed in the tower, the crew consisted of two people.  The maximum speed on the highway was 37 kilometers per hour, and on rough terrain - about 20. </p><p>  Another type of tank in the German army was the T2.  According to many characteristics, it was similar to T1, but had more powerful weapons, and the crew consisted of three people.  T1 and T2 had several modifications.  Mostly, they were distinguished by a running gear and a power plant.  German armored vehicles of World War II at the beginning of hostilities in 1939 totaled about three thousand tanks. </p><h2>  Czechoslovak combat vehicles and factories </h2><p>  In Czechoslovakia, both the tanks themselves and the factories where they were manufactured were captured.  These combat vehicles were designated LT35 and LT38.  The Germans, they received the indices 35T and 38T.  Czechoslovak tanks were not only light compared to German vehicles, they were also equipped with more powerful weapons. </p><p>  The thickness of the armor plates was also greater, and, in principle, we could talk about their better protection, if not for one “but”.  Unlike <span>German tanks,</span> which had a welded construction, Czechs were assembled using rivets, and when a shell hit the tank, they scattered and wounded the crew even in cases where there was no through penetration of the armor. </p><h2>  Subsequent inventions by German designers </h2>

    <p>  German armored vehicles of the Second World War were constantly improved.  The developers set new goals.  And soon T3 and T4 appear.  It was T3 that for a long time was considered the main one in the tank troops of the Wehrmacht.  The combat weight of the car was almost 20 tons.  The maximum thickness of the armor plates reached 30 millimeters.  Initially, the T3 was armed with a cannon and three machine guns, two of which were mounted in a tower, and the third - on a <span>ball joint</span> in a frontal armor plate. </p><p>  As for the T4 tank, it was the same as the T3 in terms of numerous characteristics.  Approximately equal combat masses, security indicators, the same type of engines were used on both, and the crew consisted of five people.  The main difference was in armament. </p><h2>  Russian tank building </h2><p>  And what was the difference between Soviet armored vehicles of the Second World War?  Tank construction in the <span>Soviet Union</span> in the first half of the 1930s was based on the experience of a foreign manufacturer, mainly British and American.  In 1938, the heavy KV1 was adopted.  The armor of the tank was anti-shell.  The maximum thickness of the armor plates is 75 millimeters.  Armored vehicles of Germany of the Second World War had 2.5 times smaller thickness of the armor. </p><p>  The creators of T34 solved a more difficult task.  And it is worth noting that they did an excellent job with their goals.  This tank, possessing high firepower, reliable fire protection and high mobility, served as the base point on which all Soviet tank armored vehicles of World War II were designed. </p><p>  Strengthening the armor protection had to be made in the rigid overall framework of the medium tank.  The maximum thickness of the sheets was 45 millimeters, and the designers set them at an angle.  This increased the likelihood of a rebound.  And most importantly, almost doubled the thickness of the armor horizontally.  Also, the designers determined the optimal angles of its inclination.  In the most vulnerable frontal part, it was larger, and on the sides less. </p>

    <h2>  Armored vehicles of the USA of the Second World War </h2><p>  During World War II, the United States experienced a revolution in the design and manufacture of tanks.  <span>The American weapon of</span> victory was Sherman.  It was designed for a crew of five.  In addition to the main 75 mm cannon in the tower, the machine was armed with three machine guns, as well as a mortar of 50.8 mm caliber for setting the smoke screen.  The armor was up to 100 millimeters thick.  The main advantage of this tank was that it combined the advantages of a light and medium tank. </p><p>  But naturally, the armored vehicles of the Second World War were not limited only to these designs.  Throughout the entire period of hostilities, the developers constantly took into account all the pros and cons of a particular combat unit, and as part of this they carried out modernization. </p>
