It is similar and not similar to other hotels of the same five-star category.  The building is located almost next to the sea - it is only a quarter kilometer away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zen the inn resort spa" class="if" height="193" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/179496.jpg" width="600"></div>  You can go to the beach via a well-maintained underpass.  Such a concern for the safety of tourists is very popular with vacationers.  Famous for everyone and beloved by the Russians Alanya from Zen the Inn Resort SPA is only 20 kilometers.  You can get to the city by a free bus (it runs on a schedule) or a taxi.  Here in Alanya, a real fairy tale awaits the guests of Turkey - the city specializes in tourism.  There is another positive point: the airport is 100 kilometers from the hotel.  This means that this place is devoid of the shortcomings of many resorts close to the airport: there are no aircraft at all, guests can enjoy the silence.  Fans of travel will not be difficult to visit the mountain gardens of the Taurus Mountains, Devil's Caves.  This is a unique place: there are no such <span>stalactites and stalagmites</span> almost anywhere in the world.  Young people are waiting for discos, clubs, and children - parks and attractions.  In short, the hotel is good for both old and small.
