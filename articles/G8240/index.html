No wonder its name is Vincci Nozha Beach <span>Spa 4 *.</span>  <span>The spa</span> in the hotel, according to many visitors, is a real Mediterranean paradise.  It offers balneotherapy, and various massages, and body wraps, and a jacuzzi, and a hammam.  A good beautician gives advice and makes face masks.  And for those who wish to sunbathe beautifully and at the same time improve their health, vacationers especially recommend peeling after a hammam. </p><p>  Intensive skin rejuvenation procedures are also popular.

There is a poolside snack bar with sandwiches and fries.  Three √† la carte establishments, including Italian and Tunisian restaurants.  There is also a bar on the sea.  Perhaps the choice here is less than, for example, in Turkey, but everything fresh, cooked very skillfully.  A lot of salads, there is always meat, fish, shrimp and squid.  Great Italian pasta and pizza. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vincci nozha beach 4 hammamet" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/556043.jpg" width="562"></div>

The teachers there are very good at dealing with children.  They organize games and competitions not only in the club premises, but on the beach, in the stadium, and even throughout the hotel.

    <h2>  Sea and water vacations </h2><p>  The beach at the hotel is simply amazing, according to the reviews of tourists.  The entrance to the sea is gentle, which is very good for children.  The water is clear, clean and warm, with virtually no algae and jellyfish.  The sand is snow-white, velvet and soft, like a feather-bed.  The spectacle is somewhat reminiscent of a Bounty ad.  All people have enough sunbeds, no one takes them.  Catamaran, kayaks - all this is free.  Beach towels - on security.  The hotel Vincci Nozha Beach 4 * (Hammamet) also has three pools.  One of them is under the roof and heated.  It is used in cold weather.  The second is in the air.  This is the main pool and it has three water slides.  And the third is designed for children and is equipped in a special way.  Near the pools there are a lot of sunbeds on the lawns. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Vincci Nozha Beach 4 * offers great opportunities to travel.  Photos of dozens of excursions are posted on the network as illustrations for reviews.  From the hotel you can take walks, ride camels and horses.  Families with children are recommended to go to the water park - it's about fifteen minutes on foot.  And the city of entertainment Cartageland is also good.  Only they are not advised to go on weekends - there are too many people.  To Hammamet, in particular, to its old center, take a taxi for five minutes.  There you can walk around the city, take pictures, go to the fortress.  There are very cheap products in government stores - olive oil, coffee, dates.  If you want exotic, you can order a two-day excursion to <span>the Sahara desert</span> at the hotel <span>.</span>  And if you like ancient sights, then welcome to Carthage!  By the way, a big excursion to the Sahara includes trips to historical places and ancient ruins, visits to the mountains, a Barbary village and an oasis with a waterfall. </p><h2>  Is it expensive to relax here </h2><p>  The price for a double room at this Vinci hotel starts at sixty-seventy dinars per day for two.  The hotel is considered a budget for Tunisia, it offers very good services for this price.  There are several paid services that are not included in the price.  For example, to use a safe and a refrigerator, you need to pay extra two and seven dinars per day, respectively.  To smoke a hookah in a hotel, you will need to lay out eight units of local currency.  But tourists recommend walking a distance of two hundred meters from the hotel.  There will be a local hookah, where this pleasure costs half as much.  Forty dinars cost to fly over the sea by parachute, eighty to go to Carthage.  A bottle of wine and lobster in the old center of Hammamet will cost gourmets one and a half thousand Russian rubles (approximately). </p><h2>  Vincci Nozha Beach 4 * - traveler reviews </h2><p>  Rest at this hotel is always excellent.  People are positive and get what they expect.  This is a very good hotel for those who want to relax, swim in the beautiful sea, sunbathe on the beach with a convenient entrance to the water and just have a wonderful meal.  Mostly families with children come here, as well as lovers.  Many Europeans have a rest - French, Germans, Italians.  A phenomenon like drunk tourists is eradicated.  Perhaps the young people who want to hang out from morning to evening, at first will not seem so much fun, but then they will find not so far from the hotel the local Latino disco, where it is quite possible to break out.  Tunisia itself is a more Europeanized country than Egypt itself.  It is very safe and you can safely walk.  Even single women can open their legs and shoulders without fear of judgment and harassment.  Mostly tourists like the hotel, they are happy with it and recommend it to everyone.  Therefore, the hotel has many regular customers who come here not for the first time.  If to summarize what tourists write about this establishment, we note that this is a good choice for a reasonable price. </p>
