The German city of Dresden is interesting for tourists for its stunning architecture.  In addition, his museums store magnificent collections of art.  The city is incredibly beautiful and is of interest to tourists. </p><h2>  Where is the city of Dresden located? </h2><p>  The ancient city, founded in the thirteenth century, is located on the Elbe River, just twenty kilometers from the border with the Czech Republic.  Dresden is the center of Saxony and has long had the status of the cultural capital of Germany.  Moreover, at present, the city can be safely called an important transport and industrial center of the country.  Its population is about 530 thousand people, but Dresden still occupies an important place among other cities. </p><h2>  The history of Dresden </h2><p>  The history of the city of Dresden begins in 1206.  It was this year that the first mention of it in the sources dates from.  According to legend, the city arose on the site of a fishing village.  The heyday of the city begins around 1485.  It was during this period that the city of Dresden became the residence of the Saxon dukes of the Wettin line.  The greatest flowering occurred during the reign of King of Saxony Frederick Augustus I.  It was under him that Zwinger, the Catholic Church of Hofkirche and the Church of Frauenkirche were erected. </p><p>  August I restored the city of Dresden, which was almost destroyed during the fire of 1685.  With his light hand, the city was filled with baroque buildings, which are now the pride of "Florence on the Elbe."  In addition, during the time of August I, Dresden acquired the title of capital of Saxon china.  An ancient legend says that the king always needed gold for the treasury, and therefore locked in the castle of the alchemist Bettger, so that he could find a way to obtain precious metal.  However, the scientist did not receive gold, but he discovered the stunning secret of making high-quality porcelain, thanks to which the whole region became famous in the future. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof dresden" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2166562.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Significant flourishing reached the German city of Dresden in the eighteenth century.  At this time, it becomes the universal center of the European economy, politics and culture.  And already in the nineteenth century, industry began to develop very actively in the city.  Until the mid-twentieth century, Dresden was considered one of the most beautiful cities in the country, thanks to its artistic wealth and magnificent architecture. </p><h2>  Artistic heritage </h2><p>  The main depository of art is located in the famous Dresden art gallery, created in the sixteenth century by Frederick the Wise.  In the eighteenth century under Augustus II the institution reached its peak, as its storerooms were regularly replenished not only with individual canvases, but also with whole collections at once.  Of greatest interest is Italian painting of the era of the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries.  This is, first of all, the works of Veronese, Giorgione, Titian, Correggio, Raphael, Tintoretto.  Also present are the works of famous representatives of Dutch painting - Reysdal, Vermeer, Rembrandt and Hals.  In addition, there are paintings of the Flemish school - Sneijders, Van Dyck and Rubens.  All these wonderful works could die at the end of World War II.  Therefore, the Germans hid wealth in raw limestone mines.  Subsequently, their restoration took several decades. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="German city Dresden" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2166569.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In February 1945, Dresden was bombed by the armed forces of the United States and Great Britain, as a result of which Zwinger was completely defeated.  In his pavilions housed a library, a collection of prints and porcelain.  The ensemble was completely destroyed.  Architects and scientists restored the complex according to archival drawings.  And now at the Zwinger are exhibits of the Dresden Gallery. </p><h2>  Description of the city </h2><p>  Description of the city of Dresden is worth starting with its structure.  It is located on both sides of the Elbe River.  On the left coast is the "Old" city of Dresden - more precisely, its historical part.  On its territory is the largest part of the attractions.  Despite the severe destruction that befell the historical center during the Second World War, it was possible to restore it, while maintaining the appearance of the city as it was before.  In the historical center there is the famous Zwinger, the Frauenkirche church, the Zepmer Opera House, Neumarkt Square, the Cathedral, the Castle Residence, the Stables, the Academy of Arts and other buildings. </p><p>  The most favorite bridge of the townspeople is the Augustus the Strong Bridge, which connects the two parts of the city of Dresden - the New and the Old.  The New Town also has many beautiful buildings and historical monuments.  Immediately behind the bridge stands the Golden Horseman monument dedicated to Augustus the Strong.  Royal Street is one of the main in the new part.  It has vernissages, boutiques, galleries and other interesting places.  But in the center of the Baroque quarter you can see the Church of the Three Kings.  This building is one of the oldest representatives of the late Baroque in Germany. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Zwinger Palace </h2><p>  The most famous city brought to the city of Dresden sights and art values.  The most famous and significant is the Zwinger Palace, which is considered the highest manifestation of baroque in Germany.  The buildings of the palace form a courtyard with fountains and flower beds, on which all tourists and guests of the city can walk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dresden city photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/2169350.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Zwinger was erected from the sandstone of Saxony, which was often used in construction.  The stone allows you to perform thread elements of any complexity.  In addition, over time, sandstone tends to darken, which makes the buildings mysterious.  It is worth noting that Zwinger is the most amazing attraction of the city of Dresden (photo is given in the article).  The splendor of its decoration reminds the building of a palace.  But in fact, Augustus the Strong conceived the complex as a place of storage of armor, weapons, porcelain, collections of paintings, silver and exotic plants, and not as the residence of the royal couple.  One can only imagine how much money was needed to build such a large-scale repository of art.  This indicates a great love of art and all that is beautiful, as well as a desire to demonstrate the greatness and power of the monarchs. </p><p>  Zwinger consists of six pavilions, which are connected by galleries.  On its territory you can see the Armory, the Bell Pavilion, the German Pavilion, Porcelain, which houses the Royal Collection of magnificent porcelain.  It is also interesting to see the Crown Gate, the French Pavilion and the Physics and Mathematics Salon.  No less beautiful is the Nymph Bathhouse.  But the <span>Dresden gallery of</span> paintings was erected later, but now it is very harmoniously complements the general ensemble.  Initially, the most significant celebrations were held in Zwinger.  And now, the palace hosts open-air celebrations and concerts. </p><h2>  Residence palace </h2><p>  The residence palace is one of the oldest buildings in the city of Dresden.  It was built in the Neo-Renaissance style.  In 1940, on the site of a beautiful palace were the city gate and wall.  And already in 1548 in their place the first palace was erected, in which the Saxon dynasties of kings lived.  In the future, the building was repeatedly completed and remodeled, supplementing with various architectural elements.  The most interesting tourist attraction is the Hausmannstrum tower, its height reaches one hundred meters.  It is equipped with a viewing platform, from the height of which you can admire the beauty of the city of Dresden. </p><p>  Very beautiful and the courtyard of the residence.  Two openwork suspension bridges connect the building with the Cathedral.  On the territory of the beautiful palace there are two museums that deserve the attention of guests of the city of Dresden in Germany.  One of them is called Green Arches.  Its exposition is divided into two parts - ‚ÄúNew Green Arches‚Äù and ‚ÄúHistorical Green Arches‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dresden city in Germany" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2166572.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In total, the museum has more than four thousand beautiful exhibits, among which you can see unique jewelry with sapphires, diamonds and emeralds.  All of them are stored under glass anti-glare windows, allowing to evaluate their beauty.  A real masterpiece of the exhibition can be called a small cherry stone, on which 185 faces are carved. </p><h2>  Royal china collection </h2><p>  In the center of Dresden in Germany, the world's most exquisite and richest collection of porcelain is stored.  It is commonly called "white gold."  The collection is striking in its painting and beauty.  And this is not surprising, because historically, Saxony has become the real homeland of all European porcelain.  The value of Meissen porcelain is recognized worldwide.  August Strong appreciated such products.  Therefore, he regularly replenished his collection not only with beautiful specimens of Meissen production, but also with interesting porcelain from China and Japan.  The Dresden Museum currently holds seventeenth and eighteenth-century Chinese and Japanese artifacts. </p><h2>  Semper Opera </h2><p>  The city of Dresden (photos are given in the article) is impossible to imagine without the famous State Saxon Opera House, which is one of the most beautiful buildings in Europe.  It is made in the style of the Neo-Renaissance.  The building has become a real decoration of Theater Square.  It is decorated with stunning beauty sculptures.  The history of Semper‚Äôs opera dates back more than 450 years.  The first theater building in this place appeared in 1648.  In the future, eight more theaters were erected nearby, which is why the square became known as the Theater.  In 1841, Semper erected a new building, which burned down in 1869. Therefore, the question arose again about the restoration of the opera. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dresden city photos attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2166574.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Then Semper and his son built a completely new structure, which looked exactly the way we see it at present.  However, all the ups and downs of history did not end there.  During the bombing of 1945, almost the entire building was destroyed.  It was possible to restore it based on the surviving drawings of the Semper family. </p><h2>  Church of St. Mary </h2><p>  The history of St. Mary's Church is incredibly mysterious.  Its roots go back to the eleventh century.  It is believed that the first building on this site was built in the era of the Slavic tribe of Sorb, who lived on the Elbe coast before the appearance of Dresden.  And in 1142, a temple in the Romanesque style appeared on the same spot.  Currently, the protestant church of the city of Dresden flaunts here (photo is given in the article).  The height of the temple is 91 meters.  He was erected by order of the very same Augustus the Strong.  The Protestant church was supposed to outshine the Catholic churches in those days with its beauty. </p><p>  The construction took seventeen years.  But a temple of stunning beauty with many artistic elements was erected.  However, it affects not only the appearance of the building, but also its interior decoration.  The dome and arches of the church are painted in gold.  It is worth mentioning that during construction the dome was completely made of stone, which is unusual for architecture.  But, due to the fact that in its upper part there are windows, the impression of lightness of a massive structure is created. </p><h2>  Brule's terrace </h2><p>  Walking around the city, you should definitely walk along the famous Bruhl terrace of Dresden.  Which country city still boasts such a large number of attractions in a relatively small area ?!  Along the promenade, opened in 1814, there are numerous historical architectural works that must be an object of attention for curious tourists.  The legacy of the Renaissance makes the center of Dresden completely mysterious and special.  Here, behind every turn, lies another beautiful building with its long and sometimes tragic history. </p><h2>  Japanese palace </h2><p>  A very unusual place in Dresden is the Japanese Palace.  It is built in baroque style.  Currently, the palace houses three museums: primitive history, ethnology and a collection of natural sciences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dresden city description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2166576.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The building was built in 1715, but later became the property of Augustus the Strong, who began to organize festivities in it.  But the palace got its name due to the creation of a roof in an oriental style.  <span>Asian style</span> is also present on the external facade and inside the courtyard.  In the eighteenth century, the building acquired the status of a museum, which later housed the library.  And in the nineteenth century, the architect Zemper was engaged in the reconstruction of the palace.  But during the period of 1940, the library funds suffered greatly.  And the building itself was restored until 1951.  Later, three museums were located in the palace. </p><h2>  Marcolini Palace </h2><p>  In the historical part of the city is the former Marcolini palace, the building of which was built by Bruhl in 1736.  Its main attraction was the baroque <span>fountain of Neptune.</span>  The complex is known for the fact that Wagner once worked in it and Napoleon lived for a month.  But from 1849 to the present day, the city hospital has been located on the territory of the palace. </p><h2>  Neighboring cities </h2><p>  In fairness, it is worth noting that interest is not only Dresden itself, but also neighboring cities.  The rich heritage of Saxony is not only within the city limits.  Therefore, tourists should pay attention to the cities near Dresden.  25 kilometers from it is Meissen on the high bank of the Elbe.  On its territory there is a Gothic cathedral, the famous Meissen porcelain manufactory and the Albrechtsburg castle - the main attractions of the town.  It is no secret that Saxony is the birthplace of stunning china.  So it was Mason porcelain that glorified the region all over the world.  But the town itself is incredibly beautiful, which attracts the attention of many tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dresden which city" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2166578.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is also worth remembering the Pilnitz Palace, which is located 15 kilometers from Dresden.  The castle was the suburban residence of the monarchs of Saxony.  The complex began to be built under Augustus the Strong.  And in the mid-nineteenth century, the palace underwent reconstruction. </p><p>  Another great place in Saxony is the Moritzburg Castle, which is located 14 kilometers from Dresden.  The palace was also built as a country residence.  In the eighteenth century, Augustus the Strong turned a simple hunting lodge into a beautiful baroque palace.  Subsequently, the complex became a favorite vacation spot of the nobility.  It is located in an incredibly picturesque place - on an artificially created island. </p><h2>  Interesting places of the city </h2><p>  There are many interesting places in Dresden.  If time permits, it is worth visiting the world famous dairy store of the Pfund brothers, founded back in 1880.  The institution is very different from the usual shops.  It is decorated with ceramic tiles and fancy mosaics.  And on the walls you can see hand-painted.  The stunning beauty of this place allowed him to become the most beautiful shop in the world.  An interesting fact is that in 1998 the store even got into the Guinness Book of Records. </p><h2>  Features of Dresden </h2><p>  Where this city is located and what are its main attractions, we have already told readers.  But, unfortunately, within the framework of one article it is difficult to tell about all the beauties of Dresden and Saxony.  The city has many interesting places that have a not so long history, but still attract the attention of many guests. </p><p>  Citizens consider the birthday of their city March 31, 1206.  After all, this date is imprinted on the letter of Dietrich von Meissen, in which the first mention of Dresden is documented.  And yet, locals celebrate the city's day in August.  It was during this period that large mass celebrations of citizens were organized.  As a rule, concerts and theatrical performances are held in the city for three days.  On such days, a festival of steamboats is held, and the holidays end with fireworks.  The event program is updated annually by the organizers. </p><p>  In fairness, it is worth noting that Dresden is one of the most visited cities in Germany.  More than two million guests visit it annually. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the city of dresden" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2166579.jpg"></div>

    <p> In the city you can see not only historical sights, but also just interesting places.  In Dresden, you should see a completely unusual musical building.  It is located in the student quarter.  The house is painted in stunningly beautiful turquoise color.  But even this does not attract crowds of onlookers to him.  The facade of the building is completely hung with pipes and funnels that resemble wind instruments.  In such an unusual way the system of drains is designed, which, by the way, copes with the task perfectly.  In addition, during the rain she makes wonderful sounds.  For this reason, the house was called musical.  According to tourists who visited the building during a rainstorm, they were able to listen to the full performance of the orchestra.  Drains emit completely different sounds depending on the intensity of the flows.  True or not, it‚Äôs hard to say, you can only visit this amazing place yourself to make sure the reviews are true. </p><h2>  Dresden Kitchen </h2><p>  Having visited Dresden, you should definitely go to one of the local restaurants or cafes.  Most of the dishes offered in catering establishments are Saxon cuisine.  An incredibly popular meal is roast with beef.  Before cooking, meat is carefully marinated and many spices are added.  You should also try the local potato soup.  But for dessert, the townspeople traditionally eat cheesecakes.  You should try delicious cakes with cottage cheese and raisins.  On Christmas Eve, all the cafes prepare crispy gingerbread for guests. </p><p>  The national cuisine of the city is not distinguished by any special delicacies.  Caf√©s and restaurants serve traditional dishes that have their long-standing cooking traditions.  As desserts, fruit salads and pastries are popular with locals.  It is worth noting that, in addition to traditional German institutions, the city, of course, has French, Italian or Japanese restaurants.  The most interesting gastronomic establishments are located in the Neustadt area, it will be interesting for all gourmets to make an excursion here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cities near dresden" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2166582.jpg"></div>
