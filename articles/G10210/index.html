Near the Margarita Suite Appart Hotel 4 * there are many shops where you can buy everything you need.  Also near the hotel there is a market and several souvenir shops.  Many vacationers bought Turkish sweets here. </p><p>  As for the hotel‚Äôs own territory, although it is small, four residential buildings and three whole pools plus one for children fit here.  There is also a pool with water slides.  According to tourists, the hotel grounds are well maintained and clean. </p><p>  The rooms in the hotel, according to our compatriots, are spacious, comfortable, pleasantly decorated, with a fresh renovation.  Please note that shower gels and soap are given out only upon check-in; later, maids do not renew them.  Therefore, you have to purchase bath amenities yourself.  A big plus for many vacationers considered the availability of kitchen corners in the rooms with a full range of everything necessary for simple tea drinking and cooking.  There is also Wi-Fi, but it doesn‚Äôt catch well in all rooms.  It is best to connect to the Internet in the lobby.  Also, guests pay attention to the fact that the hotel does not have <span>beach towels.</span>  In this regard, you should take them from home or buy on the spot. </p><p>  As for cleaning, it was carried out daily, but, according to many tourists, not very high quality.

    <h2>  Nutrition and Staff Comments </h2><p>  The staff at Margarita Suite Hotel reviews earned for the most part positive.  So, according to tourists, newly arriving holidaymakers always try to populate as early as possible, without condemning them to vain expectation.  All employees are very polite, attentive and quick.  However, please note that due to the fact that mainly Scandinavians rest in the hotel (Swedes, Danes, Finns, etc.), and there are few tourists from the Russian Federation and neighboring countries, the Margarita Suite Hotel staff do not speak Russian .  Therefore, without a basic knowledge of English, it will be difficult here. </p><p>  As for food in the hotel, there are no complaints about it.  According to vacationers, vegetables and fruits are always fresh.  A large selection of fish and meat dishes (turkey, chicken, beef), always several types of side dish are also offered.  Very tasty sweets.  For breakfast, pancakes and omelet are fried.  According to vacationers, you are unlikely to be able to return home from vacation without a couple of extra pounds. </p>

    <h2>  Impressions of a beach holiday and entertainment </h2><p>  Many tourists in their reviews note the fact that the distance from Margarita Suite Appart Hotel 4 * to the beach is not 450 meters (as stated in most hotel descriptions), but all 900 meters.  Therefore, this fact should be noted.  A bus runs several times a day along the hotel-beach-hotel route, so you can use it if you wish.  However, many tourists preferred to overcome this path on foot.  On the shore of small pebbles.  The beaches are clean and well maintained, the water is clear.  There are practically no waves here.  Sun beds and umbrellas can be rented at an additional cost.  But many travelers bought umbrellas and mats in one of the shops and were located on a free section of the beach for free. </p><p>  As for other entertainment, there is no animation in Margarita Suite Hotel.  Once a week, a Turkish night with live music, belly dancing and fire shows is held on the poolside terrace.  Also available: mini golf, table tennis and billiards.  Tourists liked to relax by the pools (there are three of them here).  There are even water slides.  For children, there are no special entertainments, except for the "paddling pool". </p>
