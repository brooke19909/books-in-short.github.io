    <p>  <strong>For</strong> <strong>and against</strong> </p><p>  Both the mainland and the islands offer excellent opportunities and prospects for recreation, and knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each region, you can choose exactly the place that will give you the rest of your dreams.  In Crete you will find hotels of different levels, as well as on the mainland, but if you are interested in attractions, you can see them much more on the island: all interesting places are located in a limited area.  In addition, the island is located a little to the south, so there the warm days last longer than on the Halkidiki peninsula.  However, <span>hotels in Greece</span> (Halkidiki is no exception) offer you a truly wonderful and unforgettable vacation. </p><p>  <strong>On three fingers ...</strong> </p><p>  If you look at the map of Greece, you will certainly notice that Halkidiki resemble a trident.  Local residents each of the peninsulas, crashing into the Aegean Sea, called fingers.  Here are the hotels of <span>Greece.</span>  <span>Halkidiki</span> offers guests of a hotel of different levels: simple and inexpensive, with ascetic design, located on the very border with the self-governing community of Athos on the peninsula of the same name;  middle class hotels, good 4 *, located very well relative to the sea, with good food </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of halkidiki greece" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/413/218363.jpg" width="600"></div>  and affordable prices;  upscale 5 * hotels, spreading their possessions over vast territories where all the conditions for the relaxation of wealthy people are created.  In a word, hotels of Greece offer you a vacation of any level and for every taste.  Halkidiki is a good place for everyone: a huge variety of different hotels, many attractions and magnificent nature will give truly unforgettable impressions and emotions.

Based on the information received, choose the place where you want to spend your vacation.  If you need a calm and quiet vacation, inexpensive and without frills, go to Athos: there the unity of the sea and olive groves is felt especially sharply.  But if you are interested in the best <span>hotels, Halkidiki</span> (Greece) offers Sithonia and Kassandra.  Sithonia is a bit calmer than Kassandra, there are relatively few hotels and they are designed for more wealthy guests.  One of the most outstanding is the Porto Carras hotel complex - three hotels with chic infrastructure spread over a vast territory.  However, it pales in comparison to the Danai Beach Resort - a VIP-level complex with luxurious service, chic rooms and sky-high prices.  On Kassandra, life boils during the day and </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Halkidiki hotel rating greece" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/413/218362.jpg" width="600"></div>  at night: if you get bored of sitting at the hotel, you can easily walk to the nearest club or bar and relax to the fullest.  The rating of hotels (Halkidiki, Greece) in Kassandra is headed by Aegean Melathron - a five-star hotel aimed at relaxing relaxation and creating maximum comfort for its guests, and the huge Sani complex with wonderful infrastructure and all kinds of entertainment on site.  However, it is here, on Kassandra, that the largest number of hotels are located;  It is believed that this place is more suitable than others for youth recreation or for families with children.  Now that you know what hotels in Greece are, Halkidiki will certainly interest you even more.  By the way, given that planes arrive, as a rule, in Thessaloniki (when booking a hotel in Halkidiki), do not deny yourself the pleasure of walking around this city - it has something to show you!
