    <h2>  Biography </h2><p>  In his homeland in Kazakhstan, he managed to become a legendary person a long time ago, even in his old age he did not cease to actively participate in the public and political life of his people, became one of the organizers and was the president of a charity fund that helps veterans and their families. </p><p>  In Kazakhstan, any student knows where Talgat Begeldinov was born, they honor and try to pass on the memory of the hero to the next generation.  He was born on August 5, 1922 in the small village of Mai-Balyk, Akmola region, but later the family moved to Frunze, which is now renamed Bishkek and is the capital of Kyrgyzstan.  The family did not live well, father and mother left their native village due to lack of land, and were interrupted by small earnings.  The boy lived with his parents up to 6 years, then for some time he was brought up in the family of his childless uncle, it was a tribute to an ancient tradition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Some sources dispute the birthplace of Begeldinov, calling Kyrgyzstan his birthplace, but, by and large, this is not so important, Talgat Yakubekovich is one of the few people who can be called a person in the world. </p><h2>  Love to heaven </h2><p>  By the age of 16, a brisk young man, impressed by the exploits of the book heroes of the novel ‚ÄúTwo Captains‚Äù, dreamed only of airplanes, combat flights and the sky.  There was an flying club in the city of Frunze, but they didn‚Äôt want to take Talgat right away, for his age he was rather short and was only a little visible from the cockpit.  But he was accepted, and for the young man difficult days begin, he had to combine school and study at the flying club, and besides, it was necessary to help the family.  They lived very poorly, their clothes were plain, there wasn‚Äôt enough money for food, so Talgat Begeldinov was forced to get a job. </p><p>  The young man hid his hobby from his father for a long time, because he dreamed of seeing his son as a doctor.  However, Talgat was soon able to prove to both parents and instructors that he was capable of being not just a pilot, but a courageous and stubborn person.  The path to obtaining a diploma in an aero club for a peasant boy was not easy, for a long time he was not taken seriously, humiliated, and even survived, but Begeldinov withstood the blow, passed all the exams with honors and even learned to become a social activist. </p>

    <h2>  Start of war </h2><p>  Talgat realizes that he will no longer be able to live without sky and airplanes, and soon he had a unique opportunity to continue his flight education.  A commission arrived at the flying club to select cadets at the Saratov Flight School, Begeldinov was chosen immediately, and in 1940 he went to Saratov, not even suspecting that he would not be able to return home for many more years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Talgat Yakubekovich Begeldinov at the school had to face more than once a scornful attitude towards his growth and nationality, but here he will receive the first serious school of life and extensive experience in flying on different devices.  Young cadets from the first days of the war were already eager for battle, but the commanders insisted on the professional training of the pilots, they did not want to send fragile youths to the front for certain death. </p><h2>  Acquaintance with IL-2 </h2><p>  A few months later, Begeldinov was seeking transfer to a bombing aviation school near Orenburg, where the young man quickly mastered heavy vehicles and soon received the rank of corporal. </p>

    <p>  But even here the young pilot was not immediately allowed to go to the front, along with other cadets he helped at the school on the economic side.  They planted potatoes, raised cows and pigs, sent all the food to the soldiers on the front line.  Soon he was transferred to a fighter school, where Talgat met his future ‚Äúiron horse‚Äù, the famous IL-2.  Already then legends were made of him, and all the pilots wanted to plow the sky only on him. </p><h2>  At the front </h2><p>  Finally, the school received orders to send part of the fighters to the front, among them was Talgat Begeldinov.  Acquaintance with the war took place near Tver, here young people learned that those with whom they spoke a few hours ago rarely return to base.  The battles were serious, even the aces of the sky, wise by experience, perished, but here they are, nineteen-year-old youths with a minimum number of flight hours.  No one was afraid, and Talgat and his comrades were eager for the front, in the midst of battle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But here, the command for several weeks forced to carry out training flights and shell an imaginary enemy.  Finally, military days began, several sorties per day, first in a group with other planes, then individually Talgat Yakubekovich destroyed trains, trains, tanks, anti-aircraft guns and other strategic important basing centers of the Nazis. </p>
