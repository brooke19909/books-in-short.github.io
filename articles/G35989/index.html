Baden-Baden: history, description, photos and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If the word "bad" is present in the name of a German city or village, be aware: this is a resort.  And not just a place where you can have a good rest: people come here to also improve their health.  The word "bad" does not mean "dietary supplement."  It can be compared with "SPA".  Therefore, at such a resort must be present if not bathing, then at least pump-rooms with healing mineral water. </p><p>  Many of these towns, in the name of which there is a prefix (or ending) "bad", have been known since the late Roman Empire.  This article will focus on one of them.  Baden-Baden is a resort in Germany, the most popular in Russia.  Below we will explain why. </p><p>  The French call this town with a population of fifty-four thousand people ‚ÄúRoyal SPA‚Äù - the royal resort.  And the Germans proudly declare that Baden-Baden is the "summer capital of all of Europe."  As for the last statement, one can argue: the beaches of the <span>Cote d'Azur</span> in France are much more crowded with vacationers.  But this is what Baden-Baden takes: the opportunity to leisurely spend time away from the bustling crowd. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resorts Baden Baden" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1313335.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is the resort located </h2><p>  Out of the very south-west of Germany, near the headwaters of the Rhine, is the Black Forest, translated from German as ‚ÄúBlack Forest‚Äù.  These are low, but extremely picturesque mountains.  They are spurs of the Alps.  Among these natural beauties lies the federal state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg.  Its capital is Stuttgart, and the major cities are Mannheim, Karlsruhe and Freiburg.  This land is frontier: it adjoins France from the west, and Switzerland from the south.  This situation makes the stay in the federal state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg also excursion-rich.  Indeed, an hour away is Strasbourg and the high Alps.  The resort of Baden-Baden (Germany) is located on the western slopes of the Black Forest, on both banks of the Os river.  Why does the town have such a double name?  <span>The thermal springs</span> were discovered here by the ancient Romans.  In the city you can see the ruins of ancient baths.  And the fame of the local baths spread throughout the Roman Empire. </p><p>  The settlement that arose in the third century was called Baden.  When Germany came together, people began to specify in which land the resort was located.  They said: "Baden in the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg."  In the end, in 1931 the city officially changed its name.  Now it sounds like a tautology.  But it immediately becomes clear which particular resort is in question. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baden Baden Resort" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1313338.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Since 2013, the resort's international airport began to take regular flights from Russia.  The carrier company Ceman Airlines sends its planes from the capital's Domodedovo.  There are other options.  You can get to Frankfurt or Stuttgart.  In Germany, you can travel by rail relatively cheaply if you know some secrets.  So, a ticket ‚Äúall federal state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg‚Äù, valid for two hours, will cost you cheaper than the fare ‚ÄúStuttgart - Baden-Baden‚Äù.  An excellent highway network connects the city with Karlsruhe and Freiburg.  Resorts in Baden-Baden have long come out of the city limits.  Indeed, in small villages nearby, thermal keys are also beaten.  Clinics, pools, pump rooms are built on these sources.  There is a bus service between the resorts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort baden baden germany" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1313332.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History of Baden-Baden </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that the city owes its glory to the ancient Romans - great lovers to soak in the baths.  At the dawn of our era, they built on the shores of Os a bath for wounded veterans.  Later, a settlement grew up here, which became known as Civitas-Aurelia-Aquensis.  The city became truly famous in 214, when it was visited by the emperor Caracalla.  He really liked the local thermal waters.  Imperial baths were built for Caracalla. </p><p>  In the early Middle Ages, the baths were forgotten.  But already from 1306, they were again put in order by the rulers of the burg of Badon (as the Roman Civitas-Aurelia-Aquensis began to be called in the local dialect).  In the Renaissance, when doctors began to prescribe ‚Äúsluggish" patients and women who could not conceive a child, treatment on the waters, the city became so popular that a resort fee was introduced here (by the way, the first in all of Germany).  The presence of mountains attracted pulmonary patients.  In the nineteenth century, the resorts of Baden-Baden became the "summer capital of Europe", where the whole high society flocks.  A casino is being built here (the first in Germany) and other leisure infrastructure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baden Baden Resort Photo" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1313404.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Russia and Baden-Baden </h2><p>  In the eighteenth century, the heir to the throne, Alexander Pavlovich, married a certain Louise.  His wife, who went down in history under the name of Empress Elizabeth Alekseevna, among others, bore the title of Princess of Baden.  Since the reign of Alexander the Great, the fashion for ‚Äúwaters‚Äù has also come to Russia.  Empress Elizabeth loved to travel to their native places, to the resorts of Baden-Baden.  And the whole Russian nobility followed her: the Grand Dukes Trubetskoys, Menshikovs, Volkonskys, etc. Dignitaries, middle-class nobles and merchants who could afford to luxuriate in this resort did not lag behind them. </p><p>  Many entrepreneurial people bought real estate here - if not in the town itself, so in its vicinity.  In the 19th century, Baden-Baden firmly entered Russian classical literature.  He is mentioned in his works by Gogol, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Goncharov, Chekhov and Turgenev.  Since the Russian community was large, the Orthodox Church of the Transfiguration appeared in the resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baden baden resort in germany" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1313339.jpg" width="600"></div>
