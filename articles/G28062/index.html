The Devil in the Flesh, Antichrist, Black Death - all these nicknames were given to him by ordinary people.  Those who were exiled to concentration camps, suffered in the ghetto, went to be shot ... Adolf Hitler completely changed the course of history not only in Germany, but also in the whole world.  After himself, he left complete devastation in Europe and a document that regulated the work of the remaining Reich government.  Hitler‚Äôs political testament is interesting from a historical point of view, it reveals to us the nature of this dangerous man, his secret plans and hidden beliefs. </p><h2>  Key points of the document </h2>

It consists of two parts, in which Adolf Hitler summarizes his life, political and military activities.  He also openly discusses why the Second World War began.  He also names the reasons that prompt him to commit suicide, and thanks his citizens for love, respect and support.  He accuses Himmler and Goering of conspiracy and coup and removes them from all posts.  Instead, it completely changes the <span>composition of the government.</span>

The rulers of states with such roots or their activities in favor of this nation - this is what provoked his aggression.  In the document, he completely absolves himself of the blame for the beginning of the bloodshed.  And he says that he has repeatedly suggested controlling and limiting the armament of the world.

    <p>  Hitler‚Äôs quotes from the political will are interesting and reveal his actions on the issue of solving the German-Polish problem.  ‚ÄúIn just three days, I made an offer to the British ambassador to liquidate this conflict, but it was thrown back, because the British government needed this war,‚Äù he writes.  Hitler calls the reason for the refusal the influence of propaganda, which was spread by the Jews, and as a result, increased business activity beneficial for London. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Why did the Fuhrer choose suicide? </h2><p>  Hitler‚Äôs political testament also conveys to us the motives by which he decided to settle accounts with life.  First of all, this is the inability to leave the Reich.  The F√ºhrer writes that the strength of his army was weakened, his morale was undermined from the inside by traitors and cowards.  Therefore, his last will is to share the fate of millions of Germans who decided not to flee, but to remain in the occupied country.  But since falling into the hands of the enemy is unacceptable for Hitler, death is the only right decision. </p><p>  The F√ºhrer writes that he is dying with a light heart.  He is inspired by the exploits of the rank and file at the front, the exorbitant help of the rear and the fervent hearts of German youth.  Hitler's speech in the document contains gratitude to all these people, whose enormous efforts Reich flourished, and the glory of Germany boomed throughout the world.  The sacrifices of ordinary people and his own death, the ruler of the Reich is sure, will give a seed that will be able to germinate and revive the National Socialist movement in the future.  He asks the people not to repeat his suicide, but to save their lives in order to continue the struggle and give birth to future heroes of Germany. </p><h2>  Political appointments </h2>

In his will, he expels him from the party and completely deprives him of his rights.  Instead, the seats of the Reich President and Commander-in-Chief of the military should be taken by Admiral Doenitz.  He also removes Himmler, the Reichsf√ºhrer and the Chief Minister.  At the request of Hitler, he should be replaced by Karl Hanke and Paul Gisler.

Hitler was informed of their desire to seize power, to negotiate with the enemy.  All this, according to the ruler of the Reich, caused great damage to the country, led to the defeat of his people in this war.  Therefore, dying, he wants to atone for the Germans by appointing them a decent and honest cabinet.  The F√ºhrer hopes that the new government will be able to continue his work and make Germany the "queen of all nations."  Among his followers: Bormann, Greyk, Funk, Tyrac and other German figures of that time. </p><h2>  The main mission of the followers </h2>

Some members of the new cabinet appointed by the F√ºhrer, including Bormann, Goebbels and their wives, also wanted to commit suicide with their leader.  But Hitler orders them not to do this, since their activities, intelligence and resourcefulness should serve the good of the country, should revive it from ruins and raise it from its knees.

    <p>  The F√ºhrer wishes them firmness and justice.  They should not succumb to fear, because the honor of the nation for its followers should be above all.  According to Hitler, the main task of future generations is to continue the development of the party, sacrifice its own interests to it, be faithful to duty and, to the last drop of blood, obey the new government.  The German people must observe racial laws, at the same time hate and destroy the poisoner of the whole world - the Jewish community. </p><h2>  Value of Hitler's political testament in </h2><h2>  world history </h2><p>  It is huge, since it managed to shed light on many distorted facts and propaganda of the USSR government, oppressed Jews and other peoples who suffered in that war.  The fact that Hitler was a ruthless tyrant and a killer of millions of innocents is pure truth.  But the fact that he was a weak-minded, nervous tantrum, as Soviet films show us, is a myth.  The will shows that it was written by a sensible person.  He was wise enough, just directed his activities in the wrong direction, which resulted in the death of millions of people.  The document also protests the version that the Fuhrer allegedly managed to escape to Latin America and live there safely until one hundred years.  But we see: he loved his ideology so much, putting it above all that he wanted to die with it. </p><p>  Hitler's political testament testifies to the fact that not only the Fuhrer was the culprit of the war.  England itself, desiring bloodshed for its own selfish ends, became the indirect culprit of the onset of the collapse of Europe.  When Churchill realized what he had done, it was too late to stop the Fuhrer, who had advanced into the very depths of the continent.  And the Soviet Union itself was an aggressor similar to Hitler.  It was he who unleashed a series of wars from 1938 to 1941: he swallowed the Baltic, captured parts of Poland and Finland. </p><h2>  The opinion of historians </h2>

Some say that his will is extremist in nature, so it was forbidden to distribute it in many districts and regions of the Russian Federation.  In principle, the decision is correct.  After all, the legacy of the main killer of the 20th century became the basis of the policy of neo-Nazis, who have recently intensified their illegal activities throughout the country.  The document has no right to life; it must be destroyed in the same way as Hitler himself.  But this is only one side of the coin.  If you look from a different angle, the will is a historical value, interesting to discover new facts about this person, his environment and the politics of Nazi Germany.

    <p>  Other historians evaluate the document and draw attention to the fact that in its lines there is not a single bad word about the Russian people.  Despite the fact that Germany fell under Soviet shells and bombs, Hitler's speech is not riddled with curses on the USSR.  As before, he calls the blame for all the ills on earth.  Hitler's quotes burn with aggression and hatred of this people. </p><h2>  What happened after the death of the Fuhrer? </h2>

But not all associates were ready to submit to his will.  So, the new Reich Chancellor Goebbels appointed by him did not want to stay alive.  Because of love and devotion to his Fuhrer or fear of being severely punished by the winners, but he also committed suicide.  Other generals also acted: Hitler's adjutant Burgdorf and the last chief of staff, Krebs.

    <p>  Someone says that this is ordinary cowardice.  But this can be argued, since not everyone dares to take their own lives.  And their death from their own hands now now looks more dignified after a century than the death of the same Goering, who blew his last breath in an American prison, or Himmler, who died in the English bunk.  And not to mention the dozens of those hanged in 1946.  No, we don‚Äôt sing <span>praises to these</span> bloodsuckers, we just try to look at events objectively, casting aside personal prejudices and opinions. </p><h2>  Interesting facts about Hitler </h2>

His eternal desire to read and process book material was known to his associates.  They often saw him in libraries, at seminars and conferences.  The F√ºhrer idolized purity and avoided people with a runny nose.

    <p>  Hitler was always laconic.  But this concerned only personal communication.  When it came to politics, then it could not be stopped.  Pondering his speech for a long time, he spent hours silently walking around the office, but when she began to dictate to the typist, she did not have time to write down everything verbatim.  The verbal flow was accompanied by quotes, exclamations, active gestures and facial expressions. </p><p>  Adolf Hitler changed the course of history, he was remembered to us as a tyrant and a murderer.  Despite the many positive qualities of his character, he has no excuse for the troubles that this evil genius brought to innocent people around the world. </p>
