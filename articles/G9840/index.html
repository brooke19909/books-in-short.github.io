  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scientific and technical progress. Stimulation and financing</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Scientific and technological progress (NTP) is recognized in the world as the most important factor in the development of the economy.  In literature (both domestic and western) it is more often associated with the term <span>"innovation process".</span> </p><p>  Scientific and technological progress of the 20th century had a significant impact on the social development of the population of many countries.  In the middle of the century - during the period of developed market conditions - the concept of general welfare, formed according to the principles of rational efficiency, gained popularity. </p><p>  As James Bright (American economist) noted, scientific and technological progress is the only process that can combine technology, science, management, entrepreneurship, and economics.  The essence of the process is in obtaining and mastering innovation.  Scientific and technological progress is a multi-stage phenomenon, starting with the emergence of innovation and ending with its commercial implementation.  Thus, the process covers a complex of relationships, including consumption, exchange, production. </p><p>  Stimulating the development and implementation of innovations is considered the most dynamic management tool associated with the influence on the interests of all participants in the process.  As a result, they (participants) accelerate scientific and technological progress not only according to instructions from above, but also in accordance with their own convictions. </p><p>  Stimulation contributes to the formation of benefits while satisfying the social and <span>economic interests of</span> enterprises developing and developing innovative highly efficient equipment. </p><p>  When accelerating the process, great importance is attached to the formation of an organic bonus system based on the results of production and scientific and technical activities.  Stimulating the innovation process involves not only moral or material encouragement.  Along with this, there is a system of punishments, which implies a reduction in the payment and social development funds of enterprises producing inefficient and outdated products. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The organization of the acceleration of the innovation process is closely linked not only with the development of technology and science, but also with a change in relations in the socio-economic sector. </p><p>  Stimulation of scientific and technical progress involves the use of <span>environmental</span> management methods <span>.</span>  In the presence of established standards for fees for used <span>resources, enterprises</span> strive for a more rational and integrated application.  In this case, it is more profitable to use special <span>resource-saving technologies,</span> extracting the maximum income from each ton of resources.  In addition, certain standards are established for paying for harmful emissions in the production process.  In this regard, enterprises are striving to apply pollution reduction techniques.  At the same time, in case of exceeding the established standards for emissions, an increased fee is charged from the enterprise. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, scientific and technological progress is unthinkable without funding.  At the same time, special funds are formed and used that contribute to the stimulation of scientific and technical progress.  In accordance with their economic nature, they (funds) relate to the social costs of production.  They are in some way a form of reservation and transfer of advanced costs to the value of the finished product.  The role played by funding funds in <span>the reproduction process is</span> close to the role of depreciation.  Their application allows you to offset the costs of education, the development of innovations, as well as insure the risk associated with this. </p><p>  Of course, the success of scientific and technological progress largely depends on the position that science occupies in society. </p><p>  As world <span>economic experience</span> shows <span>, the</span> transition to a market system can be successful in the context of radical reforms in the economic sphere and large-scale changes in the basic economic structure. </p>
