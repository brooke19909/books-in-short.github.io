  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The sensor is buggy: causes and solutions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Often, smartphone users are interested in what to do when the sensor of their smartphone is buggy.  This is because the user interacts with the device through the touch screen, whether scrolling through the menus, working with files, and other functions of the device.  If the sensor is buggy even after repair, the user cannot fully use the entire functionality of the gadget.  And this is sometimes extremely necessary. </p><h2>  Why it happens? </h2><p>  The sensor on Android or IOS may start failing completely unexpectedly.  The cause may be poor repair or components or a fall.  Usually inadequate sensor operation on almost any smartphone can be associated with mechanical stress.  To protect the touchscreen from shock, protective glass or films are installed on it, since without additional protection, unpleasant situations can occur due to shock or fall.  As a result, the sensor on the phone is buggy, or it completely fails. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zerodollartips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what to do" class="if uuid-3166318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3166318.jpg"></div><p>  A touchscreen can start to fail for several reasons: </p><ol><li>  Moisture in the device. </li><li>  Software bugs. </li><li>  Incorrect touchscreen replacement or poor component quality. </li></ol><p>  If you know for sure that your phone has not been subjected to mechanical or moisture effects, but the touch does not respond to touches or does not respond to them correctly, then most likely the problem is a software error.  It is possible to fix it yourself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Signs of a faulty sensor </h2><p>  There are several indicators of a touchscreen malfunction on a smartphone: </p><ol><li>  The sensor does not respond to clicks in certain places or on the entire screen. </li><li>  Chaotic display operations (files and applications open by themselves, scrolling through menus, etc.) after an impact, a fall, or poor-quality repair. </li></ol><p>  If the sensor is buggy, what to do and how to solve the problem yourself?  Consider the methods below. </p><h2>  Clear screen </h2><p>  Starting to independently reanimate a poorly functioning, braking or buggy sensor, you need to clean it of dirt.  The smartphone will definitely not get worse from this, but the contact between the finger and the touchscreen will improve, which may very well solve the problem of freezes and slowdowns.  To clean the display of a smartphone, it is better to use a soft lint-free cloth and a special tool for cleaning the sensor.  Special wet wipes for screens are also suitable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sensor what to do" class="if uuid-3166319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3166319.jpg"></div><h2>  Phone reboot </h2><p>  As stated above, the problem may be software.  In this case, rebooting the device may help.  If the iPhone sensor is buggy, you must: </p><ol><li>  Press and hold the power and home buttons (volume up and down buttons on iPhone 7 and above). </li><li>  Wait for the Apple logo on the phone screen. </li><li>  Check the sensor‚Äôs performance by touching the icon of any application after loading the system. </li></ol><p>  If the sensor is buggy on a smartphone running Android, the instructions for rebooting will vary, as the key combinations depend on the manufacturer of the device.  For example, for most Samsung smartphones, a combination of the power key and volume down is suitable.  Rebooting the device may solve the sensor malfunction due to a software error. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Check protective accessories </h2><p>  It happens that it is additional protection that interferes with the operation of the sensor.  Because of it, the sensor may not immediately trigger or slow down when you press one of the sides of the case or mechanical buttons on the device.  For example, the sensor may completely stop responding to clicks on the entire display or only at the bottom if the protective film or glass was not glued onto the phone screen correctly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.technobezz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the sensor is buggy" class="if uuid-3166323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3166323.jpg"></div><p>  The market today is full of affordable protections for smartphones, but not all of them are of high quality and do their job properly.  If your cover covers any part of the screen, it will interfere with the normal functioning of the device, causing the touchscreen to work incorrectly or freeze.  What to do if the iPhone sensor is buggy?  In order to identify what causes incorrect operation of the touchscreen, you need to remove the cover and check the sensor.  If the protective cover causes interruptions in the display, then after removing it, the sensor will be restored to functional state.  But if the screen continues to fail, you should look for a malfunction further. </p><h2>  What should I do if the problem persists? </h2><p>  In the event that rebooting the device, replacing the glass and removing the protective cover did not give any results and the touchscreen still fails, most likely the problem is not software errors and incorrect accessories, but a malfunction of the internal components of the device.  In this case, you should contact the service to professionals who will diagnose, identify a breakdown and replace a failed part. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tnhonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The sensor is buggy on the iPhone" class="if uuid-3166327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3166327.jpg"></div><p>  If, after the device crashes, the keys sometimes incorrectly work or do not work at all and the touchscreen does not respond to pressing, the wizard will first find out the cause of the breakdown, and then eliminate it.  After the diagnosis, they will explain in detail why the touchscreen was buggy or did not work, and tell you about the state of your device after a drop or moisture.  Further, if necessary, a specialist will clean the device from traces of moisture or replace the display module. </p><h2>  When may a screen replacement be required? </h2><p>  The display of any phone is constantly subjected to mechanical stress, as a result of which it may stop responding to touch, or the sensitivity of the sensor may decrease. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sferamagazine.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the sensor is buggy what to do" class="if uuid-3166328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3166328.jpg"></div><p>  Deep scratches on the glass can also cause the bottom of the screen to stop working.  To solve problems with a fully or partially disabled touch screen, it is necessary to replace the glass or the entire display module.  Also, replacing the display if the sensor malfunctions or displays information on the screen incorrectly is necessary after: </p><ol><li>  Phone Drops. </li><li>  Moisture in the case, which negatively affects the sensitivity of the sensor and causes incorrect triggering. </li><li>  Scuffs and deep scratches on the glass due to natural wear. </li><li>  Other mechanical damage on the touchscreen. </li></ol><p>  Replacing the display module in case of damage or malfunction is quite simple.  But with self-disassembling and installing a new screen, you can damage thin loops and landing sockets, which will lead to more expensive repairs. </p>
