To get a loan: it is enough to be over 18 years old, have a passport of the Russian Federation, registration in one of the regions, a good credit history and a stable income.  But not always the borrower can boast of having all the parameters.  And for those who previously allowed delinquencies in loans, 5 out of 6 banks are denied loans.  In order not to waste time filling out a questionnaire where it is impossible to obtain a loan, you need to know which banks do not refuse credit. </p><h2>  What do I need to get a loan? </h2><p>  It is not difficult to obtain a loan, even if the borrower has previously made delinquencies under the contracts and has outstanding obligations.  To do this: </p><ul><li>  choose a financial institution that guarantees a loan with a bad credit history; </li><li>  provide a complete set of documents required by the lender; </li><li>  choose a convenient type of loan (if there are several); </li><li>  apply online;  it is much faster and more profitable than a loan at the bank office; </li><li>  wait for the decision of the bank. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="r.search.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why cash loans will be denied" class="if uuid-2978294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2978294.jpg"></div><p>  But before applying, you need to compare banks that give loans with bad credit history.  Not all companies are willing to provide a good loan to non-payers.  In order not to overpay interest on a loan, it is better to spend time searching for a minimum rate and favorable conditions for maintaining a loan agreement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  List of creditors for bad credit payers </h2><p>  Of course, not a single bank will issue loans to all customers without failure.  This is unprofitable and entails financial risks.  But there are companies whose approval percentage for applications in which does not fall below 89%. </p><p>  Which banks do not refuse a loan to almost anyone: </p><ol><li>  Tinkoff </li><li>  "Setelem." </li><li>  "OTP Bank". </li><li>  "Renaissance". </li></ol><p>  Some of them, namely, Setelem and OTP Bank, specialize in drawing up loan agreements by installments.

You can apply for a loan and an installment card only by passport. </p><h2>  "Setelem" Bank: features of lending from partners </h2><p>  Cetelem is among the partners of Sberbank, which is a sign of creditor reliability.  But the percentage of approved applications to Setelem Bank is higher by 32.3%. </p><p>  Areas of bank lending: cars, furniture, appliances (including mobile phones and a headset for them).  Setel‚Äôs technology partner is Svyaznoy.

When applying for a loan in Svyaznoy, 93.7% of borrowers received loans within 1 hour after sending the application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="r.search.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="for what reason does the bank refuse a loan" class="if uuid-2978272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2978272.jpg"></div><p>  But the bank has certain requirements for payers: </p><ol><li>  You can apply for a loan from 21 to 65 years old. </li><li>  The client must be a citizen of Russia and live in one of the regions of the country. </li><li>  A passport and one of the documents (TIN, passport, driver's license, SNILS) are required. </li><li>  To receive a loan, a client must receive a personal offer from Setelem Bank. </li></ol><p>  Subject to all requirements, within 1 day the borrower can get a loan in the amount of 15 thousand to 1 million rubles with an interest rate of 12.9% per annum.  The loan term is from 1 to 5 years. </p><h2>  OTP Bank: obtaining a loan </h2><p>  Online reviews of banks that do not refuse credit do not dispense with the mention of OTP Bank.  The company offers to issue loans even to customers without official income and with a bad credit history.  Only a passport is required to apply.  A cash loan can be obtained on the OTP Bank website. </p><p>  Cash Loan Terms: </p><ul><li>  amount up to 4 million rubles; </li><li>  overpayment from 14.9% to 35.7% per annum; </li><li>  a loan is issued for up to 7 years; </li><li>  the bank decides to issue a loan within 15 minutes. </li></ul><p>  OTP Bank, like Setelem, offers loans for the purchase of goods.  These are the so-called installments for a period of 3 months to 5 years.  You can receive goods using the Setelem loan in mobile phone stores (Euroset, Megafon), jewelry stores (Adamas, Gold 585), fur stores (Snow Queen, Alef) and etc. </p><p>  Loan issuing options: </p><ul><li>  amount from 2 to 500 thousand rubles; </li><li>  no down payment; </li><li>  only a passport is needed; </li><li>  payment date selection; </li><li>  a wide range of channels for repaying a loan. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.romaniajournal.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="banks with bad credit" class="if uuid-2978269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2978269.jpg"></div><p>  To obtain a loan, the borrower must be at least 21 years old, but no more than 69 (at the maturity date).  Loans are issued only to Russian citizens with permanent registration in the OTP Bank service region.  Lack of registration is one of the reasons why denial of a loan in cash at OTP Bank. </p><h2>  Bank "Renaissance": reviews, filing an application </h2><p>  Renaissance is one of the banks that combines an installment loan for the purchase of goods and classic lending.  At the bank, customers can get a loan even with a bad credit history.  If the borrower is looking for which bank will give the loan, if others refused, he should contact the Renaissance. </p><p>  Customer reviews about the bank, for the most part, are positive.  Borrowers note transparent lending conditions, quick examination of the application.  Customers consider the lack of credit in the company to be charged a commission for depositing funds at the bank's cash desks, through a mobile bank and transferring from a bank card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.modernghana.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which bank will give a loan if refused" class="if uuid-2978972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2978972.jpg"></div><p>  Lending conditions in the Renaissance: </p><ul><li>  The rate is from 10.9% to 24.9% per annum.  It depends on the number of documents and whether the borrower receives a salary in a bank account. </li><li>  The limit is from 30 to 700 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Clients age from 20 to 70 years.  If the borrower does not receive a salary in the account of the Renaissance, then he can get a loan only from 24 years old. </li><li>  Loans are issued only to citizens of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Minimum income requirements for citizens: from 8 thousand rubles for residents of all regions except Moscow.  Clients of Moscow branches must earn at least 12 thousand rubles a month. </li><li>  Registration in the region in which there is a branch of Renaissance Bank. </li><li>  At least 3 months of experience. </li></ul><p>  You can apply online.  Consideration takes place during the day.  If the decision is positive, the client must contact the selected bank branch for a loan. </p><h2>  Why can they refuse to issue a loan? </h2><p>  Having learned which banks do not refuse credit, borrowers are still afraid to hear that they did not approve the loan.  None of the credit organizations will give a 100% guarantee that the loan will be approved, since the decision on each client is made individually. </p><p>  To increase the chances of issuing, you need to know when the bank refuses the loan: </p><ol><li>  Insufficient solvency. </li><li>  Very bad credit history. </li><li>  Existence of existing delays. </li><li>  Arrest on the accounts. </li><li>  Refusal to provide documents. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.incrypts.com" data-author=": Incrypts, "><img itemprop="image" alt="which banks do not refuse credit" class="if uuid-2978313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2978313.jpg"></div><p>  If there are at least 3 reasons, there is practically no chance of getting a loan at the same time.  But to find out exactly why the bank refuses the loan, the borrower can from the lender.  In addition, the client can request a credit history to check their reliability as a payer. </p>
