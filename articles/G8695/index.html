He did not rule for long, only a few months from April to June 1605. </p><h2>  Ascension to the throne </h2><p>  This prince is credited with outstanding enlightenment.  He is the firstborn of Boris Fedorovich and Maria Grigorievna.  When Godunov Fedor Borisovich was still a child, his father began to rule Russia unilaterally. </p><p>  From childhood, the boy was given honors of the royal order.  When ambassadors were received at the palace, his name was indicated in the texts of ceremonies, and diplomatic gifts were sent.  Such increased attention to the boy is explained by the fact that Fedor was preparing to enter into a family relationship with the Rurikovich in the future.  His father began to rule in 1598, already then the heir became prince, appeared at ceremonies. </p>

At that moment, the king was sick and did not have the opportunity to visit the shrine.

    <h2>  Intensive education </h2><p>  Tsarevich was taught to stamp the state, communicate on important topics with the boyars in the Duma, and find a common language with ambassadors.  He met grooms who came to ask for the hands of Xenia, his sister.  Also, without him there were no charity and court cases that his father was in charge of. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fedor Godunov was mainly brought up by Ivan Chemodanov, thanks to whom he grew up as a very educated young man.  In the future he will be remembered as an enlightened ruler.  This person can be called the first object of application of the European education system among government officials of Russia.  He also had ill-wishers who created rumors that the young man was seriously ill and weak-witted. </p>

    <h2>  Difficult circumstances </h2><p>  The reign of Fedor Godunov did not begin under the most favorable conditions.  The length of time between joining the board and ending it is extremely short, and also overshadowed by severe trials. </p><p>  False Dmitry I attacked Moscow, because of which the previous ruler was killed.  The oath taken earlier by the Godunovs had such an interpretation, in accordance with which the people believed that they agreed that Otrepiev was a true ruler.  The period of confusion and political litigation, a war for power began. </p><p>  Fedor Godunov had to regain his right to reign, which was quite difficult, given the lack of experience in conducting military operations.  He was then only 16 years old.  I had to rely on the help of the Basmanovs - a family that had previously successfully fought False Dmitry. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It was a real fierce struggle for the primacy and love of the people.  Companions of the young king distributed gifts to people, with the help of which they were supposed to remember his father.  Previously exiled people received an amnesty.  One of them was the cousin of the ruler B. Belsky, who a bit later played an important role in the arrest, to which Tsar Fedor Godunov was subjected. </p>

    <h2>  Weakening </h2><p>  Despite all efforts, the expected result was not achieved.  Nearby were a lot of traitors, one of whom was the boyar F. Mstislavsky.  Plans were made for the murder of Fedor, but the dynasty was already overtaken by the collapse, which was at the peak of its seventh week of rule. </p><p>  Prior to this, they established the Stone Order, which served as the ministry in charge of construction, under whose supervision there were architects who worked with stone and brick factories.  It was this institution that controlled the budget of the settlements in which the extraction of building materials was carried out. </p><p>  There is no reliable data on whether F. Godunov minted his own coins.  There is a version in accordance with which there were monetary units with his name.  If this is true, he is the only king who does not have his own stamp. </p><p>  Also, his initials can be found on the money attributed to Boris Godunov.  In addition, this ruler was not crowned with reign, so the entire history of the rule can be called very specific and unusual. </p>

    <h2>  Beginning of the End </h2><p>  The young ruler made great efforts to win over the people.  The boyars did the same.  However, not all warriors wanted to obey him, there was a split, provoking serious friction between different social groups. </p><p>  False Dmitry managed to lure large masses under his rule.  There were regular skirmishes in the camp.  Gradually, Fyodor was cheated by an increasing number of his former supporters; less and less support remained for him.  The few troops that remained loyal to the rightful king were defeated due to their weakness. </p><p>  On the side of the traitors stood the Korela Cossacks, who were serious opponents.  Fedor could only trust the Germans, who paid a generous salary for wage labor.  At that time, his rival felt more and more freely and called his own person a true ruler.  Now the traitor's title has already spread to Godunov. </p><p>  Despite the threat of torture that the ruling dynasty created over the rioters, this infection could no longer be cured.  The rebellion got out of hand.  The tsar‚Äôs family could only hide in the Kremlin from certain death.  Now, not only the rebels, but also their own people were a serious threat.  Everything ended with the deposition of the sovereign.  The king who came to rule after Fedor Godunov is False Dmitry I. </p><h2>  Eyewitness Assessment </h2><p>  If we talk about the reviews of foreign and Russian contemporaries, we can regard the whole family as victims of the power behavior of Boris Godunov.  He killed before this king Dmitry.  For this, before God, he had to answer both him and his relatives.  So in his "Other Tale" says V. Shuisky, who wrote lines on the subject anonymously. </p>

The ground for them was prepared by their father.  Under other conditions, the younger Godunov could bring prosperity to the country, but, as you know, you can‚Äôt rewrite history.  A troubled time, like a dark quagmire, consumed his bright mind and progressive designs.
