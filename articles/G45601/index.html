Roentgen in 1895 and called X-rays.  Over the next two years, the scientist was engaged in their research.  During this period, the first <span>x-ray tubes</span> were created <span>.</span>  They are the most common source of radiation. </p><p>  It was found that hard X-rays can penetrate various materials, as well as <span>human</span> soft <span>tissues.</span>  The latter fact quickly found application in medicine. </p><p>  The discovery of x-rays at that time attracted the attention of scientists around the world.  The following year, after their discovery, a huge number of works on their study and use were published. </p><p>  Many scientists have studied the properties of x-rays. </p><p>  J. Stokes predicted their electromagnetic nature, which was experimentally confirmed by C. Barcl, who also discovered polarization.  German physicists Knipping, Friedrich, Laue revealed diffraction (phenomena associated with a deviation from rectilinear propagation).  In 1913, Bragg and Wulf independently discovered a simple relationship between <span>wavelength,</span> diffraction angle, and the distance between nearby atomic planes on the crystal.  All the above works formed the basis of <span>structural x-ray analysis.</span>  The use of spectra for elemental material analysis began in the 1920s.  A major role in the development of the study and application of radiation belongs to the Physicotechnical Institute, which was founded by A.F. Ioffe. </p><p>  The most common source of rays is an x-ray tube.  However, the sources may be individual radioactive isotopes.  In this case, some directly emit <span>x-rays,</span> while in others nuclear radiation (a-particles or electrons) bombard the emitting radiation metal target.  The tube has a significantly higher radiation intensity than isotopic sources.  At the same time, the dimensions, cost, and weight of isotope sources are incomparably less than that of a tube installation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sources of soft x-ray radiation can become synchrotrons and electronic storage devices.  The <span>radiation</span> intensity <span>of synchrotrons</span> is two to three orders of magnitude higher than the radiation of the tube in a certain region of the spectrum. </p><p>  The natural sources that emit x-rays include the Sun and other objects in space. </p><p>  In accordance with the mechanism of occurrence, the spectra and the radiation itself can be characteristic (linear) and inhibitory (continuous). </p><p>  In the second case, fast particles (charged) are emitted by means of the X-ray spectrum due to their deceleration in the process of interaction with target atoms. </p><p>  Linear radiation is formed as a result of atomic ionization with the ejection of an electron from one of the shells of the atom.  Such a phenomenon can result from the collision of an atom and a fast particle, for example, with an electron (primary x-ray radiation), or the absorption of a photon by an atom (fluorescence x-ray). </p><p>  The interaction of rays with matter can create a photoelectric effect that accompanies their absorption or scattering.  This phenomenon is detected when, when an atom absorbs a photon, the first one emits one of the internal electrons.  Then, either the radiative transition of an atom with the emission of a photon of characteristic radiation or the ejection of a second electron during a non-radiative transition can occur. </p><p>  Under the influence of X-rays on non-metallic crystals (for example, <span>rock salt)</span> , ions with a positive additional charge are formed at some sites in the atomic lattice, and excess electrons appear close to them. </p>
