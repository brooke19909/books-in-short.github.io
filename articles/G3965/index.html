It was created back in the 14th century. </p><p>  The fortress was built by <span>the Republic of Genoa</span> to protect Kafa, the largest port in the Crimea.

Let's get acquainted with the history of this majestic fortress. </p><h2>  The ancient city of Feodosia.  The origins </h2><p>  Theodosius (Crimea) is a city with an ancient history dating back more than twenty-five centuries.  It was built in the VI century BC.  e.  Greek settlers.  At the beginning of the 4th century <span>BC, it</span> became part of the Bosporus state.  Then Theodosius and acquired its current name.  It translates as "given by God." </p>

Very quickly Theodosius developed into a prosperous trading settlement and one of the main slaveholding centers in Crimea.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When Greece fell into decay, the city repeatedly passed under the control of either the Roman Empire, the Khazars, or Byzantium.  Until the X century, Theodosius was in a deplorable state.  This was due to the fact that the Romans had their trading ports, more convenient in location than the Crimean ones.  Theodosius fell into decline and the raids of some nomad hordes.  In the XIII century, the city was under the control of the Golden Horde, after which it was bought by Genoese merchants. </p><h2>  Genoese period.  Building a fortress </h2><p>  This time is considered the most prosperous in the history of the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Kafa</span> (Feodosia).  The Genoese fortress, by the way, was built exactly then. </p><p>  The beginning of prosperity can be attributed to about the middle of the XIII century.  Genoese merchants, entering the Black Sea, noticed the undoubted advantages of the local bay.  On the site of the ancient city, they arranged a trading settlement, which they called Kafa.  And thanks to the powerful fortifications in Constantinople, they took control of all the sea routes leading from the Mediterranean to the <span>countries of the East.</span> </p><p>  Soon Theodosius became the main Genoese colony in the Crimea.  She was a major transit shopping center.  Through Feodosia, furs and wheat, gold and precious stones, porcelain and spices were brought to the European countries from the East.  But the main and most profitable product, as before, alas, remained numerous slaves. </p><p>  In general, during this period Theodosius was a prosperous city.  The population then totaled about 70 thousand souls.  The city had its own theater and a bank branch, its own coins were minted. </p>

    <h2>  The creation of the Genoese fortress </h2><p>  In the middle of the XIV Genoese fortress was built to protect Kafa.  This is not only a bright attraction, but also the real pride of the city of Kafa (Feodosia).  The Genoese fortress was the second largest, as well as the most powerful in all of Europe.  It was located in the south of the city, on the coast of Theodosius Gulf.  She had two lines of defenses: the citadel - the heart of the fortress - and the outside. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Its perimeter totaled more than five thousand meters.  It consisted of more than thirty towers.  Interestingly, each of them had its own name.  Under the walls of the fortress was a deep moat, which served not only to defend the city, but also to drain water into the sea. </p><p>  The citadel was built on steep slopes that played the role of primary defensive structures.  Limestone mined from <span>the seabed</span> or from nearby mountains served as the material for its creation.  The total length of the walls exceeded 700 m. Their size was more than 11 m, and the width was about two.  The citadel housed the palace of the consul, the local treasury, the court, as well as warehouses with especially expensive goods - furs, silk, jewelry. </p><p>  And although most of the buildings were destroyed over many centuries, every resident of the peninsula can proudly tell where the Genoese fortress is located, how it was created. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Siege of the fortress by the</span> Golden Horde troops </h2><p>  One of the most tragic events in Europe is connected with the fortress in Cafe.  This is a plague epidemic that broke out in 1347 - 1351.  It all started with the fact that the Golden Horde army, led by Khan Dzhanibek, tried to capture the rich and prosperous city of Kafu (Theodosius).  The Genoese fortress, we note, was built so that it could withstand any offensive.  The Tatar cavalry simply did not have the opportunity to overcome the high and strong walls and cross the deep moat dug in front of them.  Dzhanibek had one hope - to starve the inhabitants of the city.  The siege by the Mongols of the Genoese fortress in Crimea could have lasted for many months, if not for the tragedy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The summer heat and non-compliance with the most basic hygiene requirements, as well as the accumulation of a huge number of warriors, provoked an outbreak of plague among the besiegers.  Then, in order to quickly seize the fortress, Janibek orders to throw the bodies of the dead through the walls.  An epidemic begins in the city.  Realizing what was happening, the wealthy Genoese merchants (and there were about a thousand of them in the city) secretly left Cafu and went home. </p><p>  The remaining residents, trying to leave the infected territory as soon as possible, hastened to open the gate and surrender.  However, <span>Khan Dzhanibek, in</span> order to prevent the spread of the epidemic in his army, did not enter the city, but left it without even closing it.  Meanwhile, the Genoese, returning home, left a terrible disease in all the cities where they only stopped.  The result was the worst epidemic in the history of Europe, which lasted more than three years and claimed the lives of, according to various estimates, from a quarter to half of the entire population of the continent. </p><p>  Some countries and cities are completely empty.  This epidemic is described in many literary works, including the Boccaccio's Decameron. </p>

    <h2>  Genoese fortress in the XV - XIX centuries </h2><p>  At the end of the 15th century, Theodosius was captured by the Ottoman army.  The Turks first destroyed the city, and then rebuilt it and renamed it.  Now he was called Kefe.  The city became the main Turkish trading port.  It housed the most famous slave market in the entire Northern Black Sea region. </p><p>  In 1616, the Zaporozhye Cossacks stormed the fortress under the leadership of <span>Peter Sagaidachny.</span>  They quickly defeated the powerful garrison and freed the prisoners. </p><p>  Since the end of the XVIII century, Theodosius was part of the Russian Empire. </p><p>  In the XIX century, the fortress was almost completely destroyed.  And, strangely enough, the reason for this was not a war or a siege.  The fact is that at that time there was a catastrophic lack of materials for the construction of houses and other structures.  Local residents had to disassemble the medieval fortress in order to use this stone. </p><h2>  Fortress in the 20th century </h2><p>  In 1920, Soviet power was finally established in the city.  Theodosius (Genoese fortress with it), despite the destruction, continued to keep traces of its former power. </p>

    <p>  After the hostilities, Theodosius gained the status of a resort.  The ruins attracted tourists from all over the country. </p><h2>  Genoese fortress today </h2><p>  Today the fortress is practically not preserved.  All that remains of it is the southern and part of the western wall of the citadel, several towers scattered around the city.  Also in the central part some churches, Turkish baths and a bridge were saved. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the Genoese fortress in Feodosia is not as famous as the Sudak fortress, today it remains a popular tourist destination.  Perhaps due to the fact that the buildings were not subjected to restoration, but managed to maintain the authentic, incomparable spirit of antiquity and the Middle Ages.  And so the Genoese fortress is so attractive.  Traveler reviews indicate that this is an amazing and unique place where you want to return again and again. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Today, perhaps, every resident of the city will easily tell you where the Genoese fortress is located.  The excursion can begin directly from the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe railway station, looking at the tower of Constantine, located there.  Finding the remains of an ancient citadel is very easy - just ask any passerby where the Genoese fortress is located. </p><p>  How to get by transport?  You can get on the minibus number 1 from the market.  And you can take a walk - it will take no more than half an hour, but the impressions will remain the most pleasant.  You need to go along Gorky Street.  After turning left, the Genoese fortress will already be visible.  The entrance, or rather, the gate has been preserved well, but it is better to start the inspection from the magnificent bridge, from where a magnificent view of the valley opens. </p>

    <h2>  Fortress in Feodosia and art </h2><p>  The dazzling sun of Theodosius attracted many famous people.  But glorified her world-famous painter, marine painter Ivan Aivazovsky.  Anton Chekhov preferred to rest here.  Osip Mandelstam and <span>Alexander Green</span> lived in Feodosia <span>.</span>  By the way, it was here that his ‚ÄúRunning on the Waves‚Äù was written. </p><h2>  Other surviving fortresses of Crimea </h2><p>  The fortifications in Feodosia are not only the Genoese fortress in Crimea.  As mentioned above, merchants, trying to completely capture the sea routes, strengthened different cities.  One of these defenses was surprisingly well preserved, and today it attracts many tourists.  What is the name of the city in which the Genoese fortress is located?  Zander. </p><p>  The ticket price in rubles is about 150-160.  And although almost nothing was left of its central part, the walls of the structure now amaze with their grandeur and inaccessibility, clearly standing out from the bay.  The fortress in Sudak, or, as it was then called, in Sughdea, was built a little later than in Feodosia.  Today it is a nature reserve.  It is best to come there in August - at the indicated time, a large-scale knightly tournament is held in the fortress, lasting more than a week. </p><h2>  What else to see in Feodosia? </h2><p>  The medieval citadel is undoubtedly the oldest, but far from the only pride of Theodosius.  Among others, no less beautiful, one can note the unique gallery of paintings by Aivazovsky presented by the artist to his native city. </p><p>  Another famous place is the Green House-Museum, in which the writer lived and worked.  The amazing world of science fiction is recreated in the form of a ship.  And, of course, do not forget about the numerous monuments and fountains, museums and squares that adorn the look of this magnificent city. </p>
