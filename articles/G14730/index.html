  <section class="page js-page"><h1>German attack on the USSR</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  World War II redrawn the world map; its significance is not minimized even by the most inveterate skeptics.  The main part of the war - the Second World War - also causes serious interest among many residents of the modern world.  Around the reasons for the <span>outbreak of war,</span> its course and outcome, many rumors roam that are often offensive to the inhabitants of our country, whose grandfathers and great-grandfathers remained on the battlefields. </p><p>  To this day, thousands of publications are published on the beginning of this confrontation.  The main event on the eve of the war is, of course, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.  After that, a friendship agreement was drawn up.  Concerned about the military successes of the Wehrmacht, the Soviet leadership took the initiative in this matter, writing in the text of the treaty a phrase about good neighborliness. </p><p>  The next stage of the pre-war relations between Russia and Germany is characterized by mutual cooling.  Hitler at that time already got everything he wanted.  Now compliance with the agreements with Russia ceased to be beneficial to him, and he began to act contrary to the agreements.  Soon, the Barbarossa plan came into development, and the German government finally lost interest in cooperation.  The Soviet government, meanwhile, followed the terms of the adopted treaties. </p><p>  Relations between Soviet Russia and Germany constituted a disregard for international legal norms and constituted a conspiracy of dictators. </p><p>  At the beginning of World War II, relations between Germany and the USSR developed in accordance with the Nonaggression Pact.  But in the spring, a sharp cooling began.  At this time, a message was received about building up the Wehrmacht's military power near the borders of the Soviet Union.  An official request was sent to which Hitler replied that his army was conducting <span>military exercises</span> in these areas <span>.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When France fell, Stalin realized that Germany was no longer interested in the neutrality of the USSR.  Churchill soon received an offer to improve relations.  At the same time, Germany entered into a ‚Äútriple agreement‚Äù with Italy and Japan. </p><p>  In October 1940, Finland deployed fascist troops on its territory that could carry out an German attack on the USSR. </p><p>  Another exacerbation happened at the end of 1940.  The number of fascist troops increased in Poland and Prussia.  In response to this, Stalin stopped the delivery of goods to Germany.  The troops were partially alerted to prevent a German attack on the USSR. Hitler assured Stalin that the troops were not concentrated in the direction of the Union, that the non-aggression pact remained valid.  But the situation was heating up, although the Soviet government until recently did not believe in the possibility of an insidious attack, and even being warned, it did not take active measures to organize defense. </p><p>  06/22/1941.  Germany attacked the USSR. </p><p>  Preparations for the attack went at an active pace throughout the year.  Hitler was determined to destroy the vitality of the Soviet people.  By the end of December, a war plan with the USSR was approved.  The German attack on the USSR became a matter of time. </p><p>  The defense capability of the Soviet Union was at a sufficient level due to the continuous imperialist danger.  But by the summer of 41, new weapons had not yet arrived in the USSR, the level of training of leading cadres left much to be desired, and intricate relations with Germany allowed German officers to manage the borders. </p><p>  It should be noted that the attack of <span>fascist Germany</span> on the USSR was not expected.  Although this possibility was explored in the offices of the Kremlin, the <span>Soviet leaders</span> were not aware of the exact date of the attack.  <span>Soviet intelligence</span> checked dozens of critical questions, the answers to which would prevent the attack of fascist Germany on the USSR.  Together, all these factors caused the inability of the Soviet Union to adequately respond to the blow of Germany, which was especially noticeable at first.  Hitler wished to take full advantage of the effect of surprise, and he succeeded very well.  His plan was worked out in detail, to the smallest detail.  The leadership of the Soviet Union did not have such an advantage. </p><p>  The generally accepted reasons for the German attack on the USSR are unknown.  Although the situation seems obvious, documents and evidence suggest that this story is an example of political deceit combined with a dictatorship. </p>
