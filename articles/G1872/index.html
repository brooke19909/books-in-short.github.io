After all, as they say in the quote, which became an aphorism, everything is there.  Someone are attracted by gastronomic tours, someone goes behind a fur coat.  Many go to see ancient and medieval sights.  Some want to bow to miraculous relics and icons.  Well, the Kalogria Beach Hotel 4 we are describing here is suitable for those who are in love with the nature of Greece.  You will not find such beauty of landscapes anywhere else. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the first line of the beach in a conservation area.  Green mountains approach the sea.  In the protected pine forest of Strofil live badgers, weasels, foxes, ferrets.  Nearby are the beautiful lakes Prokopos and Lamia - nesting places for many species of birds.  Hotel Kalogria recently had only three stars.  The reconstruction and construction of new villas last year allowed the administration to join another one.  But this Quartet remains the cheapest option on the Peloponnese. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  If you land at Araxos International Airport (Patra's air harbor), the transfer to the hotel takes a quarter of an hour.  Indeed, from the terminal to the doorstep of the hotel is only nine and a half kilometers.  But if Athens is the landing point, then much more time will be spent on the road.  Kalogria Beach Hotel 4 is located in the northwest of the Peloponnese peninsula, in the Achia Nome (region), on the outskirts of the resort of Kalogria.  From the air harbor of the capital of Greece - 250 km, from the seaport of Patras - 35 kilometers.  Despite the fact that beautiful limestone mountains approach very close to the coast, the terrain is flat and people with sore feet should not be afraid of endless stairs, descents and ascents.  The resort's sandy beach is a stone's throw from the hotel.  The warm Ionian Sea, the crystal mountain air, filled with the smell of pines and flowers, and the hospitality of the staff immediately create an atmosphere of cloudless relaxation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Kalogria Beach Hotel 4 (Peloponnese, Ahaia) is surrounded by a beautiful garden with pine trees, flowering trees and shrubs.  Previously, when the hotel had only three stars, it had buildings.  Now they added brand new snow-white bungalows.  Many reviews recommend booking these very houses.  There are several reasons.  Bungalows are located very close to the sea, so you can fall asleep to the sound of the surf.  The rooms are spacious and equipped with new appliances.  In such villas there is no feeling of crowding, which residents of megacities who are pretty tired of the city crush will fully appreciate. </p><p>  The rather extensive territory of the hotel is very stylishly decorated.  According to vacationers, the atmosphere of Greece is felt in everything.  The paths are obscured by arcades twined with wisteria or bougainvillea.  Green lawns, palm trees and Mediterranean pine trees complete the idyllic landscape.  Among this magnificence are pools with clear water.  Everywhere there are many flowers, and in the distance in the sultry haze you can see mountains. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kalogria Beach Hotel 4 Peloponnese" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2088363.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and Pools at Kalogria Beach Hotel 4 (Peloponnese, Ahaia, Kalogria) </h2><p>  All reviews agree that the coast here is the best on the entire peninsula.  Soft light golden sand, without a hint of stones.  It is molded well - to the delight of children.  In general, this beach is ideal for kids.  Sunset at sea is very gradual.  Children can splash freely in shallow water.  In this place, small tides and few algae.  The beach is wide and long.  On it in several rows are sunbeds and stationary umbrellas.  All of them are free for hotel guests.  Water sports can be enjoyed on the coast.  For guests of the hotel there is a <span>beach bar.</span> </p><p>  As an alternative to the Ionian Sea, swimming in the pools is offered.  There are three of them.  One is for adults, the second is for children, and the third has two water slides.  Reviews say that they are not extreme at all, but children under four years old are better off.  The terrace around the swimming pools is lined with sunbeds and umbrellas.  You can always find free places. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kalogria Beach Hotel 4 Greece Peloponnese" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2088362.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Kalogria Beach Hotel 4 (Greece, Peloponnese) has two teams of animators: for children and adults.  In the mini-club kids can be identified as early as four years of age.  So that all children are not bored, they are distributed by age category. </p><p>  In the afternoon, emphasis is on sports.  Animators encourage vacationers (very tactfully and delicately) to play beach volleyball or to participate in the lessons of the Greek sirtaki dance.  And in the evenings, shows are organized - every day is different.  Sometimes amateur animators are replaced by performances by real artists.  The hotel invites professional dance groups and singers. </p><h2>  Kalogria Beach Hotel 4: reviews </h2><p>  All tourists were pleased with their stay at the hotel.  The only thing that summer guests did not like was the abundance of mosquitoes.  There are many of them, especially in June-July.  So you need to stock up on a lot of spray or insect cream.  Reviews praised the food at the hotel.  It is very diverse, the restaurant offers many delicious Greek dishes.  The responses are very different about the numbers.  Those tourists who got into the building complained about old furniture and household appliances.  But the guests of the bungalow were satisfied with their place of residence.  The contingent of guests at the hotel is multinational.  There are Russians, but they do not make up the majority. </p>
