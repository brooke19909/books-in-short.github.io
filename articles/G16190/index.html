  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Theory of Automatic Control</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The theory of automatic control originated in the 19th century, in its second half, and was called "regulation".  With the expansion of the scope of application of machines with <span>steam engines,</span> there is a need for special regulators, which are devices that support the uninterrupted operation of such machines.  It is this fact that gave impetus to the beginning of scientific research in the field of technical control of objects and is known as the "theory of automatic regulation".  In the future, scientists have deduced the main aspects of this doctrine, which can be quite successfully applied in such systems as social and economic.  Therefore, the original name was replaced by a term of wide meaning - "Theory of automatic control." </p><p>  The next step in this field of research is the process of introducing into the control system (SU) and regulating the automation devices of some electronic elements and telemechanics.  This fact contributed to the emergence of fairly accurate guidance and tracking systems, telemetry and telecontrol, automatic correction and control.  The 20th century (50th year) is famous for the creation of automatic control systems for industrial complexes and production processes using electronic computers. </p><p>  Managing any object implies influencing it to achieve a goal determined by a specific process or condition.  In the form of <span>a control object</span> (OS), an electric motor, any machine or aircraft can be adopted.  The use of technical means without involving a person in the <span>management process</span> is called automatic.  In turn, the automatic control system (ACS) is formed on the basis of the combination of automatic control and OS. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fundamentals of the <span>theory of automatic control</span> involve maintaining the laws of change of certain physical quantities that characterize the processes occurring in the OS, without human intervention.  Such quantities are called ‚Äúcontrolled quantities‚Äù.  In this class of systems, automatic control systems can be seen.  Their task is to establish at a constant level the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the controlled quantity.  It is also necessary to achieve changes of the same value within a given program.  For example, when considering a baking oven as a control object and as a controlled quantity, the temperature will change, changing its values ‚Äã‚Äãaccording to a certain program, based on the requirements of the process. </p><p>  In further studies, the goal of management was directly related to a set of quality indicators that gave a complete description of the system.  In turn, these indicators began to be required to achieve their lowest or highest (limit) values.  It is for this that self-adaptive or adaptive systems have been created. </p><p>  The theory of automatic control helps to improve the functioning of the object, which should be controlled by a special system.  Often, auxiliary operations such as starting, monitoring, stopping, and commissioning can also be automated.  In itself, self-propelled guns must function as part of a specific production complex. </p><p>  <span>The theory of automatic control</span> considers such classifications of control systems as: </p><p>  - <span>purpose of management</span> ; </p><p>  - type of control loop; </p><p>  - a method of transmitting signals. </p><p>  The theory of automatic control should study the laws of the processes that occur during the construction of self-propelled guns, investigate the design features of the control object, taking into account the conditions of its operation, to build high-quality, accurate and efficient control systems. </p>
