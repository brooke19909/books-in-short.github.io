Seven Wise Men of Ancient Greece</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Wisdom and erudition have always been highly regarded in almost all social systems.  Moreover, not only possession of knowledge was considered a priority, but the ability to put it into practice at the right time.  That is what was called wisdom.  The cradle of European culture is considered to be Hellas.  In this regard, it is not at all surprising that it is the sages of Ancient Greece who are considered the first to shed light of knowledge on the then dark peoples of the Old World.  It is they who are attributed to the systematization of the experience accumulated by mankind until then and its implementation on the example of their own life. </p><p>  Since ancient times, people have tried to highlight the most prominent representatives of humanity.  Back in antiquity, seven sages of Ancient Greece were named, individuals who, according to the Hellenes, possessed the greatest reserve of knowledge.  This number was not chosen by chance.  The number "seven" had a sacred and religious meaning.  But if the number of geniuses remained unchanged, then their names changed depending on the time and place of compiling the list.  Several options have survived to this day, in which the sages of ancient Greece appear. </p><h2>  Plato List </h2><p>  According to legend, seven sages from Ancient Greece were named by name in Athens during the archon Damascia in 582 BC.  e.  The very first and most famous list that has survived to this day was left in the IV century BC.  e.  the great philosopher Plato in his dialogue Protagoras.  Who was included in this list, and what made the seven wise men of Ancient Greece famous? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Thales of Miletus (640 - 546 BC) </h2>

    <p>  Thales was one of the first ancient philosophers and the founder of the so-called Ionian school.  He was born in the city of Miletus, located in <span>Asia Minor,</span> in the territory of modern Turkey, from where he got his nickname.  In addition to philosophy, he achieved special knowledge in astronomy and geometry, thanks to the study of the heritage of the Egyptians and scientists of Mesopotamia.  The division of the calendar year into 365 days is attributed to him.  Unfortunately, all the thoughts and sayings of Thales of Miletus came to us only through the works of later philosophers. </p><h2>  Solon of Athens (640 - 559 BC) </h2>

    <p>  Solon is a famous Athenian philosopher, poet and legislator.  According to legend, came from the royal family of Codrid, but, despite this, his parents were people with little income.  Then Solon was able to get rich, and then became the most influential political figure in Athens.  It is he who is considered the creator of democratic laws, which have remained unchanged in this city for several centuries.  Towards the end of his life, he voluntarily stepped down from power.  Also very highly Solon was valued by contemporaries as a poet and thinker.  To the question of the <span>Lydian king</span> Croesus, does Solon know anyone happier than him, the Athenian philosopher replied that this can only be judged after the death of a person. <br><br></p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Biant Priensky (590 - 530 BC) </h2>

    <p>  Biant is probably a more mysterious figure than the other sages of ancient Greece.  Very little is known about his life.  He was a judge in the city of Priene, where he became famous for his wise decisions, and once even saved his hometown from the Lydian king Alliate.  But when the Persian ruler Cyrus conquered his homeland, Biantu had to leave the settlement without taking anything with him. </p><h2>  Pittak Mitilensky (651 - 569 BC) </h2>

    <p>  Kleobul, according to one version, came from the city of Linda, in Rhodes, and the second, from Caria in Asia Minor.  His father was Evagor, who was considered a descendant of Heracles himself.  He earned fame as a wise ruler and urban planner, erected a temple in Linda and built a water supply.  In addition, Cleobulus became famous as the author of songs and ingenious puzzles.  His daughter Kleobulin was also once considered one of the most enlightened philosophers. </p><h2>  Mison of Hyun (VI century BC) </h2><p>  Mison, despite the fact that his father was a ruler in Hens or in Itia, chose for himself a quiet and contemplative life of a philosopher, far from worldly fuss.  Most famous as the author of great sayings, some of which were worthy to be <span>among the 7</span> sayings of the sages of ancient Greece.  Some experts believe that Plato was included in the list of the wisest people for political reasons. </p><h2>  Chilo of Sparta (VI century BC) </h2>

    <p>  Chilo is a famous Spartan poet and legislator.  He held the post of efor.  In his post, he promoted the introduction of many progressive laws, which were later attributed to Lycurgus.  The speech of Chilo, according to contemporaries, was full of deep meaning, but differed in laconicism, a characteristic feature of most Spartans.  It is he who is attributed the dictum that dead people are not spoken badly. </p><h2>  List of Diogenes Laertes </h2><p>  In addition to the list of Plato, the most famous is the list, which includes the seven wise men of Ancient Greece, an outstanding philosopher of philosophy <span>Diogenes Laertius,</span> who lived supposedly in the late II-early III century.  AD  The only difference between this list and the previous one is that instead of Mison, the Corinthian tyrant Periander is included in it.  Some scholars consider this list to be the initial one, despite the fact that Diogenes lived much later than Plato.  This paradox is explained by the fact that the latter, due to his rejection of tyranny, could have deleted Periander from the list and included the lesser-known Mison.  Diogenes in his work used a more ancient source. </p><p>  The names of all the other sages in both lists are completely identical. </p><h2>  Periander of Corinth (667 - 585 BC) </h2>

    <p>  Periander, the ruler of Corinth, is probably the most controversial figure of all 7 sages of ancient Greece.  On the one hand, he was distinguished by an amazing mind, was a great inventor and builder, who modernized the drag through the isthmus, separating the <span>Peloponnesian Peninsula</span> from the mainland, and then began to build a canal through it.  In addition, Periander patronized art, and also significantly strengthened the army, which allowed Corinth to rise as never before.  But on the other hand, historians characterize him as a typical cruel tyrant, especially in the second half of the reign. </p><p>  According to legend, Periander died from the fact that he could not bear the death of his son, to which he himself was doomed. </p><h2>  Other listings </h2><p>  In the lists of other authors, only the names of Thales, Solon, Biant and Pittak remain unchanged.  The personalities of the other sages can vary and differ significantly from the two classic versions. </p><p>  Akusilai (VI century BC) is a Hellenic historian who lived even before Herodotus.  By origin Dorian.  Tradition ascribes it to him the first historical work written in prose. </p><p>  Anaxagoras (500 - 428 BC) is a philosopher and famous mathematician from Asia Minor.  Also practiced astronomy.  He tried to explain the <span>structure of the universe.</span> </p><p>  Anaharsis (605 - 545 BC) - Scythian sage.  He was personally acquainted with Solon and the Lydian king Croesus.  He is credited with the invention of the anchor, sail and potter's wheel.  In addition, Anaharsis is known for its valuable sayings.  He was killed by the Scythians for adopting Hellenic customs.  The reality of its existence is called into question by many scientists. </p><p>  Pythagoras (570 - 490 BC) is a famous ancient Greek philosopher and geometer.  It is he who is credited with the famous theorem on the equality of angles in a right triangle.  In addition, he is the founder of a philosophical school, later adopted the name Pythagoreanism.  He died in old age with his own death. </p><p>  In addition, among those who were recorded in the sages of Ancient Greece, one can name the names of Forekides, Aristodem, Lin, Efor, Las, Epimenides, Leofant, Pamphilos, Epicharmus, Pisistratus and Orpheus. </p><h2>  Listing Principles </h2><p>  It can be concluded that the Hellenes included representatives of the most diverse kinds of activity in the list of the wisest people, but most often they were philosophers.  Although, in fact, they could combine this subject with another important occupation - the study of mathematics, astronomy, natural science, and government.  However, almost all the sciences of that time were inextricably linked with philosophy. </p><p>  These lists could vary significantly and differ from the two so-called classic versions.  In many ways, the specific names included in them depended on the residence and political views of the originator.  So, Plato, apparently, for these reasons excluded from the great sages of the Corinthian tyrant Periander. </p><p>  The Greeks were not always present on the lists of great thinkers.  Representatives of other nations, such as the Hellenized Scythian Anaharsis, were sometimes included there. </p><h2>  The Importance of Themes Today </h2><p>  Of course, the Greek attempt to single out the most prominent representatives from their number and systematize them is one of the first of its kind in the Ancient World.  By studying this list, we can judge what personal qualities were considered the most significant in the ancient world and were associated with wisdom.  It is important to get acquainted with these representations of the Hellenes in order to be able to look through the eyes of a modern person on the evolution of this concept for many centuries. </p><p>  In Russia, to study this aspect in the school course, a separate topic has been highlighted - ‚ÄúThe Sages of Ancient Greece‚Äù.  Grade 5 is the optimal learning period for perceiving such fundamental questions. </p>
