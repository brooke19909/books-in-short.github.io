These are knitted shoes, designed not only to warm the legs of the child, but also to serve as one of the parts of the general ensemble of clothes.  Yarn for knitting such things is chosen according to the season.  You can knit the finest summer items or warm wool for the winter. </p><p>  In the article, we consider several options for knitting baby booties for babies.  We will tell novice masters how to measure the number of loops for knitting on needles, which knit is best used for the sole and the main knit, how to decorate and select the style of products for girls and boys. </p><h2>  Types of baby booties </h2><p>  Nowadays, the variety of shoes for babies has increased significantly.  Masters try to give products similarity with adult models.  For very tiny children, delicate lace-up shoes with ties with pompons or tassels are made.  In winter, high boots or boots will warm your legs better.  It is more convenient for a child who is already learning to walk independently to move in knitted shoes.  Little mods will love to flaunt in booties, similar to sports sneakers or sneakers.  Girls can associate baby booties with a jumper, such as sandals or pointe shoes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted boots" class="if uuid-2568650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2568650.jpg"></div><p>  Such products are also divided into colors.  Most often, boys knit blue, blue or green booties.  Girls pick up yarn of red, pink, purple tones.  There are universal products that will suit both floors - both in color and in style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Necessary materials for knitting </h2><p>  Before you begin, consider what is the best way to pick up the threads.  They should not be prickly and synthetic completely, so as not to cause discomfort in the baby or allergic reactions.  The size of the needles is also selected for the type of yarn.  It is better to use steel, made of stainless steel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ravelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit booties" class="if uuid-2571451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2571451.jpg"></div><p>  A gypsy needle with a wide eye or a hook is useful for stitching, depending on which seam will be made.  Also think over the color gamut of the threads; you can use the other color to highlight the sole area or the hem on the top.  To take measurements you will need a flexible meter, a ruler.  For calculations - pencil and paper.  If you will decorate booties with additional materials, then you need to prepare them in advance too - buttons and ribbons, piping or pompons, beads or plastic insects. </p><h2>  How to calculate loops </h2><p>  Before any knitting, the master knits a sample for elastic and basic knitting baby booties.  They collect 20 loops + edging on the knitting needles, knit 5-6 cm of the canvas.  Then the sample should be stretched in warm water, dried and ironed.  Then, a ruler is attached to the sample and they look at how many centimeters it turned out to be connected with this pattern to this number of loops.  For example, the measurement is 10 cm. Then 20 loops need to be divided by 10 cm. It turns out that there are 2 loops in each centimeter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then we measure the baby‚Äôs leg with a flexible centimeter.  You can measure the insole of the shoes.  For example, the measure is 9 cm. We calculate the number of loops necessary for a set: 9 cm x 2 loops = 18 loops (+ 2 edge).  The received amount is 20 loops. </p><h2>  Simple boot style </h2><p>  Next, consider how to knit baby booties with knitting needles for beginners.  Take the easiest option for making crafts on the pattern.  For the sole, you need to connect a rectangle whose length is equal to the size of the foot, and the short side corresponds to the width of the sole in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe toes, that is, in the widest place.  Next, you need to attach a flexible meter to the nail of the big toe and wrap it around the heel, returning already to the little finger.  This will be the top of baby booties.  The width of the knitted strip for the second part is taken after measuring the distance from the sole to the bone on the foot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="booties for babies on a pattern" class="if uuid-2568601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2568601.jpg"></div><p>  The photo shows that after knitting, both parts are sewn together in the central part, then the sides are overlapped with an overlap in the front and the loop is sewn with a thread into a loop around the entire circumference of the shoe.  In the center of the overlap, you can attach bright buttons or sew a pompom. </p><h2>  High boots </h2><p>  How to knit baby booties with knitting needles?  Very simple.  We begin the detailed explanation with a set of loops.  As described above, you need to find out how many loops are typed for 1 cm of knitting.  In our measurements, we got 2 loops per 1 cm. The baby‚Äôs foot is, for example, 9 cm long. In this version of knitting, they immediately double the size, that is, you need to knit 18 cm. Most often, a garter stitch is chosen for the sole.  Loops are drawn on the knitting needle after the following calculations: 18 cm x 2 loops + 2 hem = 38 loops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingmatters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted booties" class="if uuid-2571447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2571447.jpg"></div><p>  After a set of loops, you need to tie half the width of the foot.  For example, if it is 4 cm, then only 2 cm is knitted. This will be the sole of the booties. </p><h2>  The bulk of the work </h2><p>  The next step in knitting is raising the height of the boot.  Some continue to knit with a garter stitch, as in the sample in the photo, others use a 1x1 elastic or any other pattern.  Knit 4-6 rows in height. </p><p>  The main difficulty for beginners in baby booties is a sock.  First you need to divide the number of loops in half and mark the middle of the knitting with a colored thread so as not to get confused.  Then count 4 loops in one direction and the same number in the other.  We find the central 8 loops and continue knitting only these elements.  In our sample, the sock is made facial.  In each knitted row of sock, the last, eighth loop is knitted together with one of the side loops.  Thus, the length of the booties is tied from the end of the fingers to the raising of the leg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew up the sole" class="if uuid-2568678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2568678.jpg"></div><p>  When the desired size is reached, continues knitting all the loops typed on the knitting needles.  For the style we have chosen - a height of 8 cm with a 2x2 rubber band.  Then the loops close.  The last action in the work will be stitching along the center line.  The seam must be made beautiful, since when the upper part of the booties is bent, the back of the knit will also be visible.  Begin sewing from above, lead to the heel and further along the center line of the sole.  All that remains is to pull in a rope for tying a contrasting color. </p><h2>  Booties sandals </h2><p>  If you want a child to tie booties with a jumper, like summer sandals, then the work is much simpler than the previous option.  The loop set is calculated in the same way.  After tying the soles and raising the height of the shoes begin to turn the front of the toe.  In sandals, this part is short, so all 4-6 rows are knitted.  It all depends on the thickness of the yarn.  Then one row is performed along the entire length of the knitting and the loops are closed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="booties sandals" class="if uuid-2568684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2568684.jpg"></div><p>  You can immediately make the center seam.  When the ballet is completely ready, begin to knit the jumper.  For this, after trying on the foot of the product and thinking over the location of the strip in the right place, the main thread is tied.  Then, from already closed loops, a set of 3-4 loops is made and a thin strip is knitted that will reach the opposite side of the shoe, plus an additional 2 cm for sewing buttons. </p><p>  At the end, the hinges close and a decorative element is attached.  It can be a button or pompom, crocheted flower or a simple satin ribbon bow.  Such baby booties, knitted with needles, are, of course, more suitable for girls. </p><h2>  Pointe shoes for girls </h2><p>  The next version of booties will also appeal to girls' parents more.  The method of knitting the main part of the product is similar to that described above.  The difference is in the additional elements.  This is a jumper, and not one, but two whole, and made crosswise.  Let's look at how to create such beauty with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pointe shoes - booties" class="if uuid-2568672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2568672.jpg"></div><p>  How to tie baby booties, you already know.  Before closing the loops in a circle, you need to leave the same number for the fasteners at the beginning and at the end of the loops located on the knitting needles.  In our case, 6 loops on each side.  After measuring the required length of the strips with a flexible meter, you need to get the right amount with air loops, and after knitting 4 rows of garter stitches, close the loop.  When the main seams are made, buttons are sewn on both sides.  The tied strips are laid out crosswise and fastened on buttons made of thread loops.  These booties look very feminine and gentle on girls.  Little ballerinas will be comfortable in them moving around the room. </p><h2>  Four-knitting </h2><p>  If you have learned to knit baby booties for beginners, then you can easily cope with knitting shoes for babies on four knitting needles.  It‚Äôs best to use a checkbook to draw a diagram of the sole.  Some beginners knit simple rectangles, but the corners of the lower part of the work will be ugly in the finished product, therefore, having drawn the number of loops in width and length on the notebook sheet, it is necessary to remove two loops in the heel area in the last and penultimate row.  Then the rounding on the heel will have a slight decrease.  From the middle of the foot in the drawing, add 1 loop at the beginning and end of the row.  Thus, they knit until the last 4 rows remain.  They cut the loop, 2 in each row, making the reduction of the sock. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="4-point booties" class="if uuid-2568624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2568624.jpg"></div><p>  Further actions are similar to the previous options, the height of the product also rises and the sock is tied.  The upper edge is double viscous.  To make it easier to insert a rope to tie a bow. </p><p>  The article provides several simple options for knitting baby booties with a description of the work performed step by step.  If you have basic knitting skills, then with such a simple task you will cope quickly. </p>
