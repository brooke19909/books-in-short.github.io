    <h2>  What else do tourists say? </h2><p>  As it was already possible to verify, the complex Katya ex Krizantem Katya Hotel 5 *, the photo of which is provided in the article, causes the vast majority of vacationers to have extremely positive emotions.  This is not surprising given its status and rating. </p><p>  What else can people who have been here say something interesting?  Perhaps the most valuable information concerns the direction of the hotel.  Tourists say: this is a traditional Turkish hotel, aimed at youth and family vacations.  People with children, elderly couples and tourists of a young age will like it here.  But lovers of nightly entertainment are advised to look for another hotel.  Even Obagel itself is a quiet place.  Of course, the center of Alanya is not far away, but few people are tempted by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtraveling for entertainment to a neighboring village. </p><p>  But there is animation in the hotel.  Moreover, in several languages, including Russian.  Energetic animation staff entertain guests from morning to night, so no one is bored.  Evening programs end at about eleven o‚Äôclock in the evening, so nothing rests on a relaxing vacation and peaceful sleep.  However, the apartments have excellent sound insulation, so you can just close the door to the balcony, turn on the air conditioning and enjoy the silence. </p><p>  By the way, about the rooms.  People who have been at the hotel recommend reserving apartments located on the south side.  Their balconies offer amazing sea views.  In general, these numbers are few.  Many more have windows overlooking a neighboring hotel or territory.  By the way, lovers of silence are advised to book apartments on the sixth floor of the main building.  There, according to reviews, excellent insulation. </p><p>  And yet, in the midst of the summer season, it is better to come directly to the time when guests begin to populate.  Check in at this hotel from 14:00.  Therefore, it is advisable to select the appropriate flight.  This hotel complex is very popular, so in summer there are practically no available rooms.  Guests leave the apartment before 12:00, but for another two hours the room is preparing to move the next tourists. </p><p>  In conclusion, it is worth saying that this is a wonderful hotel for people who value high-class service and comfort.  If you want to spend your vacation in a decent place, then you can safely make a choice in favor of Katya Hotel 5 *.  Surely it‚Äôs not necessary to regret it.  And numerous positive reviews are a direct confirmation of this. </p>
