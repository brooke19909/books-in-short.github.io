The recreation center "Drivyaty", which is located in this area, invites guests to its cozy guest houses all year round.  These places offer a great opportunity to relax from the daily bustle.  Fascinating nature, clean air, full fishing and swimming in the lake - all this awaits the guests of the ‚ÄúDrivyaty‚Äù complex.  <span>The recreation center</span> has many other advantages that help spend an unforgettable vacation. </p><h2>  Description of the terrain and its ecosystem </h2><p>  This fabulous place is located in the Vitebsk region.  It is here that Lake Drivyaty is located, which is one of the largest water bodies in the country.  The wealth of this area is a unique aquatic ecosystem.  Also around the lake there is a wide variety of flora and fauna.  The native flora has more than 800 individual species.  Among them are those listed in the International Red Book. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Drivyat recreation center" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1178399.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The variety of local animals is also amazing.  About 40 different species of fish live in the local water bodies, so lovers of fishing with fishing rods will be able to ‚Äúhunt‚Äù from the heart.  Walking through the picturesque nature, vacationers notice how many feathered singers are here.  Indeed, it was estimated that approximately 35% of the country's birds select this territory for nesting.  A rare species is the mute swan, which was recently on the verge of extinction.  Today it can be met by arriving at the "Drivyat".  The recreation center attracts many people because vacationers have every chance to see flying squirrels, badgers, roe deer, moose and other wild animals.  Also in these forests live bears, lynxes, wild boars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Swimming in the lake, you can see its incredible purity.  It is important to note that the local air is shrouded in the aroma of resins and trees, which exudes a forest located in the southern part of the park.  Their area reaches approximately 31,000 ha.  Among them are more common spruce.
