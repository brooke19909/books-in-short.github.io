Expectant mothers are trying to get all the best for him before the birth of a child: clothes, toys.  But if you do not consider it necessary to spend large sums on outfits, which in a few months may be small, then creating clothes for newborns with your own hands will be a great way out. </p><h2>  Bouquet for newborns </h2><p>  If one of your friends or relatives expects to be added to the family, and you do not know what gift to present to your young mother, approach the matter with imagination.  Make a bouquet of clothes for newborns with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vtemu.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bouquet of clothes" class="if uuid-3076448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3076448.jpg"></div><p>  Small children's things are perfectly suited to make beautiful compositions from them, for example, in the form of flowers.  Everything will work: socks, linen diapers, mittens, hats or romper suits.  The actions are completely simple: </p><ul><li>  we lay out every thing on any surface so that there are no folds and bent corners; </li><li>  give the shape of a tube or roll; </li><li>  we fix the corners; </li><li>  tightly connect all parts of the composition into a bouquet. </li></ul><p>  When composing a bouquet, you can use thin ribbons or wire so that the conceived composition does not crumble and hold until the child‚Äôs parents untie it.  For beauty, you can complement the work with fresh flowers or, say, sweets in a shiny, beautiful wrapper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When composing a bouquet, you can not be limited to the classical form.  Try to follow the example of florists and make a bouquet of things that resembles a bear, a hare or a dog.  We are sure that such a wonderful gift will please not only you, but also the parents of the child. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="bouquet for newborns" class="if uuid-3076446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3076446.jpg"></div><h2>  The choice of material for sewing </h2><p>  Sewing clothes for newborns with their own hands requires certain knowledge.  In order for things to last long, to be of high quality and convenient, it is worth paying special attention to the choice of material from which the thing will be made.  There are a number of requirements. </p><p>  First, you need to pay attention to the material itself.  It is best to choose fabrics based on natural fibers.  These include linen, flannel, cotton and knitwear.  The content of synthetic fibers should be minimal, not more than 5%, since the sensitive skin of the baby will sweat in synthetic tissues and irritation may appear. </p><p>  Secondly, take into account the hygienic characteristics of the material, as well as the gender of the child and the season for which clothes will be made.  For the summer period, it is important to choose light fabrics like flannel.  In the cold season, you can do with cotton or linen. </p><p>  When choosing material for sewing clothes for newborns with their own hands, it is better to take fabrics of light or white shades.  Brightly colored canvases contain many dyes, can fade or provoke an allergy in the baby over time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Useful tips for needlewomen </h2><p>  Before you get acquainted with the instructions on how to sew clothes for newborns with your own hands, and start developing models, think about the difficulties that you may encounter in the process.  Here are some suggestions: </p><ul><li>  Make a list of what clothes you want and can make yourself, and what you have to buy in the store. </li><li>  Estimate the size.  Babies are very mobile and do not sew end-to-end, create free models. </li><li>  You should not plan many things of a similar style.  Children grow quickly and in a few months the thing you have developed will lose its relevance. </li><li>  Consider the details.  For example, it is better to use buttons as fixing elements.  They are easier to fasten than buttons, and they cannot hurt like locks and fasteners. </li><li>  Model clothes so that the seams are on the outside.  So they will not rub the baby‚Äôs delicate skin. </li><li>  Practice models with cuffs.  This will significantly add to the wear time of the product.  If you bend the cuffs on the sleeves or pants, the thing will increase by a whole size. </li></ul><p>  And, of course, if we sew clothes for newborns with our own hands, this does not mean that only a needle and thread are required for work.  Whenever possible, use good sewing equipment to get quality products as a result. </p><h2>  Sew the undershirt </h2><p>  To calculate patterns and sew clothes for newborns with your own hands does not entail any difficulties.  Better to start with an ordinary vest. </p><p>  To build a pattern for the undershirt, you need to know approximately the length and width of the sleeve, the undershirt itself and the depth of the neck.  The body size of all infants is approximately the same, so the pattern can be calculated according to general data: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  product length - 25 cm; </li><li>  width - 26 cm; </li><li>  neck depth - 13 cm; </li><li>  height from the bottom edge to the sleeve - 13 cm; </li><li>  armpit sleeve width - 12 cm; </li><li>  the swing of the vest with sleeves - 55 cm; </li><li>  sleeve width - 8 cm. </li></ul><p>  Before you start cutting, the material from which you plan to sew the undershirt must be washed and ironed.  This will provide shrinkage of the fabric and will not spoil the item at the first wash.  Then transfer these patterns to the fabric, having previously folded it in half.  The back part is cut out entirely, and the front halves - separately.  After cut them and sew on the outside, seams out.  Iron.  The vest is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="domosedkam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vest pattern" class="if uuid-3076440" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3076440.jpg"></div><h2>  Overalls for the newborn </h2><p>  Clothing for newborns is more diverse than it seems at first glance.  If the baby's undershirts are useful for home use, then for walking you will definitely need a jumpsuit.  <span>Patterns of clothes for newborns</span> with their own hands will not require much time and are built according to classical data: </p><ul><li>  shoulder length - 6 cm; </li><li>  leg width - 8 cm; </li><li>  product length - 38 cm; </li><li>  height from neck to armhole - 27 cm. </li></ul><p>  Data may vary.  After construction, transfer the pattern to the fabric using a piece of chalk or soap.  The material must be folded in half with the front side, placing the shared thread along the product.  The fabric needs to be washed and ironed in advance, this will save from shrinkage after the first washing of the finished product.  When cutting out a thing, do not forget to leave a few centimeters for seams and allowances, otherwise the overalls will be small, and you will waste time in vain.  After flashing all the parts, it remains to attach the buttons.  The jumpsuit is ready.  Depending on the season, you can choose the fabric for the season. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ladyspecial.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="overalls pattern" class="if uuid-3076463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3076463.jpg"></div><h2>  Body and sliders </h2><p>  According to the same data, almost all patterns of clothes for newborns are built.  With your own hands, you can create such comfortable things as body and romper on the basis of the undershirt or overalls.  The body is the same jumpsuit, only without sleeves and long legs.  Its only difference is that the fasteners are located between the legs of the child, thereby simplifying the removal of clothes.  Sliders are a type of jumpsuit with pants fully closed, but with open hands.  Basically, these things are needed for children who are just starting to crawl and can scratch their legs. </p><h2>  Booties and mittens </h2><p>  Such small details of a children's wardrobe as booties and mittens can also be done by yourself.  For booties, you just need to measure the length of the children's foot and its height from the sole to the ankle around the entire perimeter.  Both sizes translate to paper.  First, an oval is drawn, equal in length to the foot of the child, and the width adopted conditionally for the newborn is about 5 cm. Then draw a rectangle, the long side of which is equal to the circumference of the oval, and the short side is the height to the ankle.  Ready patterns are transferred to the fabric, cut out and sewn together from the inside. </p><p>  Mittens, which must be worn by infants so that they do not scratch their faces, are easier to sew.  Measure the shape of the baby palm and fix it on paper.  Then transfer the pattern to the fabric, cut two halves.  Sew.  Attach the buttons to secure the mittens to the children's wrist.  Done. </p><h2>  Envelope cocoon </h2><p>  If you are preparing an envelope in advance to meet a newborn from the hospital and want to make this event even more solemn and memorable, sew it yourself.  To do this, you will need cotton fabric, insulation, Velcro and zipper.  The scheme is simple.  We make a pattern based on the classic approximate data of the baby.  The shape will resemble a bag.  We transfer the pattern to the fabric, cut out, connect the parts, fasten the Velcro in a place convenient for you, so that you can easily open and close the cocoon.  The resulting baby clothes can be decorated with ribbons, beads or appliqu√©s on any topic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.zipy.co.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="children in knitted envelopes" class="if uuid-3076437" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3076437.jpg"></div><h2>  Tips for lovers of knitting </h2><p>  Not all women like to sew.  There are also many who do not think of their home life without other types of needlework.  Knitted clothes for newborns are as popular as fabric clothes, they are practical and comfortable.  Even has its advantage.  Children grow up quickly, and if a favorite thing has become suddenly small, you can always take a knitting needle or crochet hook and tie the required length.  If you decide to tie something to your baby, consider several factors: </p><ol><li>  Choose the right yarn.  Today on the shelves you can choose the appropriate material of foreign and domestic production.  Preference should be given to natural fibers, without artificial dyes and with a lower content of polyester and acrylic, which can cause irritation on children's delicate skin. </li><li>  If you take the pattern for sewing as a basis, keep in mind that the knitted thing has the ability to stretch, so you need to carefully select the sizes.  For obese children, it is recommended to take a pattern one size larger. </li><li>  If it is already known that the newborn does not tolerate wool, then use viscose or bamboo threads.  They are less aggressive and hold their shape well. </li></ol><p>  Babies do not need things of a complex cut.  But increased attention should be paid to parts of the product.  After you have tied the item, check again that the edges of the neck, sleeves and hem are well fixed, as weak loops can open. </p><p>  Knits are beautiful and practical.  They can go for a walk, go on a visit or attend a social event.  To knit such a thing, you need to stock up on working tools, yarn and have several hours of free time.  Choose a simple design.  The most important thing is convenience and comfort.  It is better to pay attention to interesting types of loops or patch patterns.  Choose a thread that is pleasant to the touch, discreet, preferably light in color, without clogging villi, which can serve as an irritant to the skin. </p><h2>  Clothes for the stronger sex </h2><p>  Making clothes for newborn boys with their own hands is quite simple.  She is much more modest than for girls.  The most common types of products in home production are vests. </p><p>  Classic technologies for creating things for newborn boys and girls are no different.  The difference is given exclusively by the choice of color and accessories. </p><p>  Favorite colors for creating clothes for boys were and still are blue, brown and purple shades.  Parents pick up children from the hospital in exclusively blue envelopes, which at first glance make it possible to understand the gender of the child.  The clothes adhere to the same rule, decorating it mainly with drawings of domestic and wild animals, as well as marine inhabitants or plants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="babydotdot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted booties" class="if uuid-3076452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3076452.jpg"></div><h2>  Clothes for girls </h2><p>  It is much more interesting to make clothes for baby girls with their own hands.  There is where to show your imagination and skills.  Sliders and overalls are decorated with skirts, vests are often made with various ruffles or frills. </p><p>  Colors for clothes are chosen in pink or yellow, decorate clothes with drawings and applications of various colors, fruits, fantastic animals or cartoon characters.  Clothing for girls is strewn with all kinds of rhinestones, embroidered with beads and sparkles. </p><p>  Many mothers and grandmothers who make clothes for newborns with their own hands like to complement sets with beautiful hats and elegant scarves. </p><h2>  Headband </h2><p>  As a rule, newborns do not yet have hair, but parents really want to decorate the baby's head.  In this case, children's headbands come to the rescue, which you can sew with your own hands in less than an hour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abeautifulmess.com" data-author=": Laura Gummerman, "><img itemprop="image" alt="headband" class="if uuid-3076479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3076479.jpg"></div><p>  Measure the circumference of the child‚Äôs head and set aside on the material of your choice.  Remember to leave two centimeters per seam.  Cut a strip of fabric, connect both its ends.  Decorate the product to your liking.  A baby headband is ready. </p>
