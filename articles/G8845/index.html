This is the warmest region of the country, which is located in the south.  From all sides this amazing land is surrounded by the Alps.  By the way, they are the reason that a unique, mild climate has developed here.  But Carinthia is famous not only for comfortable weather.  Austria is an amazing country, more than 1200 picturesque lakes are located here, among them several hundreds with crystal-clear drinking water.  Add to this the beautiful river valleys and mountains, ancient castles and amazing cozy villages, and you will get the best place on earth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="carinthia austria" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1897787.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Paradise for tourists </h2><p>  Indeed, far from everywhere you can find such a variety of entertainments that Carinthia offers its guests.  Austria is famous for creations not only of nature, but also of man, historical and cultural monuments.  The latter are very diverse and interesting, because from ancient times the Celts and Slavs lived here, so it is almost impossible to determine belonging to one or another culture by ancient buildings.  Since 1335, Carinthia became the land of the Habsburgs.  The name itself means "a place where friends live."  It is impossible not to feel the unusually warm and friendly attitude of the indigenous population.  Here you need to visit at least once to appreciate the magnificence of nature and the quality of relaxation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  Before the trip, be sure to make a plan for visiting attractions so as not to get lost from the abundance of offers.  Below we will talk about some of them.  Fortresses and abbeys, monasteries and museums - they will be very interesting to lovers of cultural recreation. </p><p>  When tired of walking around the city, you can pay attention to the natural beauties that Carinthia (Austria) is famous for.  Two national reserves are located here, these are Hoch Tauern and Nockberge.  You can spend the whole day on the territory, there are gorges and waterfalls, glaciers and caves.  Many routes and sightseeing tours allow everyone to choose exactly what he likes.  For lovers of incredibly beautiful landscapes, an alpine panoramic route will become unforgettable.  In Knockberg you can admire the alpine meadows and pastures traditional for these places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in austria" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1897786.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Visit to the capital </h2><p>  The cities are alike, but this does not apply to the city of Klagenfurt.  There are a number of very interesting sights, including museums and monuments, old mansions, fountains.  Favorite entertainment of local residents and visitors is boat riding on local lakes.  Experienced tourists say that if you want to save on excursions, then take the Karnten Card, which will provide a discount on public transport, as well as visits to museums, parks and attractions.  Despite the fact that the city is small, a discount will greatly help to save the budget. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Holidays in the mountains </h2><p>  Visiting Austria and not skiing is unnatural.  Even if you have never climbed the summit in your life and do not know how to ride, experienced instructors will certainly help.  Local ski resorts are ready to offer their guests multi-kilometer ski slopes and over 35 different sports schools.  Rest in the mountains does not boil down to skiing.  Here you can engage in any of the winter sports.  This is ice skating, climbing, and just walking.  To leave the hotel in the morning, look at the snow-white caps of the Alps and breathe in the amazing air - is this not happiness?  Trails for cross-country skiing lovers also deserve attention, they are distinguished by a large length, with smooth turns and an ideal sliding surface. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in the mountains" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1897785.jpg" width="469"></div>

    <h2>  Meltal Glacier </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular ski resorts, which consists of 19 km of simple pistes, 24 km of medium and high difficulty.  Nine lifts work here.  The main season lasts from October to March, but the resort operates year-round.  Natural snow cover reaches 4.5 meters.  In the summer, an artificial snowmaking system works.  Breathe in the cleanest alpine air and admire the stunning views, this will give you the mood for several months ahead. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Rest on the lake </h2><p>  This is entertainment that is suitable for any season.  I must say that there are a lot of lakes, but only one of them is so famous among tourists.  This is a magnificent bowl of bluish-green water, which is located in such an amazing place that it seems as if civilization simply does not dare to disturb its peace.  This is the lake Werther See. </p><p>  It is the largest among all Austrian water bodies, has an elongated shape.  Its length is about 20 km, and its width varies from 1 to 2 km.  But the most important thing is what surrounds him.  Along its shores, mountains and forests reliably shelter.  And because of them the snow-white peaks of the Alps peep out.  Clear water and air made this place extremely popular among tourists.  It should be noted that the area is open for recreation relatively recently.  It used to be a wild place, but after the railway was laid, it turned into a popular resort.  Here you can rent a cozy cottage and ride a boat or bike.  In winter, the lake is usually covered with snow, but it freezes only once every 10 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="carinthia austria attractions" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1897783.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For fishing lovers </h2><p>  If you do not see a vacation without the opportunity to sit with a fishing rod, then Carinthia is waiting for you.  Austria is rich in ponds, and many of them have a variety of fish.  For example, Lake Millstatter See.  This is a unique reservoir with steep banks, the area of ​​which is 13.3 km <sup>2</sup> .  <span>Mirror Lake</span> belongs to the glacial type, as it was formed about 20,000 years ago, just in the ice age.  Trout and perch are found here, you can even get eel.  The lush forest decorates the lake.  It is especially solemn in the fall, when the air becomes especially transparent, ringing from the farewell trills of birds. </p><h2>  Waterfall park </h2><p>  Wasserspielepark Fallbach is the most popular destination for children.  It was created as a park for outdoor enthusiasts.  This is an entertainment center in the wild, where picturesque ponds and mountain waterfalls serve not only as scenery, but also as a place for games and overcoming obstacles.  A huge number of water rides are arranged here.  Each age group has its own place for games, as well as entertaining events.  Exciting water games will delight not only children but also parents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Klagenfurt city" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1897784.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Picturesque gorges </h2><p>  This is another natural miracle that Carinthia (Austria) is ready to share with you.  The sights of these places amaze and delight, it is simply amazing that a tiny corner of our planet has such a treasury.  A local attraction is the picturesque Raggashluht Gorge, created by the Ragga stream.  To tourists can admire its beauty, bridges are built here.  In some places, the gorge is so narrow that the walls almost converge with each other.  At the exit of the gorge, a view of the fantastic waterfall opens. </p><h2>  Magic castles </h2><p>  On the territory of Austria there are a large number of <span>impregnable fortresses,</span> which were built as military and protective structures.  One of them is the Hochosterwitz Castle.  Today, it no longer looks ominous, but rather, on the contrary, resembles a beautiful palace from a fairy tale.  Located on a dolomite peak 160 meters high, it looks like a sentinel, looking at all four sides.  It is visible for almost 30 km. </p><p>  To get to the castle territory, it is necessary to overcome 14 gates, each of which has its own unique bolt mechanism.  Climbing the paved road, you can see them all, touch the ancient walls with your own hands.  By the way, today it is a private property.  But the owners allow tourists to visit separate rooms from April to October.  Here you can see the collections of ancient weapons and armor, consider the paintings.  Tourists note that several hours spent here are remembered for many years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Werther See Lake" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1897782.jpg" width="410"></div>

    <h2>  Falkenstein Castle </h2><p>  A medieval building located in the Harz Mountains.  It is located in the city of the same name, high above the Selk River Valley.  It was built in 1120 and has since changed a lot, but still retains the features of a medieval castle.  The castle was of command importance from the first day of its foundation and was never captured.  It is relatively small and really resembles a watchtower.  Drowning in greenery, with an interesting multi-vaulted roof, Falkenstein is also an interesting object. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Austria has always been considered one of the best places to relax and restore children's health.  This is facilitated by the beautiful nature and very mild <span>climate.</span>  <span>The weather</span> in Austria is very even without sharp drops.
