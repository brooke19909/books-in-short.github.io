Concept, necessary forms and forms, examples of registration</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  By purchasing a banking product, any client, sometimes without knowing it, becomes the owner of an account with which you can carry out income and expense transactions.  At the same time, there must certainly exist some tool that allows any client to exercise control over the movement of their own funds.  This is a bank statement.  This is a document that is usually issued upon request to the client.  However, not everyone knows about this possibility.  Let's fix it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lodestarpam.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank statement" class="if uuid-3199438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3199438.jpg"></div><h2>  Bank statement - what is it? </h2><p>  It is a reference financial document that allows you to track expense and incoming transactions on the account for a certain period.  Using a bank statement, each client can confirm the fact of debiting or crediting funds or, conversely, refute this information.  This document can be obtained on a personal visit to the institution or remotely if the credit institution provides such a service. </p><h2>  What is it for? </h2><p>  The bank statement, as you understand, reflects information not only about the current state of the account, but also about cash flows.  Using this financial statement, it is possible to confirm the crediting or debit of funds, the amount of taxation and more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Bank statement in 1C 8.3 displays information about the write-off and receipt of funds by bank transfer.  Therefore, as a rule, it is used when it comes to financial transactions of an enterprise.  In addition, bank statements in 1C contain information about the current state of the account. </p><p>  When else do you need such certificates?  Bank statement for a visa may be required for those citizens who are planning a trip abroad.  This document allows you to confirm the financial situation and convince the consulate that you do not plan to become an illegal emigrant, but have enough money to pay for your stay in the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bharatgrouponline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank statement" class="if uuid-3199441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3199441.jpg"></div><h2>  Design Examples </h2><p>  I must say that the form of the bank statement is not enshrined in legislative or regulatory acts.  That is why examples of design are often used to understand what is at stake.  However, there is a whole list of points that it must certainly contain: </p><ul><li>  The name of the bank, as well as its details. </li><li>  Information about the client indicating his current account. </li><li>  Date of preparation. </li><li>  Account balances at the beginning and end of the day. </li><li>  All transactions related to debiting or crediting funds. </li></ul><p>  In addition, each financial transaction listed in the statement must contain the following data: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  The date of the. </li><li>  The number of the document used to complete the transaction. </li><li>  Amount. </li></ol><h2>  Required forms and forms </h2><p>  This information is not required by the client, as the bank uses pre-prepared forms and forms to provide relevant information.  All that is required of you is to contact the company office or request the necessary information remotely.  Depending on the method of treatment, you will receive an extract in paper or electronic form, and subsequently you can print it yourself.  Below is a sample that contains standard information. </p><div class="photo" data-original="900igr.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank statements in 1s" class="if uuid-3199435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3199435.jpg"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  A bank statement is a document that is generated daily for companies and entrepreneurs who own current accounts.  However, you need to pick it up yourself when you visit the office.  However, other ways to obtain a bank statement are possible.  It depends on the conditions of the particular institution in which the client is served. </p><p>  As for the certificate for an individual, the institution does not automatically generate it.  Therefore, the client must request this information on their own.  At the same time, you should definitely indicate the period for which you want to receive financial information.  The time it takes to generate the document depends on the conditions of the credit institution where you are served.  The period for preparing a bank statement at a bank can be from several minutes to several business days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  By the way, a similar period is valid in cases where an entrepreneur or legal entity requests information for a period exceeding one cash day. </p><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  A bank statement can have several different types, which depends on the status of the account holder and the type of product that he uses: </p><ol><li>  Bank statement. </li><li>  Deposit account statement. </li><li>  Statement of the loan account. </li><li>  Electronic statement. </li></ol><h2>  On current account </h2><p>  It is formed daily for settlement accounts of individual entrepreneurs or legal entities.  Information is generated automatically.  In this case, the account holder has the right to request an extract for the period of interest to him.  It can be a calendar month, a quarter or more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yourstory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank statement in 1s 8 3" class="if uuid-3199442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3199442.jpg"></div><h2>  Deposit account </h2><p>  It is formed by the bank upon receipt of a corresponding request from the client.  This financial statement contains information on the amount in the account, the amount of accrued interest, as well as on income-bearing transactions.  An example of such an extract is information that is displayed in a savings book.  However, a similar statement can be generated for a client who uses a debit or credit card. </p><h2>  On the loan account </h2><p>  This information may be required for customers who have a bank loan.  Such an extract contains the total amount of funds contributed by the borrower, the amount of payments indicating the principal debt and accrued interest, as well as the remaining debt.  In the case of a credit card, the obligatory payment is also indicated, which must be paid to prevent interest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.outsourcing-pharma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank bank statements" class="if uuid-3199443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3199443.jpg"></div><h2>  Electronic statement </h2><p>  This is an alternative to traditional paper help, which has certain advantages.  For example, such a bank statement may be delivered to a customer‚Äôs email.  Subsequently, he can print it on his own.  In addition, to order such information you do not have to personally contact the bank office.  It is enough to use remote services. </p><h2>  How to get the? </h2><p>  There are many ways to get a bank statement.  We list so that you do not have any questions: </p><ol><li>  Contact the bank office.  This is the most simple and familiar way for most customers.  All that needs to be done is to visit the selected office, contact a specialist, waiting in line, and request an extract from the desired account.  Be prepared to provide a passport.  This method is not suitable for those who have absolutely no extra time for such actions.  In addition, the situation may be complicated by the small number of offices of the bank in which you are served. </li><li>  Terminal.  In this device, most likely, it will not work to form a complete statement.  However, this one can be convenient for customers who need information only about the latest transactions. </li><li>  Personal Area.  Most companies offer their customers remote methods of service.  Convenience lies in the fact that you do not have to personally visit the bank office, spend time on the road and idle in queues.  All you need to do is pre-register in your personal account, and then carry out the order of discharge, indicating the desired period.  In addition, it is possible to set up regular receipt of a bank statement by e-mail.  This will allow you to control your own finances without committing unnecessary actions in the future. </li></ol><h2>  Sberbank </h2><p>  A bank statement at a given financial institution can be obtained in several ways.  The client can personally contact the company office or use the online service to expedite the procedure. </p><p>  In the second case, you need to pre-register using a bank card and mobile phone.  This is necessary in order to gain access to your personal account where you can order an extract.  The client will be able to independently choose a period, receive information in electronic form or print if there is a technical possibility. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.soloincolo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="visa bank statement" class="if uuid-3199444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3199444.jpg"></div><p>  A bank statement for a visa is often requested by citizens who apply to the consulate.  The ability to receive it remotely allows you to somewhat speed up the process, as it does not require personal contact with the office. </p><h2>  How much is? </h2><p>  This is a topical issue for potential customers.  As a rule, banks provide this service for free.  If in any organization they require payment for such a service, this is rather an exception to the rule.  For example, in cases where it is necessary to provide an extract on the official letterhead with a seal.  This statement is generated by a bank employee, and is not printed automatically.  As you know, this entails more time.  Accordingly, for customers the service is provided for a fee. </p><p>  If we are talking about legal entities, slightly different conditions apply.  Whether the bank statement will be paid or free depends on the package of services chosen by the company, as well as on the method of requesting information.  As a rule, accountants use remote channels with EPC.  At the same time, statements are issued in exchange that are equated to paper counterparts and can be used as full-fledged accounting documents. </p><p>  If a financial statement is requested in one copy, the service is provided free of charge.  However, a repeated request for this information may incur a fee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="marketingland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank statement is" class="if uuid-3199445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3199445.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know what a bank statement is, as well as how to request and receive it.  This information may be useful for both private clients and legal entities.  You should know that a bank statement is generated in two copies, of which only one is issued to the client upon request.  The second is stored in the electronic database of a financial institution. </p>
