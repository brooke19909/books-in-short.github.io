Thanks to the achievements of modern technology, they can replace computers for users.  However, there is such a category of customers that prefers the most ordinary ‚Äúdialers‚Äù.  This group of people appreciates in phones not advanced functionality, but, for example, the quality of signal reception.  They don‚Äôt need the super-powerful gadget performance, the main thing is to constantly stay in touch.  And precisely for these purposes, some manufacturers still produce simple push-button devices.  One of these is the Nokia 105 (2017) mobile phone.  Reviews about him will be considered in this article.  We also describe the characteristics of the device, and at the same time we find out if it has features. </p><p>  Comparing this model with smartphones makes no sense, since it is significantly inferior in equipment, but this does not mean at all that the Nokia 105 will not be able to attract the attention of a certain group of customers.  So, what did HMD Global decide to surprise by launching the device running S30 +? </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Before you begin to study the reviews of the Nokia 105 Dual SIM (2017), let's get acquainted with the history of this brand.  The Finnish company began operations in 1896.  In the early stages, she was engaged in the production of paper.  After several decades, an additional direction was launched - rubber products.  Electronics production opened only in the 80s of the last century.  Products began to be in demand, so a separate division was allocated for this direction.  Mobile phones manufactured under the Nokia brand almost immediately became popular.  Owners of such devices consider them legendary.  Surprisingly, some devices still work today.  Finnish products are also very fond of the domestic buyer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="1000logos.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 105 Reviews (2017)" class="if uuid-2258349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2258349.jpg"></div><p>  Unfortunately, the company's activities have not always been very successful.  The recession occurred around 2010.  It was at this time that smartphones began to appear on the mobile device market.  Almost immediately, manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung took the lead.  Their popularity is explained by the fact that they took into account current trends and were able to quickly rebuild.  But the Finnish company missed this point, and its products began to gradually give way to leading positions.  Of course, smartphones on the Windows Phone operating system appeared on the market, but they could not withstand the competition.  It even got to the point that the production of phones in general became unprofitable.  Then it was decided to sell a division of Microsoft.  But this did not save the situation.  Gadgets began to be produced under a different brand, but they were lost in a wide range. </p><p>  In 2016, the right to release phones under the Nokia brand was acquired by HMD.  In order to try to regain its former popularity, in 2017 smartphones on the popular Android OS were released.  The time will tell how successful this decision was, but the fact that the manufacturer does not forget about this category of customers who prefer to use simple push-button phones definitely deserves respect.  Indeed, at the moment there are so few such models that users simply have no choice.  So, let's look at the <span>characteristics of the Nokia 105</span> (2017) and reviews about the model left by real people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="gadgets.ndtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 105 (2017) White" class="if uuid-2258350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2258350.jpg"></div><h2>  The target audience </h2><p>  This phone was designed for a specific audience.  Youth is unlikely to become its potential buyer.  However, there is one caveat.  Those young people who, by the nature of their activity, often find themselves in extreme conditions, will still prefer a simple device that provides a stable signal and a long working life.  Also, Nokia 105 is perfect for connoisseurs of retro tubes.  But still, a large part of the target audience is the elderly.  The fact is that the manufacturer tried to take into account in full such moments that maximize ease of use.  We are talking about convenient keys on the button keyboard, a simple menu, large font.  Many users pay attention to the fact that there is no need to make complex manipulations to make a call, and this is an extremely important criterion for the elderly.  What else is said in the reviews of the owners?  Let's get it right. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handybg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 105 (2017) Black" class="if uuid-2258351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2258351.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance Features </h2><p>  The first thing buyers pay attention to is design.  Of course, you should not expect any frills from a simple handset for calls.  For this reason, not all users were delighted with this model.  ‚ÄúNew - well forgotten old!‚Äù  - It is this phrase that comes to mind when you first see the Nokia 105. The shape of the body of the new device is vaguely reminiscent of the 3310 model, which has become a real legend.  Users believe that, despite the large dimensions (112 √ó 49.5 √ó 14.4 mm), the phone does not look bulky.  The advantages they include low weight.  With such dimensions, the device has a mass of only 73 g. These results were achieved thanks to the plastic case. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsmarena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile button telephone Nokia 105 (2017)" class="if uuid-2258354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2258354.jpg"></div><p>  A wide range of colors is also mentioned in reviews of the Nokia 105 (2017) mobile phone.  Black (black), White (white) and Blue (blue) - the case of this model is designed in such colors.  Polycarbonate, which is used for the main surfaces, caused a pleasant tactile sensation.  Its quality inspires confidence among the owners, which is confirmed by numerous comments.  The assembly is excellent.  When interacting with the phone creaks, crunches, play are completely absent.  Naturally, this pleases the buyer, since it was precisely the high level of reliability that all models of the Finnish brand were distinguished by.  The main thing is that the user does not have to constantly use the cover so that the phone does not get dirty. </p><p>  The most non-marking option is Nokia 105 (2017) Black.  The reviews of this instance say that on the surface of the case, neither fingerprints nor dirt are completely invisible.  By the way, according to most, it is a black phone that looks very interesting and stylish.  An excellent addition is the rubber keyboard.  It will be examined in detail a little later.  Also on the front panel there is a screen.  It is not very large, but pleased with the image quality.  When turned off, the display appears to be much larger, as the manufacturer used fairly wide black frames.  The owners claim that with this model they were able to return to the past and nostalgic. </p><p>  What else is worth highlighting in the appearance?  The connector for connecting the charger is located on the upper end of the case.  This socket has a micro-USB format, which fully complies with modern standards.  In the center of this end, a LED flashlight is displayed.  Also, the developers did not forget about the connector for connecting audio devices.  The usual lock and volume keys on the side ends are not displayed.  Only the company logo flaunts on the back cover. </p><h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  The Nokia 105 (2017) receives most of the positive feedback thanks to its user-friendly keyboard.  It consists of a control panel and a digital unit.  The owners focused on the material.  Rubber keys are quite convenient to use - the finger does not slip when pressed, the stroke is clear.  The control panel, which is located immediately below the screen, displays three large buttons.  Two of them, located on the sides, are designed for two positions.  The one on the left side is used to unlock (top) and receive a call (bottom).  In the center there is a joystick.  He works on five positions: "OK", right, up, left, down.  To the right of it is a button with which you can end the call (lower part) and go back, being in the menu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techpinas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Keyboard Nokia 105 (2017)" class="if uuid-2258375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2258375.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Now we‚Äôll look at the characteristics of the phone, and also find out how they were rated by users in the reviews.  Nokia 105 DS (2017) - modification, which is equipped with two slots for SIM cards.  Also available with one.  An indisputable advantage is considered to be a small but color screen.  Its diagonal is 1.8 ∫.  The device is able to work only with 2G networks.  It is based on the S30 +.  It has three games installed: Crossy Road, Snake Xenzia and Doodle Jump, so you won‚Äôt be bored.  Given that the cost of this model is only about 900 rubles, it is not equipped with a camera.  Of course, at present this is a significant minus.  Music lovers can listen to their favorite tracks by turning on the FM radio.  It works only with headphones that act as antennas. </p><p>  What is important for simple ‚Äúdialers‚Äù, the phone has a phone book.  It can store up to 2000 contacts.  There is also enough memory for 500 messages. </p><h2>  Let's talk a little about the possibilities </h2><p>  Reviews of Nokia 105 (2017) say that you don‚Äôt have to rely on great functionality.  The device runs on a fairly simple "OS".  All that will be provided to the user is a phone book, storage for messages, a radio, an organizer and, of course, a flashlight.  Unfortunately, you cannot put a specific ringtone on each subscriber, but you can select it using a personal picture.  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that the organizer has all the necessary applications.  Especially users identified the following: alarm clock, calculator, stopwatch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techpinas.com" data-author=": Mr. Ramesh Bakotra, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 105 (2017) Blue" class="if uuid-2258355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2258355.jpg"></div><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  If you believe the reviews about Nokia 105 (2017), then its strongest side is the quality of communication.  This is the criterion for most buyers to become decisive.  Even with the fact that the device works only with the 2G standard, it catches a network in those places where modern smartphones are powerless. </p><p>  Unfortunately, if the signal reception of the device is very good, then there may be problems with voice transmission.  In reviews, often users say that during the conversation the interlocutor is hard to hear.  But for him, on the contrary, speech will sound clearly, loudly and legibly. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  What reviews about Nokia 105 (2017) sounded about autonomy?  It is worth noting that the company was on top in this matter.  The ability to stay in touch for a long time is the indisputable advantage of all models of Finnish production. </p><p>  The battery at 800 mAh is responsible for autonomous work.  The battery is made using lithium-ion technology.  Allows you to use the phone for about a month in standby mode.  One charge is enough for 15 hours of talk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cgtrader.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Model of the Finnish manufacturer Nokia 105 (2017)" class="if uuid-2258356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2258356.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  So, users in the reviews of Nokia 105 (2017) are called a regular phone for calls.  It is made in a classic design.  The owners say that for 900 rubles.  it has practically no shortcomings.  But they include the significant advantages of the battery life on a single charge and the quality of communication.  What else is needed for a simple phone ?! </p>
