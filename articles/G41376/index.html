Why do Russians prefer to endure a many-hour flight and spend time on a visa when the same benefits can be obtained without leaving the territory of their native country?  Often, relaxing in a four-star hotel in <span>Egypt or Turkey,</span> such as Hotel Golden Beach 4 *, is much cheaper than a ticket to a small cottage on the coast of Sochi or Anapa.  The Russians prefer to go to countries with excellent, but inexpensive service - these are Thailand, Turkey, Greece and Crete, Egypt, the UAE. </p><h2>  Top 5 countries to relax </h2><p>  Southeast Asia is explored by tourists who are not afraid of long flights and exploring a new culture.  Thailand is an exotic country where residents of Russia, the USA and China fly in during the winter holidays, so you will have to take care of booking a room in advance.  The capital, Bangkok, is usually less interested in travelers than resorts located on sandy beaches washed by the warm waters of the Indian Ocean.  In Thailand, every tourist will feel like a welcome guest: smiling Thais will gladly share the history of their country and offer national dishes and exotic fruits at the lowest price. </p>

    <p>  Families with children or youth go to Turkey to rest with all the noisy company.  A huge number of nightclubs and other entertainment venues await visitors in Bodrum, while Antalya with open arms awaits lovers of the urban type of relaxation.  Tourists come to Turkey not only to get a beautiful tan, but also in order to buy inexpensive gold jewelry.  Shells and corals, unfortunately, are not allowed to be transported to the airport, since seafood is considered the property of the republic. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mediterranean countries attract tourists with their unique culture and warm climate.  In Greece, ancient art was born over several hundred years, and travelers will be able to see firsthand the ancient temples and other colossal buildings.  Service in Crete will certainly please lovers of relaxation with comfort - Golden Beach Hotel Hersonissos 4 *, which is located in the north of the island, will be the best choice for single travelers or families with children. </p><p>  To fly to the United Arab Emirates from Moscow is a little longer than to Turkey or Egypt, but for patience this country will reward tourists with a varied vacation.  In luxury hotels, visitors can instantly feel like shahs and princes.  A fascinating desert safari and helicopter flying over the capital are just a small fraction of the adventures that Russians are waiting for upon arrival in the UAE. </p><p>  Egypt attracts tourists from all over the world with its beauties.  The passion for studying the ancient artifacts and tombs of the pharaohs began more than a hundred years ago and continues to this day, and travelers stay in the best hotels such as Calimera Golden Beach Hotel 4 * not only for beach activities, but also to devote themselves to studying the history of this extraordinary country . </p><h2>  Egypt or Tunisia? </h2><p>  Russians rarely prefer African countries to relax - tropical heat, insects and fever attract archaeologists rather than prosperous Europeans.  There are two states in the north of the continent, in which thousands of tourists with different levels of income each year rest - Egypt and Tunisia.  Russians, who have never had to visit African resorts, often can not decide where to go on vacation again.  In Egypt, you can have a great time at Crystal Sharm Hotel 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh), and in Tunisia at Hotel Golden Beach 4 * (Skanes). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  A small North African state is famous for its magnificent sandy beaches, which is why the prices for tours to this country are slightly more expensive.  The lack of Russian animation in Tunisia sometimes scares tourists who come with the goal of not only sunbathing on the beach, but also culturally relaxing.  Considering that the second official language in the country is French, in many hotels the staff does not speak English.  Tunisian resorts are focused on spa vacations, while in Egypt diving can become the main hobby of vacationers.  The bottom of the Red Sea literally beckons with its amazing corals, shells, jellyfish and fish.  In Egypt, even in the most expensive hotels, tourists are treated as a source of profit, so they can feel false hospitality, which can not be said about the Republic of Tunisia.  Hotel <span>Golden Beach 4 * is</span> cordially waiting for its visitors and is ready to provide everything that is necessary for a quality and interesting vacation: archery, tennis, minigolf and other entertainment that guests can do in their free time from the beach.  Going on vacation with your family, you will not lose by choosing Tunisia, while active youth will be more interesting to spend time in the bustling resorts of Egypt. </p><h2>  Berlin Golden Beach Hotel 4 * in Bulgaria </h2>

    <p>  European countries seem to Russians no less attractive for recreation than the <span>resorts of Turkey,</span> Greece or Egypt.

    <p>  The food in the hotel is high-quality and varied, so if you stay in a hotel room on an all-inclusive basis, you do not have to buy food yourself or have dinner in a restaurant.  However, the administration of the Golden Coast Beach Hotel 4 * took care of customers who want to enjoy delicacies.  There are three bars and a Mediterranean tavern in the open air, and three restaurants indoors.  The hotel lives up to its four stars and successfully competes with other establishments in price - the cost of the all-inclusive tour is more than affordable, so tourists often extend their stay. </p><h2>  <span>Average</span> vacation <span>check</span> </h2><p>  The Royal Villa hotel in Greece is considered to be one of the most expensive in the world, because for one night guests sometimes have to pay up to fifty thousand dollars!  The external decoration of this palace differs from ordinary four-star hotels, but the service and other amenities in Hotel Golden Beach 4 * also look very decent.  The amount required by the administration of the "Royal Villa" is enough for tourists to relax in more modest hotels as much as 50 times (and not just one night, but a whole week and two!). </p><p>  For a double room with a sea view at the Hotel Golden Beach 4 *, visitors will pay 130 euros, the difference in meals for the buffet and all-inclusive systems can be a maximum of 10 euros;  single rooms are on average more expensive by 30 euros.  Holidays with children, as a rule, are slightly more expensive, since the administration is ready to accommodate a child free of charge without the right to occupy an extra bed.  Thus, a week stay at Park Hotel Golden Beach 4 * for a company of two people will cost a maximum of $ 1,000. </p><h2>  4 Star Hotel Requirements </h2><p>  Going on vacation abroad, the Russians strive not only to have a good day on the beach, but also to relax in the evening in luxurious apartments.  The number of stars in the hotel indicates the level of comfort and quality of service, but so far there is no single classification for all countries.  In Turkey, hotels undergo annual certification, but confirmation may take several years.  Give preference to young buildings, such as Golden Beach Hotel 4 * (Bodrum), in which, at a low cost, the service will be much better. </p>

    <p>  In Egyptian hotels, the number of stars is determined not by the quality of the rooms, but by the range of services provided.  Often, travel agencies to attract customers position the hotel as a four-star hotel, but in fact, the service can correspond to three stars.  There is no unified system for assessing the level of hotels, but customers can count on some mandatory conditions in hotels of a certain class.  Bed linen is updated daily at the four-star hotel, and customers can also use the laundry facilities at any time.  The rooms have a telephone, a safe, a minibar, air conditioning and cleaning supplies - such is the Hotel Golden Beach 4 * hotel.  Guest reviews confirm the high level of service and the availability of all amenities. </p><h2>  Budget tours: where it is more profitable for Russians to fly </h2><p>  Several times a year, travel agencies announce discounts on the most popular destinations.  So, for a three-day stay in hotels in Spain, Italy and Greece, a married couple will pay up to 500 euros, including a one-way flight;  Turkey and Cyprus will cost tourists an average of 50 euros more.  For holidays in the ski resorts of Austria, Andorra and France, Russians will have to pay twice as much.  By the way, in the same countries you can go in the warm season and settle in a hotel with sea views.  In Bulgaria, tourists can have a great time at Park Hotel Golden Beach 4 * in winter and summer.  Prices for vacations in prestigious places such as Dominican Republic, Sri Lanka, Maldives will differ significantly.  For a weekly stay in a two- or three-star hotel, a couple will have to pay from 1,500 to 2,500 dollars, taking into account the flight.  It is much more profitable to purchase a tour through proven services such as Tez Tour, which will select the most advantageous offers in more than twenty countries in a matter of minutes. </p><h2>  How much does a vacation in exotic countries cost? </h2><p>  Actual offers for trips to Turkey can be found in the season of the so-called last-minute tours, when ticket prices and accommodation in comfortable hotels, such as Gate Hotel Golden Beach 4 *, will be record low.  Usually such a sale happens in the fall and spring, but you will have to overpay for a vacation in the New Year holidays or in the last months of the summer. </p>

    <p>  The average cost of a trip to Turkey with a weekly stay will be $ 700 per person, with a lower level of comfort, the price can drop to $ 400.  For a similar low amount, tourists can go to Egypt, but the cost of a vacation in Thailand will be much higher, which is due to the duration of the flight, but during the last-minute tours you can find a ticket to this exotic country for $ 500.  If you cannot choose between a vacation within Russia or abroad, give preference to the second option - not a single sanatorium in the Krasnodar Territory can be compared with the Golden Beach Hotel 4 *.  Turkey is a country where spending time can sometimes be cheaper than a trip to the Black or Azov Sea, so you should not be afraid of a long flight and a language barrier. </p><h2>  Relax and save </h2><p>  Many Russians do not dare to go to another country because of the high price of accommodation and flights, but is it that acquaintance with a new culture, interesting souvenirs and a beautiful tan are not worth the investment?  By purchasing a ticket through a travel agency, you save money on further entertainment and shopping.  It is known that family vacations are much cheaper, and the hotel administration can offer a free bed for a child or other favorable conditions.  Going to an exotic country, decide what you expect from the trip - a high level of comfort and pastime in a luxury hotel or walks along the beach and the city? </p><p>  Many tourists believe that it is better to overpay and get full conditions than to sleep on solid beds and eat ordinary dishes.  Hotel in Tunis City Hotel Golden Beach 4 * is represented by comfortable rooms for guests of various levels of affluence.  If you are not interested in air conditioning, a bar and satellite TV, and you plan to only spend the night in your room, you will have enough small apartments with a minimal amount of furniture.  When purchasing a tour with all-inclusive conditions, be prepared that you will have to overeat with delicacies.  If you plan to skip at least one meal, the hotel will only have to wait for breakfast, and for lunch or dinner you can go to the Turkish snack bar. </p><h2>  A package of documents required for a flight to Turkey, the UAE, Egypt and Greece </h2><p>  Turkey attracts Russians by the fact that they will not need to apply for a visa to relax in this country.  At the border, it is enough to present a passport and a return ticket or the necessary amount for its purchase.  Given the annual multimillion-dollar flow of Russians to this country, there are rarely cases when border guards send a vacationer back home - most often tourists successfully register and have no problems with leaving.  The government strictly ensures that guests of the country do not violate the terms of their stay at the resort.  If in 2012, Russian citizens could stay in Turkey for no more than two months, today the permissible period is halved. </p>

    <p>  The UAE government has more stringent requirements for those wishing to relax in this country.  A few days before departure, you must apply for a visa at the Moscow Visa Application Center or at a travel agency through which you plan to purchase a tour.  Single women must meet certain conditions to enter the UAE: if they have not reached the age of thirty and travel alone, a deposit of $ 1,500 must be paid to stay at the hotel.  To get a visa, you need a standard package of documents: a copy of your passport, application form, photo. </p><p>  The fascinating history of the country, an unforgettable beach vacation and unusual Thai cuisine attract tourists from all over the world, and it‚Äôs very easy for Russians to organize a trip to this kingdom - they can stay in it for 30 days without a visa.  The situation is different for citizens of Ukraine and Belarus: entry into the country is allowed only with a visa.  The receipt procedure is usually not delayed, and tourists will need to pay $ 25 for all documents.  By the way, the famous Hotel Golden Beach 4 * hotel is located in the resort of Pattaya, where most Russians go on vacation. </p><p> The cost of a visa to Cyprus depends on several factors: the purpose of your trip, the number of days of stay and the level of comfort of the hotel where you decide to stay.  The visa is provided by the consulate, and Russians can get it under a simplified program.  The country is a party to the Schengen agreement.  A visa is done within two weeks.  If you decide to spend your vacation in one of the exotic countries, take care of the paperwork in advance, and then nothing will prevent a good rest! </p>
