    <p>  In connection with the emergence of friction in relations between the USSR and the Union states, from March one thousand nine hundred and fifty-third years in some countries of Eastern Europe belonging to the socialist camp, mass discontent of citizens began to arise.  They found expression in numerous demonstrations and strikes.  The greatest protest was expressed by the inhabitants of Hungary and Czechoslovakia.  The situation in the GDR, where the standard of living of the population worsened, led the country to the brink of a mass strike.  To suppress dissatisfaction, the USSR government introduced tanks into the country. </p><p>  The organization of the Warsaw Pact was the result of negotiations between the Soviet leaders and the leadership of the socialist states.  It includes almost all countries located in Eastern Europe, except Yugoslavia.  The formation of the Warsaw Pact organization served as a prerequisite for the creation of a joint command of the Armed Forces, as well as a Political Consultative Committee coordinating activities on the foreign policy of the allied states.  All key posts in these structures were held by a representative of the USSR army. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The Warsaw <span>Pact on Cooperation,</span> Friendship, and Mutual Assistance was created to ensure the security of its member countries.  The need for this agreement was due to the expanding activities of NATO. </p><p>  The concluded agreement contained provisions that provided mutual assistance to any participating country in the event that it would be attacked, as well as holding mutual consultations in case of crisis situations with the creation of a unified command over the armed forces. </p><p>  The Warsaw Pact organization was created in opposition <span>to the NATO bloc.</span>  However, already in the nineteen fifty-sixth year, the Hungarian government declared its neutrality and desire to withdraw from the countries participating in the agreement.  The answer to this was the entry of <span>Soviet tanks</span> into Budapest <span>.</span>  The unrest occurred in Poland.  They managed to be stopped peacefully. </p><p>  The split in the socialist camp began in the nineteen fifty-eighth year.  It was during this period that the Romanian government achieved the withdrawal of the USSR troops from the territory of its state and refused to support its leaders.  A year after that, the Berlin crisis arose.  An even greater strain was caused by the construction of a wall around <span>West Berlin</span> with the installation of checkpoints on the border. </p>

    <p>  The countries of the Warsaw Pact in the mid-sixties of the last century literally overwhelmed the demonstrations against the use of military force.  The collapse of Soviet ideology in the eyes of the world community occurred in the nineteen sixty-eighth year with the introduction of tanks in Prague. </p><p>  The Warsaw Pact organization ceased to exist in the nineteen ninety-first year of the year simultaneously with the collapse of the socialist system.  The agreement lasted for more than thirty years, during the entire period of its validity it posed a real threat to the free world. </p>
