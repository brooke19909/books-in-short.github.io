In pursuit of the best device, users have to sort through dozens of models.  But they do not have time to do this, because every month there is another novelty that catches the attention of the audience.  So, another Xiaomi flagship recently became known - Mi Max 2. Reviews relate primarily to its main feature. </p><h2>  Size matters </h2><p>  They could not think of screens of similar sizes 5 years ago.  Now smartphones with a diagonal of 5.5 inches have become familiar.  Six-inch models are increasingly attracting attention.  But options with a 6.44 display may still surprise someone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi max 2 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015980.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The first audience was pleased with Sony, releasing its "shovel" Xperia Z Ultra a couple of years ago.  After that, some manufacturers made attempts to create models with similar dimensions, but then the buyer was not ready for this. </p><p>  Xiaomi decided to resume this story.  Last year, she introduced the Mi Max, which was able to find its buyer.  There were also the most devoted fans who looked to the future and hoped for subsequent updates. </p><p>  The manufacturer did not keep itself waiting and this year showed the audience the updated Xiaomi Mi Max 2. Reviews make it clear that some cardinal changes did not happen with the new generation.  But some parameters still changed under the influence of time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The company still continues to hide its new products in simple boxes.  Before us is an ordinary white box made of quality cardboard.  The orange logo of the manufacturer flaunts in the middle.  In the upper right corner are the features of the modification: the amount of RAM and internal memory. </p><p>  There are no gifts in the box.  Along with the smartphone there is already a familiar envelope with documentation and a paper clip to remove the tray.  Under them at the bottom of the box is a charger unit and a USB cable.  It works with Qualcomm QC 3.0 technology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi max 2 64gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015979.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If you buy the phone directly from a Chinese store, you will most likely get a European plug.  Have to buy an adapter. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  This is not to say that the reviews about the <span>Xiaomi Mi</span> Max 2 phone are very positive.  Of course, the device was not perfect.  It is still aimed at the budget segment.  But its huge screen also affects the cost.  It occupies the main area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe front panel. </p><p>  Compared to the previous model, this one looks more compact, because it took away the wide frames around the screen.  As a result, the fact that its diagonal is so large can not be noticed right away. </p><p>  There is nothing outstanding in its design.  It is not easy to distinguish from budget competitors.  It is presented in black and gold.  In the first version, the device is completely black, in the second - the back panel is gold, and the front panel is white. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The front panel is occupied by a 6.44-inch screen.  Above the display, a spoken speaker, a front camera and a pair of sensors were placed.  Under the screen there is an empty frame on which the illuminated touch control buttons are hidden.  There is no mechanical key. </p><p>  The back panel is made of matte black plastic.  It looks good and generally does not cause any complaints.  In the upper left corner there is a double flash and a small ‚Äúeye‚Äù of the main camera. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi max 2 owner reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015978.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At the top in the middle was a fingerprint scanner.  As usage shows, it is slightly above a comfortable level.  That is, when you pick up the phone, the finger does not immediately lie on the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù of the scanner.  But it works quickly and without errors. </p><h2>  Elemental base </h2><p>  The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 case details were not reviewed by the owners.  Most likely, this is due to the fact that all the elements took their usual places.  They are easy to intuitively find and use. </p><p>  On the left side there is a button for adjusting the volume and power.  They are made of plastic, have a soft stroke.  A combination tray is visible on the right side.  You can install two "SIM cards" here or replace one of them with a memory card.  Interestingly, nanoSIM is installed in one slot and microSIM in the other.  The solution is incomprehensible, since almost all smartphone models have switched to using the smallest SIM card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The upper end took an additional noise reduction microphone, headset jack and infrared.  The lower one mimics the ‚Äúapple‚Äù gadgets.  A speaker is hidden under one grid, and a main microphone under a second grid.  In the middle, we placed a connector for a Type-C charger. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  Since this is a key feature of the model, it is worth making it a separate block.  The feedback from the owners of Xiaomi Mi Max 2 will say about the operation of such a giant, our business is to operate with numbers. </p><p>  As it turned out, the smartphone, despite the apparent compactness, has become larger than its predecessor.  Of course, the numbers are insignificant, but still he gained an extra millimeter in height and became 174 mm, its width increased by tenths - 88.7 mm, and the thickness remained almost the same - 7.6 mm.  In weight, he added 8 units - 211 grams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone reviews xiaomi mi max 2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015977.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Its size is not a record in the market.  There is, for example, Asus ZenFone 3 Ultra, which turned out to be higher and wider. </p><p>  But if you look at the difference between the new product and the previous model, the question arises: why does the second version look more compact?  It‚Äôs not easy to answer.  We can only assume that this effect was achieved due to the beveled edges of the case. </p><h2>  Exploitation </h2><p>  Despite this feature, not all users left positive feedback.  Xiaomi Mi Max 2 64Gb Black is a very large phone.  Some owners were not able to get used to its size.  Someone was chasing an impressive diagonal, forgetting that it would not be so easy to manage such a "monster". </p><p>  Some did not even benefit from the special function to reduce the screen.  If you drag your finger along the side edge along the touch panel, the display conditionally becomes smaller, shifting to the edge.  The desktop occupies a third of the screen, the rest of the space is a black background. </p><p>  The model is hard to put in your pocket.  She barely finds a place in a small purse.  Even in the hand, especially the female, the gadget lies uncertainly.  Therefore, the number of buyers who are really satisfied with the dimensions is small. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  As you know, you get used to the big screen quickly.  Do you often use seven-inch tablets?  In just a couple of days, you begin to notice that the screen could have been bigger.  The same story happens with the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 64Gb smartphone. </p><p>  Screen reviews received good.  Firstly, the diagonal plays a large role, on which it is very comfortable to watch videos, play games or just read.  Secondly, the resolution of 1920x1080 pixels is quite enough for this screen.  With this indicator, the ppi 342 is average, but it does its job. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi max 2 camera reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015976.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Thirdly, the IPS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãinstalled for the phone.  And this means that the picture has good colors, saturation and brightness.  <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 4 protective glass is the best choice for such a display.  The manufacturer did not forget about the <span>oleophobic coating</span> and a variety of technologies for the screen. </p><p>  If you compare this new product with its predecessor, it is noticeable that the display has not changed much.  It has mediocre viewing angles that distort colors when tilted.  If you turn the phone to the left, the shades fade, to the right - they become pale. </p><p>  On the other hand, if such a diagonal made an ideal screen, the cost would be more than at least twice. </p><p>  Pleased users with a margin of brightness.  It is enough here for outdoor use on a sunny day.  Visually noticeable that the colors are a little "fade."  But you can calmly see who is calling and read the message. </p><h2>  "Shell" </h2><p>  When <span>reviewing the Xiaomi Mi</span> Max 2 64Gb, the reviews are different.  And with some you can immediately agree, with others - it's easy to argue.  So, a lot of different responses were collected by the ‚Äúshell‚Äù of the smartphone. </p><p>  It went on sale based on Android 7.1.1 - this is definitely a plus.  Most of last year‚Äôs models still work on the ‚Äúsix‚Äù or ‚Äúfive‚Äù.  Processed OS proprietary "shell" MIUI 8.0.  This is also cool, but there are a few but. </p><ol><li><p>  It is noticeable that proprietary software is a bit buggy.  This is not to say that it directly slows down, but lovers of the ‚Äúsmoothness‚Äù of the system will definitely not like it. </p></li><li><p>  There were questions to notifications.  Part, but you definitely miss.  What this is connected with is not clear, but the Chinese have a big problem. </p></li><li><p>  Obviously, MIUI 8.0 is "unfinished" to the end.  She looks raw.  But there are hopes that upcoming updates will fix all bugs and the situation will change. </p></li></ol><h2>  Iron </h2><p>  Another reason for the endless debate is the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù of Xiaomi Mi Max 2 64Gb.  She received double reviews, since it is impossible to please everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi max 2 64gb reviews review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47310/2016568.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The processor for this model was Qualcomm Snapdragon 625. Experienced users understand that this is not the 800th series, but it has proven itself perfectly.  The chipset operates at a frequency of 2 GHz on eight cores. </p><p>  Adreno 506, another champion of productivity, became the graphic adapter.  Everything looks good together: it works stably, without any glitches, but it shows average performance. </p><p>  This is especially noticeable if you look at the testing of flagships, which in Antutu show values ‚Äã‚Äãthat exceed 120 thousand.  The hero of the review gives out stable 63 thousand points, and this is quite enough for everyday use. </p><p>  ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù smartphone Xiaomi Mi Max 2 reviews received good.  Nobody will refuse 4 GB of RAM now.  Time 1 or even 2 GB is already passing, and 3-4 GB are gaining popularity.  Therefore, for this the manufacturer is a huge plus. </p><p>  The internal memory is 64 GB, and this is also enough even to throw a couple of movies on the phone and watch them on the go.  Not to mention that there will be plenty of space for photos and documents. </p><h2>  Photo / Video </h2><p>  But the camera Xiaomi Mi Max 2 reviews received surprisingly good.  Of course, it was stupid to hope that a budget smartphone, and even with such dimensions, would be equipped with high-quality modules.  But it was not all so deplorable. </p><p>  Typically, Chinese manufacturers pay little attention to lenses.  Unless, of course, they do not want to create another camera phone.  But this time, surprisingly, it turned out very well. </p><p>  The main module is equipped with a resolution of 12 megapixels and an aperture of f / 2.2.  The front camera takes good pictures with 5 megapixels. </p><p>  In daylight, you can‚Äôt find fault with the pictures at all.  Good saturated bright colors, without overexposure and other nonsense.  At dusk and at night, the module copes worse.  But all the same, "does not lose face" and shows good results. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi max 2 64gb black reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015974.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Shooting a video Xiaomi Mi Max 2 64Gb Gold received different reviews.  Someone was incredibly happy that the videos can be shot in 4K resolution.  Someone was hooked by the lack of stabilization.  In general, the videos are obtained as usual.  They are unlikely to be drawn to be uploaded to the YouTube channel, but they will do for the family archive. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  With battery life, the model is doing well.  Such a large screen simply needed a significant amount of battery power.  Therefore, it was equipped with a 5300 mAh battery.  If you recall the predecessor, then there is a noticeable increase in battery capacity, and this is good news. </p><p>  Together with support for QC 3.0, the battery can last a long time and quickly charge.  According to the stated indicators from the manufacturer, it is clear that the phone can play video 12 hours in a row without recharging.  You can search for something on the Internet for 8 hours or play for 7 hours with maximum brightness. </p><p>  The smartphone lives quietly for a couple of days of moderate use.  And this is one of the main advantages for which Xiaomi Mi Max 2 reviews received good.  I was also pleased that the device overnight can lose only 3-4%. </p><p>  The novelty learned and independently charge other devices in the presence of the right wire. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The model is equipped with all the necessary modules for wireless communication.  If we talk about frequencies, the smartphone supports LTE FDD and TDD LTE.  In the city, mobile Internet does an excellent job and shows good speed.  But everything, of course, depends on the operator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi max 2 64gb gold reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015972.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There is support for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2.  Additionally, there are Wi-Fi Display and Wi-Fi Direct options, you can configure the access point yourself.  For some, the lack of NFC turned out to be sad. </p><p>  Implemented a navigation module.  It works quickly and finds satellites in the first seconds.  There is a built-in magnetic compass. </p><p>  For communication, the Smart Dial application is installed.  When dialing a phone number, it searches for contacts by the first letters.  You can customize the sorting and display of subscribers. </p><p>  Otherwise, everything remained native to the Android OS.  You can send one of the numbers to the black list.  Easy to record a conversation.  The vibrating alert is not very loud, so you can not hear it in the bag.  The speaker provides a good sound.  The voice of the interlocutor is not distorted. </p><p>  Reviews Xiaomi Mi Max 2 64Gb in terms of interface and operation left good.  None of the owners had problems moving around the system.  Just save numbers and enter them.  A clear messaging application. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  And finally, the overall impression of the owners.  By the fall of 2017, the model can be found in stores.  It is sold for 20 thousand rubles.  In this case, you will have in your hands a version with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal.  If you order a smartphone from China, you can grab a discount, and in Asia it is still cheaper.  You can save up to 5 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The most important ‚Äúfeature‚Äù was the screen of Xiaomi Mi Max 2. He received the best reviews.  Those who understood what dimensions would be with such a diagonal were not disappointed.  Of course, there were cases when at the time of purchase the user sees the display and understands its dimensions.  But after a couple of weeks of operation, the device returns. </p><p>  Unfortunately, such models are doomed to criticism from lovers of compact smartphones.  But in any case, even such a giant will find its buyer. </p><p>  On the Internet you can find many reviews of Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Black.  Reviews still give a clearer picture.  Most of them are subjective, but they can still be very useful for a potential buyer. </p><p>  From them you can understand that the novelty works with a good battery.  If a modern device with such a diagonal can withstand two days, then this is a huge plus.  Pleased with the presence of fast charging.  This is especially important for a phone with such a battery capacity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone xiaomi mi max 2 64gb reviews" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015973.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Noted by users and a good camera.  This is another reason why you can pay attention to your smartphone.  It can be seen that the manufacturer did not throw this element.  Of course, you are unlikely to get photo masterpieces, but excellent pictures for social networks are guaranteed to you. </p><p>  They didn‚Äôt save on iron either.  The owners managed to install any game and enjoy the maximum graphics settings.  In addition to entertainment, there are many useful work tools.  What is missing, everything can be installed from the application store. </p><p>  Thanks to 4 GB of RAM, you can not be afraid that some data will be lost due to the fact that you minimized the software.  The device tries to save all important information as much as possible. </p><p>  It will be enough for everyone and 64 GB.  32 GB is considered universal, and the double storage is especially attractive to everyone.  Here you can download the season of your favorite series, save travel photos and download your favorite music. </p><p>  If you are the owner of Xiaomi Mi Max, then updating your device to a new one makes no sense.  Perhaps it is better to wait for subsequent modifications.  But if you just look at the models of tablet phones, then for this cost you will get an excellent device. </p>
