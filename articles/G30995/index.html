LG 43UJ639V gets so different reviews that it‚Äôs even hard to understand whether to buy this model or whether you need to look at other options. </p><p>  This is all due to the fact that not all people know, for example, about 4K resolution and HDR technology.  Therefore, for them, the picture becomes noticeably better.  More experienced users can compare TVs by these parameters and be somewhat unhappy.  So we get two camps of comments: positive and negative. </p><h2>  Company </h2><p>  LG and LCD TVs have been around for a long time.  In general, this manufacturer has been known since 1947.  Now it is the fourth largest company.  The LG Group includes several subsidiaries, including LG Electronics Inc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tv lg 43uj639v reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2110717.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is this subsidiary that manufactures electronics and household appliances.  It was founded a little later than the main financial and industrial group.  In 1958, she began her active work. </p><h2>  Products </h2><p>  One of the main directions of this corporation was the production of LCD and LED TVs.  In addition to them, the company boasts audio equipment: karaoke, players, music centers.  It produces video equipment: cameras, cameras, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also popular are mobile phones, laptops, PC monitors, some components.  Under this brand, they sell air conditioners, air filters, energy-saving products, etc. </p><h2>  TV </h2><p>  The hero of the review is the LG 43UJ639V TV.  It is impossible to say that this is a completely new and revolutionary product.  Against the background of all such models, this is unremarkable.  Features such as 4K resolution, HDR technology, an integrated operating system have become familiar to the modern user. </p><p>  The thing is different: not everyone can afford such a technique to their home.  Hence the lack of understanding of what characteristics can be considered really useful, and which are presented for the purposes of an advertising campaign. </p><p>  If not for the cost, this model could easily be called an ordinary TV.  But since it is not accessible to everyone, we will try to describe all its advantages and capabilities. </p><h2>  Family </h2><p>  LED TV LG 43UJ639V belongs to the affordable models of the UJ639V family.  In some countries, the line is called UJ632.  This includes the smallest 4K TV.  Its diagonal is 43 inches, there are also variations with 49 inches. </p>

    <p>  As mentioned earlier, the hero of the review is endowed with 4K resolution, HDR technology and webOS 3.5.  The cost of this model is on average $ 600. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Comparison </h2><p>  If you follow the news from this company and approximately understand the situation on the market, then most likely, at the first glance at this model, you will see representatives of the UJ630V and UJ634V series in it.  And then, if you want to find comparisons, you can hardly find a difference from last year‚Äôs options. </p><p>  If we take into account the fact that this is considered the middle price segment, and nobody claims to be unique, then such copying is quite common for everyone.  As a result, we have a conditional continuation of previous models with slightly higher indicators, which in fact do not affect anything.  So the model under review stands out only because it was released in 2017. </p><h2>  Supply </h2><p>  <span>Reviews TV LG 43UJ639V</span> regarding the supply and configuration assembled good.  Yes, the manufacturer did not dodge with the box.  Before us is the usual branded packaging from the company.  The cardboard is dense and generally provides safe screen transportation. </p><p>  The white box received a minimum of graphic elements.  On the front of it fit a burgundy branded strip, which indicated the main parameters. </p><p>  In the upper left corner is the company logo with its slogan: "Life's Good."  In the upper left corner it is indicated that we have ‚Äúnew 2017‚Äù, which once again proves to us the only advantage of this model from last year. </p><p>  In the middle in capital letters it is indicated that we have an Ultra HD TV with 4K.  Under it, the smaller letters describe the family to which the model belongs, as well as the TV screen size of 43 inches (108 cm). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="43 inch tv" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2110719.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As you can see, such a description can be made to any last year‚Äôs model or product of the current year of release.  It remains only to change the value of the diagonal. </p><p>  On the burgundy strip indicated four main <span>characteristics of the TV</span> : </p><ul><li>  Matrix IPS 4K. </li><li>  Active HDR. </li><li>  The presence of Ultra Surround. </li><li>  The work of the model based on webOS 3,5 Smart TV. </li></ul><p>  In the box, in addition to the device itself, there are a couple of instructions and manuals for use, connection and settings.  There is also a remote control and power cable. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  So, as mentioned earlier, we have a TV with an IPS panel.  It has a simple design, but at the same time, it remains true to the latest fashion trends.  The diagonal of 43 inches, although it is considered the smallest in 4K resolution, actually does not look like that at all.  Before us is a very large, massive screen.  It looks great both on the stand and on the wall. </p><p>  The model imitates frameless variation, although, of course, there is a thin panel around the screen.  It seems metallic because it is coated with gloss.  But, naturally, no one would use metal.  Therefore, we have a good quality plastic.  As practice and time show, it does not burst, does not crack and looks good. </p><p>  TV <span>LG 43UJ639V reviews</span> about the stand received different.  This is due to the fact that in different countries it is structurally different.  From here, someone was pleased with the wide crescent-shaped stand, and someone did not really like the installation on two small legs. </p><p>  The company logo is located on the bottom frame.  On a light frame, it is barely noticeable.  In addition, the panel below is so thin that its dimensions are tiny.  Immediately, below, they made a small block for control.  The power button and indicator were placed here.  There are speaker grilles. </p><p>  If you consider the TV in full view, then you can not call it superthin.  Behind it is slightly convex.  From the point of view of design, there is nothing outstanding here.  Ports are located in a special conditional compartment.  They are easily accessible from the left. </p><h2>  Remote control </h2><p>  As mentioned in the description of the LG 43UJ639V TV, you can find a remote control in the box.  There is a ‚Äúmagic bullet‚Äù called Magic Remote.  It has a curved shape with large rubberized buttons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led tv lg 43uj639v" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2110714.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For those who have not previously used this, it can take a long time to get used to it.  Although all the buttons are logically arranged in groups.  There is a scroll wheel in the middle - like a mouse wheel.  A very convenient element that will help you flipping pages on the Internet or clips on YouTube.  They also placed special buttons on the remote control to access Netflix and Amazon Prime resources. </p><h2>  main parameters </h2><p>  So, the LG 43UJ639V TV got the characteristics usual for any similar model in this price segment.  If you look at Samsung or Sony TVs for the same price, you will see all the same numbers and technologies. </p><p>  The series includes two models of 43 and 49 inches.  We have a smaller option on the review.  It works with a screen resolution of 3840x2160 pixels.  It shows 4K images with active HDR technology.  For those to whom the latest indicators are an empty word, it is necessary to explain. </p><h2>  Innovations </h2><p>  Let's start with the concept of "4K".  This is the latest newfangled resolution that indicates resolution in digital cinema and computer graphics.  Conventionally, it equals indicators of 4 thousand pixels horizontally. </p><p>  After the 4K resolution became fashionable, and it was used by everyone in their specifications, the experts decided to approve special instructions for the equipment.  Having a list of the necessary characteristics, she can rightly use this parameter. </p><p>  As a result, several digital cinema standards appeared on the market that correspond to 4K resolution.  These include full-frame, academic, cached, widescreen and ultra.  All these standards differ slightly in terms of pixels and aspect ratio. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ips panel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2110716.jpg"></div>

    <p>  HDR is a technology that works to improve image and video, in which the brightness range is much higher than standard indicators.  As practice shows, such pictures become more contrast, while maintaining the naturalness and correctness of colors. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  A similar 43-inch TV can give a lot to the average user.  For example, you can use the 360 ‚Äã‚ÄãVR function.  It implements the effect of virtual reality.  Therefore, if you worked with photos taken on a VR camcorder, then the results can be viewed on such a TV. </p><p>  Another feature of Magic Mobile helps synchronize data from another device on the LG 43UJ639V.  So on the big screen you can show your guests photos from the last trip, which are stored on your phone, tablet or laptop. </p><h2>  Customization </h2><p>  After you start working with a brand new device, you may have questions about setting up.  LG 43UJ639V TV is based on the updated webOS 3.5 operating system.  Thanks to her, you can make the initial setup. </p><p>  The virtual assistant Bean Birds appears in the system.  It is pretty funny animated and well designed.  When you first turn it on, he conducts a tour of the system.  Tells about the main functions and features.  All this is accompanied by video instructions.  It is important to remember that such an assistant appears only once.  But you can call it if you need to be re-configured. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The interface of the updated OS is very simple and intuitive.  There are no tricky sections that lead to nowhere.  When you turn on, we are greeted by a welcome screen.  After that, you can click on the "Home" button, where the application launchpad will open. </p><p>  There are already quite a lot of them.  Of the pre-installed ones, there are also useful services, and there are those that you are unlikely to ever turn on.  You can also optionally install the programs you need. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg 43uj639v tv review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2110715.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Despite the seemingly ideal system, reviews about it are not always positive.  Yes, it is well thought out, easy to use.  But over time, you begin to notice the brakes.  The interface sometimes freezes, slows down or thinks for a long time.  There are delays of a few seconds. </p><h2>  Testing </h2><p>  To make a complete picture of the LG 43UJ639V TV, few reviews.  As practice shows, you need to conduct additional tests that would give more information. </p><p>  As a result, the video quality turned out to be really good.  4K resolution affects the quality of the picture, making it clear and detailed.  If you connect a laptop to the screen, then you won‚Äôt be able to further improve the image.  So you can not even try such a trick. </p><p>  Viewing angles in the specifications are indicated as wide.  In fact, this indicator is very subjective.  Testing showed that viewing angles are average.  At the edges, the picture is a bit blurry. </p><p>  The analysis of the system also did not give any cool results.  Despite the quad-core processor, the TV slows down, especially during the transition from one application to another. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  A good conclusion can be reviews of the LG 43UJ639V TV.  Owners of this model as a whole were satisfied.  We noted a good picture, good sound, implemented by two speakers, a simple operating system and a resolution of 4K.  The IPS matrix produces natural, correct colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tv lg 43uj639v description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2110713.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Technologies that enhance images work well.  Other options are a good addition.  Perhaps they will not all be used, but they will definitely become a good gift for experienced owners. </p><p>  There were also many shortcomings.  Noted the lack of a linear output for headphones or speakers.  A refresh rate of 50 Hz is a low indicator both for this resolution and for the diagonal.  Nevertheless, some noticed the jamming of the Smart system.  Someone did not have enough brightness and color rendering quality. </p><p>  Otherwise, we have before us a standard TV of the budget segment among models with 4K resolution.  Its main advantage is its size, updated OS and the presence of UHD.  Everything else turned out to be somewhat unfinished and "raw".  Although for 35,000 rubles, perhaps, you can‚Äôt expect more. </p>
