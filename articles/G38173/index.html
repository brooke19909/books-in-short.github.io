    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Shepsi is a small village, which is the administrative center for a number of settlements in the district.  Only about 3,000 people live here.  His story begins somewhere in 1900, namely, with the appearance of the first estate built for <span>Lieutenant General Petrov.</span>  This man played an important role in the development of rail transport in this area.  The village received its name in honor of the river of the same name and in translation means ‚Äúthree rivers‚Äù.  This is due to the fact that earlier three streams flowed into the Shepsi River, due to which it was given such a name.  Holidays in Shepsi not only allow you to enjoy the warm southern sea, but also appreciate the beauty of the majestic mountain spurs of the Aymalug gorge and the pristine beauty of gentle slopes covered with trees and shrubs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  A mild Mediterranean climate allows you to make a great vacation in Shepsi.
