    <p>  An ideal image from such devices and for such little money is not worth the wait.  The first thing the cheapest TVs sin is the lack of LED backlight.  Without it, the distribution of brightness and color depth occurs unevenly, which is visible to the naked eye (especially in a juicy picture).  Plasma models are too expensive for this article, so we will focus mainly on devices with <span>liquid crystals.</span> </p><h2>  What to look for before buying </h2><p>  Since many people use old-model televisions with conventional antennas, special attention should be paid to the presence and reproduction of an analog signal.  In addition, in the review below, preference will be given to models with additional functionality such as Internet access or a built-in media player. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, let's see if there are standing models in the budget segment (the cheapest TVs) that demonstrate, if not excellent, then at least a good level in all key indicators. </p><h2>  LG 32LW4500 </h2><p>  If you are not a fan of surfing the net, you rarely check Twitter, Facebook is even less likely, you watch YouTube videos once a month, and you use Skype on a personal computer, then this model is suitable for you.  The device does not have Internet access, but all the other characteristics of the model are at a high level. </p>

    <p>  Inexpensive TVs are not equipped with DLNA support and HbbTV technology, and this gadget is no exception.  Everything in it is ‚Äúimprisoned‚Äù for watching videos (and in this model succeeded).  Even though the TV is equipped with Edge LED-backlit, the 2D image has excellent quality, and there is practically no visible light on the LCD panel.  The color reproduction is close to ideal provided that the Expert 1 mode is turned on and the average color temperature. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the presence of an IPS matrix, which many outdated models are deprived of, so the device is perfect for a large family or company - fans who gather around the screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Blur or some artifacts during scaling of SD materials are almost invisible, and this resolution (1920x1080) is a significant plus.  <span>The</span> device holds an <span>analog signal</span> quite well, so the model is perfect for watching TV shows and other broadcasts. </p><p>  The only thing that users note in their reviews as a significant minus is that it is too small a TV, and even with a shallow black color.  Therefore, ardent fans of the "dark" genres (horrors, thrillers, noir) should look for a more suitable model.  Otherwise, you will get gray tones on a seemingly black background. </p><p>  The quality of the three-dimensional picture of this device deserves all praise, especially since similar inexpensive TVs can not boast of this.  The level of parasitic artifacts is extremely low, and although some eyes can be sore from unaccustomed, the passive system that is used in this model is much healthier than special shutter glasses. </p><p>  One of the pluses of the model can be attributed to the expanded configuration: now there is no need to buy anything to watch 3D video.  Well, in this mode, the resolution is knocked out of the frame (960x1080), but for the 32-inch diagonal this is simply not essential. </p><h2>  Is it worth buying </h2><p>  Judging by marketing research, only 25% of users (the territory of the Russian Federation) connect their TV to the Internet.  All other categories of buyers with Smart TV are either not familiar at all or do not use it, preferring for this purpose a personal computer, laptop, tablet or smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Looking at the statistics, it will be reasonable to note that this model is a logical choice, especially since it was released back in 2011 and today is worth a penny.  The price of the device is quite justified, and its balance with quality is more than sustained. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  price; </li><li>  good sound; </li><li>  the presence of a media player; </li><li>  four pairs of 3D glasses included; </li><li>  the presence of a good "passive" ZD. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  design; </li><li>  small diagonal; </li><li>  black color (gray with dynamic backlight); </li><li>  no network connection; </li><li>  one USB output; </li><li>  no headphone jack; </li><li>  oversized remote control. </li></ul><h2>  Panasonic TX-P46U20 </h2><p>  TV models of this brand have something to respect.  For many generations, the company was famous for its high-quality assembly and high-quality images.  Many exhibitions recognized Panasonic devices as the best in their category.  Even BW televisions of this brand sometimes could compete with competing color models. </p>

    <p>  The TX series showed a fairly high level of picture and pleased its consumer with a low price.  The secret that makes up the amount is quite simple - this is the last generation of models that saw the light in 2010, and for modern electronics even three years is a rather long time, not to mention six years. </p><p>  Just as nobody is interested in a five-year-old smartphone, so this device was unjustly forgotten.  Even on venerable Internet sites, this model can be found with great difficulty, and even then for a long order. </p><h2>  TX Series Features </h2><p>  The choice of the diagonal of the TV is not the last item for many users, and it is this model that gets to the point, thanks to its dimensions.  Similar devices have standardized sizes for this type of matrix (42 inches), while the TX model offers a 46-inch diagonal, and ten centimeters for the human eye is a rather noticeable difference.  Here you can add a full-fledged Full HayDi resolution with a 1920x1080 resolution. </p>

    <p>  Numerous reviews on this model are mostly positive, but the only thing that users note as a significant minus is the design, too far it gives back the distant 2010 with its frame, large stand and thickness of the case.  And although this gadget belongs to the category of ‚Äúcheapest TVs‚Äù, its indisputable advantages that almost all owners note in their reviews are its structural strength (ideally, if there are small children) and durability. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  price; </li><li>  diagonal; </li><li>  plasma screen; </li><li>  good sound; </li><li>  convenient remote control; </li><li>  excellent performance 2D images. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  power consumption (reaches 300 W / h); </li><li>  lack of USB communications and a media player; </li><li>  no 3D mode. </li></ul><h2>  Toshiba 42vl963 </h2><p>  The Toshiba of the VL series can be called the golden mean of this review.  The concepts of ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and ‚Äúsmall TV‚Äù models are completely different.  The device turned out, albeit concise, but with a very pleasant design for the eye.  The perimeter frame is very thin, so it is almost invisible, and compact controls are conveniently located below. </p>

    <p>  But the main advantage of Toshiba is not so much the appearance as the functionality of the device.  Here you can find all kinds of DVB tuners with full adaptation (T, C, S2), there is an excellent media player that can cope with almost any format.  Additionally, it is possible to record everything that is happening on the screen to a USB flash drive or an external hard drive. </p><h2>  Device Features </h2><p>  The Smart TV option is also available here, but judging by user reviews, the company is significantly behind its competitors in this regard: even the YouTube channel is not really integrated into the model‚Äôs options.  The only thing that saves in this case is the Toshiba Places branded channel, where you can find quite a lot of sensible applications. </p><p>  Although the backlight is made using Edge LED technology, it performs its functions very well: the brightness across the screen is very well distributed and it is almost impossible to see any sharp jumps with the naked eye.  The picture looks detailed and clean, and the dynamic processing deserves all praise. </p><p>  There is passive 3D, and of high quality, which makes it possible to spend much more time behind the screen than that of competing counterparts.  Separately, it is worth noting the presence of several pairs of 3D glasses of branded production, so there is no need to buy something to view 3D. </p><h2>  To buy or not </h2><p>  In terms of picture quality, the model is in no way inferior to the aforementioned device from LG, even the stereoscopic system is built on the same principle and is not much different from Toshiba.  But as a consumer argument, we can note the presence of Internet opportunities, which LG does not have. </p>

    <p>  One of the weaknesses of the VL series is its interface.  One gets the impression that it was designed, developed, and turned into life by completely different people, moreover, speaking different languages.  As a result, we get somewhere too oversimplified, and in some places too elaborate and complicated menu.  At the same time, many important points, which, according to the forecasts of logic, should be nearby, for some reason are scattered around the screen.  In the internal settings, there is the same confusion of windows and strokes that you won‚Äôt be able to understand right the first time. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  modern (for the old model) and nice design; </li><li>  LCD panel without glare; </li><li>  good quality 2D images; </li><li>  excellent reception of broadcast channels; </li><li>  the presence of adapted tuners; </li><li>  quality of "passive" 3D; </li><li>  Four pairs of branded 3D glasses included; </li><li>  good media player; </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  a confusing menu, but for those who are used to the Philips and Samsung, it‚Äôs generally a dark forest; </li><li>  the ergonomics of the remote control and the position of the keys are poor; </li><li>  there is no built-in Wi-Fi; </li><li>  black colors look gray. </li></ul>
