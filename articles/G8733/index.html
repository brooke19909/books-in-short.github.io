In this role, only Vladimir Lenin or Alexander II can compare with him.  For 36 years of independent rule of the autocrat, the state has not only changed its status from the kingdom to the Empire.  All spheres of the country's life have changed.  Reforms affected everyone - from the homeless to the nobleman from St. Petersburg under construction. </p>

    <p>  The Church did not stand aside.  Possessing infinite authority among the population, this organization was distinguished by its conservatism and inability to change and interfered with the growing power of Peter.  Inertness and adherence to the traditions of priests did not prevent the emperor from making changes in religious circles.  First of all, this, of course, is the Orthodox synod.  However, it would be a mistake to say that the change ended there. </p><h2>  The State of the Church on the Eve of Reform </h2>

This also applied to the Church.  The XVII century was marked by constant riots, including on religious grounds.  Peter's father - Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich - faced <span>Patriarch Nikon,</span> who carried out many reforms affecting some Christian rites.  This aroused the indignation of the people.  Many did not want to abandon the faith of their fathers and were eventually accused of heresy.  Schismaticism exists to this day, but in the XVIII century this problem was felt especially sharply. </p><p>  The key issue was the distribution of power between the king and the patriarch.  This concerned, for example, the monastic lands and the order of the same name (that is, the ministry), which tried to regulate the management of the clergy.  Such interference by secular authorities outraged the patriarch, and this conflict also remained open at the time of the accession of his son Alexei to the throne. </p><h2>  Peter's attitude to the Church </h2>

    <p>  In fact, during the time of Peter the Great, the policy of his father continued in religious matters.  The point of view of the new autocrat was largely influenced by secular education, as well as priests of the Kiev Metropolitanate, which was annexed to the Moscow Patriarchate in 1688. In addition, he led a life far from Christian ideals and, in addition, managed to travel around Protestant Europe, where the relationship with the clergy were organized according to a new pattern created after the Reformation.  So, for example, it should be noted that the young king looked with interest at the experience of the English crown, where the monarch was considered the head of the local <span>Anglican Church.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The highest church organ under Peter 1 at the beginning of his reign is the patriarchy, which still had great power and independence.  The Crown Prince certainly did not like this, and on the one hand he wanted to subordinate all the higher clergy directly to himself, and on the other, he was disgusted at the prospect of the appearance of his own Pope in Moscow.  The custodian of the throne of St. Paul did not recognize anyone's authority at all.  In addition, sought, for example, Nikon under Alexei Mikhailovich. </p><p>  The first step of the young tsar in relations with the Orthodox clergy was the ban on the construction of new monasteries in Siberia.  The decree is dated 1699.  Immediately after this, the Northern War with Sweden began, which constantly distracted Peter from clarifying relations with Orthodoxy. </p><h2>  Creation of the title of locum tenens </h2><p>  When Patriarch Adrian died in 1700, the king appointed the locum tenens of the patriarchal throne.  He became Metropolitan of Ryazan <span>Stefan Yavorsky.</span>  Adrian‚Äôs successor was only allowed to do ‚Äúworks of faith.‚Äù  That is, to engage in heresy and worship.  Yet the rest of the powers of the patriarch were divided between orders.  This primarily concerned economic activity on the lands of the Church.  The war with Sweden promised to be long, the state needed resources, and the king was not going to leave extra money for the ‚Äúpriests‚Äù.  As it turned out later, it was a calculated step.  Soon the parish bells began to be sent for remelting for new guns.  The highest church organ under Peter 1 did not resist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The locum tenens did not have independent authority.  On all important issues he had to consult with the other bishops, and send all reports directly to the sovereign.  At the time, the reforms were frozen. </p><p>  At the same time, the importance of the monastery order increased.  In particular, he was instructed to take control of the ancient Russian tradition - poverty.  Holy fools and beggars were caught and taken to order.  Punished and those who gave alms, regardless of rank and position in society.  As a rule, such a person received a fine. </p><h2>  Creation of the Synod </h2><p>  Finally, in 1721 the Most Holy Governing Synod was created.  At its core, it became an analogue of the Senate of the Russian Empire, which was responsible for the executive branch, being the highest organ of the state directly subordinate to the emperor. </p>

    <p>  The synod in Russia implied such positions as the president and vice president.  Although they were soon canceled, a similar step perfectly demonstrates Peter I‚Äôs habit of using the Table of Ranks practice, that is, creating new ranks that have nothing to do with the past.  The first president was Stefan Yarovsky.  He did not use authority or power.  The position of vice president performed a supervisory function.  In other words, it was the auditor who informed the tsar about everything that happened in the department. </p><h2>  Other posts </h2><p>  The position of Chief Prosecutor appeared, which regulated the relationship of the new structure with society, and also had the right to vote and lobbied for the interests of the crown. </p><p>  As in the secular ministries, in the Synod appeared their spiritual fiscals.  In their sphere of influence was all spiritual activity in the country.  They monitored the implementation of religious norms, etc. </p><p>  As noted above, the Synod was created as an analogue of the Senate, which means that it was in constant contact with it.  The link between the two organizations was a special agent who delivered reports and was responsible for the relationship. </p><h2>  What the Synod was responsible for </h2><p>  Responsibility of the Synod included both the affairs of the clergy and issues related to the laity.  In particular, the highest church organ under Peter 1 was to monitor the performance of Christian rites and eradicate superstition.  It is worth mentioning about education here.  The synod under Peter 1 was the last authority in charge of textbooks in various educational institutions. </p><h2>  Secular clergy </h2>

    <p>  According to Peter's idea, the white clergy was to become an instrument of the state, which would influence the masses and monitor its spiritual condition.  In other words, the same clear and regulated estate was created as the nobility and merchants, with their own goals and functions. </p><p>  Throughout its past history, the Russian clergy has been distinguished by its accessibility to the population.  It was not a caste of priests.  On the contrary, almost everyone could enter there.  For this reason, there was an overabundance of priests in the country, many of whom ceased to serve in the parish, but became tramps.  Such ministers of the Church were called ‚Äúsacral‚Äù.  The lack of regulation of this environment, of course, was something out of the ordinary during the time of Peter 1. </p><p>  A strict charter was introduced, according to which in the service the priest was only to praise the new reforms of the king.  The synod under Peter 1 issued a decree obliging the confessor to inform the authorities if a person confessed to a state crime or blasphemy against the crown.  The henchmen were punished by death. </p><h2>  Church education </h2><p>  Numerous audits were conducted to verify the formation of the clergy.  Their result was a massive deprivation of dignity and a reduction in the estate.  The highest church organ under Peter 1 introduced and systematized new standards for receiving the priesthood.  In addition, now each parish could have only a certain number of deacons and not a single person more.  In parallel with this, the procedure for exiting one's dignity was simplified. </p><p>  Speaking of church education in the first quarter of the XVIII century, it should be noted the active opening of seminaries in the 20s.  New educational institutions appeared in Nizhny Novgorod, Kharkov, Tver, Kazan, Kolomna, Pskov and other cities of the new empire.  The program included 8 classes.  There were boys with primary education. </p><h2>  Black clergy </h2><p>  The black clergy also became the object to which the reforms of <span>Peter I</span> were directed <span>.</span> Briefly speaking, changes in the life of monasteries were reduced to three goals.  Firstly, their number has steadily decreased.  Secondly, access to dignity was difficult.  Thirdly, the remaining monasteries were to receive a practical purpose. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="government synod" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23669/550233.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <p>  The reason for this attitude was the monarch‚Äôs personal dislike of the monks.  This was largely due to childhood impressions, in which they remained rebels.  In addition, the emperor was far from the way of life of the schemnik.  He preferred practical activity to fasting and prayer.  Therefore, it is not surprising that he built ships, worked as a carpenter, and did not like monasteries. </p><p>  Desiring that these institutions bring some benefit to the state, Peter ordered them to be converted to hospitals, factories, factories, schools, etc. But the life of the monks was greatly complicated.  In particular, they were forbidden to leave the walls of their native monastery.  Absences were severely punished. </p><h2>  <strong>The results of the church reform and its further fate</strong> </h2><p>  Peter I was a convinced statesman and, according to this conviction, made the clergy a cog in the general system.  Considering himself the only bearer of power in the country, he deprived the patriarchy of any power, and eventually completely destroyed this structure. </p><p>  After the death of the monarch, many excesses of reforms were canceled, however, in general terms, the system continued to exist until the 1917 revolution and the Bolsheviks came to power.  Those, by the way, in their anti-church propaganda actively used the image of Peter I, praising his desire to subordinate Orthodoxy to the state. </p>
