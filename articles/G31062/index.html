Calculating machines </p><p>  Blaise Pascal (1623-1662).  For several years, the young scientist has developed more than fifty models of calculating machines, trying to help his father count taxes.  In 1645 he created the "Pascalina", which performed addition and subtraction. </p><p>  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) proposed a <span>counting machine,</span> which he called an arithmometer.  She performed all arithmetic operations. </p><p>  Charles Babbage (1792-1872) - the first software-controlled machine was almost finished and consisted of two parts: calculating and printing.  He put forward promising ideas about the memory of the machine and the processor.  Augusta's assistant scientist Ada Lovelace has developed the world's first computer program <span>.</span> </p><p>  The history of the development of computers.  New ideas, new inventions. </p><p>  <span>Herman Hollerith</span> (1829 - 1896) - invented the tabulator in 1888 - a calculating machine with an electric relay.  Used in the development of punch cards Jacquard. </p><p>  By <span>1900,</span> mechanical calculators and then electromechanical ones entered mass production. </p><p>  Forest - 1906 - the creation of a three-electrode vacuum lamp (triode).  This discovery will subsequently become the impetus for the creation of computers. </p><p>  Konrad Zuse (Germany) invented in 1938 a new mechanical machine that processes information in <span>binary code.</span>  In 1941, an electromechanical one based on a relay appeared, which is considered the first computer controlled by a program.  She performed arithmetic, including floating point. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  John Mauchly and Presper Eckert - in 1946 in Pennsylvania developed the first computer.  It was named ENIAK, had automatic software control. </p><p>  John <span>von Neumann</span> (1903-1957) - mathematician, formulated the principle of "stored program". </p><p>  1949 - University of Cambridge - the new English EDSAC possessed all the components of modern electronic computers. </p><p>  The history of the development of computers.  The first Soviet. </p><p>  In 1951, the MESM (small electronic calculating machine) appeared, which was developed by scientists under the leadership of S. A. Lebedev in a laboratory near Kiev.  Then others were invented, the best of which in the sixties was considered the M-20 computer (created under the leadership of SA Lebedev), which performed twenty thousand operations per second. </p><p>  The history of the emergence of computers.  From generation to generation. </p><p>  First-generation computers (50-60 years of the twentieth century).  The main element is an electronic lamp.  Large volume (covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã170 square meters) and the weight of the machine (30 tons).  The inventors determined the circle of the main components of a computer: processor, RAM, <span>input-output devices.</span> </p><p>  Second-generation computers (60-65 years of the twentieth century).  The elemental base is semiconductor transistors.  The amount of memory (on magnetic hearts) increased 32 times, the speed increased 10 times.  The size and weight of cars decreased, their reliability increased.  New important programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãwere developed: Algol, FORTRAN, COBOL, which made possible the further improvement of programs.  During this period, an I / O processor is created, the use of operating systems begins. </p><p>  Third-generation computers (1965-1970) The <span>elemental base</span> changed transistors to integrated circuits. The dimensions of the computer and their cost were significantly reduced. It became possible to use several programs on one machine. Programming is actively developing. </p><p>  Fourth-generation computers (1970-1984). Element base change - placing tens of thousands of elements on one chip.  Significant expansion of user audience. </p><p>  The further history of the development of computers and ICTs is associated with the improvement of microprocessors, the development of microcomputers that can be owned by individuals.  Steve Wozniak developed the first mass home computer, and then the first personal computer. </p>
