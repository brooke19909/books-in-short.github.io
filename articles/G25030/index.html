Once you buy a set of rechargeable power supplies and a charger, you will save significant money (compared with the regular replacement of standard batteries).  In our review article, we will try to tell you which AAA batteries are better, as well as the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir application, leading manufacturers and popular models. </p><h2>  Classification and dimensions </h2><p>  The battery classification defines a clear correspondence between the size and shape of a product and its alphanumeric or alphanumeric designation (or the so-called form factor).  The "little fingers" batteries called 44 "long" with a diameter of 10 mm according to the American standard are called in common people by three Latin letters - AAA (in the international standardization system - HR03).  Accordingly, AA (HR6) batteries are used instead of disposable ‚Äúfinger‚Äù batteries with a length of 50 mm and a diameter of 14 mm. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  Depending on the chemical composition of the technological elements included in the technical device of the AAA battery, such products are: </p><ul><li>  Lithium Polymer (Li-Pol).  A design feature of such products is a micro-USB connector installed on the case, through which they are charged using the cord supplied.  Such batteries have not yet been widely used because of their very high cost.  For example, a set of two batteries (400 mAh each) Rombica Neo X3 costs about 1000 rubles.  The pluses include increased voltage - 1.5 V. </li><li>  Nickel Cadmium (Ni-Cd).  These rechargeable AAA batteries have been popular for quite some time.  However, taking into account the highly toxic characteristics of cadmium and its derivatives, as well as the increased modern requirements for human environmental safety and the environment, almost all the leading manufacturers of this battery segment have abandoned their production. </li><li>  Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH).  They are the most popular today and are perhaps the best AAA batteries.  The choice of these products is very wide both in terms of manufacturers represented on the Russian market and in terms of price and technical indicators.  Therefore, it is precisely about them that will be discussed in this article. </li></ul><p>  For information!  AA and AAA lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries are no longer available at all. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  AAA Battery Specifications </h2><p>  AAA batteries are characterized by: </p><ul><li>  Operating voltage: 1.2 V. </li><li>  Capacity: 550 to 1100 mAh. </li><li>  The form factor is AAA (HR03). </li><li>  Overall dimensions: length - 44 mm, diameter - 10 mm. </li><li>  Weight: 12-15 grams. </li><li>  The number of full charge / discharge cycles guaranteed by the manufacturer: from 500 to 3000. </li><li>  Uninterrupted service life: from 3 to 10 years. </li><li>  Self-discharge level. </li></ul><h2>  Application area </h2><p>  Rechargeable batteries are used in a wide variety of devices: </p><ul><li>  digital cameras and flash units; </li><li>  video cameras; </li><li>  voice recorders; </li><li>  portable radios and multimedia music centers; </li><li>  wireless game console controllers; </li><li>  hair trimmers; </li><li>  cordless phones; </li><li>  wireless mice, keyboards and headphones; </li><li>  portable CD and MP3 players; </li><li>  children's electromechanical toys (including radio-controlled); </li><li>  miniature flashlights (on incandescent lamps or LEDs); </li><li>  electric shavers, epilators and toothbrushes. </li></ul><p>  The choice of AAA battery capacity directly depends on the energy consumption of a particular device. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  The undoubted advantages of nickel-metal hydride batteries (compared to disposable batteries and rechargeable products based on Li-Pol or Ni-Cd) are: </p><ul><li>  Saving money (the kit purchased once will last for many years). </li><li>  The energy intensity of modern AAA batteries often exceeds that of standard batteries. </li><li>  Modern rechargeable Ni-MH products (unlike batteries) almost do not reduce the amount of energy delivered even at high discharge currents. </li><li>  These products (compared to Ni-Cd) have almost no effect of the so-called memory, so you can put them on charge without waiting for a full discharge.  In this case, there is no deterioration in performance. </li><li>  Full environmental safety of materials used in the manufacture.  This allows you to operate them without causing any harm to human health, and also greatly simplifies the process of subsequent disposal. </li><li>  Large selection of products. </li></ul><p>  The main disadvantage of such products is that manufacturers do not recommend using them at sufficiently low temperatures.  Only some models (usually with the Pro index) are designed to operate at minus 20 degrees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Leading manufacturers </h2><p>  The leading and most popular manufacturers of nickel metal hydride batteries today are: </p><ul><li>  Japanese Panasonic, Sanyo, Sony and Maha; </li><li>  American Duracell and Energizer; </li><li>  German Ansmann and Varta; </li><li>  Dutch Philips; </li><li>  Hong Kong GP; </li><li>  Russian "Cosmos", Robiton and "Bison". </li></ul><p>  All of them have won the trust of consumers and have a good price / quality ratio. </p><h2>  Popular models from Panasonic </h2><p>  The well-known Japanese manufacturer Panasonic, the first to start the production of nickel-metal hydride batteries with a low self-discharge current, remains the unchanged leader in the ratings of AA and AAA batteries. </p><p>  For use with HR03 (AAA) batteries in devices with the form factor, the company offers three types of ‚Äúlittle‚Äù batteries. </p><p>  The "younger" Eneloop Lite model today costs 210-220 rubles.  Having a minimum (compared to more expensive Panasonic products) capacity (550 mAh), the device allows you to carry out the maximum number of recharge cycles available today (up to 3000). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gadgetworld2u.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic Eneloop Lite" class="if uuid-2682715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2682715.jpg"></div><p>  The price of the product Panasonic Eneloop with a capacity of 750 mAh is 260-270 rubles.  The number of full charge / discharge cycles guaranteed by the manufacturer is also very large - 2100. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On a note!  The Panasonic AAA batteries described above retain 70 percent of their charge even after three years of storage. </p><p>  The "older" Eneloop Pro model, which allows 500 full recharge cycles, today has a rather large capacity (950 mAh) for this type of battery and costs 300-320 rubles.  A distinctive feature of this product is the ability to operate at ambient temperatures up to minus 20 degrees.  After a year of storage, such a battery will lose only 15 percent of its initial charge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.slant.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic Eneloop Pro AAA" class="if uuid-2682707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2682707.jpg"></div><p>  For information!  After reading the operating instructions for a particular device, you can determine which AAA batteries are best suited for it. </p><p>  An important advantage of Panasonic Eneloop batteries is that they are sold already charged and ready for direct use (Ready To Use). </p><h2>  GP product line </h2><p>  The AAA batteries (according to numerous customers) from GP are very popular due to the very balanced price / quality ratio.  A Hong Kong-based manufacturer offers the user 6 models of HR03 form factor products with a capacity of 650 to 1000 mAh and a cost of 85 to 150 rubles, respectively.  The number of recharge cycles for all products is the same and is about 1000. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.voltronic.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="GP batteries" class="if uuid-2682728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2682728.jpg"></div><p>  Like all leading manufacturers, GP began to produce batteries with low self-discharge current.  The GP AAA ReCyko + model with a capacity of 850 mAh costs about 140 rubles.  The marking on the Always Ready packaging indicates that the device is already charged and intended for immediate use (without pre-charging). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gpbatteries.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="GP AAA ReCyko" class="if uuid-2682720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2682720.jpg"></div><h2>  Popular models from Energizer and Duracell </h2><p>  Both American manufacturers have long been known to Russian consumers.  In their reviews, they give preference to the two most popular AAA battery models: Duracell Duralock (about 200 rubles) and Energizer Extreme (260 rubles).  Their technical indicators are the same: capacity 800 mAh, the number of recharge cycles - 1000. Both are sold in a charged state, which indicates their low self-discharge current.  And although Duracell guarantees 5 years of trouble-free operation for its product, most likely, under the same operating conditions, Energizer will last no less.  Which AAA batteries are better, only their own experience in their use, with the same energy consumer, will finally be able to judge.  Otherwise, the comparison will be very incorrect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shop.countdown.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Energizer Extreme Batteries" class="if uuid-2682735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2682735.jpg"></div><h2>  The most popular AAA batteries from German manufacturers </h2><p>  Among the "Germans", the most famous and trusted manufacturers of <span>batteries</span> are Varta and Ansmann.  The owners of portable equipment with high energy consumption (such as flash units) are very popular with AAA batteries of both companies with the Professional index.  The cost of both the one and the other model with a capacity of 1000 mAh (Varta Professional AAA and Ansmann Professional AAA) is about the same and amounts to 170-180 rubles.  The only difference: Varta guarantees 1,500 recharge cycles, while Ansmann guarantees only 1,000. Although, in our deep conviction, this is unlikely to dramatically affect the product‚Äôs life span.  With the so-called idle (that is, not using the battery for its intended purpose), both devices save up to 85% of the initial charge during the year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ansmann batteries" class="if uuid-2682764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2682764.jpg"></div><h2>  Products of Russian manufacturers </h2><p>  Naturally, domestic manufacturers are also involved in the production of the popular type of AAA batteries.  Among the popular models, users note "Cosmos KOCR03" and "3ubr Dynamic Pro AAA".  Both models have the maximum capacity for this form factor - 1100 mAh, and they are designed for use in devices with high energy consumption.  The cost is approximately the same and is about 150 rubles.  The number of recharge cycles is about 1000. </p><p>  The Robiton AAA Micro battery (costing 90-100 rubles) has a slightly lower capacity (900 mAh).  The manufacturer positions this product as the cheapest among analogues without a memory effect and with a low self-discharge current. </p><div class="photo" data-original="voinmarket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Batteries Robiton" class="if uuid-2682780" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2682780.jpg"></div><h2>  Charging device </h2><p>  As the best charge for AA and AAA batteries, battery manufacturers naturally recommend their own brand of accessories.  That is, everything is simple, I bought, for example, a Panasonic Eneloop kit, get a Panasonic Basic Charger BQ-CC51E for 1200-1300 rubles.  Such a device will simultaneously charge 2 or 4 products.  The approximate charging time is 8-10 hours (although this indicator will largely depend on how much the batteries have been discharged). </p><div class="photo" data-original="batareyka.km.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic Charger BQ-CC51" class="if uuid-2682786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60729/2682786.jpg"></div><p>  For comparison: a universal <span>charger</span> (AA or AAA) Robiton Smart S100, also designed for simultaneous charging of 2 or 4 batteries, costs 900-950 rubles.  The built-in processor monitors changes in voltage and other electrical parameters and automatically turns off the device at the end of the charging process.  Charging time, depending on battery capacity, varies from 1.5 to 6 hours.  The package includes a power adapter and a power supply for connecting to the cigarette lighter of the car (this greatly expands the functionality of the product). </p><p>  Which of the above devices of the average price category from well-known manufacturers will be the best charge for AA and AAA batteries.  It would seem that everything is simple: Robiton is cheaper and charges faster, Panasonic is more expensive and slower.  However, electronics gurus unequivocally claim that the higher the charging speed (and hence its current), the shorter the battery life and vice versa.  Currently, the cost of nickel-metal hydride batteries is not so high, so some users will not want to achieve their maximum life (5-10 years) in order to save their own time. </p><p>  The most advanced can purchase a high-tech microprocessor-based <span>intelligent charger</span> with the ability to manually set modes and monitor process steps (voltage, current, and capacitance level) on a multi-function LCD screen.  A popular device with such capabilities Robiton Master Charger Pro LCD today costs about 3400 rubles. </p><p>  For information!  Almost all modern chargers are equipped with a protection device against the so-called reverse polarity.  If you accidentally insert the battery incorrectly (that is, mix up ‚Äú+‚Äù and ‚Äú-‚Äù), then this will not lead to failure of either the charger itself or the battery. </p><h2>  What to look for when choosing </h2><p>  When choosing batteries, you should pay attention to several basic aspects: </p><ul><li>  First of all, it's capacity.  The larger it is, the more naturally your device will last longer until the next recharge.  However, the process of restoring the performance of high-capacity products will take longer. </li><li>  If you use the device (with batteries installed in it) often enough, then you can safely purchase standard batteries.  But if you turn on the device from case to case, then buy products with a low self-discharge current.  Then, after taking out the flash from the shelf in half a year, you can be completely sure of its performance.  Conventional batteries in this period will be discharged to zero. </li><li>  The number of reload cycles excites mostly very zealous owners.  Even with a minimum value of this indicator (500) and very intensive operation (recharging every 2 days), the most budget GP batteries will last at least a year and a half. </li></ul><p>  Important!  You should not save too much on the charger, as this leads to a decrease in battery life.  It is best to purchase products with the function of automatic disconnection from trusted manufacturers. </p><p>  The final conclusion, which AAA batteries are best for your CD player or a radio-controlled car of your beloved child, will help you to carefully read the instruction manual (which often indicates the recommended capacity) and consult an experienced sales assistant in a specialized store. </p>
