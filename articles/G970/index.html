Terms on deposits and loans</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  I would like to talk about Solidarity Bank.  Samara is one of the Russian cities in which this bank operates.  Many residents of the city use the services of the bank because it offers its customers profitable loan and deposit programs. </p><h2>  Bank "Solidarity" (Samara).  Addresses of branches and branches </h2><p>  Today, 5 bank branches operate in Samara.  Given the population in this city, we can state that such a number of points of sale is optimal.  The location of branches around the city is also convenient due to the fact that there are no crowded points of the institution, but they are dispersed throughout the city. </p><p>  The department on Kuibyshev street, 90, works on <span>weekdays</span> from 9 to 19 hours. </p><p>  The bank branch on Amineva street, 1, in addition to the daily schedule from 9 to 19, also accepts customers on Saturday.  On this day, the bank is open from 9 am to 3 pm.  The lunch break is floating, that is, the client can receive services at any time. </p><p>  In addition, the bank branch is located on the passage of George Miterev.  The work schedule of this branch is original: from Monday to Saturday - from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.  Of course, without a break. </p><p>  According to the same schedule (from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays, until 5 p.m. on Saturday), branches were opened at the following addresses: </p><p>  - Victory Street, 71; </p><p>  - Pervomaiskaya street, 27. </p><p>  Bank employees are always glad to every client! </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="solidarity bank samara" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29179/957412.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Bank deposits </h2><p>  Solidarity Bank (Samara) offers deposits for individuals on more favorable terms than many competitors.  Of course, experts often explain this phenomenon by the fact that the bank has problems, and it needs funds to solve them by increasing its loan portfolio.  In this case, everything is quite simple.  Bank management understands the desire of customers to earn money on deposits, therefore, sets interest rates in excess of the real inflation rate in the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, consider the Optimum deposit.  You can put money in national currency at 12% per annum.  In foreign currency, the rates are also quite good.  Not every bank can see a rate of 4.5% per annum in euros and dollars.  The deposit is drawn up for a year, and interest is paid to the depositor on a quarterly basis. </p><p>  Another interesting suggestion is the Savings deposit.  Interest rates for this type of passive earnings are 0.5% higher than for the Optimal deposit.  In addition, interest is paid at the end of the contract (in a year), and the minimum deposit amount is only 10,000 rubles and, accordingly, 150 dollars. </p>
