Many will think that this is something complicated from the field of abstruse physics and mathematics, and that this does not concern them.  However, the situation is completely different.  Microwave devices have long and tightly entered our lives, and they can be found everywhere.  But what is it? </p><h2>  Microwave Range </h2><p>  Decoding microwave - ultrahigh frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, which are located in the spectrum between the frequency of the far infrared and ultrahigh frequencies.  <span>The wavelength of</span> this range is from thirty centimeters to one millimeter.  That is why the microwave is sometimes called centimeter and decimeter waves.  In the foreign technical literature, the interpretation of the microwave - microwave range.  It is understood that the wavelength is very small in comparison with broadcasting waves, which are of the order of several hundred meters. </p><h2>  Microwave Properties </h2>

    <p>  In its length, this type of wave is intermediate between the emission of light and radio signals, which is why it has the properties of both types.  For example, like light, these waves propagate along a direct path and are blocked by almost all more or less solid objects.  Like light <span>radiation, microwave</span> can focus, reflect, propagate in the form of rays.  Despite the fact that microwave decoding focuses on the ‚Äúsuper‚Äù -high range, many antennas and radar devices are a slightly enlarged version of mirrors, lenses and other optical elements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Generation </h2><p>  Since microwave radiation is similar to radio waves, it is generated by similar methods.  Decryption of the microwave implies the application of the classical theory of radio waves to it, however, due to the increased range, it is possible to increase the efficiency of its use.  For example, a beam alone can ‚Äúcarry‚Äù up to a thousand telephone conversations at once.  The similarities of microwave waves and light, expressed in increased density of the transmitted information, have been found to be useful for radar technology. </p>

    <h2>  The use of superhigh frequencies in radar </h2><p>  The waves of the centimeter and decimeter ranges became an object of interest even during the Second World War.  At that time, the need for an effective and innovative detection tool arose.  Then, microwave waves were examined for their use in radar.  The bottom line is that intense and short pulses are launched into space, and then part of these rays is recorded after returning from the desired distant objects. </p><h2>  Application of superhigh frequencies in the field of communication </h2>

Engineers and technicians decided to use these radio waves in communications.  In all countries, commercial communication lines based on the transmission of high-frequency waves are actively used.  Such radio signals do not go along the curve of the earth's surface, but in a straight line, through relay communication stations located at heights with intervals of about fifty kilometers. </p><p>  Transmission does not require large expenditures of electricity, since microwave waves allow narrowly focused reception and transmission, and also at stations are amplified by electronic amplifiers before relaying.  A system of antennas, towers, transmitters and receivers seems expensive, but all this pays off for the information capacity of such <span>communication channels.</span> </p><h2>  Application of microwave frequencies in the field of satellite communications </h2><p>  A radio tower system for relaying microwave signals over long distances can exist only on land.  For intercontinental negotiations, artificial satellites are used, which are located in the <span>geostationary orbit of the</span> Earth and act as repeaters.  Each satellite provides several thousand high-quality <span>communication channels to</span> its customers for transmitting television and telephone signals simultaneously. </p>

    <h2>  Heat treatment products </h2><p>  The first attempts to use ultra-high frequencies for food processing received positive, and even enthusiastic, reviews.  Microwave ovens today are used both at home and in large food industries.  The energy generated by high-power electronic lamps is concentrated in an insignificant volume, which allows you to heat the product cleanly, compactly and silently. </p><p>  <span>The built-in microwave oven</span> is most prevalent in the household and can be found in many kitchens.  Also, such household devices are used in all places where fast heating and preparation of dishes is necessary.  A microwave oven with a grill, for example, is an absolutely essential element for any self-respecting restaurant. </p><h2>  The main sources of radiation </h2>

    <p>  Progress in the use of microwave waves is associated with <span>electrovacuum devices such</span> as klystron and magnetron, which are capable of generating a huge amount of high-frequency energy.  The use of a magnetron is based on the principle of a volume resonator, the walls of which are inductance, and the space between the walls is the capacity of the resonant circuit.  The dimensions of this element are selected according to the necessary resonant ultrahigh frequency, which would correspond to the desired ratios between capacitance and inductance. </p><p>  So, microwave decryption - ultra high frequencies.  The size of the generator directly affects the power of such emissions.  Small magnetrons for high frequencies are so small that their powers cannot reach the desired values.  The problem is also with the use of heavy magnets.  In the klystron, it is partially solved, since an external field is not needed in this electrovacuum device. </p>
