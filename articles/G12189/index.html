    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  This hotel complex is already about 17 years old.  But inside, everything is beautiful, modern, new, as well as outside.  That's because in 2015 there was a restoration. </p><p>  Mayor Pelekas Monastery 5 * is located a 2-minute drive from the village of Pelekas, right on the sandy beach of Kontogialos.  It takes about ten minutes to get to Ioannis Kapodistrias Airport (located in Kerkyra, the main city of the island).  The bus stop is located at the very beginning of the village of Pelekas, where you can walk in 15-20 minutes by serpentine or take the free hotel bus, which runs several times a day (the schedule can be checked on the spot). </p><p>  A trip there is exactly the same as in Kerkyra.  Since all the attractions are dispersed in that area.  These are Iperagias Teotoku Mirtidion Monastery, Aqualand Water Park, <span>Achillion Palace,</span> St. Spyridon Church and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  When planning your vacation in Mayor Pelekas Monastery 5 * (Pelekas), it is worth remembering some organizational nuances.  Firstly, check-in here begins at 15:00, and departure lasts until midnight.  Of course, if guests arrived early and their room is already free, they will be settled.  But in the midst of the holiday season, this is hardly possible, since the hotel is popular, and almost all the dates here are busy. </p><p>  In Mayor Pelekas Monastery 5 * (Greece, Corfu), you can stay with children.  Babies up to 2 years old will be provided with a free cradle.  Children under 12 have an extra bed.  If someone older than this age has arrived with guests, then 25% of the cost per person will have to be paid for it.  Need an extra bed?  Then you will need to pay not 25%, but 35%.  By the way, all such nuances are best negotiated with the administration in advance.  You should write about them in your reservation request.  Then the administration will send guests confirmation of the provision of a service. </p><p>  By the way, upon check-in, you will need to present a personal credit card, which was used for pre-booking.  And each guest is required to provide their identification card. </p>
