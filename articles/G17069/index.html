    <h2>  Hurghada, Mamsha district </h2><p>  This area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort is also called the Promenade.  Al-Mamsha is not inferior to Sheraton.  Everything is still clean, beautifully decorated, a decent pedestrian zone.  Many ATMs, pharmacies, cafes with green courtyards and cozy verandas.  Once you leave the territory of the Dessole Marlin Inn Beach Resort (Egypt, Hurghada), you will find yourself in this ocean of modern civilization.  The most attractive corner of El Mamshi is the Esplanade Mall shopping center near the Sinbad Hotel.  There are many shops there, including the Ramstore specialized in selling souvenirs.  The complex itself is built in the form of a rectangle without a roof so that you can enjoy the fresh air.  On the same street is one of the best discos in the area - Little Buddha.  It is recommended for all partygoers.  El Mamsha is a very safe place.  People often come here for walks with children.  While parents are sitting in cafes or on benches along the Promenade, their offspring ride on cars and bicycles, the benefit is to rent them on the avenue is very simple.  They recommend coming here in the evenings: beautiful lighting, romantic atmosphere, tall palm trees planted on both sides of the street ... Concerts, shows, festivals are often held here.  This is one of the few areas of the city whose life is completely devoted to tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marlin inn beach resort hurghada" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1081017.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get, the location is nearby </h2><p>  Marlin Inn Beach Resort is seven kilometers from the airport.  The center of Hurghada is very close.  The hotel goes directly to El Mamsha street with many cafes and restaurants.  If you suddenly get bored in the evening, you will always find where to go for fun.  Across the road from the hotel is the large Cottos Shopping Center.  Here you can find a purchase for the heart, without even leaving too far from the hotel.  Anyway, you can get to any significant place in the center of Hurghada in literally twenty minutes.  And this is a good saving on a taxi.  Even McDonald's is within walking distance.  Moreover, those tourists who visited him, say that the taste of food is different from Russian institutions of the same brand for the better.  The infrastructure outside the beach complex is excellent.  The hotel‚Äôs location is also why vacationers like it because they are brought first from the airport, and taken last during the transfer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marlin inn beach resort 4 hurghada" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1081019.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Like any hotel in the center of Hurghada, the Marlin Inn Beach Resort has a not very large park.  But it is green, beautiful and well-groomed.  The territory is very compact.  The hotel itself is the main building and several buildings.  They are called latin letters.  Bungalows A, B, C and D are next to the main restaurant, and the entire animation program takes place near Building D.  Buildings E, F, G and H are closer to the sea.  Some people like to live in the main building, and some like bungalows.  The rooms in the main building are better, but in the cottages you do not have to constantly run up the stairs to the reception or to the restaurant.  There are also two entrances to the bungalow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marlin inn beach resort reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1081029.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Hotel Marlin Inn Beach Resort is quite large.  It has four hundred and twenty-one numbers.  Most of them are standard.  Approximately eighty rooms located in the main building overlook the sea.  For tourists accustomed to luxury, the hotel has more than twenty suites.  A bottle of mineral water is delivered to the minibar every day.  The room has a safe where you can put money and valuables.  Tourists settle quickly, you do not have to wait long.

    <h2>  Short and short trips </h2><p>  Local travel agencies, which you will meet in large numbers when you leave the territory of the Marlin Inn Beach Resort Hurghada, offer you the same excursions as in a hotel, only half the price.  Experienced travelers are advised not to believe the words of tour operators that if you do not buy a trip from them, then your insurance will not work, or that guides can forget you somewhere, but go quietly with local companies.  In addition to traditional excursions, sightseeing, sea, ATVs, jeeps, Luxor, Cairo are offered ... Recently, vacationers have begun to become interested in trips to Sharm El Naga Bay.  This is also reported by guests of the Marlin Inn Beach Resort.  Feedback on this tour is very positive.  Swimming with a mask in the reserve and then having lunch at a restaurant by the sea is the same as visiting Sharm El Sheikh.  And from long excursions, the Nile cruise is becoming more popular, despite its high cost. </p><h2>  Shopping: how and where to shop </h2><p>  Hurghada is a place where tourists come not only to bask in the winter and summer in the sun, but also to buy something as a keepsake.  And shopping can begin right at the exit of the Dessole Marlin Inn Beach Resort.  The recall of any tourist - whatever you take - mentions a shop with healing and aromatic oils, which is a stone's throw from the hotel.  If you bargain, you can buy a quality product and bring down the price well.  There you can find shops with tea, textiles.  A trip to other Hurghada boardwalks, for example, Marina, from the hotel, will cost two dollars by taxi.  The famous shopping center "Senzo" and "Carrefour" are most attractive for tourists due to fixed prices and a variety of goods (there you can find not only souvenirs, but also T-shirts and other clothes).  Near the Sinbad Hotel, the concentration of shopping centers - Esplanade, Hurghada Star. </p>
