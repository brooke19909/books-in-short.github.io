They are made from beads, beads, polymer clay, rubber bands and many other ways.  Let's look at ways to create original jewelry with your own hands. </p><h2>  <span>What is weaving</span> from soutache </h2><p>  Accessories made from soutache cannot be ignored.  What it is?  Perhaps this word is not so famous as the products themselves, which everyone saw directly.  Soutache is a braided silk lace that is used to decorate clothes, usually for children and women. </p><p>  Weaving from soutache, first of all, is carried out thanks to the monophonic thread, with the help of which the cords are fixed.  And if you have at least a little sewing experience, it will not be difficult for you to master this type of decorative art. </p>

    <h2>  History of Art </h2><p>  Soutache embroidery has been known since the 14th century, when it was actively used in the decoration of women's clothing in France.  Later, this technique (soutache) began to be used to create jewelry. </p><p>  In Russia during the time of Peter I, this type of decoration was also known.  In the XIX-XX centuries, he was successfully forgotten.  However, in the 90s of the last century, thanks to the Israeli designer Mehale Nagrin, who used it to create jewelry, the technique received a second life.  Currently, the "soutache" technique is used in the manufacture of handbags, earrings, bracelets, necklaces and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Is it possible to make such jewelry at home?  Of course.  Soutache is an unusual way of creating jewelry, involving the use of silk lace.  By wrapping them around beads or stones, you can get excellent patterns. </p><h2>  Features of weaving from soutache </h2><p>  Before you start creating your dream jewelry, it is advisable to draw a sketch of the planned product.  It is not necessary to do this with absolute similarity, but the schematic drawing does not hurt.  Here are some more tips: </p><ol><li>  Begin in the middle, using a stitch string of several additions for sewing.  Embroider it with the main element and after that begin to add other components of the accessory. </li><li>  The wrong side is very important not only from an aesthetic point of view, but also because it is necessary that the product does not fall apart.  Therefore, attach a piece of leather or felt, circle in shape, cut and shape the wrong side. </li><li>  Handle the finished product carefully, as the soutache cord is easily damaged, and if one bead falls out, it will be problematic to correct the situation. </li></ol><p>  Below we will look at how you can make a bracelet using the `` soutache '' technique.  A master class for beginners will help you master this type of needlework in the shortest possible time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What is required to create a soutache bracelet </h2><p>  So, prepare the following materials and tools: </p><ol><li>  Several suture laces of different colors. </li><li>  Beads with a diameter of 5 mm and 3 mm. </li><li>  Threads of the same colors as the laces. </li><li>  Clamp. </li><li>  A small piece of skin. </li><li>  Clasp for bracelet. </li></ol><p>  When all of the above is prepared, you can begin to manufacture a bracelet. </p><h2>  Making jewelry from soutache together </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="technique soutache" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1637174.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  A master class is designed for an average of 3 hours.  Proceed: </p><ol><li>  In this technique, you should start from the middle of the product, but not from the end.  Take a large bead and secure it between the two cords.  The bead should be firmly fixed between them.  Lock the laces with threads. </li><li>  Next, take two more shoelaces of different colors and continue to sheathe the bead. </li><li>  Add 4 more beads, securing them to the sides of the main. </li><li>  Stitch the beads with soutache. </li><li>  Using small beads, form a semicircle around one of the 4 beads, then near the second one close to it. </li><li>  Fasten the ends of the stitch. </li><li>  Follow the entire procedure from the other side. </li><li>  To make the side parts, you should take two cords and fold them in half.  Arrange small beads in the middle at the same distance. </li><li>  Add a couple more layers of soutache by inserting small beads between the beads of already finished rows. </li><li>  Cut the excess thread and fix the ends with a special clip. </li><li>  So make the second part of the bracelet, sew it with the central blank. </li><li>  Sheathe the inside of the decoration center with pieces of leather.  Cut them according to the size of the middle part. </li><li>  Attach the clasps. </li></ol>

    <p>  You can start making the necklace using the Soutache technique.  The photo shows how this product should turn out. </p><ol><li>  Glue the cat's eye to a dense fabric.  Cut it, leaving an allowance of a couple of millimeters. </li><li>  Shell the stone with beads.  Use two each. </li><li>  Take a soutache cord 35-40 cm long and wrap the cabochon with it, sewing the edges of the cord to the fabric. </li><li>  Add a silver lace, and in the upper part, between the two cords, add beads and a black pearl. </li><li>  Add the agate bead at the top, framing it with a silver soutache. </li><li>  Sew half of the row with agate beads. </li><li>  Stitch them with two cords and at the end connect the blue and silver cords with the previous row, stitching with a needle. </li><li>  Fold the cords in the opposite direction and continue the new row with mother-of-pearl beads. </li><li>  At the end of the row, add an 11mm mother-of-pearl bead and surround it with cords. </li><li>  Cut off the excess cord, slightly singe its end so that it does not creep. </li><li>  To form a necklace ribbon, fasten a large agate bead in the upper part and then lay out the pearl beads with a snake, wrapping them around with a silver cord. </li></ol><p>  You have half of the product with the central part ready.  Make the second part of the product in the same way. </p><p>  Try on the decoration.  If the length suits you, then you can start making the fastener: </p><ol><li>  Make a loop on one side and sew a large bead on the other. </li><li>  Cut a piece of skin of the right size and glue it to the back of the center. </li></ol><p>  That's all weaving `` soutache. ''  The master class for beginners came to an end.  Your necklace is done! </p><p>  Soutache is a form of art that allows you to create unique jewelry and accessories, embody all your ideas and express yourself through the creation of beauty. </p>
