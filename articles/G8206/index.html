    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The village of Golubitskaya (boarding house "Nadezhda") has its own dining room, located on the territory of the recreation complex.  Three meals a day.

The menu has a wide variety of fish and meat dishes, freshly prepared juices, plenty of greens and fresh vegetables.  All products are purchased from local manufacturers.  The cuisine is Russian and European.

The water park has five runs for adults.  The most twisted of them - "Twister".  This is a closed pipe through which you have to "fly" at a speed of about 8 m / s.  A more terrible descent is Kamikaze.  Most of the descendants do not even have time to get scared - the angle of the slope is almost 40 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Golubitskaya, boarding house &quot;Hope&quot;" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/1569942.jpg" width="600"></div>
