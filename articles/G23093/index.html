    <p>  It should be noted that musicians work exclusively "live".  The main style is the tunes of the last century.  In particular: blues, rock and roll, jazz, disco, funk and rock. </p><p>  The Jagger Club selects the musicians very carefully.  Address of one of the most famous institutions of St. Petersburg: pl.  Constitution, 2. Relatively close to two metro stations. </p><p>  The restaurant has its own site, which is constantly updated.  It is there that you can learn about the numerous performances and concerts of your favorite musicians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tasty food </h2><p>  However, not all customers come to the club because of the performances of the artists.  Many are attracted to the rich restaurant menu.  The complex has an excellent cuisine, the dishes of which are praised by all, without exception.  You can try here Mexican, European and American delicacies.  Talented cooks are responsible for the quality of food. </p><p>  Jagger Club offers its customers a bite to eat both main courses and exclusive soups.  Especially often, visitors order branded sausages and snacks for a foamy drink.  The institution offers three types of beer, the price of which fluctuates around 200 rubles per glass.  You can also enjoy delicious desserts. </p><p>  However, visitors claim that it is best to dine here and order a business lunch.  Such a complex is very satisfying, tasty and inexpensive, regular customers share.  It should be noted that every day the dishes change. </p><p>  In addition, on weekends and <span>holidays, the</span> administration offers various promotions and discounts both on the kitchen menu and on the bar card. </p>

    <h2>  Public Administration Collaboration </h2><p>  The Jagger Nightclub can immediately seat more than 200 people at tables.  Other customers, meanwhile, are watching a concert program at a wide dance floor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The interior is especially pleasant for guests.  Style reflects the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe club.  Everything is designed in dark colors.  Comfortable soft sofas and large tables face the stage.  This allows you not to leave the feast and enjoy the music.  The adjacent seats are fenced off by high walls.  Therefore, other visitors will not prevent you from having fun in the company of friends, guests say. </p><p>  It is very convenient to conduct business conversations, anniversaries and companions.  The administration pays attention to the requests of the public and often invites famous singers to the club.  Those who book a room for a large company can agree with the management on the performance of their musician. </p>

    <h2>  Uncultured workers </h2><p>  However, the Jagger club has its drawbacks.  Dissatisfied customers leave especially many negative reviews about the work of the staff.  In particular, in the comments you can often find information that the waiters practically require a tip from visitors. </p><p>  Also, employees do not navigate their own menu, so asking them to recommend one of the dishes is pointless, guests say.  The audience also complains that it is very difficult to pass control at the entrance during the holidays.  Usually only those who pay a large deposit on the doorstep are allowed inside. </p><p>  Do not please guests and high prices for alcoholic beverages.  Also, customers do not like the fact that in the middle some people smoke.  The room is filled with cigarette smoke. </p><p>  Another caveat to get used to: the Jagger Club is a very popular place.  Therefore, the hall is always full of diverse audiences.  There are so many people that it‚Äôs sometimes impossible to even chat and enjoy music.  On the other hand, this suggests that the place is popular and worthy of your attention.  In bad clubs, a lot of people would not gather. </p>

    <h2>  Negative side of the club </h2><p>  Often, guests note that the bar sells low-quality alcohol.  However, the administration says that drinks are a kind of institution reputation, so the management carefully monitors its goods. </p><p>  Another negative point is dishonest customers.  There were times when visitors complained about lost and stolen things. </p><p>  Good music is why people go to the Jagger Club.  Reviews on the dance floor are good.  There are a lot of tables in the hall, but they are constantly reserved, customers note.  There are practically no empty seats.  And given the fact that the institution is crowded, it‚Äôs very difficult to dance and enjoy the concert, visitors complain.  Due to the fact that the room is crowded, very long lines are formed.  Especially long have to go through face control and wait at the wardrobe. </p>

    <h2>  Popular place </h2><p>  In addition to all of the above, some visitors are not happy with the location.  The metro is quite far (1.5-2 kilometers from the station).  Also, customers do not like the fact that tables can only be booked until 22:00.  After this time, places are given to other guests.  Those who are left without armor have the opportunity to sit at the barrier near the dance floor. </p><p>  Many people are sure that their celebration can only make the Jagger Club unforgettable.  Photos are very bright and positive.  A large crowd of people does not interfere with regular visitors to this establishment.  Customers say the more people, the more fun.  In addition, the administration is quite coping with such a mass of people. </p><p>  The staff manages to accept and deliver orders, so there is no need to wait.  Security ensures that the club does not have drunk guests.  And another important plus - the room has an excellent ventilation system.  Even despite the large influx of visitors, the hall is always fresh and cool. </p><h2>  Great evening </h2><p>  Control at the entrance to the institution is adequate and polite, regular customers share.  Although security is not very strict with the appearance of visitors, still the guests are always neat and well-dressed.  It is often complained that the administration looks in bags and too meticulously checks the public.  However, other guests understand that such a safety measure is primarily designed to ensure order in the hall. </p>

    <p>  People also like the fact that usually adult visitors hang out in an institution.  The audience comes to enjoy an amazing concert with clear sound.  A large screen hangs over the stage, on which events in the hall are broadcast.  Therefore, even those who, during a performance, have fun with friends around the table, can watch the musicians. </p><p>  Has its regular customers club "Jagger".  Telephone institutions can be found in directories.  It does not make sense to indicate it here, since it often changes.  By calling the administration, you can reserve a table for free and order a menu for the evening, which will be unforgettable. </p>
