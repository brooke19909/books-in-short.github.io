These lands are famous for their black soil.  One of the first researchers even spoke about this - Przhevalsky wrote that it is in this area that the climate is very mild and the most fertile lands along the entire coast of the Sea of ​​Japan. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="42.9522157" data-lng="133.11048519999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/2/3/423.png"></div><h2>  Village of the same name </h2><p>  On the territory of Unashi there are several rural settlements.  One of them is the Golden Valley of the Partisan district of the Primorsky Territory.  It was founded in 1884, and the modern name was given in 1972.  About 3 thousand people live in the settlement, and the village itself is located on the left bank of the Partizanskaya river.  A highway runs through the entire settlement: Nakhodka-Kavalerovo.  Almost on the territory of the village there is an aerodrome of the same name and a military garrison, and there are many interesting places in the district. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techmonuments.livejournal.com" data-author=": xplight, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Airport airplane" class="if uuid-2241031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2241031.jpg"></div><h2>  Aerodrome </h2><p>  Over the past 10 years, no aircraft have taken off from a local airfield.  Over more than 60 years of history (founded in 1954), the base has served the needs of military and civilians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Initially, the airfield in the Golden Valley of Primorsky Krai was called Unashi.  Then the 47th Fighter Regiment was based here.  The base became famous in the late 40s, after participating in hostilities in Korea.  About 60 pilots of this airport received distinctions for guarding the air borders of the Far East. </p><p>  In 1991, a decision was made on the joint deployment of civil and military aircraft at the airport.  And in 1994, a cargo and passenger terminal was introduced at the base of the military airport. </p><p>  In 1998, military aviation was disbanded, and aircraft and navigation equipment were taken out.  As a result, the airport becomes completely civilian, but without the equipment necessary for carrying out flights.  Financing from outside does not come, later the directors of the enterprise condemn for appropriation of the remaining funds, but after some time they justify and release it.  Now the whole territory is covered with grass, the hangars are almost destroyed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kimuracars.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Motolife and Japanese auctions" class="if uuid-2241036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2241036.jpg"></div><h2>  Motolife </h2><p>  The Golden Valley of <span>Primorsky Krai</span> is famous for the friendly family Motolife.  This is not just a motorcycle salon selling real Japanese motorcycles, it is an interest club.  In fact, a team of like-minded people is organizing and conducting biker rallies.  Also helps everyone to participate in the auction.  First, a technique is selected.  According to certain parameters, the estimated cost is approved, and if you manage to win the auction, the buyer receives the desired motorcycle.  Equipment, especially brought from Japan, is associated with incredible drive and unstoppable speed, so there is no shortage of buyers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="nocturneism.livejournal.com" data-author=": nocturneism, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Catherine massif" class="if uuid-2241041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2241041.jpg"></div><h2>  Shaiginsky settlement </h2><p>  The village of Zolotaya Dolina of the <span>Primorsky Territory</span> is famous not only for military sights and a biker club.  Near the village in 1891, the Shaiginsky settlement was discovered. </p><p>  This ancient monument of regional significance is located on the southern island of Sikhote-Alin.  Four gates erected in the medieval style of the Far East are found here.  The gates in the central part are fenced with an L-shaped hilt (fortification), which is about 30 meters long. </p><p>  In general, the territory of the settlement represents a whole system of ramparts, ravines of natural origin, between which the streets lie.  The whole territory is divided into quarters, which were intended for different segments of the population.  Found production facilities.  In all likelihood, several thousand people lived in this city. </p><p>  Excavations in the Golden Valley of Primorsky Krai confirm that earlier people living in this territory professed Buddhism and Taoism.  However, ordinary people preferred ancient Turkic shamanism.  Some elements of these cultures can be seen among the Nanai, Udege, and Manchu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nat-geo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nature of unashi" class="if uuid-2241050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2241050.jpg"></div><h2>  Mountain ranges </h2><p>  Partizansky district has the most beautiful natural monuments, of which there are about 28. The route “Eastern Ring of Russia” will often include a visit to the Catherine Massif.  This is a beautiful landscape with vertical slopes and numerous caves. </p><p>  Tourists are offered visiting caves: </p><ul><li>  Heavenly. </li><li>  Partisan. </li><li>  Lion’s. </li><li>  Tiger and several others. </li></ul><p>  The territory of 50 hectares, where the Catherine Massif is located (Zolotaya Dolina, Primorsky Krai), is famous for the Lysa Mountain and Lozov Ridge.  The last mountain range is the highest in the entire Far East (759 meters), in addition, many legends and myths hang around it.  It is believed that in the dungeon of the ridge there is an underground kingdom, where there is a gallery of bas-reliefs and hidden untold treasures of ancient civilization. </p><p>  Today the Golden Valley is a unique and, in modern terms, branded place of the Primorsky region. </p>
