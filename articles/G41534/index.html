But even Nokia experts did not expect the South Korean manufacturer to jump over the bar that existed then in the field of protecting its devices.  More specifically, Samsung has abandoned the IP54 standard in favor of IP57.  At the same time, the Finnish manufacturer was developing its device in order to withstand the Samsung M110 model.  But in practice it turned out that the B2100 Xplorer appeared in the role of a real opponent.  And this was a real surprise for the Finns.  Nevertheless, the current situation cannot be considered from only one point of view.  Also, we will not be able to give an unambiguous answer to the question of which of these devices is better.  But first things first. </p><h2>  Duel manufacturers </h2>

    <p>  The reader should be aware that the market for mobile devices that belonged to the protected class was really small.  It has never been that he possessed a huge (and even large) assortment of models.  It is logical to assume that in this, so to speak, segment between key players, an extremely difficult battle is unfolding.  As soon as a new device appears, it should take someone's place, forcing the enemy out of his position.  And then, on one side of the barricade, the first company is moving its apparatus forward by all means, and on the other side the other company is making every effort to prevent a competitor from carrying out an insidious plan.  What does all this say?  The fact is that we have a similar situation in this case.  However, the South Korean manufacturer has certain advantages.  For example, one can note the fact that sales of the next device developed by Samsung started much earlier. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Positioning </h2>

    <p>  Nokia 3720 Classic, the price of which at the start of sales amounted to six thousand rubles, was developed and presented to a wide audience as a youth solution.  Especially according to the plan of the Finnish manufacturer, people involved in extreme sports should appreciate the phone. </p><h2>  Differences from predecessor </h2><p>  There are some similarities between the subject of our review today, as well as the <span>Nokia 5500</span> Sport.  That is why the last device is usually called the prototype or predecessor of the Nokia 3720, reviews of which you can read at the end of this article.  Nevertheless, the 5500 model had a whole list of additional functions that were cut down in the device we reviewed.  We can say that from the moment the device under the name ‚ÄúNokia 3720‚Äù entered the international arena of mobile devices, models built on the principle of operation of the C40 platform have become a protected segment of the company. </p>

    <p>  Actually, this is the reason that some specialized functions have disappeared.  Among them, by the way, included satellite maps with navigation on the corresponding elements.  The consequence of all this internal turmoil (otherwise it is really impossible to call the application of a concept not thought out by the Finnish manufacturer) was the offer of devices at a lower cost.  After all, who would want to overpay the extra money, and in return get a phone with reduced functionality?  It is unlikely that buyers would make such a decision.  Whether it‚Äôs the case when the device is sold on the market for a price corresponding to the functional bar.  Then it‚Äôs really possible to say that the ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù ratio in this case is fulfilled in the ideal variant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Preliminary conclusion </h2><p>  Nokia 3720 Classic was the first device of the Finnish manufacturer, which was equipped with incomplete functionality, but claimed to win a large number of hearts.  We can say that the model laid the foundation for a food contract, since the followers of the device did not have great capabilities in the corresponding plan.  Yes, it‚Äôs possible to say that a certain level of protection was present.  But the Finnish manufacturer almost stopped there, for some reason without taking any action to improve this technology tree.  Strange, but things should be called by their proper names.  Nevertheless, under such conditions, the ‚Äú3720 Classic‚Äù model became a good competitor to the devices offered by the South Korean company ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù at that time.  In general, the direction and vector of action were set, and that at that time was the most important.  Note that to purchase the subject of our today's review can those people who are looking for a well-protected phone, equipped with good appearance and at the same time sold at the lowest price. </p>

    <h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The dimensions of the phone are as follows: in height - 115 millimeters with a width of 47 mm.  The thickness of the device reaches 15.3 mm.  Moreover, the mass of the device is 94 grams.  According to such dimensions, to say that the model belongs to the class of protected devices is very, very difficult, but in fact everything is just that way. </p>

    <h2>  Exterior Features </h2><p>  The back panel is made of matte plastic.  There is also a special rotary screw.  Around the case along its perimeter stretched a metal frame.  Perhaps all of these components can be called characteristic features of the phone.  Plastic, by the way, is made soundly enough.  A similar solution was applied to some other devices from the class of inexpensive phones.  Using your finger to pull out the locking screw does not work.  To do this, you will need to use some subject.  In the absence of specialized tools, even an ordinary coin can be used. </p>

    <h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  The device is assembled quite high quality.  All openings were sealed.  There is an additional film that provides moisture resistance.  However, something in more detail about her will not work. </p><h2>  Security level </h2><p>  Defining his device in the class of protected devices, the Finnish manufacturer did not win in his head.  Even if we consider the most fragile part of the design (and in almost any phone it is a screen), we can immediately note that even it is protected very effectively.  Such a device can be thrown as much as you want and anywhere, and at the same time it will not be particularly harmful.  On the World Wide Web you can find videos on which the company's specialists captured the test of strength and other "bullying" committed on the model.  Even by today's standards, the reliability of the device is at a good level.  Needless to say, then this level delighted a huge number of users. </p><p>  The company conducted the most interesting test when the phone was immersed in a glass of water.  In practice, such an experiment will end for the device not with instant, but with gradual death.  Yes, death for the device does not come right on the same day, but immersion in a liquid will significantly reduce the period of possible operation.  Let us respect the protection standards and therefore, for the sake of fairness, we recall that IP54 was designed to protect against individual splashes.  But this standard will not cope with immersion in a liquid, that's for sure.  That's about something, and potential buyers of the device should not forget about it. </p><h2>  Color schemes </h2><p>  From the very beginning, it was assumed that the phone will be delivered in four colors to the mobile device market.  However, when sales started, on the official website of the company, the model appeared in only two solutions.  This, as always, is a classic of the genre. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  We remind readers that you can always find themes for the Nokia 3720 on the official website of the Finnish manufacturer, and in the meantime, we move on to listing the shortcomings and advantages of the model based on the reviews left by people who have walked through this mobile phone. </p><p>  As usual, it will not be possible to dig into the devices of the Finnish manufacturer in terms of communication quality.  This automatically puts a small plus.  However, the problem arises when using ringtones.  According to reviews, the speaker is not as strong as I would like to see and hear, and to miss an incoming call in a noisy environment is really possible. </p><p>  Otherwise, consumers note a good level of security.  Another plus.  But if we discard this parameter and look at the functionality of the closest competitors of the subject of our today's review, we will notice many decisions that look more favorable against the corresponding background.  The functionality of the model that we examined today, as users note, is at a fairly low level, and this is a significant drawback. </p>
