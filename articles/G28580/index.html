  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Travel to Kronstadt. Dam</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the obligatory points of the program for tourists visiting St. Petersburg is a trip to Kronstadt.  The dam is the only land road that connects the <span>island of Kotlin</span> with the coast of the Gulf of Finland.  It is this building that is important not only for transport accessibility, but also for the safety of the city.  What role does Kronstadt play in this?  A dam is a structure in the form of a road located in the bulk territory.  Throughout its length there are special gateways that can open and close if necessary.  This is what helps regulate the water level in the Neva and prevent possible flooding. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-314035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15653/314035.jpg?1542659024"></div><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  So, how did the idea to connect the shore of the bay and Kronstadt come about?  The dam appeared here recently, although its construction was planned back in the early twentieth century.  Talk about its construction and the prevention of a possible recurrence of sad events began even after the violence of the elements described in Pushkin's poem <span>"The Bronze Horseman".</span>  However, far from immediately these conversations became a matter.  For a very long time, ferry was the only way to get to Kronstadt.  The dam appeared only in the early 2000s and connected the island with the northern part of St. Petersburg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Initially, Kronstadt was a military city, and only sailors lived on its territory.  For ordinary citizens there was no need to visit him, but they would not have been allowed.  However, after the discovery of the island, ferry services ceased to satisfy demand.  Despite this, the second part of the dam was built just a few years ago.  This is due to the fact that on the second construction site it was required to design and build an underground tunnel, which would help ensure a continuous traffic flow and free passage for ships that enter St. Petersburg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-314036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15653/314036.jpg?1542659024"></div><p>  But is Kronstadt popular for tourists?  The dam certainly made it more accessible.  You can get to it with the help of public transport routes and fixed-route taxis.  The road from the <span>metro station "Old Village"</span> to the city center takes about 40 minutes, depending on traffic jams. </p><p>  For many residents, it is the dam that is attractive to visit.  Kronstadt and its environs bear a certain romantic stamp, due to its isolation and solitude from the bustle of the city.  The uninhabited part of the island is cut up by the remains of ancient forts and fortifications that keep in themselves the memory of past battles.  Locals and tourists have chosen these places for walks and picnics, lovers of extreme sports also like to spend time on the beaches of the island.  The dam (Kronstadt), a photo of which can be found in more than one album about a trip to St. Petersburg, will be remembered not only for its architecture, but also for its atmosphere. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-314037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15653/314037.jpg?1542659024"></div><p>  So, for any traveler, there are several reasons to visit Kronstadt.  The dam, architecture, warships, unusual atmosphere - all these are the distinctive features of this place, and they attract many tourists every day here.  And even though the beauty of Kronstadt is severe and strict, precisely in the clear geometry of the streets along which the dank sea wind walks, is its splendor, which is hard to put into words. </p>
