Attractions, of course.  For example, you should see the church of Saints Peter and Paul.  It was built in the thirteenth century.  This is a solid, solid, squat stone building, next to which you can feel the spirit of the early Middle Ages.  Both outside and inside the building amazes with majestic simplicity.  Unique murals were created at different time intervals.  Therefore, they represent a certain chronology of church architecture. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  In the old part of the city is <span>the Cathedral of the</span> Nativity of the Virgin.  The current church was built on the site of the foundation left from the Orthodox church, which was significantly damaged by the 1913 earthquake.  The cathedral was completely rebuilt only twenty years later.  It is a light gray monolithic building with green domes. </p><h2>  Church of the Forty Martyrs </h2><p>  Describing the attractions of the resort of Veliko Tarnovo, it is worth paying attention to the Church of the Forty Martyrs. </p>

    <p>  This is a magnificent architectural complex.  In 1230, Tsar Ivan Asen II defeated the army of the ruler of the kingdom of Epirus.  This battle took place on the day of the Forty Martyrs.  Therefore, the temple, which the king decided to build in order to perpetuate the memory of his victory, was named in honor of this church holiday.  Centuries later, when the Turks seized power in the Balkans, the church was converted into a mosque.  Icons, of course, were destroyed.  An earthquake in the early twentieth century also caused significant damage to the structure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The surviving remains of the church are part of the National Historical Museum of Sofia. </p><h2>  Fortress Tsarevets </h2><p>  What other <span>attractions</span> in Veliko Tarnovo <span>(Bulgaria)</span> deserve attention?  For example, lovers of antiquity should visit the Tsarevets fortress.  Built at a time when Bulgaria was the most powerful state in the Balkans, it has been perfectly preserved to this day.  Despite the fact that it was significantly destroyed by the Turks, timely and carefully restored, the fortress is a delightful corner of medieval architecture.  On its territory were discovered the remains of ancient settlements of the Romans, Thracians and Byzantines.  In the center of the fortress, which resembles a small town in size, is the Palace of the Bulgarian Patriarchate, as well as the Church of the Ascension of the Lord.  In the fortress there is a Baldwin‚Äôs tower, so named in memory of the crowned captive of the Emperor of the Latin Empire, Baldwin of Flanders.  In 1205, his troops were defeated at the battle of Adrianople.  The emperor himself was captured by his opponent, the Bulgarian king, Kaloyan.  For the love of Tsar Baldwin‚Äôs wife they were put to a terrible and painful death.  So the legend goes.  Historians claim that he was in prison on charges of rebellion against the king.  And he was executed along with other conspirators. </p>
