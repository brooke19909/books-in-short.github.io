    <p>  <strong>Seoul, South Korea</strong> </p><p>  Among other things, it is also a very ancient city.  He had the status of the capital of one of the ancient Korean kingdoms even before our era.  Monuments of material culture have not been preserved from such deep antiquity, even the name of the city managed to change several times over a couple of millennia.  But against the background of this hoary antiquity, it is only more interesting to observe the dynamic breakthrough in development that Seoul made.  South Korea has become a leader in economic growth not only in Asia, but also in the entire industrial world.  Many Korean-made products won the global market in fierce competition.  For example, Korean cars and consumer electronics are known on all continents.  And this was achieved due to the natural hard work of the Korean people, multiplied by effective management and breakthrough technologies in the field of electronics and precision mechanics.  If you want to see in reality the materialized features of the near future, then you should go to Seoul for this.  South Korea is a visible image of technological and <span>social progress.</span>  The city, transformed in half a century from a provincial Asian slum into a kind of new urban civilization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="south korea city seoul" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/247716.jpg" width="492"></div>  Seoul transforms before its eyes and changes its appearance.  It will be difficult to recognize in ten years.  It is quite common here to demolish buildings and structures.  Not because they are outdated, it is just planned to build something more impressive in their place.  This is Seoul.  South Korea is well reflected in the mirrored faces of the skyscrapers of its capital.  But if it is so easy to say goodbye to the past here, what about the sights?

Despite more than two thousand years of history, there are not very many antiquities in a huge city.  This is due to the peculiarities of historical development and the Korean mentality.  It was not customary to build here for centuries and millennia.  The wooden city many times in its history thoroughly burned.  Even during the great <span>Korean war</span> between North and South in the mid-twentieth century, he twice changed hands.  But with all this, there is even something to look at.  First of all, we are talking about six ancient wooden palaces: Chandokkun, Gyeongbokgung, Toksugun, Chiang Kung Gong, Unhyung Gong and Gyeong Gong.  They are carefully restored and maintained in good condition.  This is the national historical heritage of a republic such as South Korea.  Seoul has many other interesting tourist sites. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="South Korea Seoul Attractions" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/247715.jpg" width="496"></div>  One of them is the ancient city gate of Namdaemun.  They are currently under restoration.  In general, the tourism industry here is just starting to gain good momentum.  So far, travelers from Europe and America are much less than from Japan and China.
