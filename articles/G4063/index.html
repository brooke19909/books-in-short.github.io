Most often, a new thing when examined in more detail raises a lot of questions.  Claims can be both to the quality of the product, and to its appearance and functions.  Take, for example, a floor-mounted electronic scale.  Customer reviews say that this item should be in every home.  But at the same time, choosing a really good device is quite problematic. </p>

    <h2>  Weight control </h2><p>  The abundance of cheap, but greasy and junk food has made us hostages of extra pounds.  That is why weight control is not another fashionable feature, but rather a necessity.  Obesity leads to a number of health problems, which means that every person must watch his figure, if not for the sake of maintaining standards of beauty, then at least for the sake of well-being.  This is how the scales turned from a device that can be found mainly in a hospital and in a store, into a thing vital in every home. </p><h2>  Mechanics or Electronics </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best electronic floor scales" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11340/391961.jpg?1399556953964" width="530"></div></h2><p>  The choice of scales, in fact, comes down to two options: old and reliable mechanical devices and newer electronic floor scales.  Price often plays a decisive role, and mechanical devices are leaders.  They are much cheaper than their electronic counterparts; their price range starts from 250 rubles.  Such a purchase is affordable for absolutely all categories of citizens - both pensioners and students, even <span>for unemployment benefits,</span> you can buy such a device.  True, they have a number of minuses: they have little accuracy, and the error only increases over time due to the weakening of the spring.  In addition, these models do not provide additional functions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The advantages of electronic scales </h2><p>  Electronic floor scales differ from mechanical ones by the presence of a display on which the weighing results are displayed.  However, this is not the only difference.  Most models are equipped with a memory that allows you to record all measurements.  Expensive devices are equipped with the following functions: </p><ul><li>  automatic determination of <span>body mass index:</span> before the first weighing, information about the growth is entered into the device, after which the device gives the calculated BMI value; </li><li>  user identification: during the measurement, the device itself determines which of the users registered in the memory is weighed; </li><li>  <span>wireless monitor:</span> this makes it possible not to lean every time to the floor, but to see the result literally in the palm of your hand; </li><li>  automatic inclusion of the device. </li></ul><h2>  Weight Analyzer Function </h2><p>  There is another advantage that electronic floor scales have.  Weight Analyzer is a very useful application.  You do not just measure weight and determine BMI, but you can also determine the percentage of muscle mass, adipose tissue and body fluids.  No miracles, all strictly according to science: when a person gets on the scales, a small electric discharge passes through him.  So small that it does not feel at all.  However, this discharge allows you to fix the biometric resistance of body tissues.  The analysis of this information allows you to calculate the percentage of muscles, adipose tissue and fluids, which means that it allows you to very carefully assess the state of the body. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Instructions for use </h2><p>  Most people believe that they know how to use such a device as electronic floor scales.  The instruction, however, warns of several general rules that must be followed without fail: </p><ol><li><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic scales" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11340/392333.jpg?1399608203864" width="392"></div></h2>  Do not stand on the device with wet feet or on the wet surface of the balance. </li><li>  You need to become so that the weight is concentrated on the central part of the device. </li><li>  Do not use the scales in the presence of defects and damage on the glass surface. </li><li>  Do not use scales on carpets. </li><li>  The device must be placed on a flat, dry and non-slip surface. </li><li>  To reduce the error, weight control must be performed at the same place. </li><li>  Do not place the balance near heating devices. </li><li>  Do not store and use the device in rooms with a humidity of more than 80%. </li><li>  Do not allow the scales to get wet, as this will lead to their failure or to an increase in the error. </li><li>  It is forbidden to disassemble the scales, as well as to repair them yourself.  For any breakdown, you must contact the service center. </li></ol><h2>  Floor electronic scales: positive reviews </h2><p>  The opinion of customers is quite clear: most of them are sure that electronic scales are much better than their mechanical counterparts.  First of all, they are convenient to use - no need to look closely at the position of the arrow on the scale.  This is especially important for people with low vision.  We have already talked about additional features above, and they also positively affect customer demand. </p><p>  Among all electronic scales, buyers distinguish several favorites.  Price was not a determining factor; only functionality, accuracy and design were taken into account.  The best scales - floor electronic Beurer BF100.  Cost - from 6000 rubles.  The second and third places were shared by Zelmer-34Z011 and Saturn ST-PS-1240. </p><h2>  Floor electronic scales: negative reviews </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic scales outdoor weight analyzer" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11340/391952.jpg?1399557068516" width="500"></div></h2><p>  However, despite all the advantages, some people are not happy with the purchase.  So, what complaints did the electronic floor scales cause?  Customer reviews are as follows: the device is not accurate, it is inconvenient to use it, or it pretty quickly fails.  But all these claims relate to inexpensive scales, for example, Tefal, Supra, Redber.  Their cost does not exceed 1000 rubles, and it is they who most often become leaders in sales.  In fairness, it should be noted that a significant part of the claims are presented unreasonably: inaccuracy, high error and even failure occur due to violation of the instructions for use. </p><p>  The biggest inconvenience when using electronic devices is the need to connect the device to the network, which limits mobility, or the constant replacement of batteries. </p><h2>  Industrial scale </h2>

    <p>  Floor electronic scales are not only available in a compact version, with a measuring range of up to 200 kg. </p><p>  Electronic industrial floor scales are a special platform with load cells installed on it.  They differ from mechanical ones in increased accuracy - up to 100 g, which, with a measurement range of several tons, is a very high indicator.  Another difference between industrial electronic scales and mechanical analogues is the ability to connect to a computer.  This allows you to significantly expand the scope of devices and additionally record and archive all received data.  Their price is from 25 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Technology does not stand still, and perhaps very soon the choice of the buyer will not be limited to mechanical and electrical devices for weight control.  Maybe some completely new devices with a number of additional functions will appear.  For example, they will not only measure weight, but also automatically adjust the figure and remove extra pounds.  At least, such devices would have been wildly successful among all the fair sex.  Nobody forbids us to dream, but so far, alas, we have to rely only on self-control and on ordinary scales. </p>
