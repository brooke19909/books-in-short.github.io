Seaside-steppe climate, gorgeous sandy beaches, healing mud of local lakes and developed resort infrastructure have a good rest and treatment. </p><p>  In a quiet area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe coastal city of Yevpatoriya, not far from the healing salt <span>lake of Moynaki,</span> in an old park there is a cozy pension, which has its own history and original name - Park Hotel Romanova (Yevpatoriya).  Guest reviews suggest that this hotel is quite popular. </p><h2>  History tour </h2><p>  The hotel building and the entire territory are an architectural monument.  An old two-story mansion was built at the very beginning of the twentieth century. </p><p>  During the First World War, in the building of the Primorsky sanatorium, located next to the mansion, there was a hospital in which the wounded soldiers of the Russian army underwent rehabilitation.  This hospital was named after Empress Romanova and was kept at the expense of the tsarina‚Äôs personal funds.  In 1916, the imperial family visited Evpatoria and the Alexandra Fedorovna hospital.  The Empress personally bandaged wounded soldiers, and Emperor Nicholas II presented state awards to recovering heroes. </p><p>  The current resting place - Park Hotel Romanova - was named after the Russian Empress <span>Romanova Alexandra</span> Fedorovna. </p>
