On each draw one image: the silhouette of a female, male, bird, cat, as well as a tree and a flower.  And inanimate objects: a fence, a house, a door, a river.  You can colorize, but this is not necessary.  Such a fortuneteller made of paper with his own hands is quite effective in black and white.  The main thing is that from the side of the “shirt” the pattern does not appear through.  Now the interpretation of the images:

    <ul><li>  The symbol "woman" indicates high demands on oneself, people, deeds, the fulfillment of desires and life in general.  Lower the bar a little, then your aspirations will come true.  Just beware of false and deceitful people who, alas, are in your close circle. </li><li>  The symbol "man" is more positive.  He points to reliable protection in personal and public affairs.  And your desires will come true, however, with the help of outsiders. </li><li>  But the drawing “bird” is a symbol of ephemeral hopes and Manilov’s dreams.  And if he fell out during fortune-telling, fantasize as much as you like, but do not invent anything concrete, there will be no sense!  However, with great perseverance, something can happen. </li><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper fortuneteller" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/304614.jpg" width="500"></div>  The drawing “home” indicates the stability and monotony of your daily life, which will last for some time.  Improve your life, strengthen family, family ties - here you will be lucky. </li><li>  The image of a “tree” is a difficult financial question; it will loom in the near future.  If your desire is not connected with money, then fortunetelling gives the go-ahead. </li><li>  If you have been tortured by all sorts of difficulties and troubles, and you want to know when they will be completed, and the “fence” pattern has appeared, calm down, problems will soon be resolved in a way convenient for you.  Just call for help from your comrades, then things will go smoothly. </li><li>  Figure "cat": this animal is always independent, walks by itself, and therefore do not rely too much on the execution of the conjecture.  But you personally obviously do not occupy the strength of will and character.  This is also good! </li><li>  Did you get the “flower-seven-flower” picture?  A good sign that you will be lucky soon.  Although you are not safe from intrigues and changes in your personal life.  Therefore, the fortuneteller of paper, the scheme of which is considered here, warns you to be careful. </li><li>  The drawing “river” indicates a possible long road: a trip, your trip or the arrival of relatives.  And if you are <span>guessing at a desire,</span> believe: it will be fulfilled, only you should try. </li><li>  The picture “door” has fallen - that means, get ready for new active deeds, and the desire will take on real forms, just show enterprise! </li></ul><p>  How does all this work: put the leaflet-drawings in a bag, make a wish or formulate a question quite clearly and pull out the picture.  Treat it and do not get too upset if something does not meet your expectation! </p>
