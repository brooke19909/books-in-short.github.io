    <p>  A sociological survey is one of the best and most reliable <span>research methods</span> that can only be.  Most often they are carried out in order to find out what people think about this or that occasion.  In other words, when it is necessary to form public opinion.  Why is this method considered good?  Because the principle of chance operates here.  In the polls, they try to involve the maximum number of people who are not connected and not familiar with each other, in general - random passers-by.  Indeed, in such cases it is important to hear differing opinions and draw up certain statistics, which are built on the basis of the information received.  And why is it needed - this is a completely different question. </p><h2>  Survey Assignment </h2><p>  A sociological survey is the main component of psychological research.  Its main purpose is to obtain specific information regarding collective, group, public, and, of course, purely individual opinions.  Sometimes they are also carried out in order to find out people's thoughts regarding certain events, which, as a rule, are also associated with society.  This method is used everywhere today, because it is with its help that it is possible to obtain more than 90 percent of sociological data. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Method specifics </h2><p>  A sociological survey is, rather, a specific research method, since it involves the use of an individual approach to each person who participates in this experiment.  As a matter of fact, each person is a primary <span>source of information.</span>  It is a sociological survey that can help to study the sphere of people's consciousness.  Most often they resort to it when it is necessary to find out information regarding a situation or phenomenon that is not publicly available for direct observation.  Or if there is no documentary evidence about them that usually helps to form a definite opinion. </p><p>  In addition, this is a fairly economical, efficient, mobile and easy way.  However, one can argue about the latter for a long time.  Since sometimes it‚Äôs difficult to get some data.  Again, the survey involves direct contact with the respondent.  And we all know what certain individuals can be.  Some simply flatly refuse to tell anything.  This creates certain problems for the person who conducts the survey. </p><h2>  Contact Issues </h2><p>  Often it is necessary to overcome a whole strip of psychological obstacles and ‚Äúwalls‚Äù in order to conduct a sociological survey.  Example: you need to know the opinion of pensioners about the current economic situation.  Everyone knows what kind of people belong to the age category "60+".  The interviewer will have to deal with a bunch of questions that are not related to the topic.  ‚ÄúWhy do you need this?‚Äù, ‚ÄúBut will something change?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWill you feed breakfast again!‚Äù  - a flurry of absolutely unfounded and illogical charges will fall on the head of the person who asked his question.  It may take a whole day to find out the opinions of a hundred such people.  What to do to achieve this goal? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to connect with the respondent? </h2>

    <p>  It is necessary to have reliable tools with you, which is justified directly by the research program.  You can‚Äôt go empty-handed!  You also need to try to be as friendly, welcoming, but unobtrusive as possible - the interlocutor should be configured to communicate.  Even if someone flatly refuses, the interviewer must remain confident in his preparedness.  It must be remembered that not everything depends on him.  And, finally, it is necessary to prove yourself as a subtle psychologist - to predict the development of a particular situation (which may delay the conduct of the survey), be able to direct the interlocutor in the right direction, and also monitor the mood of the respondent.  If you are ready, you can successfully conduct a sociological survey.  An example of this is the numerous questionnaires recorded in the framework of a television program and shown on the air. </p><h2>  Research Information </h2>

    <p>  But what follows when the task is completed?  After that, the most important thing begins.  The results of opinion polls are studied - in detail, meticulously, scrupulously.  In parallel, specialists compile statistics.  If the method of a sociological survey was to conduct a kind of test (that is, a question was asked and several answer options were given, among which one had to be chosen), then this takes little time.  You just need to calculate how many people have chosen the first answer, how many - the second, third, etc. And already based on the statistics received, experts draw a definite conclusion. </p><p>  For example, if a sociological survey was carried out in order to identify how the residents of city N adopted a new decree banning <span>smoking in public places,</span> the conclusion could be: ‚ÄúBased on a survey among residents, it was possible to find out that 52% supported the law, 48% - on the contrary, 4% expressed their indifference. It follows from this that ... "- and in that spirit.  Some kind of conclusion about the work done.  Depending on the purpose, it can be different - sometimes a few lines are enough, and sometimes sociologists express their thoughts on several pages.  If you just need to convey <span>statistical indicators</span> to society <span>,</span> then the first option is used.  And if it is necessary to achieve any changes, for which the help of higher authorities or administrations is often necessary, then sociologists have been working on the text for a long time. </p><h2>  Questioning Method </h2><p>  With testing, everything is clear, each of us at least once in a lifetime, but something similar happened.  But what can be said about such a method as a questionnaire?  A sociological survey conducted by filling out a specific form takes significantly longer in time.  The respondent is given a questionnaire with questions pre-registered there, to which he must give an answer.  And statistics based on these data are also more difficult to compile, plus everything will take more time.  This method is used if it is necessary to obtain more detailed and detailed information.  And if in a single ‚Äútest‚Äù survey they voice the problem and give two or three options for an answer, here the respondent will have to work hard and express his opinion more fully. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sociological survey method" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/676578.jpg" width="252"></div>

    <p>  It is worth noting that not every list of issues can be considered a questionnaire.  It is compiled by sociologists on a special principle.  First, a unified research plan is needed.  A questionnaire is not just a form.  This is a kind of written conversation with a person.  Usually it has a small but understandable introduction, where the respondent is told about the topic, goals and main tasks of the survey.  And, of course, a little information about the organization involved in the survey. </p><h2>  Are polls needed? </h2>

    <p>  Many, superficially understanding this topic, believe that the results of opinion polls do not lead to anything.  However, it is not.  In fact, polls provide an opportunity to better deal with certain problems, understand the world around us and learn the truth in a given situation.  By the way, many Russians think so.  And, by the way, this was found out with the help of the same polls.  In the end, if you need to solve some <span>global problem,</span> then this method can help.  But only if the results are proven, because all the information is checked. </p>
