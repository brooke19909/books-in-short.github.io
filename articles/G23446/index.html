We will tell in the article!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  "Rachich step" is an interesting way to design the edge of any product.  It performs several important functions.  Firstly, the "step" prevents stretching and deformation of the product.  The edge of the canvas, decorated in this technique, holds its shape well.  Secondly, the "step of the dog" is used for decorative purposes.  It gives volume and a beautiful rounding to the edge, thereby ennobling any related thing.  The canvas, decorated with such a strapping, looks very neat and attractive.  And thirdly, the “step of the dog” is indispensable in the manufacture of “freeform” elements, for example, various leaflets, flowers or spirals.  In this article, we will describe several different ways to perform the step step element.  How to knit it, we will demonstrate using photographs.  We hope our article will be useful for needlewomen starting their acquaintance with a hook.  So, let's get to work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/371166.jpg" width="519"></div>

    <h2>  The original crochet technique "handy step" </h2><p>  With the help of this decorative strapping, the masters successfully design the sleeves, the bottom of the product and the neck.  Often the pattern "Crab step" is used to decorate hats.  It is especially convenient to use when rows with additions or decreases have "stepped" edges.  Interesting <span>crochet technique "Crab step"</span> looks when decorating blankets, pillows, bedspreads.  It is also important that it is suitable for the design of products not only crocheted, but also knitted.  You can decorate the edge with a “step at a time” by the thread that the product itself is made of, or you can choose a contrasting one.  The strapping of the fabric, made by yarn of a different color, allows you to give it a special beauty and brightness.  Such a thing will certainly attract attention.  There are several methods for performing the step step element.  How to knit it, we will tell further.  In fact, it is not difficult to perform this technique, the main thing is to practice enough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Rachich step": <span>how to knit?</span>  Method number 1 </h2><p>  Whatever the method of execution was chosen by the needlewoman, the “step of the hand” always fits “back to front” or, otherwise, “from left to right”.  In the diagrams, it is indicated as a cross with a wavy line on top.  In order to learn how to perform the "step", you will need any knitting thread and a hook that is suitable in size.  We used <span>Pecherka’s</span> “Children's Novelty” <span>yarn</span> (with a density of 200 m / 50 g) and hook No. 3. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet Technique" class="if" height="496" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/371181.jpg?1397130847225" width="595"></div>  Consider the first way to perform the "step step".  How to knit?  First, make a small square pattern.  We will make an initial loop and a chain of 7 cm long air loops. We will skip the three VP necessary for lifting.  We knit the first row <span>with double crochet.</span>  We start the second row with three air loops.  We perform it by analogy with the first.  We also start the third row of knitting with three VPs and knit it with double crochets.  This is how the "step of the step" element is executed: the circuit perfectly demonstrates this.  We make one VP for lifting.  Without turning the knitting, we introduce a hook under the loop of the base from the front to the wrong side.  Pull the thread.  On the hook we got two loops that need to be knitted.  That's all, one element of the "step of the dog" is ready!  By analogy, we perform the entire row, introducing the hook into the next loop located from the previous one to the right.  Here is a beautiful finish you should get.  Now you know how to crochet the <span>“step of the dog”.</span> <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="step step pattern" class="if" height="253" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/371198.jpg?1397131684454" width="450"></div>

Dissolve the last row (performed in the first way) and make one air loop.  Now enter the hook under the loop of the base, the one on the right.  Pull the thread.  On the hook you got two loops.  They should be knitted together.  Now make two VIs.  Re-insert the hook under the two half loops of the base column.  Repeat the same steps until the end of the row.  The photo shows an example of performing the "step of the dog" by the method No. 2.  As you can see, the strapping is somewhat larger and more voluminous than that performed by the first method. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="step step diagram" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/371199.jpg?1397131903512" width="549"></div>

    <h2>  Magnificent "step of the dog": method number 3 </h2><p>  This technique is perfect for decorating some products, such as warm winter clothes.  A magnificent "step of the dog" is created from lush columns that fit in the opposite direction.  In order to learn how to perform this element, take our sample and dissolve the last row, knitted with a "crustacean step" by method number 2.  Make one lifting loop and make one crochet per hook.  Insert your work tool into the base loop located on the right.  Grab and pull the thread.  And then repeat this operation twice.  Now grab the thread and knit all the loops on the hook in one go.  Lock the lush column of one VP.  To run the second element, skip one base loop.  Knit a row with a "step in the wild" similar to the first element. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="magnificent crochet step how to crochet" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/371201.jpg?1397132179828" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Learning to knit a "step": method number 4 </h2><p>  This method of strapping is interesting in that the wrong side is no different from the front.  Such a "step" is used when it is necessary to arrange a two-sided product, such as a rug, tack or hot stand.  Let’s move on to the fourth step of the “crib” step. How to knit it? Take our training sample and make one VP for lifting. Next <span>, crochet the hook,</span> enter the work tool under the half-loop of the base (on the right). Hold the loop. Pull it. You’ve got three loops on the hook. Now knit them in one step and fasten the element with an air loop. Finish the series by repeating this pattern. Here you should get such a beautiful edge trim. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet step how to crochet method 4" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/371188.jpg?1397132295994" width="424"></div>  We hope our article has benefited you.
