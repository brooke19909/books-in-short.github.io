    <p>  No European sophistication, Turkish abundance or Egyptian mystery can compare with the native soft subtropics of our Krasnodar Territory. </p><h2>  How to get to Ashe resort </h2><p>  If it is unacceptable for you to be on a long trip, you can buy a plane ticket to Adler, Krasnodar or Gelendzhik.  From cities to get to the village of Ashe is not difficult.  Rail transport goes to the Lazarevskoye station, the distance of seven kilometers to the resort of Ashe can be overcome by regular bus or taxi. </p><p>  Since the location of the village of Ashe - <span>Krasnodar Territory</span> - the private sector will always offer inexpensive housing.  Therefore, as part of a budget trip, you can not spend money on airline tickets or rail and go to Ashe in your car.  The path starts from the M4 highway and goes to <span>the M7 highway,</span> which will lead to the destination. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <strong><span>Cozy apartment</span> with sea view</strong> </h2><p>  For everyone there is accommodation to taste in Asha - a private sector or a boarding house with all amenities - the choice is yours.  One thing is for sure: Caucasian hospitality is not a legend, and a tourist will certainly become a dear guest in any house or hotel.  It is not customary to book expensive hotels with a daily cost of accommodation starting at 4000 r.  per room. </p>

    <p>  For example, you can go to the waterfalls Psidy and Shapsug and be surprised at their beauty and grandeur.  Mysterious and mysterious dolmens, the origin of which is still unknown.  And how deep can you dive into the Witch's Cave?  After all, more recently, it was possible to descend into it without diving equipment. </p><h2>  <strong>The legend of the murdered old people and conscience</strong> </h2><p>  At first glance, the peaceful and cozy town of Ashe has a terrifying story about the Rock of the Old Ones in the Ashe Valley.  Local residents of the valley collect the famous "drunk" honey from rhododendron, which causes drowsiness.  Ashe is famous for this honey; the private sector everywhere offers to buy it at relatively low prices.  The legend is associated with ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù honey. </p><p>  The ancient warlike Shapsug tribe was famous for its cruelty.  Not a single old man was in this tribe.  All weak and burdensome families, according to the law in force in society, were thrown from a cliff into a river.  One warrior could not kill his father, despite the fact that he asked him to.  The son hid his father in a cave and carried him water and food.  Once upon a time enemies attacked the soldiers.  Father saved the tribe by letting the enemies of "heady" honey get drunk.  The enemies fell asleep, the soldiers loaded them into galleys and sent them down the river.  Since then, the high cliff has been called the Rock of the Old Ones, and the Circassians have gained <span>respect for the older</span> generation. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The impressions of tourists about living in the private sector of the village mainly contain thoughts of an early return to the same place next season, the friendliness of local residents and how the hostesses of guest houses and private apartments are perfectly prepared.  There are a lot of positive reviews about apartments on Turistskaya Street, guests have repeatedly noted the cleanliness, comfort of the rooms, the proper operation of all communications and the absence of water interruptions.  The Fregat Guesthouse on Repin Street is also praised.  But there are also negative reviews, which are mainly associated with the purchase of low-quality goods on the street, especially wine.  But who said that buying on hand gives a guarantee of freshness of the goods?  In Asha there is a market where you can buy fresh fruits and vegetables, there are many shops and cafes where the hosts will be happy to feed inexpensive and tasty.  The most important thing, according to tourists, is to stock up on medicines, since the nearest pharmacy is located in the village of Lazarevskoye. </p>
