This lesson is a common thing for many mobile subscribers.  And the idea is realized in different ways.  Some of them are really good, and some mostly remain in the shade.  But they do have a place.  How is everyone able to change the tariff for MTS at any time of the day or night?  Smart, Super MTS and other offers - it doesn't matter what you choose.  The main thing is that the process of switching to it does not greatly depend on the tariff plan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="change the tariff for mts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139506.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Calls and calls again </h2><p>  Well, let's start with the least popular method.  This is a call to the operator.  To change the tariff to "MTS", you must first take and choose one or another offer.  And then dial 0890 on your mobile phone and wait for an answer.  By the way, this way you can not only change the plan on the SIM card of the smartphone, but also on the tablet, as well as the modem. </p><p>  Did they answer you?  Inform that you want to change the tariff.  You will be asked which one I would like to connect.  If you have not decided on your choice, right during the dialogue they will help you find the right offer.  Next, wait until you get a connection request.  After some time, you will receive a notification about a successful tariff change. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Room purchase </h2><p>  Another reception is the purchase of a new SIM card.  In this case, you can change the tariff to "MTS" along with the phone number.  In principle, you can do this if you want to either get a new operator‚Äôs offer, or change your SIM card at all. </p><p>  Come to the MTS cellular office and inform the staff that you would like to purchase a new number.  You will be asked about the selected tariff.  Like last time, if necessary, they will help you find the right offer.  Now you need to fill out an application for the purchase and connection.  Present your passport and wait a bit.  Check the correctness of filling in the data about you, and then sign the contract for the provision of services with the company.  Pay for the transaction - you can use the new SIM card and tariff plan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mts internet change tariff" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139507.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Please note that you can not always change the tariff.  Sometimes you really have to buy a SIM card for a particular offer.  Typically, this trend is evident in new tariffs. </p><h2>  Office call </h2><p>  We move on.  You can change the MTS tariff on your mobile device by contacting the operator‚Äôs nearest mobile office.  Also not the best option, but it exists. </p><p>  If you do not want to understand the process of changing the plan for a long time, then this is the ideal solution for you.  It is enough to come to the MTS office and inform employees that they would like to change the tariff.  You may be offered either the purchase of a SIM card, or help.  Choose the second. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now you need to decide on the tariff.  Do you already know what you need?  Then hand over the mobile device with a SIM card to an office employee and wait a bit.  He will do everything to go to the offer you have chosen.  In the end, the phone will pass into your hands with an already changed plan.  This service is absolutely free.  Unless for some tariffs you have to pay directly at the transition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="change to tariff super pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139510.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Change Command </h2><p>  You can move on to the more popular options that the MTS mobile operator can only offer.  Self-service methods are in great demand.  These include, for example, USSD commands.  With their help, subscribers are able to independently disconnect and connect any service. </p><p>  For example, we will try to exchange the existing offer for the Super MTS tariff.  To do this, on a mobile device, dial * 888 # and press the call button.  A few seconds of waiting - and it's done.  The main problem is that for each tariff and for each option there are USSD commands.  Remembering them all is almost impossible.  Therefore, you have to constantly look for suitable combinations.  But after that, at any time of the day or night, you can change the tariff or connect some additional package of services. </p><h2>  Messages </h2><p>  Also, for the implementation of the task set before us, everyone has the right to use SMS requests.  They are not as popular as USSD commands, but they are also used very often. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="change tariff on mts modem" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139509.jpg"></div>

    <p>  <span>How to change the tariff for "MTS"</span> using SMS request?  To do this, you must create a special message and send it to a short number.  Usually this is 111. More information about the text of the letter and numbers for sending and processing the request can be found on the official MTS website.  Why?  Because, as in the past case, it will be necessary for each proposal to look for its SMS requests.  The operator has many services, tariffs too.  And remembering everything is simply impossible. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  By the way, the Internet can help work with MTS.  Each subscriber is entitled to change the tariff on the ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù modem or SIM card using the operator‚Äôs official website.  There is an online assistant that is needed to manage connected services and capabilities.  To work with him, you must register on mts.ru, as well as gain access to the "My Account". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="change tariff for mts smart" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139508.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Ready?  Now you can either look into the "Services" section and select a favorable offer there, click on it, and on the opened page, click on "Connect".  Or just find a suitable tariff on the site, open the details about it and also click on "Connect".  You will receive a confirmation code of the operation.  Enter it in a special field on the screen and press "OK".  Next, the request will be processed with the subsequent receipt of an SMS notification with the result of the operation.  Usually, subscribers are informed that the tariff is reconnected or the service is successfully connected.  This process also does not require any costs.  And lately it has been in great demand. </p>
