They determine the value, they are stored, saved, used during trading.  In addition, coins act as valuable museum exhibits, and numismatists are ready to give a fortune in order to eventually get a rare and unique coin in its copy, the cost of which grows at times if it is well preserved. </p><h2>  <strong>Coin science</strong> </h2><p>  Previously, it was difficult to think that ordinary coins made even not of silver can cost so much because of the banal mistake of the master and the creation of the only “defective" coin for which collectors are willing to lay out thousands of rubles. </p><p>  At present, there is a whole science that is engaged in the study of valuable and rare Russian coins - this is numismatics.  It affects the technique of their manufacture, draws a parallel between the banknotes of different countries in order to find distinctive features.  Daily coins are growing in price, some of them are worth a fortune. </p>

    <h2>  Coins "remake" </h2><p>  There is also the concept of “remake coin”.  In this case, everything is simple - this is a coin created based on the prototype of the rarest 19th-century coin.  These coins were minted using a genuine or specially made for this purpose stamp.  In order not to confuse the original from the remake, special marks were made on the stamp, sometimes invisible to the naked eye, but known to the creators.  Among the most striking examples of a remake, one should highlight a coin made of gold, which was called the “Sower” and is among those listed in the list of “Expensive coins of Russia”.  The value of this currency is continuously increasing day by day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Trial coins </h2><p>  These are ordinary coins, also intended for everyday use, but in connection with certain situations have never been issued.  After creating such money, the ruler rendered a verdict on whether to use it or to prohibit circulation because of too large form or expensive material, unprofitability.  Basically, they were re-melted again, but there are other options for the development of events.  For example, several coins were hidden or they were lost.  Now, such rare coins cost unthinkable amounts and are of high value to collectors. </p><p>  As an example of such coins, two rubles made of silver in 1722, with the image of Peter the Great, should be mentioned.  In addition, there is also the Konstantinovsky ruble, which was minted in 1825, currently only about six copies of this denomination are known.  Its price is three million rubles! </p>

    <h2>  <strong>Konstantinovsky ruble</strong> </h2><p>  The real price breaks all conceivable and unimaginable records, it even turned out to be more than the cost of the “Ruble of Constantine”.  He was sold at the Markov auction for only 550 thousand dollars.  The starting price was 350 thousand dollars, that is how much money was paid for a coin called "Reichevskaya Poltina", which takes place among the 10 most expensive coins in Russia, was minted in 1845. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now, the coin with the image of Anna Ioannovna has been preserved only in two copies, one of which is in the famous Hermitage, the second has been purchased in a private collection at auction for one and a half million pounds! </p><p>  The Konstantinovsky ruble belongs to the category of “Expensive Commemorative Coins of Russia” and has an interesting mystical history.  Its value lies in the fact that on the territory of Russia there never existed a ruler, whose name was Konstantin, and historians had to work hard to understand in honor of whom such a coin was issued.  Top of the most expensive coins in Russia includes this amazing instance. </p><p>  There was a hypothesis that it got its name in connection with an error during minting.  However, it is still believed that the most reliable version is that this monetary unit was created for the supposed and carefully planned coronation of Konstantin Pavlovich, the crown prince, who refused to rule the country in favor of his brother - Nikolai I. </p><p>  He denied it in 1819.  This fact was kept silent for a long time and was known only to the most native people.  Alexander I, during his reign, issued a document that was kept secret and should only be open after he died.  As it turned out, it was about Nicholas. </p><p>  And so the king dies, Nikolai and the whole servants swear allegiance to Konstantin, but for a long time the country was in an unpredictable state.  After these events, Alexander’s manifest was printed and very surprised everyone, but, despite this, the mint unfolded minting of coins, which depicted Konstantin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Soon everything changed, Nicholas, as his father bequeathed, became king, and the mint was forced to quickly get rid of samplers, because these were expensive <span>coins of tsarist</span> Russia, issued in the amount of six pieces.  Now two of them have found refuge in Russian museums, one is in an American institute, the remaining are bought by private collectors. </p>

    <h2>  Coin of Peter, or Polish thaler </h2><p>  A banknote of 1 ruble denominated in the distant 1705 by order of Tsar Peter the Great also has a high value.  According to its external data, it was very similar to the thaler of Poland, which was produced in 1630.  The value of this money is that at the time of creation, the master made a mistake in the date.  In this regard, the value of the coin turned out to be so high.  It is worth considering that analogues issued at the same time are estimated by collectors and specialists at only 400,000 rubles, but the cost of the most expensive Russian coin of that period, paradoxically, amounted to 1,500,000 rubles, given the marriage of the performer. </p><h2>  Trial ruble issued in 1801 </h2><p>  Very interesting information should be noted: 1801 was a quiet and peaceful year, so the production of portrait coins temporarily ceased.  It turns out that most of the banknotes that can be found in private collections are considered trial ones.  In addition, this, in turn, is also remodels, the minting of which was carried out using new and modified stamps. </p><p>  It should be noted that currently there is information about 7 rubles with portraits issued back in 1801.  They have certain differences in reverse and obverse.  One of the rarest rubles of the century before last was sold at the next auction for 7.25 million rubles. </p><h2>  1839, or 1.5 rubles of that time </h2><p>  This coin was created as a commemorative in connection with the construction of the chapel, a monument located in the <span>Borodino field.</span>  An imperial portrait is imprinted on it, which is illuminated by the sun's rays.  This coin is estimated at $ 70,000. </p><h2>  Coins of Platinum and Gold </h2><p>  Platinum coins were minted in 1836, their face value was 12 rubles, in total there were only eleven pieces.  These originals are becoming more and more expensive every year. </p><p>  While laying the foundation of the church in honor of the martyr Olga in 1907, gold coins were hidden in it with a total of one hundred pieces.  The remaining nine coins were given to the distinguished guests present, among whom should be mentioned Nicholas II, Alexander and the Princess named Olga.  It should be noted that rare expensive coins of Russia are currently being changed hands, they can sometimes be found at auction and, if desired, are purchased. </p>

    <h2>  <strong>World War I and cash flow</strong> </h2><p>  In 1908, coins of 25 rubles were issued, now they are considered quite rare and valuable.  What is noteworthy, they are made of a <span>gold bar, the</span> weight of which was five kilograms.  Nicholas II wanted to give this money as a sign of respect to all his relatives in 1908 on his next birthday.  One of the copies was sold in 2011, unfortunately, it was in terrible condition but, despite this significant drawback, the cost of the most expensive Russian coin at that time amounted to 1,900,000 rubles. </p><p>  There was the First World War, in connection with which the empire suffered from huge losses, there was a lack of valuable raw materials and labor.  A decree was issued on changes in the monetary system, in which it was a question of reducing the weight of coins made from copper, since these were expensive <span>coins of Russia, 10 rubles</span> had to be smelted. </p><p>  The impending revolution prevented the implementation of the plan, but partially managed to mint trial samples.  How many of them were actually made, no one knows now, reliable information is missing. </p><h2>  Coins of the Soviet era </h2><p>  In the Leningrad <span>Mint</span> in 1925, similar coins were created in order to be sold to collectors, now they are of great value and rarity.  There is another coin that is in demand among collectors; it is a fifty kopeck coin, created in 1929.  The most expensive <span>jubilee coins of Russia</span> are issued at present, but their price is not as high as those that were minted in tsarist times. </p><p>  But, even taking into account this fact, this coin does not lose its value.  Only one instance has survived to our times, which has long been in a private collection, but sold for a fabulous amount.  At the same time, the cost of one of the most expensive Russian coins was set at 10,000,000 rubles.  The amount is very eloquent. </p>

    <h2>  The cost of the most expensive Russian coin </h2><p>  However, the most expensive Russian coin should be considered “Elizabeth Golden”, the value of which is 77,409,790 rubles!  A distinctive feature is the fact that this coin is melted from real gold with an engraved image of Queen Catherine.  The reverse adorns the five emblems of cities such as Astrakhan, Kazan, Siberia, Moscow, and the central part is occupied by the state. </p><p>  This coin is considered a trial coin and was issued back in 1755 with a face value of 20 rubles.  It was minted in St. Petersburg at the mint.  The weight of the coin was 33 grams.  Another test coin was created a little earlier, in 1730, it depicts Anna Ioannovna. </p><p>  Currently, there are only two such precious items, one is kept in the Hermitage, the second is owned by a private collector. </p><h2>  Coins and man </h2><p>  Many centuries have passed, but despite this, collectors and scientists are concerned about the question of which coin is considered the most expensive and valuable.  A man always strives for self-knowledge, self-improvement and, acquiring another expensive coin, he does not worry about the fact that tomorrow it will depreciate and will cost a penny, as supply always creates demand ... </p><p>  Coins have a difficult story, some may lie in the ground for a long time, while others, on the contrary, are in the safes of their owners or gold storages, but, sadly, not everyone will cost a fortune.  It is important to remember that the value of coins will largely depend on the state in which they are: the more often you pick them up, the faster they will be rubbed.  Therefore, such relics should be stored in special boxes or under glass, so that their value and cost are not reduced. </p>

    <h2>  Top most expensive coins in Russia </h2><p>  So, we should summarize all of the above. </p><ul><li>  Honorary 10th place is occupied by 5 kopecks, which were issued back in 1916.  At present, the cost of such a relic is about 1.6 million rubles, and it rightfully takes its position. </li><li>  Rare coins have always been of interest to numismatists.  These include 25 rubles in 1908.  Now their price exceeds 1.9 million rubles. </li><li>  Two million rubles is worth a penny, the year of which is celebrated the century before last, namely, 1726.  She takes the eighth step. </li><li>  Seventh place - "Konstantinovsky ruble", it was mentioned in the article.  Its price today is more than 3 142 180 rubles. </li><li>  The sixth position is in five rubles in 1907.  This little jewel is worth nothing more or less, but 4.35 million rubles. </li><li>  4.65 million rubles will cost collectors the purchase of a unique coin of 1836 with a face value of 12 rubles.  She is in fifth place in our top.  Its uniqueness lies in the fact that platinum is present in the composition.  There were only eleven such coins.  Later, another ten similar coins were minted, which were later acquired by collectors, and therefore they have no value.  One of them was bought for the fabulous amount mentioned above. </li></ul>
