  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What determines the object and subject of research</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To prepare for a scientific or sociological study, it is necessary to go through several stages.  First you need to study such a thing as <strong>an object and subject of research</strong> .  In <span>scientific research, the</span> job is to explore the whole system, which includes the object area, <strong>object and subject of study</strong> .  The object field implies the sphere of practice and sciences, in which, directly, the object of research is located.  An object can serve as a specific process, as well as a phenomenon that induces a problem situation.  The subject, in turn, implies a specific part of the object within which this very search is conducted.  Under the object of research can understand a certain part of the material and non-material surrounded world, it can be physical bodies that interact with each other, man and living organisms.  <span>The subject of research</span> can exist only in the head of the researcher.  In other words, the subject of research can depend only on the knowledge of the scientist and is an integral part of it. </p><p>  As regards such a thing as <strong>an object and a subject of research</strong> in sociology, here the object is social reality.  In general, the <strong>object and <span>subject of sociological</span> research</strong> is a direction that is determined by ambiguous approaches to various studies of society.  Sociological studies examine the knowledge of a social society with nature. </p><p>  <strong>The object and subject of research</strong> in sociology - this is a certain sphere of reality, which has integrity and completeness.  The objects of various sciences are man and nature, which are studied by both natural and social-humanitarian branches in the world of knowledge. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One way or another, but the <strong>object and subject of research</strong> can be both tangible and intangible in structure.  The subject of the study is the individual properties and aspects of natural and social phenomena.  Scientific disciplines consider individual areas of the object, for example, in the biology of research, there are physiological and morphological aspects, in systematization and in evolutionary theory.  But in the study of society, the objects of politics, sociology and economics are investigated. </p><p>  There is a section of the <span>economic economy,</span> in which there is also an <strong>object and subject of research</strong> .  This is macroeconomics, which is devoted to the study of large economic processes and phenomena.  Here, the <strong>subject of macroeconomic research is the</strong> rate of increase, summarizing the growth or decrease of the value that characterizes the economy of the whole country. </p><p>  Macroeconomics is studying economic life on the scale of the national economy, and macroeconomic research subjects are regions, spheres and industries, the national and <span>world economy</span> as a whole. </p><p>  To determine the <strong>object and subject of research</strong> , it is necessary to study the main objectives.  Why is it necessary to study and research objects and objects?  So, the <span>goal of the study</span> is to derive the final result that any researcher would strive to complete his work.  The objectives of the study include means and ways to achieve goals. </p><p>  In general, in such a concept as <strong>an object and subject of research</strong> , there is some difference.  The object and subject of research may be of a different nature.  An object is part of an <span>objective reality that a</span> scientist is researching.  And the subject is a body of knowledge about objective reality.  Let us give an example - a hammer is an object of research, it has a certain shape and properties.  But when the hammer is put into action and it begins to knock, it becomes an object of activity, namely, an object for hammering nails. </p>
