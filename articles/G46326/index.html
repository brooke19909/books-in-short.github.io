Almost everywhere, houses and neighborhoods grow like mushrooms.  Despite the wide variety of new housing stocks, choosing an apartment has become even more difficult.  After all, housing should not only be comfortable, but also be close to developed infrastructure and work.  LCD "Lukino-Varino" (customer reviews note a good layout of apartments, the presence of a landscaped area) fully meets all these requirements.  Construction is in full swing, some houses are already populated.  The project provides for all necessary socially significant institutions. </p><h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  A housing complex is being built near the village of Sverdlovsk Shchelkovo district.  The group of companies ‚ÄúSU 22‚Äù is building the building.  The developer is distinguished by its reliability, and the beginning of its working activity goes back to the distant year of 1945. </p><p>  All buildings under construction are monolithic.  Powerful technical and industrial equipment makes it possible to perform work of different levels of complexity.  All activities of the construction organization are concentrated within the company, without attracting help from outside, this: </p><ul><li>  making an investment project; </li><li>  preparation of all necessary documentation; </li><li>  turnkey housing construction; </li><li>  laying communication both inside the building, and from its external side; </li><li>  improvement of adjacent territories; </li><li>  sale of finished real estate. </li></ul><p>  ‚ÄúSU-22‚Äù carries out all these functions independently, by attracting its own resources.  The company contains in one person an investor, a project customer, a general contractor and a finished housing seller.  This feature allows you to carefully monitor all work units and processes, as well as fulfill all contractual obligations to customers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A properly built chain of work processes can significantly save the material budget of the company, which reduces the cost of construction, and, consequently, the price of apartments. </p><p>  To maintain competitiveness, the company not only provides its customers with full services, but also constantly improves and builds the potential of its capabilities using high-tech working methods, applying the highest quality modern building materials and the latest technologies. </p><p>  LCD "Lukino-Varino" (customer reviews of individual apartments note the need to replace windows, doors and batteries, with their words, with those that the developer installed can freeze in winter) is the largest project of the company.  In addition to it, the company is building the Anichkovo residential complex, the Sverdlovsky residential complex, the Serebryanye Prudy residential complex, and the residential complex on Nedelin Street. </p><h2>  Materials and Technologies </h2>

    <p>  Only high-quality comfortable and energy-efficient housing is being built in the Lukino-Varino residential complex, SU 22.  You can hear from the developer that all the buildings in this complex are mostly monolithic.  After all, only such a structure is distinguished by its energy-saving properties.  It has good sound insulation, comfort.  This material is also characterized by earthquake resistance.  It has flame retardant, heat resistant and waterproof properties.  The monolith does not form voids and seams in the building frame. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A monolithic residential building differs from others in its rigidity and strength.  It gives uniform shrinkage, since the base of the heavy structure is distributed throughout the monolith, in contrast to panel houses, where the support goes only to the walls.  This material in construction is the most durable of all known to date.  In the house from the monolith, finishing work can be started immediately after the end of its construction. </p><p>  When erecting buildings in the Lukino-Varino residential complex, they use the most modern energy-saving technologies.  They significantly reduce the emission of harmful substances into the airspace formed during the cooling and heating of buildings. </p><p>  During the construction of buildings, the latest technologies and modern materials are used, as well as the most high-tech engineering equipment, completely new trunk communications are created.  During the construction of the residential complex, the whole range of works is carried out to restore the water supply system and create water disposal facilities in the entire microdistrict. </p><h2>  Description of the project LCD "Lukino-Varino" </h2>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the construction has acquired large-scale dimensions in the Lukino-Varino residential complex, customer reviews about this territory are very different.  Some residents are happy with everything.  They note that in winter the apartments are warm, and a kindergarten and a school are nearby.  Young families like smartly equipped playgrounds in the yards, general landscaping, the presence of supermarkets and pharmacies.  It pleases many the nature and proximity of the forest.  They note good construction quality.  There are no cracks and distortions, all surfaces are smooth.  They say that the layout of the property is simply excellent. </p><p>  But not everyone is happy with the state of affairs at the Lukino-Varino residential complex.  Customer reviews of this category indicate a change in the cost of the apartment, depending on the measurements of the BTI.  If the housing per meter will be more, then the client pays extra for the apartment, but if it‚Äôs less, then nobody returns the meters stolen by the developer.  People recommend carefully reading the contract and looking at the apartment plan.  According to them, there can be very unpleasant nuances.  Interest-holders are also unhappy with the fact that the organization takes the money in advance, before concluding the contract. </p><p>  People do not praise transport accessibility.  They say that you need to get to Moscow for at least an hour, and those who tortured traffic jams on the Shchelkovo highway in their car.  More customers note huge queues in kindergarten and school.  They say that getting there is simply impossible.  A similar situation is observed in the clinic.  Socially significant organizations are sorely lacking, and the lack of parking also causes a problem. </p><p>  In general, people are satisfied with the price and quality of apartments, their transport accessibility and still undeveloped infrastructure upsets. <strong></strong></p>
