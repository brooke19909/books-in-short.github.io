    <h2>  Main passenger </h2><p>  Tatyana and Alexey Gromovs are a young family that died in a plane crash over the Sinai Peninsula.  They went to the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh on October 15, not suspecting that this trip would be their last.  Together with them, they took a 10-month-old daughter Darina.  The girl‚Äôs grandmother was very worried when she found out that Tatyana and Aleksey would not go alone.  An elderly woman asked them to leave their granddaughter in Russia.  However, the parents did not agree.  They really wanted their daughter to see the sea. </p><p>  Before flying to Sharm el-Sheikh, Tatyana Gromova posted on the social network the latest photo of her baby.  The girl stood by the window, holding the glass with her handles, and looked at the runway, looking at the planes.  ‚ÄúMain passenger‚Äù - such words were written by mother.  After 2 weeks, this photo became a symbol of a terrible tragedy. </p>

    <h2>  Other children killed in a plane crash </h2><p>  Bogdanov Anton is a 10-year-old boy whose life was claimed by a plane crash over Sinai.  He rested in Egypt with his older sister and father.  The family was very happy about the upcoming trip.  Before flying to Sharm el-Sheikh, the boy left the inscription ‚ÄúFarewell to Russia !!!‚Äù in his profile on the social network.  Unfortunately, these words were prophetic. </p><p>  The dead children also include 3-year-old Anastasia Sheina, 10-year-old Valeria Dushechkina, 11-year-old Evgeny Pryanikov.  Their parents were Olga and Yuri Sheiny.  Adults decided to go to Egypt to celebrate an important date for them - 10 years from the date of acquaintance.  They took all the children with them. </p><p>  The death toll in the plane crash over Sinai includes the names and surnames of two more children - 2-year-old Dmitry and 3-year-old Alexandra Vinnik.  They rested in Egypt with their mother Marianna Vinnik and grandmother Natalia Osipova.  On the day the plane crashed, all of them were gone.  Oleg Vinnik, the husband of Marianna and the father of young children, lost a large family.  There were no men on this airliner.  He did not go on vacation, but remained in Russia. </p><p>  There were other children on board.  Each child had his own story, his own life, his dreams and desires.  The ending for all these innocent children was one.  Their fate in 2015 on October 31 was tragically cut short by a plane crash over Sinai.  The bodies of dead children were found among the wreckage of the aircraft in the crash zone. </p>

    <h2>  Foreboding of death </h2><p>  Some people flying that ill-fated flight, intuition told them not to go on a trip.  However, they did not listen to their inner voice.  One of these passengers turned out to be 15-year-old Maria Ivleva.  The girl was afraid to fly, she was tormented by the fear of death.  She told her friends about this.  After the plane crash and the investigation, terrifying information was found out - Maria Ivleva was sitting on the spot where the terrorist bomb was located. </p><p>  "I know that I will not return."  One of the passengers of the fateful flight, Ekaterina Murashova, left a song with that name on her page on the social network.  She lived in Pskov, participated in the city beauty contest in 2014, raised her daughter.  Catherine was very fond of traveling.  The girl went to Sharm el-Sheikh with her mother, but she did not take her little daughter with her.  The trip to Egypt was the last for Ekaterina Murashova. </p><p>  The crash of an airplane over the Sinai Peninsula is a tragic event that has been talked about all over the world.  In one day, the lives of 224 people ended.  Someone took a soul mate over the Sinai, someone lost their parents, someone was left without children, and someone lost all loved ones and was left completely alone.  This is an irreplaceable loss, the pain of which did not pass over time and is unlikely to ever subside. </p>
