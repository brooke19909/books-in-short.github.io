    <h2>  What might be needed? </h2><p>  First of all, I want to deal with materials that may be needed for the manufacture of the product.  So, of course, everything can be made of wood (or plywood), but in this case a bit of skill and a special tool are needed.  In this article, simpler options are provided: how to make a cabinet for Barbie from a cardboard box or a bag of milk.  So, scissors, glue, a ruler, adhesive tape (including double-sided), as well as wrapping paper and foil for decoration will be needed. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a doll cabinet" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/426249.jpg" width="375"></div></h2><h2>  Option 1. Milk bag </h2><p>  How to make a cabinet for Barbie?  The easiest way is to create it from a used milk bag.  It is best to choose the maximum displacement of the product, so the closet will turn out more (because the doll will need to hang long dresses).  At the very beginning, the box must be thoroughly rinsed and dried.  Further, the upper part, where the package was opened, is cut off gently and evenly.  This will be the bottom of the cabinet, its bottom.  Now you need to make the door for the product.  To do this, draw a vertical line at the very center of the wide side of the packet, practically from the very top.  Cutting it with a blade or a <span>clerical knife,</span> you can finally get doors <span>that</span> can be opened (the place where the curtains should be must be thoroughly and evenly cured so that the cabinet opens without problems).  This is basically all, the cabinet as a whole is ready.  However, he is absolutely not beautiful!  It needs to be decorated with already prepared wrapping paper, from the foil to make small pens that are attached with double-sided adhesive tape.  Well and how not to provide hangers?  To do this, in the body of the cabinet under its "ceiling" you need to punch two small holes with an awl, into which to insert the wire - this will be a hanger.  Hangers themselves are easy to twist out of wire - a simple triangle with a hook at the very top.  That's all, the cabinet and even the accessories are ready for it! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make barbie furniture" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/426251.jpg" width="340"></div></h2><h2>  Option 2. Box for shoes. </h2><p>  Still how to make a cabinet for Barbie?  So, you can use a shoe box for this (its size is optional).  First of all, you need to decide whether the cabinet will be tall or wide.  And after that, get to work.  First you need to work hard on the lid.  Its corners are gently cut, the sides (lateral bends) are straightened (unfold).  Top and bottom are cut off.  In the center of the lid you need to draw a vertical line - so the doors will open.  The door is ready, it remains to decorate it - to paste over with paper, and make a mirror from the foil on the inside of the door.  Next, the box itself is pasted.  The next step - you need to glue the door to the box using tape.  That's basically it.  Inside the cabinet, you can make a shelf for clothes: cut it out of cardboard (according to the size of the cabinet depth), bend the corners by about a couple of centimeters 90 ¬∞ on each side and glue these folds to the walls of the cabinet.  Below you can make the hanger and the hangers themselves as described above.  That's all the tips on how to make a cabinet for dolls with your own hands. </p><h2>  Other furniture </h2><p>  It is worth saying that after all, dolls need not only cabinets.  You can also figure out how to make furniture for Barbie to fill the interior.  So, if you glue two matchboxes together and wrap them in cloth, you get a nice ottoman.  An excellent floor lamp will turn out from an umbrella for cocktails (as a basis, you can use, again, a matchbox).  It is also possible to make a sofa out of matchboxes: two flat-top boxes - a place to sit, two flat on the sides of the rib - sofa handles that make it so comfortable for the doll to lean on, three boxes behind the rest area - a back.  All boxes are glued together with ordinary glue, the finished product is tightened with a cloth.  The sofa is ready! </p>
