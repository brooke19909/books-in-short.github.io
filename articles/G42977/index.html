More and more spoiled tourists are offered a completely new service - glamping, which literally translates from English means glamorous camping.  This is a unique opportunity to experience several pleasures at once: live in a tent set on the grass in the middle of the forest, take a hot shower, lie on the chic feather-beds and enjoy in the silence an amazing landscape.  So, residents and guests of Russia can plunge into the atmosphere of home comfort away from a noisy city by visiting the Cheposh Park in Altai Mountains.  It is in this place that you can completely immerse yourself in your thoughts and merge with the unearthly beauty. </p><h2>  Where is the complex </h2><p>  Having decided to become a guest of a natural-health complex of a new format, it is first of all necessary to find out where it is and how to get to it.  This is not at all difficult to do.  Since the ‚ÄúCheposh Park‚Äù glamping has already become popular for a long time, information about it can be found out from almost every traveler.  A beautiful island of unspoiled nature and solitude is located outside the territory of one of the picturesque villages of the Chemal district of the Altai Republic, on the right bank of the Katun River, merging with the Cheposh River. </p>

    <p>  Often, tourists get to the park by private car or by bus, next to the village of Chemal (Altai Mountains).  Comfortable public transport very often travels to this locality, so it will not be difficult to get to it.  Moving along the Chuysky highway from Novosibirsk or Biysk, you need to get to the village of Ust-Sema, and then turn left at the fork in the Chemalsky highway.  To the right of the road will be a bridge over the river and, having passed directly no more than 10 kilometers, you can see a turn to the bases located on the territory of a pine forest near <span>the Katun River.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that on the 8th kilometer of the road there is the first tourist point - the small village of Cheposh surrounded by beautiful nature.  There are breathtaking mountains, a forest with mushrooms, berries, medicinal plants and flowers.  You can also find many activities nearby, such as rock climbing and rafting. </p><h2>  What attracts travelers </h2><p>  This is the best place in Altai for leisure is unique, since no hotel or recreation center can boast of such a territory.  Cheposh Park will allow guests to fully enjoy the natural beauty and not worry about comfort.  No mosquitoes and midges will pester anyone here, and quiet family vacations will not be spoiled by noisy neighbors or cars rumble.  The residential area remote from the highway holds up to 50 visitors at a time, and all rooms are furnished in a Scandinavian minimalist style.  In addition, the panoramic windows of each one-story house allow you to enjoy gorgeous views to the fullest. </p>

    <p>  But lovers of romance can have a great time in gazebos with barbecue facilities. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Increasingly, families with children of any age meet at various resorts and <span>recreation centers</span> , as parents tend to spend more and more time with their children.  Of course, this is very pleasant, but it‚Äôs rather difficult to organize outdoor activities with kids, so the leaders of Cheposh Park specially created a contact zoo on the territory of the complex.  Younger guests are allowed to feed the goat Byashu, ride Margosha's horse and pet its other inhabitants.  Children under 6 years old have rooms with separate beds and nursery beds. </p><h2>  What is provided for free </h2><p>  Not only fresh air and complete unity with nature, but also free entertainment can improve your mood during your vacation.  So, while living in Cheposh Park everyone can use barbecue grills, take specially prepared firewood and even bicycles for walking.  In summer, small guests are allowed to swim in the pools, play in the playgrounds with swings and slides, and they will also have at their disposal a variety of toys (tolokars, bike races, etc.). </p>
