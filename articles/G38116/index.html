    <p>  Let's start with the general concept of this tariff plan.  It is no secret that each of its tariffs mobile operators develop to offer a certain category of users in such a way that it provides one or another goals of subscribers.  Let's just say: there are plans for working on the Internet or those that are designed to make calls;  There are universal tariffs in which ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù.  Understanding the purpose of a particular plan is important in order to choose the right one for yourself. </p><p>  For example, ‚ÄúMy Beeline‚Äù tariff plan is definitely designed for making calls.  We can understand this if only because within the framework of it the user can get only favorable conditions for conversations.  This applies, in particular, to minutes for communication within the network, according to which special payment conditions are provided.  That is, on the official website, the description of the ‚ÄúMy Beeline‚Äù tariff plan does not contain any information about the Internet traffic package, bonus SMS or minutes for talking in roaming.  It can be used exclusively for ‚Äúinternal‚Äù communication. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Subscription fee </h2>

    <p>  According to the terms of the plan, the subscriber must pay a regular monthly fee.  So, the tariff plan ‚ÄúMy Beeline‚Äù will cost 5 rubles per day (150 - per month) on a prepaid basis or 210 rubles per month - on a postpaid basis.  The essence of this separation is obvious - the operator company encourages subscribers to pay for the services provided in advance.  If the user wants to pay for the calls after the operator provides the services, an additional 60 rubles will have to be paid for it. </p><p>  The form of monthly fee, as you see, includes both the ability to pay partially on a regular basis, and the implementation of a one-time (monthly) payment.  It depends on the desire of the subscriber, on how he will be comfortable. </p><h2>  Calls within the region </h2><p>  As noted above, this tariff is designed for communication within the Beeline network.  At the very least, this comes from the main option available to the subscriber connecting to it - this is a certain number of minutes during which a special tariffication takes place.  Tariff conditions, in fact, differ, depending on whether the user is served on a prepaid or postpaid payment system.  So, those who pay before are given 100 free minutes (per day) for communication within the network.  If the subscriber ‚Äúspeaks out‚Äù more, then he pays 2 rubles for each additional 60 seconds of the conversation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As for what My Beeline tariff plan provides for those who choose postpay, they are provided with 3000 free minutes per month.  Although this looks different than in the case of prepayment - but the essence remains the same.  The only difference is that the package is not given immediately for a month, but by the day.  To use it ‚Äúall at once‚Äù in this way will not work. </p><h2>  Calls in Russia </h2><p>  This information is relevant for users who want to communicate within their region.  Therefore, the question arises: what conditions does the My Beeline tariff plan provide for those who would like to call to another part of Russia? </p><p>  Everything is very simple - the same 100 minutes per day (or 3 thousand per month) apply to communication outside the region!  This, apparently, is the main (and obvious) benefit of the tariff.  Free communication with subscribers of your network is waiting, including those who plan to make calls to other parts of the country. </p>

    <h2>  Connect or disconnect? </h2><p>  If you are interested in the intranet roaming in Russia, obviously, this plan is for you, so it should be ordered.  It is very simple to do this - there are several ways to apply for connecting a service.  The first is to call the short number 3000 tied to this tariff.  Having typed it, you will only need to follow the instructions - and the system will record your intention to use the package.  Of course, when connecting the option, remember that you need to have money on the balance sheet equivalent to the size of the plan cost (if it comes to prepayment).  In the case of work through postpay, you must use another number - 0674010333. In addition to this method, there is also a simpler option - contact the company‚Äôs support service.  Again, this is done both through mobile phone salons, the form on the website, and by telephone. </p><p>  Disabling the option can also be done using the specified methods.  Firstly, there is a short number for refusal - this is a combination of 3014. Secondly, again, you can submit an application through an operator or communication salons located in many cities. </p>

    <h2>  Compatibility </h2><p>  In addition to what My Beeline tariff (Moscow) provides, the reviews of which we will provide a little further in the text, it is important to note one more point.  It concerns the compatibility of this service with others provided by the operator.  After all, it is logical that certain tariffication conditions are clearly calculated.  So that the user cannot manipulate them (and, say, connect several tariffs at once, which are advantageous both for talking within the network and for very cheap calls outside the network), mutual exclusions are created.  They are also indicated everywhere where there is a description of Beeline tariff plans.  For example, if we talk about the service that we characterize in this article, then it cannot be used together with essentially similar options (‚ÄúUnlimited within the network‚Äù, ‚ÄúUnlimited to Beeline numbers‚Äù or ‚ÄúUnlimited within the network with a discount‚Äù), as well as with the tariff ‚ÄúConversations from afar‚Äù.  As soon as the subscriber connects ‚ÄúMy Beeline‚Äù, all of the above options are deactivated. </p>

    <h2>  Tablet or smartphone? </h2><p>  All tariff plans, in addition to their specialized specialization, are also divided depending on the device with which it is more appropriate to use them.  In particular, there are options with a large package of Internet traffic designed for the tablet;  or, conversely, universal tariffs, which offer the subscriber "just a little bit", especially for phones.  If we are talking about the ‚ÄúMy Beeline‚Äù tariff plan (it costs 3 rubles per day or 210 rubles per month, it does not matter) - it is important to note that within its framework minutes are given for calls.  Conversations are obviously more convenient to conduct from a mobile device than from a tablet computer.  Accordingly, using the ‚ÄúMy Beeline‚Äù tariff plan for a tablet is not so advisable.  Although, of course, there are computers with an installed GSM module that allow you to make calls.  For this, of course, you can connect the tariff ‚ÄúMy Beeline‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  No, in fact, on the Internet you can find a description of the tariff plan ‚ÄúMy Beeline‚Äù for the tablet.  Apparently, earlier this was a separate option, which offered some special conditions.  However, having studied this issue in more detail, you can understand that it was canceled, and today there is only one tariff plan with that name.  Based on our findings, apparently, it is designed for a smartphone. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  As for user reviews, it turned out to be not so easy to find them.  The reason is simple - in addition to the fact that there is a tariff plan ‚ÄúMy Beeline‚Äù (Moscow), there is also a mobile system for tracking expenses, controlling an account and working with connected services for subscribers.  In fact, this is a mobile terminal program for those served by Beeline.  So, there is more information on the Internet on it than on a small tariff plan that focuses on communication on the network. </p><p>  Nevertheless, even based on what we managed to find, we can conclude that the conditions of this plan are loyal enough for those who would like to talk with subscribers of their operator.  Its big plus is the fee of only 150 rubles.  per month for such a large package of free minutes.  For those who often speak with other Beeline subscribers, this service would be very helpful. </p><h2>  Cost control system </h2><p>  As for the product of the same name, but more popular, you can paint a lot of information about it, which would be the reason for writing a separate article.  Firstly, the application has a lot of advantages.  <span>This is mobility, the</span> ability to remotely monitor the status of your account, what services you use and how often.  Secondly, working with the system is free - all application services are offered at no additional cost from the subscriber.  The main thing is the desire to connect to the system.  Thirdly, using the ‚ÄúMy Beeline‚Äù program allows you to save significantly.  With it, you can, for example, find out, without the help of consultants and other company employees, what exactly are the costs of the account at the moment. </p><p>  After all, as often happens, users themselves do not know what they ‚Äúhang‚Äù on the subscriber number.  Someone simply does not attach any importance to this, and someone really does not know where the funds go.  In dealing with this, the described tool is very effective, which has an identical name with our tariff plan, which became the object of this article.  Therefore, we recommend using it. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  And as for the tariff ‚ÄúMy Beeline‚Äù, it can be noted that he would have greatly helped those who often speak inside his network.  For a relatively low price, it provides ample opportunities for conversation, including - outside the "home" region.  True, it should be borne in mind that other services are billed (for example, calls to ‚Äúsomeone else's‚Äù numbers) using a different system, depending on what your ‚Äúcommon‚Äù tariff plan is and what conditions apply to it.  After all, it will be he who will determine what price you will pay for each minute of conversation with other operators. </p><p>  And for intranet communication, the option is better than ‚ÄúMy Beeline‚Äù, you are unlikely to find. </p>
