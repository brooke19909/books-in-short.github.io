    <h2>  Title </h2><p>  The name of the city comes from the Arabic language.  Translated means "two lions."  This name is preceded by a legend.  It is believed that before Oran (Algeria) was the place of permanent residence of lions.  When the settlers began to approach the place, they exterminated the animals.  The last two surviving lions stood on the highest hill and kept people out for a long time.  The mountain was subsequently named the Lion.  Also, in honor of animals, the city itself got its name.  Two legendary lions are depicted on the emblem of the city. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The city in Algeria was first mentioned in the X century.  At the beginning of the XV century it was conquered by the Spaniards, and then by the Turks.  In 1790, the city was badly damaged by the earthquake and was almost completely destroyed.  After that, he was captured by the French and remained under their protection until the declaration of independence of Algeria in 1962. </p>
