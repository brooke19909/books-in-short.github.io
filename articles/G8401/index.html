In general, there are several rather interesting and simple methods that will certainly help you cope with the task.  True, not everyone will bring a quick and accurate result.  Let‚Äôs try to figure out how to quickly reach the Megafon operator from anywhere in the world.  Anyway, we‚Äôll find out about possible means of communication with a mobile operator.  Let's get down to business. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone operator how to get through" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/862514.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hot line </h2><p>  Of course, the first and most obvious option is to use a special operator short number.  The so-called telephone hotline.  Consider a communications provider such as <span>Megafon (operator).</span>  <span>How to reach</span> him?  You can dial a hotline phone.  Enter 0500 and wait for an answer. </p><p>  In truth, this method is starting to slowly become obsolete.  After all, talking with the operator on the hotline is far from the most successful choice.  Especially if you take into account the fact that now the majority of calls will be answered by a voice robot.  And that is why many customers are thinking about how to get through to the live operator Megafon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are a lot of different alternative moves.  And all of them will be able to satisfy even the most picky client.  Let's try to figure out what's what. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to quickly reach the operator megaphone" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/862513.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For corporate clients </h2><p>  If you are thinking about how to reach the Megafon operator (the Caucasus or another region of the globe), you can advise you a special number for <span>corporate clients.</span>  It is with his help that you can easily and simply contact a living person located on the other end of the wire. </p><p>  Dial 0555 from your mobile, and then wait for an answer.  As a rule, a truly living person will conduct a dialogue with you.  But here there is a drawback - the risk of getting into the voice of the robot.  Not a particularly nice and good option.  Indeed, this approach very often repels new customers, especially corporate ones.  No one wants to solve issues through some kind of answering machine.  It hurts too long and tedious.  And besides, it is ineffective.  That is why we have to think further about how to get through to the <span>Megafon</span> operator <span>(Moscow</span> or any other city).  Let's try to answer this question, and also try to figure out what other approaches can be offered when trying to contact the operator.  Fortunately, the modern world offers quite a few alternative approaches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  SMS request </h2><p>  Another interesting and simple communication option is to send an SMS request to the operator‚Äôs call.  That is, they will call you back.  And it will definitely be a living person, and not some kind of robot.  And it is very pleasing.  In addition to the options already listed, there are several more means of communication with a service provider such as Megafon (operator).  How to get through without problems? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to call a live operator megaphone" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/862512.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To do this, simply dial a new message on your mobile.  You do not need to write anything in it.  Send it to the short number 0500, and then wait for an answer.  As a rule, you will need to call back after 5-10 minutes. </p><p>  True, not everything is as radiant and optimistic as it might seem at first glance.  The thing is that SMS requests are usually ignored.  And some customers may simply not call.  Not particularly nice to stay away.  Is that right?  And that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs necessary to think again about how to reach the Megafon operator (Volga Region or any other place).  Let's try to answer this question.  After all, we have a lot of diverse and alternative actions.  You are sure to be able to find yourself something suitable and extremely convenient specifically for you. </p><h2>  For city number </h2><p>  Sometimes customers simply do not have the opportunity to call the operator from a mobile number.  And then a huge problem arises.  Indeed, it is simply impossible to get through a short hotline number from a landline phone.  Nevertheless, this is not at all a problem for the communication provider Megafon (operator). </p><p>  How to reach him from your home number?  Take the most ordinary landline phone and dial 8 800 500 05 00. After that, you can wait for the operator to respond.  Typically, the waiting time is 10 minutes.  That's all the communication problems are resolved. </p><p>  Only here there are a number of disadvantages.  The first is the most obvious.  You run the risk of contacting a robot voice.  And already through it you will have to go to a living worker.  This process is very tedious and far from always clear.  In addition, calling on the federal phone means risking your own time.  Yes, the average waiting period for a response is 10 minutes.  But sometimes you have to wait 30 minutes.  Not very bright prospects.  Therefore, now we will try to figure out what else will be able to help us in our difficult task.  After all, we still have a number of interesting and at the same time simple approaches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="http://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/862513.jpg" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/862506.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Roaming </h2><p>  For example, our roaming customers are most often interested in our topic.  As a rule, they need either help, consultation, or solving issues regarding money flowing away from the account somewhere.  Even abroad, you will not leave the "Megaphone" (operator).  How to get through while roaming? </p><p>  In fact, it is still simpler than it might seem.  If you are a Megafon subscriber, then just dial a specific number, and then wait for an answer.  For each type of roaming, it is different.  By the way, such calls are absolutely free for subscribers.  This is their main advantage. </p><p>  While in international roaming, just dial +7 926 111 05 00. After that, you can safely wait for an answer.  For all other types of roaming, it is worth using 0500 or 0555. Calls to these numbers are made absolutely free for Megafon subscribers.  But there is another quite interesting approach to our current issue.  Which one?  Let's get to know him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to reach the operator megaphone Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/862505.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Internet to help </h2><p>  There is another rather interesting approach.  You can try to use the official site of "Megfon".  The fact is that all modern companies support a feedback form.  It is very convenient for both employees and customers. </p><p>  You just need to go to the site and then visit the "Support" section.  In it, select "Contacts", "Ask a question in the chat."  After you select this item, the so-called feedback form will appear.  In it you can post your question, as well as order a call back.  Just write your number, and then enter the approximate time convenient for the call.  That's all the problems are solved. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, today we have figured out how to reach the Megafon operator.  As you can see, the operator offers a lot of quite interesting, simple and diverse approaches, each of which is versatile and convenient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to reach the operator megaphone Volga region" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/862504.jpg" width="600"></div>
