Already on the first May holidays, air warms up here to + 26 ° C, and water - up to + 21 ° C.  But the real beach season opens here from the middle of the month. </p><p>  The main resorts of Turkey are Alanya, Antalya.  It is always warmer than the national average.  In these resorts you can soak up the beaches and go on exciting water excursions, as well as explore the local attractions that are enough in Turkey. </p><p>  If you are thinking about where to go in early May, then you should consider Turkey.  At the beginning of the month, numerous festivals are held here and many of the most diverse holidays are celebrated. </p><p>  Is it necessary to say that the Russians feel at home in the resorts of Turkey?  Here, service in Russian is actively practiced. </p><div class="photo" data-original="holidaydestinations4all.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go in may with a child" class="if uuid-2378528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/2378528.jpg"></div><h2>  Morocco </h2><p>  Exotic for the Russians and the right answer to your thoughts on where to go in late May.  Here you can relax with children.  The country is very sincere and hospitable.  In May, the air warms up here to + 28 ° C, and water - up to +25 ° C.  The beach season officially opens by the middle of the month.  The influx of tourists begins in early June.  The end of May is the best option to relax with your children.  At your disposal, in addition to a beach holiday, numerous excursions and acquaintance with nature and history, which will benefit the child in terms of development. </p><p>  The water here has a bewitching emerald color.  The beaches are clean and very long.  The service is top notch, you will find everything to have fun.  In Morocco, you can stay at a hotel or find accommodation in the private sector. </p><h2>  Montenegro </h2><p>  Montenegro can be considered in May, if you are flying on vacation, so as not to track your sides on the beach, but to spend time actively.  Sometimes the beach holiday season is already open from May, but sometimes it doesn’t.  But there is a great chance to go abroad for very modest money. </p><p>  Is such a risk justified?  You decide, but in any case, an excellent excursion program is guaranteed, and if you are lucky with the weather, then gorgeous beaches will be at your disposal.  It is worth emphasizing that these beaches will be sparsely populated.  A good option for those who like a measured rest without fuss.  Service at the resorts of Montenegro at the highest level, even by international standards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mirror.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go in May for a beach vacation" class="if uuid-2378527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/2378527.jpg"></div><h2>  Bulgaria </h2><p>  Bulgaria in May is also a risk, as is Montenegro.  The beach season also opens here, usually in May, but it will not be hot, but moderately.  An option for those who want to relax in silence, calmly swim and enjoy nature. </p><p>  Some call Bulgaria the budget version of Montenegro.  You can’t say so, because these are different countries, but still there is such an opinion. </p><p>  I must say that the beach season in Bulgaria almost coincides with the Russian resorts, the only difference is the cleanliness of the beaches, the sea and the price / quality ratio.  Now it’s worth touching on our resorts. </p><h2>  Russian resorts </h2><p>  We examined the most popular options for where to go abroad in May.  Of course, the options are not limited to this list.  Our world is large, and there are many secluded corners.  If not one of the options described by us suits you, then you can find your best!  Believe me, there are still a lot of such options! </p><p>  But we want to talk a little about something else.  <span>Where to go in May in Russia?</span>  If you are interested in beach vacations, then it may well be that by the end of May, Russian beach resorts are already comfortable.  There is no 100% probability.  You need to navigate the weather.  If spring is early and hot, then from mid-May you can sunbathe on Russian beaches, and if spring is long and late, it happens that the beginning of the beach season shifts to the beginning of June.  However, this is the situation not only with domestic resorts.  Everywhere it all depends on the weather. </p><p>  The advantage of Russian resorts is that you can not get there by plane.  This is a great option, who is panicky afraid to fly.  Getting here by car and train is not a short journey, but those who cannot fly do not stop such problems. </p><p>  You can relax in the Crimea or Sochi.  If you prefer an active holiday, you can purchase a tourist tour to any historical city of our homeland. </p><h2>  Where to go in May </h2><p>  If you want your vacation not to depend on weather fluctuations, then you need to go to where the season always opens in early May.  This means that in mid-May it will be guaranteed to be comfortable there, regardless of weather quirks in a particular season. </p><p>  But there is one point.  If you do not like crowded beaches, then you have to rest at the start of the season or already in the velvet season.  It is these two facets of beach vacations that are fraught with weather surprises, but there is also a reward for this kind of risk.  At the peak of the season, prices for everything at the resorts are much higher, and even the apple has nowhere to fall on the beaches themselves, they are full! </p><p>  Where to go on vacation at sea in May - only you can choose.  No one else knows what you need.  Of course, a lot determines the travel budget.  Also, much depends on the remoteness of the resort.  Many of us are simply not ready for a flight of ten or more hours. </p><p>  Personal preferences are the main criterion.  Someone always needs something exotic, but someone does not like all this exoticism and is more inclined to the classic options for relaxation.  It is also worth considering that if you choose a very long flight, it is desirable that the length of stay at this resort be at least two weeks. </p><p>  The fact is that a long flight can be very expensive, that is, it can be the main criterion in the pricing of your vacation.  Therefore, you will pay for the flight in any case, and the difference between staying at the resort for a week or two weeks can be very small.  In this case, sometimes it is better to pay a little extra and stay in an exotic country under the hot sun longer.  This opportunity, of course, is not always there, but you need to take this into account when planning your vacation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidaypirates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="May beach holidays" class="if uuid-2378543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/2378543.jpg"></div><p>  We can also advise you to organize your vacation in advance, it will be noticeably cheaper.  And when you plan a vacation in advance, then you have less opportunity to miss, forget or not take into account.  Enjoy your holiday to you and your loved ones! </p>
