In addition, with the help of such products you can not only emphasize your taste, but also add a touch of freshness, originality, uniqueness to the interior ensemble.  However, it seems to novice masters that they cannot cope with such work.  But professionals say the opposite.  We studied the issue in detail and prepared a detailed and understandable article for readers.  Which will explain the technology of making spectacular pillowcases crocheted.  We will also study the schemes of interesting models, the features of taking measurements, and many other important nuances of the work in the material presented below. </p><h2>  Material and tool selection </h2><p>  There are no strict recommendations regarding yarn.  Therefore, it is up to each needlewoman to decide on her own what to conceive the conceived product from.  However, for openwork pillowcases (pillows from napkins) it is better to take a thin thread.  For example, "Iris."  But pillowcases such as "grandmother's square" or "African flower" look more interesting if knitted with woolen yarn.  In general, experienced needlewomen recommend using yarn left over from other products to implement the crocheted pillowcase scheme you like using a crocheted pillowcase.  After all, every master probably has a whole package of small balls and hanks.  And so you can get rid of the remnants, and create the original thing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted pillow for beginners" class="if uuid-2998292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2998292.jpg"></div><h2>  Simple Pillow Case </h2><p>  Novice masters should not immediately take up complex products.  It is better to take the most ordinary square pillow of any size and knit ‚Äúclothes‚Äù for her.  And after mastering the skill on a more complex version.  Traditionally, any pillowcases fit from the center to the sides.  But at the initial stage, of course, you can connect a chain, the number of loops in which is equal to one side of the square.  Then, moving in a straight line, that is, an even cloth (without increases and decreases), tie to the opposite side.  And then climb the same distance.  In this case, you can crochet a pillowcase according to the pattern of any simple pattern or with ordinary columns.  Thus preparing two details of the pillowcase.  Sew which is necessary on two sides, and the third supplement with zipper.  So that the product can be washed from time to time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Take measurements from the pillow </h2><p>  If the reader wants to knit a square pillowcase in accordance with all the rules, it is necessary to measure the pillow first.  To do this, take a centimeter tape and use it to determine the length of one side.  Thus, we find out the number of loops to which we must come.  It is not difficult to calculate the series for the increments.  It is only necessary to divide the length of the side into two.  To find out how many loops you need to add in each row, you should subtract the two initial loops from the total number of loops.  And divide the resulting value into rows that separate the center from the sides. </p><h2>  How to crochet a square </h2><p>  Experienced craftsmen say that for crocheting a square pillowcase, you need to stick to the following steps: </p><ol><li>  We knit a chain of eight loops. </li><li>  Lock in the ring. </li><li>  Next, we knit, moving in a circle. </li><li>  In the first case, we raise the loops of the previous row, knitting them, and make two airy ones, forming the angle of the square. </li><li>  In the second, we act differently.  We raise the loops of the previous row, and at the corner we knit two in a column.  Depending on the pattern, these can be single crochet or double crochet. </li><li>  Whatever technology the reader prefers, he will still, with each subsequent row, increase the side of the square by two loops. </li></ol><h2>  How to knit pillowcases from napkins </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted pillow" class="if uuid-2998209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2998209.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to use an openwork pattern when crocheting a knitted pillowcase on a pillow, you can search for the pattern in a magazine that contains masterclasses on napkins.  In this case, the pillow can be square or round.  It is also worth noting that the openwork part can be located on only one side.  The second will be connected by simple columns.  Or you can prepare two napkins of the right size, sew them and add zippers.  Make a contrasting color lining for your pillow and give the finished product even more originality.  However, in this case, experienced craftsmen recommend knitting a pillowcase with monochrome yarn, and not motley.  If the needlewoman really likes the napkin scheme, the shape of which does not fit the existing pillow, the masters advise just to rip the old thing.  Prepare a lining of the desired shape and fill with filler.  And after proceeding to crochet pillowcases according to the pattern, which came to taste. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Curly pillowcases </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted pillow" class="if uuid-2998344" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2998344.jpg"></div><p>  If a knitter is ready to give a new life to an obsolete pillow, an even more interesting product can be knitted.  This option is suitable for creative and creative people, as well as for those who are tired of boring traditional forms.  Curly pillowcases can be different.  However, the most prominent among them are hexagonal and resembling a starfish.  Moreover, they can also be made dense enough so that the lining is not visible.  Or, on the contrary, fishnet, highlighting the pillowcase in contrast. </p><h2>  Pillowcases from motives </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ar.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted pillow step by step" class="if uuid-2998308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2998308.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, experienced needlewomen note that novice craftsmen, confident that they can‚Äôt cope with crocheting curly pillowcases, the patterns and description of which are proposed above, can be recommended to make a pillow of motifs.
