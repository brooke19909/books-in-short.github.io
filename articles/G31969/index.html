    <h2>  Obersee Lake </h2><p>  Obersee is located very close to the Royal Lake.  Closely adjacent to it, it shares its waters with Koenigssee.  From all sides he was surrounded by mountains.  On its shores there are no roads or residential buildings.  The only exception is the peasant's yard.  In the peasant courtyard they sell natural milk, cheese, butter.  Along the way, you can meet grazing cows, which produce milk for all this production. </p><p>  You can get to Obersee only by boat, sailing along Koenigssee to the pier of Salet.  Then you need to go along a small path.  The water in it is clean and has an emerald hue.  It is so transparent that the bottom is visible.  Algae does not grow in Obersee, only stones are visible at the bottom. </p><p>  On the other side of the lake is the Rothbach Falls.  Streams of water fall from a height of almost 370 meters.  It is not easy to approach it from below, since there are cliffs everywhere.  But to the very top of the waterfall there is a bypass walking path.  Obersee is a real corner of idyll and untouched nature with waterfalls seeping between, mountain paths and trees, sometimes of bizarre shape. </p>
