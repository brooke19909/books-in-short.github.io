In addition to the mild climate, proximity to the sea coast and the warm sun, Aleppo also has a number of architectural monuments that have a thousand-year history.  Many of them are "living witnesses" of the era of the <span>Great Silk Road, the</span> Roman conquests and the reign of the procurators.  Like any other eastern city, Aleppo (or Aleppo, as the locals call it) can tell us the history of not only the eastern Mediterranean peoples, but European ethnic groups, who repeatedly conquered it, erecting their monuments and structures there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Syria Aleppo" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/45743.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  To date, Aleppo (like almost all of Syria) has become a large entertainment center, where tourists from different parts of the world are welcome.  All sorts of hotels, cottage villages and hostels are located on the territory of the eastern metropolis.  Along with this service, the entertainment business is booming in the city, which offers everyone who wants to visit casinos, restaurants, clubs and cinemas and spend in this way more than one wonderful evening in the old city.  It is worth noting that all the modern institutions that were built in Aleppo are designed in the same oriental style, so they are in perfect harmony with the ancient buildings, and the city has a holistic and beautiful appearance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main attraction of the city is the <span>citadel of Aleppo.</span>  <span>Syria</span> only in the XX century recognized this <span>architectural structure,</span> which for many years was the main city, <span>a</span> world-wide <span>architectural monument</span> .  These giant walls, which were previously considered a fortress, were erected by the joint efforts of the crusaders and local residents in the first century AD. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aleppo Syria" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/45744.jpg" width="550"></div>  Within the fortress was a whole city, on the territory of which there was a mosque, a mausoleum, the palaces of the ruling dynasty and villages for the troops of the state of Syria.  Aleppo, fenced by this fence, is now considered the old part of the city, as well as its main attraction.

    <p>  The city of Aleppo has for many years been proudly known as the "Northern Capital".  Syria, like many other states, has both an official (main) city and a historical one, of which Aleppo is.  It is here that tourists can buy souvenirs that are not made anywhere else, and among them are handmade carpets, clay jugs in the old oriental style, custom-made shoes, talismans and potions, as well as all that Syria is rich in.  Aleppo is a city whose memories will never be erased, and this is exactly the place you always want to return to. </p>
