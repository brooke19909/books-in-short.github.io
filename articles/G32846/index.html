  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do-it-yourself paving slabs: how to lay it out correctly</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, an increasing number of our fellow citizens use paving slabs to decorate their cottages and country houses.  With its help, you can lay out tracks and platforms of various shapes and colors.  Also, paving slabs have high strength, due to which its service life is many years.  True, if it is properly laid. </p><p>  The only thing that can upset a modern person is often the very high prices for paving slabs.  That is why many summer residents do not dare to such beauty, leaving it only in their dreams.  It turns out that even from such a situation there is a way out.  <span>Do-it-yourself paving slabs</span> are a real chance to ennoble any territory.  All costs will be reduced to the preparation of concrete mortar and the purchase of special forms into which the mixture will be poured.  Although, the forms can also be made independently, for example, from wooden bars, which are connected by nails and fixed with slats.  What shape will you decide: diamond-shaped, square, etc. </p><p>  How is the solution prepared?  It is difficult to determine the exact amount of solution for one form, since it is impossible to determine how large it will be.  <span>Paving slabs with their own hands</span> can be made from a solution having the following composition: 1 part cement (grades 400 and above), 3 parts sand and the same amount of water.  It is best to knead it in a plastic container, since then it is easier to wash.  The finished solution is poured into molds.  In sunny weather, it freezes in a day. </p><p>  It turns out that <span>paving slabs</span> with their own hands can be not only made, but also laid out in the place where you want.  The amount of time spent depends on what area you are going to lay out.  A work plan will be described below, adhering to which is as strict as possible. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Technology of laying paving slabs</strong> </p><p>  Do not listen to those who claim <span>that</span> only qualified professionals should do <span>this work</span> .  In fact, there is nothing complicated, the main thing is to carry out all the actions in order. </p><ol><li>  Using pegs and rope, we mark the territory where the paving slabs will be located.  The rope should be stretched at the height to which you will raise the curb.  Along the perimeter of the marked area, right under the rope, dig a trench (width 20-30 cm), in which the border will be placed.  Kneading concrete (one part of cement and five parts of sand with gravel), we tightly insert the curb sections into the trench and fill their base with concrete. </li><li>  Now we move on to preparing the place for paving slabs.  Remove the topsoil, forming the base slightly in an inclined position (so that the water drains and does not stagnate).  Cooking the base pillow.  Sprinkle the entire area with crushed stone, well-tamped with a regular home mop.  Pour a layer of sand on top, compact again, while leveling. </li><li>  Now proceed to the calculation.  The easiest way is decorative brickwork, "Christmas tree" and "column".  Start laying from the corner and move diagonally from one border to another.  Leave a small gap between the tiles so that subsequently no cracks appear.  If in some places the tile does not fit completely, it will have to be cut, and it is easiest to do this using the ‚Äúgrinder‚Äù. </li><li>  After the paving slabs are laid out with your own hands, take the sand, sprinkle it over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe calculation and, using a broom, notice at the joints.  Thanks to this, the earth will not become clogged, as well as grass to grow. </li></ol><p>  That's all the work!  Now you can easily lay out paving slabs in the place where you want.  Just imagine how your neighbors and friends will envy you, who continue to walk along the grass! </p>
