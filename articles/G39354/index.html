Indeed, even if you expect to spend very little time at the hotel, coming here only to change clothes and sleep, staying in uncomfortable conditions is unlikely to add positive emotions to your vacation.  As for the hotels operating on the all-inclusive system, on the territory of which the guests are located around the clock, their choice should be approached with special attention and responsibility.  Indisputable help in this can be provided by reviews of real people who have already happened to stop recently in a particular place.  After all, they are ready to share information not only about the advantages, which are often already obvious, but also about the disadvantages that travel agents often try not to mention.  In order to save time, we bring to your attention the generalized comments of our compatriots who were recently vacationing in the five-star AMC Royal Hotel complex (Hurghada, Egypt).  The rating of this hotel is about 4.4 points out of five possible, which speaks for itself.  Indeed, almost all tourists did not regret their choice at all and assure that the hotel meets both its category and price.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ams Royal Hotel Hurghada photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1047448.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, they declare that the rooms here are in good repair, spacious, bright and very comfortable.  A big plus is the fact that many apartments have sea views.  As for equipment and furniture, then, according to the guests, everything here is modern, almost new.  So breakdowns are extremely rare.  If something fails, then the malfunction will be fixed very quickly, you just have to report a problem at the reception.  In general, the only drawback mentioned by travelers was the lack of room in the rooms for drying wet items. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Ams Royal Hotel Hurghada" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1047447.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning, check-in </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, they were very pleased with the work of the maids of the AMC Royal Hotel (Hurghada).  So, they argue that the cleaning of the rooms was carried out every day and very high quality.  As necessary, the maids replenished supplies of personal hygiene products and the contents of the minibar.  Towels and bed linen were updated several times a week. </p><p>  As for the arrival at the hotel, according to tourists, as a rule, administrators at the reception try to do everything possible to accommodate a traveler who has just arrived in their intended room, without condemning him to long waiting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ams Royal Hotel Hurghada Egypt" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1047453.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Own territory </h2><p>  According to many guests, this hotel has a very compact private territory.  However, she is very well maintained.  There is a mass of flowering plants, palm trees, pretty places.  Throughout the day, gardeners watered, transplanted, cleaned something - in a word, ennoble the already very beautiful territory. </p><p>  Almost all travelers were satisfied with the location of the AMC Royal Hotel.  Indeed, in addition to the fact that in the vicinity of the hotel there are a lot of restaurants, shops, excursion bureaus, etc., in just a quarter of an hour you can drive to the center of Hurghada, where many tourist infrastructure facilities are concentrated.  In addition, the hotel is not far from the airport.  So the road will not be difficult even for those who go on vacation with young children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ams royal hotel hurghada egypt rating" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1047452.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  On this point, the views of the vast majority of tourists coincided.  So, many of our compatriots claim that the food in the AMC Royal Hotel (Hurghada), photos of which can be seen in this article, is organized at a very high level.  The main restaurant of the hotel guests will find a wide selection of different dishes from meat, fish, poultry, seafood.  You can also always try a variety of salads, snacks, soups, desserts, pastries, fresh fruits and vegetables.  There is also a separate children's table.  So nobody will be hungry here.  In addition, the hotel has several restaurants where you can order an à la carte dish.  Judging by their comments, the Italian restaurant was especially popular with our compatriots.  In addition, all guests have the opportunity, if they wish, to eat fast food both on the beach and in the hotel complex. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  This item caused most tourists, judging by their reviews, extremely positive emotions.  So, they claim that the private beach of the AMC Royal Hotel (Hurghada) is literally a couple of minutes walk from the residential buildings and the reception.  There is a sufficient number of sun loungers and umbrellas.  True, some tourists claim that when the hotel is almost full, sun loungers on the beach may not be enough for everyone.  Therefore, guests preferred to get up early in the morning and go ashore to take a deck chair.  However, for most tourists this was not a problem.  After all, one could always comfortably sit on sunbeds by the pool and go swimming in the sea, especially since the distance in this case had to be overcome very small. </p><p>  As for the beach itself, it is very large, sandy.  All day the hotel staff monitors its cleanliness, removing the rubbish left by vacationers.  There is also a bar and restaurant on the beach where you can enjoy your favorite drinks and not only have a snack during the day, but also have a full lunch if you wish.  Entry into the water, according to tourists, is gentle.  However, it is recommended to use special shoes, as stones and dead corals are found at the bottom.  If you want to immediately be at a depth, then you can go down into the water from the pier.  As for the coral reef, it is available off the coast.  However, as experienced travelers note, its population is not as bright and diverse as in the waters of Sharm el-Sheikh.  But, undoubtedly, there is something to see here, so do not forget to bring a snorkeling mask from Egypt from home or buy it in Egypt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ams Royal Hotel Hurghada Description" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1047451.jpg" width="600"></div>
