    <h2>  How to make a beautiful product?  Brooch "Fly" </h2><p>  To make this stylish craft, you will need to prepare the following materials and tools: </p><ul><li>  beads and long bugles silver and black; </li><li>  two large shiny beads of dark gray color; </li><li>  thin wire (0.43 mm); </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  Having acquired the necessary materials and organized a workplace, get to work.  We will perform the fly using the following schemes for beads. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaded animals for beginners" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/446034.jpg" width="600"></div>  Animals, as a rule, are made of separate parts, which are then assembled into a single structure.  First, we will make four wings of a fly (see Fig. A).  Take a piece of wire about 20 cm long, beads and glass beads of silver color.  The first row of the wing will be made of 1 pc.  bugles.  Then we collect beads and bugles, we extend the ends of the wires towards each other.  The third row is made of one bugle and two beads.  Strictly adhere to the scheme of work, stringing beads, make sure that they are always from the same edge as in the previous row.  The fourth row - the middle of the wing - is made of one bugle and three beads.  The fifth row is made of the same number of beads as the previous one, but they are typed from the other end.  Further, work continues with a decrease in the number of beads by one in each subsequent row.  The last row of the element is made of bugles (1 pc.).  Everything, the first wing of the fly is ready.  By analogy, we carry out three more exactly the same details.

We will help with the scheme! </h2><p>  Now we start weaving the body of a fly.  We take a piece of wire 25 cm long and black beads.  We begin to perform the torso from the back, guided by rice.  <em>b</em> .  The first row is made of one black bead.  The second - of the two, letting the ends of the working wire towards each other, and the third - of the three.  Next, we perform three rows with four beads, without magnifications.  It will be the abdomen of our fly.  Now we carry out three more rows of three beads in each.  Here we will mount the wings.  Next, we string two large shiny beads on the ends of the wire.  The eyes of the fly are ready.  It remains to make a proboscis of two black beads and complete the part with bugles (1 pc.).  The ends of the wires are fixed with a twist around the last bead.  Our fly is almost ready.  It remains to make paws and assemble all the parts together. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="animal pattern beads" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/446044.jpg" width="445"></div>

    <h2>  Silver-black bead fly: finish the job </h2><p>  To make the presser foot, take a small piece of wire.  On one end of it sequentially string glass beads - 1 pc., Bead, then again glass beads and beads (Fig. C).  By analogy, perform another 5 legs.  After manufacturing all the parts, proceed to assembly - attach the wings (the attachment points are indicated on the diagram with the letter <em>A</em> ) and the legs to the body.  Everything, your fly is ready!  It can be used as a separate original decoration or included as an integral part in any composition.  Now you know how easy it is to make animals out of beads.  With the scheme, we hope the work seems quite simple and intuitive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cute "Bunny": a master class for beginner needlewomen </h2><p>  To make this craft, you will need number 8 beads in white, black, pink and red.  You will also need a red bead (or large bead No. 5) and a 0.3 mm <span>copper wire</span> .  <span>How to make animals from beads?</span>  With the circuit it is not difficult! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="animal bead patterns" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/446035.jpg" width="600"></div>  We will begin the work by making the ear from white and pink beads (see Fig. A).  By analogy, we will perform the second ear, and then connect the parts as shown in Fig.  <em>b</em> .  At the remaining end of the wire of the first ear, we lower three white beads and draw it through the holes of two beads of the last row of the second ear.  Next, we extend the end of the wire of the second ear through the holes of three beads and through two beads of the last row of the first ear.  Then we continue to string the bunny's head using white beads.  The eyes are made of black beads, the cheeks are made of pink, and the nose is made of large red beads.  Weaving all the rows of the head, the ends of the wire remaining after completing the ears, we fix the twisting between the rows and bring them through the hole of a large red bead.  And then we will make mustache loops out of them (see fig. C <em>, d</em> and <em>e</em> ).

    <h2>  Beaded animals (for beginners): we continue to fulfill the bunny </h2><p>  After making the head, we proceed to weaving the legs and torso according to the following scheme. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="animal bead with a pattern" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/446047.jpg" width="600"></div>  Paws are made of white beads with one working end of the wire as the rest of the rows are lowered.  The body is made of red beads.  After creating the lower paws, the ends of the working wire are fixed by entwining behind the fifth bead from the edge.  We hope, having learned how to perform simple crafts - a fly and a hare, you will love the beads.  Animal patterns later you can come up with yourself, showing imagination.  Over time, you will certainly learn to create original products in the form of flowers, insects, fish and any funny animals.  Good luck
