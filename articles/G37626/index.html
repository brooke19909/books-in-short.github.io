Their relations and relations are determined by a certain social status, functions and roles that they perform, the norms and values ‚Äã‚Äãgenerally accepted in this system, as well as their individual qualities.  Society is usually divided into three types: traditional, industrial, and post-industrial.  Each of them has its own distinctive features and functions. </p><p>  This article will examine a traditional society (definition, characteristics, foundations, examples, etc.). </p><h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  A modern person of the industrial era, new to history and social sciences, may not understand what a ‚Äútraditional society‚Äù is.

    <p>  <span>Traditional society</span> operates on the basis of traditional values.  Often it is perceived as tribal, primitive and backward feudal.  It is a society with an agrarian system, with sedentary structures and with methods of social and cultural regulation based on traditions.  It is believed that most of its history, humanity was at this stage. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The traditional society, the definition of which is considered in this article, is a collection of groups of people who are at different levels of development and do not have a mature industrial complex.  The determining factor in the development of such social units is agriculture. </p><h2>  Characteristics of a Traditional Society </h2><p>  Traditional society is characterized by the following features: </p><p>  1. Low production rates, satisfying the needs of people at a minimum level. <br>  2. Large energy intensity. <br>  3. Non-adoption of innovations. <br>  4. Strict regulation and control of the behavior of people, social structures, institutions, customs. <br>  5. As a rule, in a traditional society, any manifestation of individual freedom is prohibited. <br>  6. Social formations sanctified by traditions are considered unshakable - even the thought of their possible changes is perceived as criminal. </p><h2>  Economics of traditional society </h2><p>  Traditional society is considered agrarian, as it is based on agriculture.  Its functioning depends on the cultivation of crops using a plow and livestock.  So, the same plot of land could be cultivated several times, resulting in permanent settlements. <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Economics of traditional society" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/822812.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The traditional society is also characterized by the predominant use of manual labor, an extensive <span>mode of production, the</span> absence of market forms of trade (the predominance of exchange and redistribution).  This led to the enrichment of individuals or estates. </p><p>  Forms of ownership in such structures are usually collective.  Any manifestations of individualism are not perceived and denied by society, and are also considered dangerous, since they violate the established order and traditional balance.  There are no impulses to the development of science and culture, therefore extensive technologies are used in all areas. </p><h2>  Political structure </h2><p>  The political sphere in such a society is characterized by authoritarian power, which is inherited.  This is because only in this way can traditions be maintained for a long time.  The management system in such a society was quite primitive (hereditary power was in the hands of the elders).  The people have virtually no influence on politics. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Features of a traditional society" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/822813.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <p>  Often there is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe divine origin of the person in whose hands was the power.  In this regard, politics is actually completely subordinate to religion and is carried out only according to the sacred instructions.  The combination of secular and spiritual power made possible the ever greater submission of people to the state.  This, in turn, strengthened the sustainability of the traditional type of society. </p><h2>  Social relations </h2><p>  In the field of social relations, the following features of a traditional society can be distinguished: </p><p>  1. The patriarchal device. <br>  2. The main objective of the functioning of such a society is to maintain human activity and to avoid its extinction as a species. <br>  3. Low level of <span>social mobility.</span> <br>  4. The traditional society is characterized by division into classes.  Each of them played a different social role. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Traditional and industrial society" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/822814.jpg" width="600"></div>  5. Assessment of personality in terms of the place that people occupy in a hierarchical structure. <br>  6. A person does not feel like an individual, he considers only his belonging to a certain group or community.

    <h2>  Spiritual sphere </h2><p>  In the spiritual sphere, traditional society is characterized by deep religiosity and moral attitudes, instilled from childhood.  Certain rituals and dogmas were an integral part of human life.  Writing in a traditional society as such did not exist.  That is why all the traditions and traditions were transmitted orally. </p><h2>  Relations with nature and the world </h2><p>  The impact of traditional society on nature was primitive and insignificant.  This was explained by low-waste production, represented by cattle breeding and agriculture.  Also, in some societies, certain religious rules existed that condemned the pollution of nature. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Traditional society is characterized by" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/822839.jpg" width="486"></div>

    <p>  In relation to the outside world, it was closed.  Traditional society did its best to protect itself from intrusions from outside and any external influences.  As a result of this, man perceived life as static and unchanging.  Qualitative changes in such societies took place very slowly, and revolutionary shifts were perceived extremely painfully. </p><h2>  Traditional and industrial society: differences </h2><p>  Industrial society arose in the 18th century, as a result of <span>industrial revolutions,</span> primarily in England and France. </p><p>  It should highlight some of its distinguishing features. <br>  1. Creation of a large machine production. <br>  2. Standardization of parts and components of different mechanisms.  This made mass production possible. <br>  3. Another important distinguishing feature is urbanization (the growth of cities and the relocation of a significant part of the population on their territory). <br>  4. The division of labor and its specialization. </p><p>  Traditional and industrial society have significant differences.  The former is characterized by a natural division of labor.  Traditional values ‚Äã‚Äãand a patriarchal system prevail here, mass production is absent. </p><p>  It should also highlight the post-industrial society.  The traditional, unlike it, aims at the extraction of natural wealth, rather than the collection of information and its storage. </p><h2>  Examples of Traditional Society: China </h2><p>  Vivid examples of a traditional type of society can be found in the East in the Middle Ages and modern times.  Among them, it is worth highlighting India, China, Japan, the Ottoman Empire. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Society Examples" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/822830.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <p>  From ancient times, China has been distinguished by strong state power.  By the nature of evolution, the society of this <span>country developed</span> cyclically.  China is characterized by a constant alternation of several eras (development, crisis, social explosion).  It should also be noted the unity of the spiritual and religious authorities in this country.  By tradition, the emperor received the so-called "Mandate of Heaven" - a divine permission to rule. </p><h2>  Japan </h2><p>  The development of Japan in the Middle Ages and in <span>modern times</span> also allows us to say that there was a traditional society, the definition of which is considered in this article.  The entire population of the Land of the Rising Sun was divided into 4 classes.  The first is samurai, daima and shogun (personified the highest secular power).  They held a privileged position and had the right to carry weapons.  The second estate - peasants who owned the land as a hereditary holding.  The third are artisans and the fourth are merchants.  It should be noted that trade in Japan was considered an unworthy business.  It is also worth highlighting the strict regulation of the <span>social life of</span> each of the estates. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Post-industrial society traditional" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/822836.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  Unlike other traditional eastern countries, in Japan there was no unity of the supreme secular and spiritual authority.  The first personified shogun.  In his hands was most of the land and enormous power.  Also in Japan was the emperor (tenno).  He was the personification of spiritual authority.

    <h2>  India </h2><p>  Vivid examples of a traditional type of society can be found in India throughout the history of the country.  At the heart of the Mughal empire, located on the Hindustan Peninsula, lay a military and caste system.  The supreme ruler - padishah - was the main owner of all the land in the state.  Indian society was strictly divided into castes, whose life was strictly regulated by laws and sacred regulations. </p>
