Should I go there in the summer?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Dominican Republic in July is just a world center of music, fun, excitement and the hot summer sun.  Midsummer here is famous for its dance marathons, festivals that last for weeks, and demonstrate to all tourists and guests of the country their national treasures.  If there is one drawback in all this southern beauty, then this is the weather in the Dominican Republic - in July it can ‚Äúplease‚Äù with torrential rains.  However, most often they happen at night, and during the day a bright sun shines over the islands. </p><h2>  What is this tropical paradise? </h2><p>  The main goal of every tourist traveling to the <span>Caribbean</span> is a first-class beach holiday.  In addition, people are also attracted to numerous carnivals, parties that never cease, fun and a riot of natural colors.  And this is not surprising, because the Dominican Republic on the world map is located, one might say, in the heart of the planet.  It does not reach the equator a bit and at the same time is in the tropics, where the difference between winter and summer is not felt at all.  It‚Äôs not sultry, not stuffy, but just very warm all year round.  The turquoise <span>Caribbean Sea</span> warms up by the southern sun, the amount of precipitation is minimal, and everyone in such conditions can simply forget and go into complete relaxation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic in July" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/478241.jpg" width="600"></div>

The sun perfectly heats sand, and the sea, and air, but it does not create a sensation of heat, heat or steam room.  In July, the Dominican Republic generally warms up to 30-35 degrees, which is acceptable for relaxing with friends, and for holidays with children.  However, due to the fact that rains occur during this period, ticket prices are significantly reduced.  There is no such influx of tourists from America and Canada, which is traced here in the winter months, so many hotels reduce the price of most of their services.  In addition, you can choose almost any number for yourself, and not worry that there will be no empty seats. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in the Dominican Republic in July" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/478240.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Local humidity and how to deal with it? </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that a July vacation in the Dominican Republic is not for everyone.  If you or your loved ones, who are also going on a cruise, have problems with pressure or with the cardiovascular system, it is advisable to postpone the trip for other months.  Due to rains and winds, it is very humid, so constant changes in atmospheric pressure can adversely affect health.  But even if you have no problems with the vessels, you should still think in advance whether you can withstand the constant changes in humidity.  Also, in advance, talk with the owner of the hotel to ensure that the air conditioners in your room are adjusted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic holiday season" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/478238.jpg" width="480"></div>

In some resort areas very high waves rise, which attracts tourists from different countries.  In general, the Dominican Republic in July during the daytime pleases with calm weather.  Small waves may rise at sea, but they will not interfere with your swimming.  The beaches of Punta Cana are considered the warmest, and the lowest temperatures are observed on the coasts of Puerto Plata.  We also note that in those places where the sea is characterized by eternal calm (these are bays, bays, and so on), people often dive under water.  Diving and snorkeling are very common here, as the underwater world of the Dominican Republic deserves the highest praise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in july" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/478237.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Possibility to buy a last-minute voucher </h2><p>  One of the most expensive and prestigious resorts in the world is considered to be the Dominican Republic.  The rest season here begins in the fall and ends in the spring.  At this time, tourists from all over the world come here from both the East and the United States.  This is due to the fact that the temperature becomes lower, on average, 25-27 degrees, while the humidity is small, and the amount of precipitation is almost zero.  In summer, the opposite is true.  Here it becomes much warmer and at the same time ‚Äúwetter‚Äù, which is why many people who bought vouchers in advance often refuse them afterwards.  Taking this opportunity, you can go for two weeks to this tropical paradise, while paying a record low amount - up to 70 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic on a world map" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/478239.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Traveling around the islands of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  Arriving here in the summer, many want, in addition to a beach holiday, to enjoy the local attractions.  To do this, you have to choose one of the modes of transport that are available here.  The easiest option is to ride on buses, which, however, are constantly clogged.  A more expensive, but still affordable way to see the sights of the country is to rent an ATV or motorcycle.  Such a transport is released without insurance, only it is worth remembering that you need to be extremely careful on the road.  Car rental is only possible with insurance, with rights, and also if you are over 25 years old.  The service is very expensive and has many pitfalls.  For example, local police often penalize tourists who drive cars with rented numbers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As it becomes clear, the Dominican Republic in July is extreme, excitement, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãentertainment and a lot of heat.  There will be rain, and the sun, and the storm, and calm.  You will be able to walk around cities and towns, and wallow on the beach.  The main thing is to choose the type of vacation that suits you best, and also decide whether high humidity and hot weather are acceptable for you. </p>
