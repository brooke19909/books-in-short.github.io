    <h2>  What is the algorithm of the project? </h2><p>  Before starting work on the project, entrepreneurs and investors - “business angels” (this is what people who invest in startups are called in common people) must register.  During this process, you should indicate who you are: an “investor” or a “specialist”.  In addition, registration involves a brief description of your business idea.  It is noteworthy that on this portal you can place not only a plan for developing your own business, but also publish your resume.  This option is suitable for people who are in search of work. </p><p>  After filling in the appropriate form, the questionnaire of the new project participant is sent for moderation, which takes 24 hours.  And then you just have to enter the system under your credentials and select the “idea”, “specialist” or “investor” that interests you. </p>

    <h2>  What are the benefits of registering on the portal? </h2><p>  According to most users who managed to register on the portal, participation in the project is completely free.  It is believed that web service executives prefer to earn money not from their users, but from advertisers.  And this is a definite plus of this project. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The second important point that users of the portal describe is the live communication of the potential investor and innovator.  From the reviews it is clear that thanks to this service, the investor fully controls the entire investment process.  First, he studies in detail a business plan, project or idea, clarifying various details, then finds out how beneficial this proposal will be for him.  Then he discusses all the subtleties of cooperation.  And then it controls the entire course of work. </p><p>  And finally, each innovator has a unique opportunity to seek the help of experienced specialists, for example, in order to calculate the “prospects” of his project.  The investor also has the right to consult with experts who help to choose the most profitable source of financing. </p>

    <h2>  How does work in a project begin? </h2><p>  Work in the project "Business Angels" (feedback on this resource can be heard from both beginners and fairly experienced entrepreneurs) begins with a well-thought-out presentation. </p><p>  According to the head of the web resource, the main task of the innovator is to find an investor.  Therefore, he needs not only to distinguish himself from other participants, but also to present his idea as ultramodern know-how.  This presentation must be posted on the site after a simple registration procedure. </p><h2>  Search for investors: the next step </h2><p>  At the second stage, each innovator can either wait until investors are interested in his proposal, or closely search for a suitable candidate.  And then it remains only to send out your presentation to the addresses of the selected financiers.  So the virtual project "Business Angels" works.  Reviews about it will allow you to get to know the company closer.  We will talk further about user opinions and a large catalog of experts, innovators and financiers. </p><h2>  What feedback can you hear about the portal? </h2><p>  Since its appearance on the network, the project has caused a flurry of emotions and criticism.  Someone liked it, but some did not.  Consider the most common opinions about the service.  For example, some project participants write that they are satisfied not only with the service, but also with high-quality information support.  They are also grateful for their assistance in finding the financing they need. </p><p>  Others did not find an investor on the portal, but they received a lot of useful tips for finalizing their presentation.  According to them, now they know how to make the idea “selling”. </p><p>  Still others admire the huge base of investment ideas.  They also like the fact that the service is free.  Fourth describe the project itself as a convenient site with a presentable design and an accessible menu.  In addition, they are satisfied with the regular distribution of new ideas and proposals for investment.  In a word, you don’t need to look for anything, everything is “served on a silver platter”. </p><p>  The specialists are also satisfied with this project.  According to them, the resource offers them unlimited opportunities for creativity, which is so often lacking in the main place of work.  Moreover, it helps in finding a part-time job, and also provides an opportunity to make new mutually beneficial acquaintances.  The financial experts, analysts, and business representatives also respond positively to the service.  They themselves often give advice to beginners and share their invaluable experience.  However, do not confuse this promising project with another resource under the same name.  We will tell you more about him. </p>

    <h2>  Business Angel: Reviews (Ltd), or Difficulty in Identifying </h2><p>  Often in the network you can find negative reviews regarding the company "Business Angels".  The only thing in this case is not the aforementioned project, but the new financial pyramid - Business Angels Inc Ltd (Limited).  The company, which began operations in May of this year, offers investors a universal deposit program. </p><p>  She promises compensation within 4% per day and 100% per month.  In this case, the minimum deposit amount is $ 10.  But is the company actively paying? </p><p>  Here's what one review says about the Business Angels hype.  It follows that the company initially worked flawlessly.  In just 28 days, it was possible to return the invested and earn some money.  However, now the resource works only for depositing money, but for withdrawal - no.  According to the investor, wherever he goes, he can’t return for a month already, including the earned interest. </p><p>  Others write that this is all a <span>financial pyramid</span> that is likely to burst soon.  Naturally, with all the money of naive investors.  Others say that they regularly withdraw money with interest and so far they are happy with everything.  Experts, however, argue that when accessing such resources, it is recommended to invest a small amount, which will be uncritical to lose if something happens. </p>

    <h2>  What other projects can help innovators? </h2><p>  Another company that can help you find a potential investor is the Business Angels Association, called Start Investments.  This is a non-profit project, operating since 2006 in Nizhny Novgorod. </p><p>  The company is not an intermediary between innovators and investors, but provides a kind of platform for communication of like-minded people.  Everyone can become members of the Association. </p><p>  Innovators and investors will also be interested in the AddVenture business angel fund, which has been operating in the business services market for more than 8 years.  This organization provides assistance in financing the most prominent entrepreneurs and organizations. </p><p>  In a word, if you want and have free time, you can find not only an idea for investment, but also the investor himself. </p>
