Currently, she began to lose ground for unknown reasons.  However, the pace is not so dynamic, so the company still has chances to restore its former popularity and authority.  Nevertheless, we can say that in the conditions of market competition, Nokia has not so many opportunities that could be realized to lure potential buyers to its side. </p><h2>  Knight Riding </h2>

    <p>  Currently, the Finnish manufacturer considers it a priority to develop high-quality cameras compared to competitors' devices and their integration into their smartphones.  The cameras have become, one might say, the leitmotif in the product line called ‚ÄúLumiya‚Äù, which is now regularly updated with new and new models.  But experts have repeatedly noted that this cannot continue constantly.  The camera theme has almost become obsolete; now any more or less good smartphone has a good module with a resolution of about five megapixels.  It allows you to take normal pictures even in ordinary light conditions.  But many users do not need more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, we can talk about the uniqueness of the devices, their difference from other devices, their gray mass due to the fact that on board each Lumiya you will find not some Android there, but a full-fledged operating system of the Windows Phone family.  However, this is nothing more than a double-edged sword.  Due to this, almost every new model is a cast from the previous one, and almost all of them are similar to each other.  Yes, there are some differences both in hardware and in appearance.  Nevertheless, a single design line can be traced very, very clearly. </p><h2>  Unnecessary solution </h2>

    <p>  The Finnish manufacturer of mobile phones has decided to make a big bet on the game in the middle price segment.  Was it worth it?  We can talk about this for a long time and tediously, citing evidence of two diametrically opposite positions.  But this is not an end in itself, we should only note that the result of such a decision was the creation of two models.  This is the Lumia 730 Dual Sim and similar - the 750th.  In fact, these are two almost identical devices.  The only difference is that in the 750th model there is an LTE module that allows the phone to work in fourth-generation cellular networks, providing packet data transmission at a higher speed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What is a device? </h2>

    <p>  Earlier, we talked about the fact that Nokia preferred tactics of ‚Äúdirect follow-up‚Äù.  That is, she actually sculpts each subsequent model from the previous one.  But the positioning of new devices requires the company to take appropriate steps, therefore, first of all, the technical characteristics of the devices fall under the distribution.  What does all this say?  The fact is that the Lumia 730 Dual SIM is a stripped-down variation of the 830th model.  Indeed, comparing these two devices, we notice that they are, in general, similar.  However, the screen has become smaller in size, the possibility of wireless charging has been eradicated.  The main difference was the change in the main camera.  The matrix remained the same as it was in the 830th, but the software module was cut to a resolution of 6.7 pixels.  Engineers should say thank you for not touching the matrix.  It allows you to receive very, very high-quality images from the camera.  However, the question of why the resolution was changed remains open.  We can only assume that without this Nokia Lumia 730 Dual could be a hidden competitor of the 830th model.  Now users will be offered a difficult choice. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Model feature </h2>

    <p>  Microsoft, in its sales, is trying to position the device as a phone for taking selfie pictures.  And this is understandable, since the resolution of the front camera is 5 megapixels.  This is probably not enough to call the phone a suitable device from other points of view.  We can say that, in fact, there are no raisins in it.  Alas, we must admit it and just put up with it, loving the model for what it has. </p><h2>  Short list of technical characteristics </h2>

    <p>  The subject of our review today is close to the oldest devices that only laid the foundation for the entire product line.  In fact, <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 730 SIM-Dual is quite bright at first glance, the device with no less interesting design than other smartphones.  It is made of plastic, of course.  What colors can a potential buyer find?  Classic (white and black) and non-classic (orange and green).  The package includes a removable panel in dark color.  It is matte, not glossy, so it will be very useful in some situations. </p><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  The Lumia 730 case, reviews about which you can find at the end of this article, is of a collapsible type.  In other words, the battery in it can be replaced.  Inside are the connectors into which you need to install SIM-cards.  There is also a slot in which the user can integrate an external microSD memory card, purchased separately.  The case must be worn directly on the telephone card.  We can say that this design of Nokia smartphones is proprietary.  It, by the way, was quickly adopted by the competitors of the Finnish manufacturer.  Why so?  The thing is that it provides the prevention of many problems associated with the hardware of the device.  It should be noted that the quality of the workmanship is at a high level, although over time glossy plastic will decay decently.  But this, as they say, is not going anywhere. </p><h2>  Much to my surprise </h2><p>  The <span>Lumia 730</span> is the first mid-range device in which engineers decided not to use separate keys for the camera.  Before that they were used.  An interesting solution, we had no choice but to find out the opinion of engineers on this issue.  The Finnish developers mentioned that they did not want to emphasize the resolution of the main camera, which, as we recall, was programmatically trimmed.  The camera features have not found widespread use, but why in vain do you have an eyesore?  There is another feature in the phone.  In it, you will find connectors for SIM cards of the Micro standard, not Nano.  In this regard, the Nokia Lumia 730 smartphone is different from its predecessors.  For example, from the 830th and 930th. </p><h2>  Dimensions and usability </h2><p>  The linear dimensions of the device are 134.7 millimeters in height versus 68.5 and 8.7 in width and thickness, respectively.  The mass of the device is 130 grams.  If we talk about whether it is convenient to use a smartphone with one hand, then we can give a positive answer to the corresponding question.  The device lies even in one hand conveniently and reliably, does not slip.  The feeling of plastic is good.  In general, the engineers and designers did not lose this time with the dimensions.  It is also interesting that these sensations are exactly the same when using panels of various colors.  This suggests an analogy of the technologies used during the creation of spare parts. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  Closer to the edges, the protective glass begins to round.  There are no frames on the case.  Yes, some users would like to see it here, because it allows you to hold the main surface just above the line of a table or other object, if put, for example, with the screen down.  Nevertheless, we will not encounter any such elements in the 730th model, that's for sure.  So that the device does not slip, it will need to be put on the back cover. </p><h2>  Facets and ends </h2><p>  On the right side you can find the volume swing.  They also allow you to normalize the sound mode of the phone.  There is also a power management button, with which we can turn the phone on or off, as well as lock or unlock it.  At the bottom we can find a connector designed to charge or synchronize with a personal computer or laptop.  This is a micro-USB port.  At the opposite end is the entrance for a stereo headset standard 3.5 mm.  It is not included in the kit, apparently, the Finnish manufacturer decided to save additional funds. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  As noted by users and buyers who purchased this phone model, there are no complaints about the communication parameters.  The device works stably in cellular networks, the same can be said about wireless modules.  At the same time, noteworthy is the good sound quality, volume of melodies and vibration alert.  At the same time, all this is standard for devices of the Finnish manufacturer, he almost never backtracked from such rules. </p><p>  Currently, the cost of the device is approximately 13 thousand rubles.  But few people make such sacrifices, especially considering the fact that the phone is intended for the most part to take selfies than for anything else.  Chinese companies can offer orders of magnitude more powerful and productive for a similar amount, and this makes many people hesitate.  This is probably why they pass by the model we have examined. </p>
