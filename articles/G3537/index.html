    <h2>  Some general information </h2><p>  This city is very different from other former capitals of the Soviet republics.  It is cozy, bright, noisy and many-sided.  Over its long history (and the settlement was first mentioned in 1420), he gained his own unique face and color.  <span>Chisinau, the sights of</span> which we will consider in our article, is the <span>capital of Moldova,</span> its cultural and historical center. </p><p>  The multinational city conquered in due time Pushkin, who is in Bessarabian exile.  Here the ingenious poet created a lot of works that forever adorned world literature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chisinau sights photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845171.jpg" width="600"></div>

Chisinau, the sights of which we will soon see, is a city from which it is worth starting an acquaintance with the country. </p><p>  The highlight of the excursion program are numerous parks, museums with rare exhibits and memorial sites of the Jews.  Why Jews?  Yes, because before the beginning of the twentieth century they made up a third of the population of the city.  Their communities built a synagogue, a monument and a <span>memorial complex, an</span> old cemetery.  There are a huge number of parks in the capital - there are already 23 of them!  In some of them, streams flow, in others there are real lakes. </p><p>  What to see in Chisinau?  Many attractions are collected in museums.  The most important of these is the Museum of National Archeology and History.  It is in its walls that the artifacts discovered during the excavations of Old Orhei are stored, and you can also see weapons from the times of the Soviet Union, a diorama dedicated to the Second World War and much more.  The building has a magnificent facade, columned halls and a large dome instead of a roof.  Before the entrance you can see the famous sculptural composition ‚ÄúRomulus, Remus and the Wolf‚Äù - Moldavians consider themselves descendants of the Romans. </p><p>  The Museum of Ethnography and Nature is proud of the reconstructed skeleton of a mammoth, discovered in 1966.  The building has an unusual architecture and is divided into two parts - one contains exhibits that are related to the flora and fauna of Moldova, and the second - household items, national clothes, musical instruments and more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in chisinau sights" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845172.jpg" width="498"></div>

And therefore, it is from here that many wine tours in the famous cellars of Moldova begin. </p><h2>  The cloister of art </h2><p>  Very beautiful city of Chisinau!  Sights, photos of which can be seen in our article, are not only museums and parks.  For example, it is worth exploring, or even visiting the National Palace named after Nikolai Sulak, where world-famous stars come.  The building of unusual architecture with a huge hall for two thousand seats hosts several international festivals.  There is also an Organ Hall in the capital, where you can plunge into the world of classical music.  The National Opera and Ballet Theater attracts with a grand building, where the best performances are held. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moldova chisinau attractions" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845178.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Objects worth attention </h2><p>  Chisinau sights, the description of which can be found in our article, are known to the world.  The hallmark of the city is the <span>Arc de Triomphe.</span>  Outwardly, it strongly resembles a similar building in Rome, but is a <span>symbol of the victory of the</span> Russian Empire over the Ottoman Empire.  In Soviet times, the arch was also timed to victory over <span>Nazi Germany</span> and a <span>memorial plaque was</span> erected at the facility <span>.</span>  Year of construction - 1854. </p><p>  It is difficult to miss the City Hall in the very center of the capital.  This is an amazing example of the <span>Moorish style</span> in architecture, erected at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. </p><p>  The bronze monument to Stephen III the Great is a tribute to the ruler, who ruled the principality during its highest heyday.  It was erected by blush from remelted cannons captured during the Russo-Turkish war.  In the old days, he was transported to several places until finally returned, opposite the Arc de Triomphe. </p><p>  The main cathedral of the Moldovan capital may seem very modest.  This is a classic building with one dome and columns.  At the end of the twentieth century, the bell tower, blown up during the reign of the USSR, was restored. </p><p>  It is also worth going to the Eternity Memorial Complex, dedicated to those who died in World War II and in the conflict in Transnistria. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chisinau sights description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845187.jpg" width="529"></div>

    <h2>  Useful Information </h2><p>  Chisinau, whose sights cannot leave indifferent, is a very hospitable city.  There are hotels in it for every taste, and financial opportunities, and modern shopping and entertainment centers, and cozy shops, and old wine cellars, and restaurants in which the best chefs of the country work. </p><p>  From one end to the other you can go by bus, trolley or minibus.  There is a railway, bus and air station in the city, so the tourist will have no problems with transport connections. </p><h2>  Epilogue </h2><p>  What the modern name of the capital means is not known for certain.  There are versions that it translates as ‚Äúhut‚Äù, ‚Äúsmall settlement‚Äù, ‚Äúburial place‚Äù, ‚Äúlittle Jeno‚Äù (Hungarian tribe).  Recently, the toponym Chisinau is often mentioned.  But not the name colors the place, but the people who live in it.  And the fact that the inhabitants of this glorious city are very hospitable, you can see for yourself by recovering in Moldova right now. </p>
