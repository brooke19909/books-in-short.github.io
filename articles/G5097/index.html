Therefore, there are many different cultural sites, famous monuments and institutions.  Sights of Manchester allow guests of the village to draw up the most complete historical and cultural presentation about it.  The county town is located in Lancashire.  The modern metropolis was founded by the Celts in the 10th century.  Then the settlement was called Mancunium, and the name Manchester came from the Saka word "mancaster".  Today it is a huge city that millions of tourists come to see every year.  After all, there really is something to see here. </p><h2>  Cathedral and Collegiate Church of St. Mary, St. Denis and St. George in Manchester </h2><p>  Manchester's sights are so magnificent that some of them can be admired for many hours in a row.  One of these masterpieces is the Manchester Cathedral.  This is a shortened version of the name of the church.  Its full version is described above.  The history of the construction begins in the Middle Ages.  The building had to endure difficulties more than once, but, despite all the trials, it survived and managed to preserve its pristine beauty to our times. </p><p>  Many sights of Manchester are the property of the whole country.  Manchester Cathedral is considered to be such an object.  This is a real monument of architecture and history of the whole United Kingdom.  The church is located in the very center of the city, on Victoria Street.  In 1215, long before the temple was built, in its place was the church of them.  Virgin Mary  But, unfortunately, nothing survived from the buildings of that church.  It was rebuilt, succumbed to reconstructions and the cathedral expanded in the Victorian era. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the Second World War, the Germans dropped a bomb on the site, which destroyed it severely.  But over time, the object was repaired, and today there are excellent services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of manchester" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1500411.jpg" width="375"></div>

The Theater itself was opened only in 1976, but the building in which it is located is ancient and incredibly beautiful.  Manchester, the sights of which we are considering, at one time was one of the centers of the cotton trade.  In 1792, the first exchange was opened in the city.  It has been functioning for eight years.  In 1809, the building of the new exchange was built.  In 1849, thanks to the reconstruction, it expanded.  Then Manchester was nicknamed "Cottonpolis," since the prosperity of the cotton trade fell at that time. </p><p>  From 1867 to 1874 the construction of the third exchange was carried out.  It was one of the largest trading floors in the UK.  The bombing that took place during World War II substantially destroyed the Royal Exchange Theater.  But gradually the building was rebuilt, however, the large trading hall is now not at all big. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manchester city attractions" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1500409.jpg" width="600"></div>
