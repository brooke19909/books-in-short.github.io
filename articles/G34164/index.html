Pension Grove Pension (Pitsunda, Abkhazia)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Hot southern sun, sea, Abkhazia, relaxation, pine grove ... No, don‚Äôt think, this is not a set of words.  This is how you can characterize a vacation in one of the boarding houses, located just six kilometers from the small resort village of Pitsunda.  By the way, the health resort is called ‚ÄúPine Grove‚Äù.  A somewhat unusual name for a southern boarding house, but there are reasons for it.  Because it is located in a relict pine forest, and even on the ground of a citrus farm and on the very shore of the sea.  The boarding house is about forty kilometers from Adler, twenty-five from Gagra.  As mentioned above, Pitsunda (Abkhazia) is practically next to it.  Pension Grove boarding house does not provide medical services, its main function is health.  In other words, here you can have a great rest both with company and family.  As for those who would like to treat some chronic diseases at the same time, amazing air filled with the astringent aroma of Pitsunda pine, excellent climate and Pitsunda balneotherapy center, using Matsesta hydrogen sulfide mineral water as the main therapeutic factor, will help him. </p><p>  And, it is worth noting, the boarding house "Pine Grove" (Abkhazia) receives positive reviews from grateful tourists.  This is despite the fact that today the capricious traveler is used to scolding everyone and everything, up to the fashionable overseas resorts.  Of course, the Pine Grove boarding house (Abkhazia) is not a luxurious five-star hotel, but it will not hit the guests in the face, and it is quite within its power to present the guests with comfortable living conditions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  "Pine Grove" is rightfully considered the best guesthouse in Pitsunda.  This is also evidenced by the reviews of those who have been here.  Almost no one was dissatisfied with the rest in a boarding house.  Pleasant tourists and excellent food, and comfortable apartments, and a well-equipped beach and pool, and superbly organized pastime.  The guests of the boarding house consider the cost of accommodation and the services offered to be quite acceptable (a day of stay here costs from 1250 to 2700 rubles).  The only thing that causes some dissatisfaction is the lack of medical procedures.  However, as it was said above, the boarding house positions itself as a health-improving institution based on the use of natural healing factors.  In addition, everyone can buy in the Pitsunda balneological hospital the so-called kursovka and go through all the necessary procedures there.  Moreover, there will be no problems with trips - from the boarding house's territory five times a day there goes its own bus to the city. </p>
