  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microdistrict "Finnish Valley": description, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cheboksary is a small Volga city with a comfortable climate.  In recent years, the city has changed beyond recognition.  A grandiose construction has started here, so every local resident will easily find for himself that quarter, that residential complex that will satisfy all his taste preferences and wishes.  The Finnish Valley microdistrict is perhaps the most ambitious integrated housing project, attracting a lot of attention.  The time has come to evaluate the project from all sides and give it the most objective assessment.  First customer reviews will help you do this. </p><h2>  About microdistrict </h2><p>  The Finnish Valley microdistrict is the best that construction companies in Cheboksary can offer.  Houses erected using monolithic-panel technology are fundamentally different from those "panels" that were erected in all cities of the country 20 years ago.  Houses have changed not only visually, colossal changes have affected the quality of external panels.  Today these are three-layer sandwich panels that perfectly retain heat and provide the necessary soundproofing properties. </p><div class="photo" data-source="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=569907&amp;page=17" data-original="www.skyscrapercity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="District Finnish Valley" class="if uuid-2260175" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2260175.jpg"></div><p>  A choice of buyers are offered nine- and sixteen-story residential buildings of increased comfort. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The new residential area "Finnish Valley" is being built in one of the most environmentally friendly areas of the city, namely in the south-west, on Chernyshevsky Street.  Already in the near future its merger with the North-Western region.  Thus, residents will receive the necessary comfort and access to all necessary infrastructure facilities, without any difficulty they can get to anywhere in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  If you are counting on comfortable housing, we strongly recommend that you take a closer look at the Finnish Valley microdistrict.  The reviews of those who managed to visit the object and get to know it better focus on the improved layouts, ceiling heights (2.7 meters), panoramic windows with a stunning view.  Among the advantages of new buildings, I would like to note spacious loggias, <span>apartment heating,</span> which allows each resident to set the most comfortable temperature in his house and save a significant part of the budget for utilities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cheb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Finnish valley reviews" class="if uuid-2260177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2260177.jpg"></div><p>  The variety of modern planning solutions is another advantage of the microdistrict.  All the houses provided by the project differ in layouts.  Young families can choose small-sized, but affordable apartments, families with young children will certainly pay attention to apartments with a spacious kitchen-living room, isolated rooms, a wardrobe and a separate bathroom.  All buyers can count on one-, two- and three-room apartments ranging from 35 to 85 square meters.  Interior decoration is not provided. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  If in doubt about the comfort provided to residents, read the reviews.  The "Finnish Valley" in Cheboksary is endowed with all the necessary infrastructure.  In the near future, the construction of a kindergarten and a comprehensive school.  For the convenience of residents, the first floors of the buildings will be reserved for commercial infrastructure: there will be shops, pharmacies, beauty salons and hairdressers.  And this is only the beginning - as the complex develops and grows, the number of infrastructure objects will only increase. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="foto.cheb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews Finnish Valley of Cheboksary" class="if uuid-2260190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2260190.jpg"></div><p>  For car owners, the project provides for the construction of a multi-level parking for an impressive number of parking spaces. </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  The improvement of the territory of the Finnish Valley microdistrict is represented by modern playgrounds and sports grounds, areas for walking and recreation.  Due to the remote location of residential buildings in relation to each other, all residents can fully enjoy the much-needed space and comfort. </p><h2>  Construction stages </h2><p>  The Finnish Valley microdistrict is being built in several stages.  At the moment, 6 residential buildings, which are fully populated, have already been commissioned.  Commissioning of the 7th building is planned for the 3rd quarter of 2019.  The date of final development of the entire microdistrict is currently unknown. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cheb.ws" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Finnish valley" class="if uuid-2260197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/2260197.jpg"></div><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The Finnish Valley is one of Cheboksary‚Äôs best projects, attracting the attention of a huge number of potential residents.  Those who have already managed to buy an apartment here and even settle in their cozy nest, focus on the quality of construction, well-thought-out layouts and developed infrastructure.  The houses really turned out to be warm, strong, outwardly spectacular, the windows offer stunning and breathtaking views of the city.  At the construction stage, an apartment in a new ecologically clean area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city can be purchased on favorable terms.  That is why, if you are at the stage of choosing an apartment, be sure to visit the sales office, the object itself and see for yourself all the advantages that it is endowed with.  This will not make a mistake. </p>
