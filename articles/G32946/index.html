The mysterious Asian country was pushed aside by other giants of the tourism market: China and India.  But gradually, tired of the usual countries, travelers switch to other resorts.

If you decide to visit this country, then pay attention to the new Golden Beach Nha Trang 3 * hotel, located in a city such as Nha Trang.  It will be a great option for those who want to explore the country without spending huge sums. </p><h2>  What are the benefits of a holiday in Vietnam? </h2><p>  Tourist complexes of this country can offer travelers excellent service at affordable prices.

In addition, in Vietnam, stunning national cuisine, which is famous for its rice and noodles dishes, as well as amazing delicacies.  Here you can try, for example, fried frogs or even baked <span>crocodile meat.</span> </p><p>  Perhaps the only drawback of the country that repels Russian tourists is a long flight.

    <p>  In addition to the main restaurant, there are no more establishments in the complex.  But nearby, in Nha Trang, tourists can visit small cafes specializing in national cuisine.  A full meal here will cost quite inexpensively.  In the European Quarter there is a chic Indian restaurant, which must be visited by all connoisseurs of Asian cuisine. </p><h2>  Can I stay here with a child? </h2><p>  Golden Beach Nha Trang 3 * complex is considered a youth hotel, so there is not much entertainment for children.  One child is allowed to stay for free if he is not older than 11 years old and if he does not occupy a separate bed.  Also, hotel guests should be prepared for the fact that there is no cradle for babies.  Do not hope that the baby can be left in a mini-club or given in the care of a nanny.  In addition, there may be problems with the nutrition of the child.  The hotel has the right not to give him a free breakfast if he lives for free. </p><p>  Organization of leisure activities for children is not here, so guests will have to think about it on their own.  Therefore, if you decide to choose this hotel for a family vacation with children, then it is unlikely to be a suitable option for you.  It is better to stay in another complex that will focus on children's audiences. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  At Golden Beach Nha Trang 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang) they carefully monitor the quality of service, so the staff is committed to providing customers with all the necessary range of services.  The hotel has a developed network of infrastructure facilities that guests can use at any time.  We list the main services: </p><ul><li>  The hotel has a 24-hour reception and an administrator who is always ready to answer guests' questions. </li><li>  At the reception for guests can arrange a paid excursion to any city sights. </li><li>  The ability to exchange currencies in dollars, euros or Vietnamese dong at the most favorable rate. </li><li>  Dry cleaning works, which for an additional fee can wash clothes, quickly dry them and stroke them. </li><li>  For hotel guests, a business center provides their services. </li><li>  Souvenir shop.  For a small fee, guests can order in-room newspaper, food or drink delivery.  Also, at the request of customers, they can be awakened by a phone call from the reception. </li><li>  The hotel is equipped with a modern elevator. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Local entertainment </h2><p>  Golden Beach Nha Trang Boutique 3 * hotel does not have a large territory, so it can not offer its guests a wide selection of entertainment.  On the thirteenth floor of the building there is a small outdoor pool in which guests can swim at any time.  The hotel also provides bicycle rental, with which tourists can travel around the city.  They can have a good time on the beach, which is located within walking distance of the hotel. </p>

    <p>  The hotel does not provide any other entertainment services.  Therefore, guests themselves can go to the city to have a good rest.  In half a kilometer from Golden Beach Nha Trang 3 * there is a sailing club.  A little further you can find a restaurant-brewery, city square, a large shopping center and city museum. </p><h2>  Positive hotel reviews </h2><p>  The opinions of tourists are a good way to find out the current state of affairs at the Golden Beach Nha Trang 3 * hotel.  Most of the reviews about him are positive, but they could not have done without significant shortcomings.  Consider the advantages of the hotel, which were noted by guests staying here: </p><ul><li>  ideal location: the beach, shops, bars and restaurants are located very close; </li><li>  spacious rooms with beds equipped with orthopedic mattresses, working fixtures and new renovations; </li><li>  friendly staff who are fluent in English; </li><li>  good housekeeping, regular linen change, no insects (ants) in the rooms; </li><li>  high-quality and hearty breakfasts, regular replenishment of tea and coffee in the room. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews and criticism </h2><p>  Most of the tourists who rested here, in general, liked the rest.  They note that the quality of service corresponds to the price category of the hotel.  However, there are those who were not satisfied with the rest.  They note the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  a slow elevator that has to wait a few minutes; </li><li>  they are constantly building something near the hotel, so the rooms are quite noisy in the morning and afternoon; </li><li>  monotonous breakfasts, which are boring already for 2-3 days; </li><li>  small beds with hard mattresses and uncomfortable pillows; </li><li>  tourists are offered a view of the sea, but in fact it is absent: from a small window you can see only a small piece of the coast and the ventilation that hangs on the building; </li><li>  the minibar is not replenished, although the staff was repeatedly reminded of this; </li><li>  the hotel has only one Russian-speaking administrator who is not always present at the reception. </li></ul>
