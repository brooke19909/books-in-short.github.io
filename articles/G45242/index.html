An expert financial institution is able to increase money through a deposit and issue a loan on favorable terms.  One of the leading banks in Saransk, "Active Bank" has been serving customers since 1990, and at the moment it has practically no competitors in its field, annually occupying the highest places and becoming the winner of industry awards. </p><h2>  About financial institution </h2><p>  The organization began its banking activities in 1990 as a branch of Finist Bank, but after 2.5 years, Active Bank separated and began to work independently.  The institution is based on the principle of shares.  Initially, the shares were distributed between 14 different enterprises and commercial structures.  The bank had such a form of ownership as a limited liability partnership. </p><p>  When establishing an organization, shareholders intended to direct its assets to lending and support small and medium-sized businesses.  These are mainly construction, industrial enterprises, but there are also municipal organizations among them.  In recent years, management has also begun to pay considerable attention to working with individuals and lending programs for them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zaimite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="akb asset bank" class="if uuid-3076858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/3076858.jpg"></div><p>  After expanding the customer base and growing volumes in 1998, a decision was made to change the form of ownership.  The bank was reorganized and received the status of a joint stock company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The head office of Active Bank is located in Saransk at ul.

The client has the right to withdraw interest on the deposit after 91 days from the date of conclusion of the contract.  The amount of interest is 6.3.  A deposit on such terms is “Profitable”, but the annual rate will be 7%. </li><li>  The “Pension” deposit does not differ from the previous paragraph in anything but interest, here the rate is 6.8%.

Reviews about "Active Bank" indicate an interesting product for which an apartment can be purchased at 6% per annum.  This rate applies to those families where a second or third child will be born from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diamond.bank" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="6% rate for the birth of 2 and 3 children" class="if uuid-3069061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3069061.jpg"></div><p>  The second child is given 3 years from the date of signing the contract, the third - 5 years.  Both periods add up.  Loan amount - up to 8 million rubles.  After the grace period ends, the loan rate is set based on the key rate of the Central Bank. </p><p>  Also, within the framework of social support, Active Bank offers loans from 300 thousand to 4 million rubles, while the loan amount cannot exceed 80% of the purchase price of housing.  Duration - from 3 to 15 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.irishtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Home mortgage" class="if uuid-3069054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3069054.jpg"></div><h2>  Refinancing </h2><p>  Any person would like to be re-credited on more favorable terms.  You can refinance a loan in Active Bank at a percentage of 9.5 to 15.55.  Possible loan amount - from 300 thousand to 5 million rubles, with an amount above 500 thousand is required to provide a pledge.  You can refinance consumer loans and mortgages. </p><p>  To qualify for loan approval, you must be officially employed and avoid delinquencies over the past 12 months. </p><h2>  Car loans </h2><p>  "Active Bank" provides car loans only for new vehicles.  A person with a constant income can buy a car, provided that it is confirmed by a 2-NDFL income statement or in the form of a bank for individual entrepreneurs.  Work experience - at least 1 year. </p><p>  The loan amount is from 100 thousand to 3 million rubles.  The interest rate depends on the loan term, starts from 11%. </p><p>  The purchased car is a guarantee until the full fulfillment of obligations to the creditor. </p><h2>  Credit for VIP clients </h2><p>  Individuals who provide most of the income of a credit institution and form its resources can receive a loan on special conditions.  For example, for a client who has a large sum of deposits with Asset Bank, the organization’s management will offer an individual interest rate.  The amount of borrowed funds starts from 500 thousand rubles, the limit is set by the bank's board. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smallbizclub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="asset bank loan" class="if uuid-3075845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3075845.jpg"></div><p>  If the loan amount is more than 1 million rubles, it is necessary to provide collateral liquid property.  For the lender does not matter the age of the VIP borrower and his length of service. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Virtually every bank has deficiencies in service or products.  Reviews about the "Asset Bank" indicate this.  Clients speak of him as an institution that keeps its word.  If the mortgage specialist said that the application will be considered within 3 days, it will be so.  Among the advantages of the bank, borrowers also note the absence of hidden fees, low interest rates and a wide range of deposit programs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.morningagclips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="asset bank loan" class="if uuid-3068947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3068947.jpg"></div><p>  If we talk about the shortcomings, then this is the isolation of the institution from the network of federal banks.  Reviews about "Active Bank" are full of customer dissatisfaction due to the lack of ATMs in the rest of the Russian Federation.  Leaving the borders of Mordovia or the Ulyanovsk region, they are forced to withdraw money in advance or do it later with a commission. </p>
