Otherwise, serious problems cannot be ruled out.  For example, when paying for services or bills.  This article will talk about how to check the balance in Sberbank.  It will be about a bank plastic card.  In fact, everything is not so difficult, but you will have to have some knowledge to achieve the corresponding goal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tiboss.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://tiboss.ru/card/sberbank-vozvrat-deneg-na-kartu-za-pokupku-21226/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ways to check card balance" class="if uuid-3192557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192557.jpg"></div><h2>  Ways to solve the problem </h2><p>  How to check the balance in Sberbank?  In order to achieve their desired goal, citizens must first study all existing methods and only then choose the exact algorithm of actions. </p><p>  At the moment, you can check the balance of money in your bank account: </p><ul><li>  via SMS request; </li><li>  through online banking; </li><li>  by contacting the office of a financial organization; </li><li>  through a call center; </li><li>  by means of a USSD request; </li><li>  by working with payment terminals; </li><li>  using ATMs; </li><li>  through a special application. </li></ul><p>  In addition, a citizen can check the balance on the plastic account by buying something or replenishing the card.  These are not the most common scenarios, but they still have a place in practice. </p><h2>  Personally to the bank </h2><p>  Do you want to check the balance in Sberbank?  Then the citizen should know all of the above techniques.  They do not cause significant trouble, in any case, their bulk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Let's start with the least popular, but with the most reliable solution.  This is a personal appeal to a financial institution.  Citizens to verify the card account must: </p><ol><li>  Prepare a passport and bank plastic. </li><li>  Come to the nearest branch of Sberbank and write an application for account details. </li><li>  View the card balance in the issued certificate. </li></ol><p>  There is nothing difficult in this, but, as already mentioned, such a technique is not in demand.  Therefore, it is worth paying attention to other approaches to the task.  Fortunately, there are more than enough of them.  Each client of the bank will be able to pick up something to their liking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="s3bank.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://s3bank.ru/cards/uznat-balans-karty-sberbanka/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet banking for checking accounts" class="if uuid-3192560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192560.jpg"></div><h2>  Internet banking </h2><p>  Do you want to check the balance of Sberbank via the Internet?  Then it‚Äôs worth connecting the Sberbank Online service.  This resource helps to quickly manage bank plastic.  For example, pay bills, transfer money and check the balance of an existing account.  Very comfortably.  The service is provided free of charge. </p><p>  The instruction for the implementation of such a technique comes to the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Connect online banking. </li><li>  Open the Sberbank Online website in a browser, and then log in under your name. </li><li>  Confirm authorization on the service. </li><li>  View the page that will open after a successful login. </li></ol><p>  On the corresponding site, all bank cards associated with the selected mobile phone will be displayed.  To their right is the balance of accounts.  That's all. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Help application </h2><p>  How to check the balance of a Sberbank card via phone?  Using this device, you can solve the problem in various ways.  For example, through a specialized application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sbankami.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile bank and card balance check" class="if uuid-3192556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192556.jpg"></div><p>  We are talking about software called "Mobile Bank".  First you need to connect this option, and then install the application of the same name on your smartphone.  Immediately after that, it will be possible to actively use the functionality of the proposed software. </p><p>  In our case, it is recommended to adhere to such an algorithm of actions: </p><ol><li>  Open the application from Sberbank Mobile Bank on your mobile phone. </li><li>  Select the section "Transactions with account" in the menu that appears. </li><li>  Specify the Request Balance option. </li><li>  Confirm the operation and wait. </li></ol><p>  After the manipulations have been done, the relevant information will be displayed on the phone‚Äôs display, or it will be sent as an SMS to the number attached to the plastic.  There is nothing difficult or incomprehensible in the operation.  True, this technique is also not very popular.  There are simpler solutions to the original task. </p><h2>  USSD request </h2><p>  For example, the formation of a special digital request can be attributed to such.  This technique works, like most of the options proposed below, with mobile banking connected.  Without it, the USSD request cannot be sent for processing.  This is simply not provided by the bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rv-mo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="USSD command to request balance" class="if uuid-3192561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192561.jpg"></div><p>  How to check the balance in Sberbank?  For example, you can use the following algorithm: </p><ol><li>  Connect the Mobile Bank option from the bank in any convenient way.  If this function is already activated, you need to check whether it is locked. </li><li>  Put your smartphone or phone in dialing mode. </li><li>  Use the numeric keypad to dial the command * 900 * 01 #. </li><li>  Click on the button responsible for sending the request for processing. </li></ol><p>  Now it remains only to wait.  Depending on the model of your smartphone and the installed OS, the information will be displayed either as a separate message, or it will be sent to SMS. </p><h2>  SMS request </h2><p>  But there is more to come!  How to check the balance of Sberbank via SMS?  Is it possible to use such a right at all? </p><p>  Yes, but only to those who initially connected themselves to mobile banking.  Assume that this option is activated.  Then you will need: </p><ol><li>  Open the messaging menu on your phone. </li><li>  Write "Balance", and after a space - the last 4 digits of the plastic that I want to check.  The last digital recording can be omitted if only one card is attached to the phone. </li><li>  Send the formed request to the number 900. </li></ol><p>  What's next?  You need to wait a bit.  After processing the corresponding request (the process takes a few seconds), the client will receive a response message that will contain information about the balance of the selected plastic.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to check the balance of the Sberbank card via SMS.  This is done in a few minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rv-mo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Request via SMS" class="if uuid-3192555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192555.jpg"></div><h2>  Call Center </h2><p>  Still wondering how to check the balance of Sberbank?  As already mentioned, it is possible to solve a similar problem in different ways.  Say by calling the Sberbank call center.  This is another far from the most popular technique, but it still occurs in practice. </p><p>  Do you want to know the balance of bank plastic via phone?  Recommended: </p><ol><li>  Dial on the phone the single number necessary to receive this kind of information. </li><li>  Wait for operator response. </li><li>  Inform the call center employee about your intentions. </li><li>  Answer the questions asked by an employee of Sberbank.  Usually they help to identify a person. </li><li>  Name the card number on which the question arose. </li><li>  Listen carefully to the relevant data. </li></ol><p>  Easy and simple!  This technique does not require a mobile bank, it can be used at any time. </p><p>  Important: calls to a single number within Russia are free. </p><h2>  ATM and terminal </h2><p>  Need to check the balance of a Sberbank card through a terminal or ATM?  For these machines, one instruction applies.  It can be considered universal. </p><p>  A guide to checking the balance of plastic through such devices is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Insert the card into the receiver of the selected machine and specify the PIN to start working with the device. </li><li>  Select the section "Operations with the card" in the functional menu. </li><li>  Click on the "Check balance" section. </li><li>  Choose a method of obtaining information.  You can display the corresponding data on the screen or print a receipt. </li><li>  Confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  Then it remains to study the information that will be presented in the selected way.  You can remove a bank card from a terminal or ATM. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cards-shop.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://cards-shop.ru/article/kak-proverit-balans-na-karte-sberbanka-5-sposobov"><img itemprop="image" alt="Verification through the payment terminal" class="if uuid-3192559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192559.jpg"></div><p>  Important: the operation is free. </p><h2>  Account Status Change </h2><p>  Another interesting technique for translating the original idea into reality is changing the balance of the card.  Each time a person spends money or replenishes an account, he will receive SMS alerts with the amount of expenses or received money, as well as with the final balance. </p><p>  This feature only works when a citizen ties a bank card to a mobile phone through mobile banking. </p>
