Its main attractions are skyscrapers, slender, and sometimes quite original forms rush up.  Approximately such a landscape will surround the guests of the hotel in question.  It was built in 2005 on one of the small, stretching between the skyscrapers of Al Falea Street.  It rests on the larger al-Mamsha street, which runs public transport.  Nearby is the alluvial island of <span>Palm Jumeirah.</span>  Geographically, the place where the Habtoor Grand Beach Resort SPA is located is also an artificially created island, but it was not washed away like Palm, but was separated from the mainland, breaking through the artificial channel Dabay - Marina for the convenience of owners of yachts who chose Dubai Marina as a vacation destination.  Seven bridges connect it to the city.  This island is considered the most fashionable in the city.  Everything here is buried in luxury, and for tourists and residents a metro station, shopping centers, a promenade with many cozy restaurants, a port for yachts have been built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Getting to the hotel is easy.  A new airport, one of the largest in the Middle East, has been built in Dubai, 4.5 km from its historic center - Deira.  Airliners from Russia arrive here all year round.  The flight duration is only 5 hours.  At the airport, organized tourists are greeted by the transfer of the travel agency where the tour was purchased and delivered to the hotel.

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p> It is very important to take into account the weather conditions for everyone buying tours in the Habtoor Grand Beach Resort SPA 5 *.  The UAE is a country in the Middle East, where the climate is greatly affected by a vast desert area.  The high months here are the winter months, when the weather is about the same as in the Moscow region in summer, namely, warm even can be said, hot days, cool nights, pleasant for swimming water temperature in the bay (about +22 degrees), plus almost full calm.  From May to October in the UAE, the season is considered low, so all prices are also low.  The reason is the intense heat.  In July, the air temperature here reaches +45 degrees in the shade, there is no rain at all, but at the same time high humidity, which even healthy people can hardly tolerate.  Rest on the beach at this time is impossible, because even the sea does not save, the water temperature in which reaches +35 degrees.  At this time, Dubai is comfortable only in those rooms where air conditioning works, for example, in the ‚ÄúMall of the Emirates‚Äù, where you can even go skiing and play snowballs. </p><p>  In the high season, lasting in the UAE from the first days of October to about mid-May, a beach holiday is perfect.  Habtoor Grand Beach Resort SPA - a hotel built almost on the shore of the bay and having its own section of the beach.  According to tourists, the sand is ideally clean and very soft, pleasant for feet, but you can walk on it barefoot only in the morning.  In the afternoon, it heats up so much that you need to put beach shoes on your feet.  The disadvantage of the beach is that sunbeds and umbrellas are located about 100 meters from the water's edge.  But swimming here is very good, since the entry into the sea is smooth, there are no stones, jellyfish and algae, but the water is so salty that it plucks your eyes.  After swimming, it must be washed off. </p><p>  For the convenience of guests of the hotel on the beach there is a bar.  Drinks and snacks in it are paid.  Nearby there are other bars and several restaurants. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Habtoor Grand Beach Resort SPA is a hotel recommended for recreation for young people, older people, families with children.  His rating is an average of 8.6-8.8 points out of 10 possible.  It is especially pleasant that the hotel gives pleasant compliments in the form of a cake, a fruit basket and a bottle of champagne (except for children‚Äôs birthday) to newlyweds, birthday men and regular customers.  Most advantages of the hotel, noted in most reviews: </p><p>  - beautiful territory, large, well-groomed, always clean, very beautiful; </p><p>  - a luxury hotel, everything sparkles and shines, all around is perfect cleanliness; </p><p>  - very helpful well-trained, always smiling staff; </p><p>  - wonderful rooms, spacious, with panoramic windows, with functioning plumbing and electrical equipment; </p><p>  - new snow-white bedding; </p><p>  - A wide range of hygiene products in the bathroom; </p><p>  - great restaurants, great food; </p><p>  - a very diverse breakfast, dishes for every taste; </p><p>  - good pools, many free sunbeds; </p><p>  - A variety of services for children; </p><p>  - a wonderful beach, the water is always clean, the depth is not from the shore, which is convenient for kids. </p><p>  Deficiencies noted at the Habtoor Grand Beach Resort SPA: </p><p>  - blocking of a deposit on a bank card, the unlocking of which, even if nothing was removed from it, occurs only in Russia; </p><p>  - the rooms in the chalet are somewhat dark, raw, generally uncomfortable; </p><p>  - all drinks, including water, are too expensive; </p><p>  - the location of the hotel buildings is far from the beach (it‚Äôs about 5 minutes to go to it, which is not very convenient in the heat, especially with children); </p><p>  - sunbeds far from the water; </p><p>  - on the beach not only hotel guests can be present; </p><p>  - frequent discos in neighboring bars, which interferes with a relaxing holiday; </p><p>  - lack of animation; </p><p>  - Room cleaning can be done quite late (around 4 pm). </p><p>  However, despite the small flaws, this hotel is a great choice for those who decide to spend a vacation in the wonderful country of the UAE. </p>
