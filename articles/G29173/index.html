If the purpose of the vacation is to take a break from the hustle, relax, stay in nature and get a little acquainted with the cultural values ​​of the hero city, then it is better to choose areas a bit far from the center.  The best choice is Reed Bay.  In Sevastopol, this is one of the young and rapidly developing areas where visitors will find what they are looking for on vacation. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  A winding, bizarre-shaped bay is located east of Cossack, stretching inland for 2.5 km, the height of the coast is from 9 to 20 m. Now industrial railway lines are laid on both sides of the bay. </p><p>  The greatest width - 1 km, depth 20 m, perfectly protected from storms, the sea does not freeze.  From the city center to the reeds 13 km. </p><h2>  Title </h2><p>  The reed bay area in Sevastopol got its name during the Crimean War, which took place on the territory of the peninsula in 1854 - 1855. </p><p>  In wartime, the uninhabited, but convenient for the parking of ships, French army and navy occupied the bay, a camp was set up on the shore, which the French called Kamyesh.  In those days, there were indeed vast thickets of this coastal plant, now completely destroyed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imha.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The French in the reeds" class="if uuid-2753747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2753747.jpg"></div><p>  As you know, the French ingloriously left Sevastopol, but the name stuck and remained. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  The weather in the reed <span>bay of Sevastopol</span> is the same as in the whole city. </p><p>  It is coldest in February, when the average temperature is below +3 <span>° ,</span> the hottest month is July, with average values ​​of +22.5 <span>° .</span> </p><p>  Sevastopol is not a rainy city, and in May the least rainfall occurs. </p><p>  Water on small beaches warms up quickly, swimming comfortably in early June, when the sea water temperature is +18 ... + 20 <span>° .</span>  The reeds are open to the wind from the north, so there is a wave at sea. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Before the arrival of the French army, the area of ​​Kamyshovaya Bay was completely uninhabited, but after itself the conquerors left separate buildings and defensive redoubts.  They came in handy in 1942 during the defense of Sevastopol. </p><p>  For a long time the reed bay was not even considered a suburb of Sevastopol.  In 1902, the aeronautical park of the Black Sea Fleet was located here.  At the airport, they trained sea pilots, tested marine aircraft, and tried to adapt even military balloons to military operations. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the bay harbored the battleship “Tashkent”, which took several thousand wounded soldiers and civilians out of the city, as well as F. Roubaud’s unique panorama painting “The Defense of Sevastopol”. </p><p>  In the postwar years, a village of fishermen appeared in Kamyshovaya, united in 1929 into a fishing collective farm.  The number of inhabitants of the settlement did not exceed 12 thousand people. </p><p>  Over time, the village grew and turned into a large fishing port with ship repair yards and a cannery.  Now there is also an oil-loading enterprise, a cement plant, treatment facilities and a powerful boiler house. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="tropki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fishing port in the reeds" class="if uuid-2753739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2753739.jpg"></div><p>  By the 80s, the village turned into a full-fledged Sevastopol microdistrict, for which the previous name was fixed. </p><h2>  Where is </h2><p>  The reed bay is located in Sevastopol in the Gagarinsky district.  Coordinates </p><p>  44.584000, 33.424937. </p><p>  From all areas of the hero city you can get to the reed bay by public transport: </p><ul><li>  buses No. 8, 40 and 41, 37, 91, 103, 104, 107, 109, 183; </li><li>  route same №№ 107, 109, 10, 14, 95, 16; </li><li>  by taxi. </li></ul><p>  To get there by car, you need a map. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.585472" data-lng="33.431534000000056" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/9/5/5/7955.png"></div><h2>  Where to stay on vacation </h2><p>  In the area of ​​Kamyshovaya Bay in Sevastopol, there are many excellent hotels, modern hotels, mini-hotels, estates, renting rooms and rooms in the private sector. </p><p>  Rooms of varying degrees of comfort and price range offer tourists such establishments: </p><ul><li>  hotels "Fairytale", "Summer", "Capone", "Atlantic", "Aurelia", "Old Pier", "Yard" and others; </li><li>  Villa "Oliva"; </li><li>  boarding house "Sevastopol"; </li><li>  mini-hotels "Cameo", "Cottage by the sea"; </li><li>  beach hotel "Omega"; </li><li>  Apartments “In the House of the Greek Choir”, “Alex”, Sea; </li><li>  hostels Mayak, Like, Good Lac. </li></ul><h2>  The beaches of the reed bay (Sevastopol) </h2><p>  There are few comfortable beaches for 2018 in the area of ​​the reeds, although the sea is within walking distance from residential buildings.  What is commonly called beaches in the hero city is often perplexing among visitors, although the reed beaches are quite suitable for undemanding tourists and citizens who want to relax close to home. </p><p>  In the reed bay of Sevastopol, there are 2 relatively comfortable beaches. </p><p>  1. "Omega."  It is located in the Round Bay and is part of the reeds area.  Length 700 m. The coastline is covered with sand, the entrance to the water is shallow, sandy, there is a “paddling pool” zone for kids - this attracts parents and children to rest.  The promenade is equipped with canopies, showers, changing rooms, toilets, you can rent beach equipment.  They offer a banana, boat or catamaran ride, and a cafe. </p><p>  Omega also has disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  in the middle of summer, mud and seaweed gather near the coast, the water becomes cloudy; </li><li>  the beach is often closed during the quarantine season. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="virtual-sevastopol.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Omega Beach in the reeds" class="if uuid-2753737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2753737.jpg"></div><p>  2. The Admiral.  Length 800 m, covered with large pebbles, the entrance to the sea is dotted with stones.  There are no canopies, but you can rent a deck chair.  From the infrastructure there are only garbage containers and locker rooms.  The beach attracts with its low population even in high season. </p><p>  There are many "wild" beaches on the coast of Kamyshovaya Bay, where locals and tourists go: Wild Omega, Peschanka and others.  Strips of narrow beaches, covered with boulders and pebbles, are located along low cliffs and the sea around the edge of the bay.  They attract the clear water of the open sea, always cooler than in closed waters, the opportunity to light a fire and put up a tent. </p><p>  If you are planning to visit such a beach, you need to understand that the bottom of the water area is not surveyed, the territory is not being improved, the rescue services are not working. </p><div class="photo" data-original="doma-sevastopol.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wild beaches in the reed bay" class="if uuid-2753735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2753735.jpg"></div><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  One of the favorite activities of tourists and locals is fishing.  In the waters of the bay, you can catch such indigenous inhabitants of the Black Sea as a sea ruff, horse mackerel, sultan, flounder, mullet, various types of gobies.  Reviews of the reed bay (Sevastopol) help fishermen to choose the right bait and return home with a catch.  Undemanding tourists really like to relax in this quiet area of ​​the city.  Once here, you will not go far from the benefits of civilization, and at the same time, you can enjoy solitude and an excellent catch.  The last argument is very attractive to fans of the “silent hunt”. </p><p>  There are many restaurants in Kamyshovaya with different price ranges: </p><ul><li>  hookah bar "Vintage"; </li><li>  Pubs "Arlekino", "Brudershaft"; </li><li>  sushi bar "Senpai"; </li><li>  Mziuri, Three Hunters, Pirveli, Paletto, Yard Cafe, Salt, Akhtiar and others; </li><li>  beer house "Prague"; </li><li>  cafe "Orange". </li></ul><p>  Lovers of the sauna will find in Kamyshovaya many places where you can warm up, billiards work.  Omega Club Hotel has an indoor swimming pool. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The relatively young area of ​​the reed bay can not boast a significant number of historical and cultural monuments, which is famous for the hero city.  Of the sights there are: </p><ul><li>  Unkown soldiers grave; </li><li>  Church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker; </li><li>  the remains of the Greek estate of Euclid IV century.  BC  e .; </li><li>  Dinopark for children. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="sevastopolmedia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dinopark of the reed bay" class="if uuid-2753742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2753742.jpg"></div><p>  Rare in beauty photos of the reed bay in Sevastopol, you can do it yourself or use a quadrocopter.  The bird's-eye view of the city makes a lasting impression. </p><p>  The Fisherman House of Culture, located in the area, often hosts concerts and other interesting events. </p><p>  For shopping lovers there are shopping centers "Orange", "Omega", "Poseidon", "Omega Bay". </p>
