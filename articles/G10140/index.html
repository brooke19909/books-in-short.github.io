The bead collar instantly became a must-have of the fashion industry and quickly moved from the catwalks ‚Äúto the people‚Äù.  Its popularity is undeniable and easily explainable.  After all, having such an accessory, you can transform and revive any, even the most ordinary-looking dress or shirt.  About how to make a collar of beads and beads with your own hands, today's article. </p><h2>  What is a false collar? </h2><p>  First, let's figure out what this patch collar is and what it is for.  So, a removable collar is an addition to the image, similar to a necklace or any other decoration of the neck and decollete.  Its essence is the same - to diversify the appearance and make the onion brighter.  In addition to its beauty, such a collar creates a certain festivity and solemnity, because  resembles a shirt collar. </p><p>  In general, girls and women who are self-confident, know their own style and are ready for experimentation choose this accessory. </p><h2>  Types of Collars </h2><p>  If you have the feeling that there is not much difference between the <span>patch collars</span> and they are all about the same thing, then this is not so.  On the contrary, today the assortment and ideas of designers are so diverse that every season we can see new models again and again. </p><p>  Here is a sample list of what to choose from: </p><ul><li>  Rack.  A stand-up collar is, in fact, a shirt collar that is familiar to everyone and is closely adjacent to the neck. </li><li>  Wide collar.  This style is called the "mantle" and resembles the robes of kings and queens.  It is divided into many options.  From knitted to stone embroidered </li><li>  Acute.  The pointed corners of the collar visually stretch the neck, making it more elegant.  And the accessory itself looks strictly and presentably. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="marriedwithfashion.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="black collar" class="if uuid-2429687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2429687.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Semicircle.  Rounded corners will suit persons romantic and feminine. </li><li>  Clasps.  They can be located in front or behind.  Or the bow can serve as a fastener.  In this case, the necklace is tied with ribbons on the back of the head. </li><li>  Layers  The more layers the collar has, the more voluminous and interesting it looks. </li><li>  Fur and feathers.  The fur option looks like an element of outerwear, but it is also solemn and rich.  The feather collar is suitable for an evening in the style of the 20s or thematic performances. </li><li>  Textile.  The collar does not have to be decorated with rhinestones or something else.  Made only of fabric with a fancy print, the collar will remind you of a retro theme. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="retro collar" class="if uuid-2429726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2429726.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Embroidery.  Another of the most fashionable options for today.  Embroidery can be both on the edges of the collar, and around the entire perimeter. </li><li>  Decor  Fully embroidered collars made of beads and beads are the most popular among those who follow fashion trends. </li></ul><h2>  Pluses of detachable collar </h2><p>  As with any purchase, you should evaluate all the advantages that you will receive from this acquisition: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  A patch collar will add sophistication to any, even the most ordinary dress.  Will make it more elegant. </li><li>  Focus on the face.  Because  the collar is right next to the face, then the emphasis will be on the upper body.  This is especially true if a woman is heavy and does not want to once again focus on the lower body. </li><li>  If you choose a black and kipelno-white high collar, complement them with a plain dress, then you instantly get an official look for a business meeting or important negotiations. </li><li>  If you have several collars and at least one neutral dress, you can look different every day, changing only the accessory. </li></ol><h2>  What to wear? </h2><p>  There are no uniform and clear rules for wearing a false collar.  However, certain points should be adhered to.  The main advice is to combine the collar only with simple-cut things, preferably monophonic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="id.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gold collar" class="if uuid-2429746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2429746.jpg"></div><p>  The second tip says that when choosing a collar, consider the shape of the face and length of the neck.  For a round face, a pointed shape is suitable, for an oval or square one, on the contrary, a rounded collar shape. </p><h2>  How to make a collar with decor on your own? </h2><p>  In order to make a collar of beads and beads with your own hands, you will need the following set: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  skin or dense heavy material; </li><li>  beads and beads; </li><li>  threads matching the color of beads and fabric; </li><li>  needle; </li><li>  satin ribbon in fabric color. </li></ul><p>  Having prepared everything you need, you can begin to work: </p><p>  1. Cut 2 identical collars from leather or fabric.  Create a form yourself, depending on taste and preferences. </p><p>  2. Then sew, starting from the edge, beads in the order in which you need.  Having sewed beads from the edges, you can begin to fill the middle of the collar. </p><p>  3. After all the beads are sewn, beads fill in all the gaps that are. </p><p>  4. Turning the finished collar over, sew the second cut blank to its back.  Thus closing the seams.  Sew tape on both sides between two collars.  And sew up everything to the end. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pink collar" class="if uuid-2429715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2429715.jpg"></div><p>  5. The bead collar is ready!  Put it on with a simple black, burgundy or blue dress and see how it has changed! </p><h2>  Braided collar </h2><p>  Another relevant and exciting activity can be weaving collars with beads.  In order to make this charming accessory, you will need: </p><ul><li>  large beads; </li><li>  small beads; </li><li>  silk thread in the color of beads; </li><li>  2 metal rings and eyelet; </li><li>  2 needles; </li><li>  2 pins; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  In order to weave a collar of beads, follow the instructions in the video.  It completely laid out all the steps of the work. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="Gdc-J96LFeI" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdc-J96LFeI" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/6/7/7/2677.jpg"></div><h2>  Stylish necklace made of beads and chains </h2><p>  If your style involves some drive and rocker motifs, we advise you to pay attention to bead collars with chains and metal elements.  This style gives the image an audacity and at the same time looks trendy at almost all times. </p><p>  So, in order to make a stylish collar of beads with your own hands, prepare: </p><ul><li>  black skin or black cloth; </li><li>  beads of gold or silver color; </li><li>  metallic color beads; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  black satin ribbon; </li><li>  decorative chains. </li></ul><p>  The execution technique begins with cutting two leather collars.  For such a slightly rough decor, the pointed shape of the corners of the collar is perfect.  But focus primarily on the shape of your face, it is on the basis of it and choose a style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.farpost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="spiked collar" class="if uuid-2429699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2429699.jpg"></div><p>  Next, you need to sew the largest beads.  After them, beading around follows.  Chains can be sewn both around the edge and with sagging inside the pattern itself.  After all the decor, carefully sew the second collar and sew the black ribbon for tying.  The collar is ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="silver collar" class="if uuid-2429734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2429734.jpg"></div><p>  This collar will be a great addition to a simple white shirt or plain short dress.  Also, <span>metal beads</span> and a metallic color palette look great in combination with leather products.  For example, a leather jacket or a leather skirt. </p><p>  In conclusion, I would like to wish all women to find their own style and, following it, decorate the image with their own hands! </p>
