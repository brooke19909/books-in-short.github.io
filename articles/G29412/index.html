What he will be, it is up to him to decide.  But it is unlikely that someone will give up paradise and carefree relaxation away from civilization, the hustle and bustle of the modern metropolis.  Agree, the first thing that probably comes to mind at the mere mention of rest is the sea and the beach.  Unfortunately, it is far from always possible to get to the coast in the summer, when the season lasts in many countries.  But this is not a reason to be upset, because in the arsenal of a modern tourist and traveler there are enough directions, including for winter holidays.  One of these is Vietnam.  If you have already visited Thailand or Goa, Vietnam will definitely appeal to you.  Exotic Asian resort, stunning beaches and picturesque unspoiled nature are harmoniously combined with excellent hotels, impeccable service and cleanliness.  The season here lasts from October to May, so you can safely pack your bags and go on a trip.  It remains only to decide on the hotel.  As with other Asian resorts, choosing a hotel in Vietnam, you need to be careful and extremely attentive - most of the possible options simply do not fit their description.  But for this, reviews of real tourists are needed. </p>

    <h2>  About accommodation </h2><p>  Asian resorts are characterized by the absence of a huge adjacent territory.  Most of the hotels here are urban-type hotels, represented by a multi-story building within the city, at some distance from the coast.  It is these hotels that are most often offered as part of last-minute tours and the most advantageous offers for tourists.  But in Vietnam you can find luxury hotels, apartments and bungalows located on the coast.  This is a great opportunity to be alone with nature, to fully enjoy excellent beach vacations.  Quite an interesting and at the same time contradictory in all respects option for accommodation is the Art Boutique Hotel 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang).  Reviews about him are diametrically opposed.  Some tourists consider the hotel to be a great place to relax, while others will never stop there again.  It remains only to understand what conditions for travelers he can actually offer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  So, the Art Boutique Hotel 3 hotel (Ex. Bali, Vietnam, Nha Trang) opened relatively recently - in 2010.  To be more precise, the original name of the hotel was Bali, after rebranding its name sounded in a new way.  It is located in the developed tourist area of ‚Äã‚ÄãVienam - Nha Trang. </p>

    <p>  The hotel is located on not the busiest street, but a bit "drowned" in it, which is why even in the evening it is not so noisy - you can sleep and relax after a busy day with excursion programs.  I must admit, quite often this hotel, due to its favorable geographical position, is chosen by families with young children who are not confused by the exotic. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Surely many are interested in information about the conditions in which the Art Boutique Hotel 3 * <span>(Vietnam, Nha Trang)</span> offers them to live <span>.</span>  <span>Reviews of tourists</span> confirm that the hotel is small, only 60 rooms of various categories.  All apartments are distinguished by sophistication, unique author's design, modern and functional furniture, which creates the most comfortable conditions for relaxation.  Again, this is if you believe the reviews of many tourists. </p>

    <p>  Each room at Art Boutique Hotel 3 (Ex. Bali, Vietnam, Nyachang) has a TV with satellite channels, including Russian.  It may seem completely unnecessary to have a TV on vacation, but sometimes even away from home I do not want to miss my favorite series, programs, I want to keep abreast of the latest world news.  Moreover, all tourists get access to high-speed wireless Internet upon check-in at Art Boutique Hotel 3 (Ex. Bali, <span>Vietnam, Nha Trang).</span>  <span>Reviews</span> say that the speed is really enough to be in touch with your relatives and friends. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It's no secret that the <span>season in Vietnam is</span> quite hot, so you can‚Äôt do without climatic equipment in the room.  So the air conditioner copes with this function perfectly.  Well, of course, each room is equipped with a private bathroom with hot water, a hairdryer and cosmetics necessary for receiving hygiene procedures.  In fact, many tourists note serious problems with the supply of hot water: you have to wait hours for it to reach the rooms located on the upper floors. </p>

    <p>  In order to make sure the comfort and quality of the arrangement of rooms, just hear at least one review of Art Boutique Hotel (Nha Trang).  A significant drawback is the lack of a safe in the room.  Vietnam has a rather high crime rate, so you should not leave valuables, money and documents unattended - it is better to move them to the safe at the reception for an additional fee. </p><h2>  Room service </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to the cleanliness of the rooms and their maintenance.  You can hear a lot of negative reviews from tourists who recall with horror their holidays here.  And all because of unsanitary conditions and dirt in the rooms.  In some rooms, even seemingly clean linens are strewn with old and stubborn stains.  This also applies to towels in the bathroom.  All tourists must be careful during the inspection of the room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, some guests describe the hotel Art Boutique Hotel (Ex. Bali) 2 * (Nha Trang, Vietnam) as chic with a stunning setting, cleanliness in rooms and daily cleaning.  In this situation, it is quite difficult to give an unambiguous answer to the question about the condition of the rooms and the maintenance of cleanliness in them.  All that potential tourists need to do is prepare themselves in advance for the worst outcome and not be demanding of a budget hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  All guests, except for rooms, reception and breakfast restaurant, are offered a spacious lounge.  It is often used for conferences, seminars, thematic rooms.  Touching upon the theme of entertainment available on the territory of the Art Boutique Hotel 3 * (Ex. Bali, Vietnam. Nyachang), I would like to note the presence of a spacious gym that will surely satisfy the requirements and expectations of all those who do not even want to run their physical form even on vacation and in principle, he does not think a single day without sports.  All vacationers can visit the sauna and even afford a luxurious Vietnamese massage - an excellent chance to relax and even solve some problems, first of all, get rid of pain in the cervical spine and back. </p>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  Of course, all vacationers have every right to count on the first-class service of the Boutique Hotel 3 * hotel (Vietnam, Nha Trang).  The reviews again confirm the possibility of completely free use of wireless Internet throughout the hotel, as well as information desk.  The kind and friendly staff is ready to answer all your questions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  For an additional fee, you can order a transfer to the airport, as well as purchase tickets for the next flight from the Art Boutique Hotel 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang).  The reviews of real tourists are confirmation that the hotel staff is really attentive to everyone. </p><p>  There is a currency exchange office on site, moreover, you can rent a bicycle, sports equipment that will diversify your vacation in Vietnam. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Breakfast can be enjoyed in the hotel's excellent restaurant.  Breakfast is not varied, but for Vietnam it‚Äôs pretty good: rice, noodles, eggs, sausages, cold cuts of meat and cheese, toasts with jam, tea, coffee and juices, fresh fruits and vegetables.  It is better to arrive early for breakfast, as the most hungry tourists usually sweep away everything from the table, leaving nothing to the rest.  The table is replenished, but fruits and vegetables may simply not be enough.  If you do not have time for breakfast, you can always eat in the nearest cafe - there are a lot of them.  In them you can enjoy traditional Asian dishes or eat something more familiar, for example, European cuisine. </p>

    <h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  An excellent beach is within walking distance, just 100 meters from the Art Boutique Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang).  Reviews emphasize how picturesque the coast is.  The beach is clean, it is cleaned daily by local residents, the sea is warm with a gentle entry into the water.  The beach has everything you need for relaxation: sunbeds and umbrellas, a bar, rental of sports equipment, all kinds of water activities - you will definitely not be bored here.  A lot of people gather here in the season, if you want a more relaxing and secluded holiday, rent a motorbike and ride along the coast - the places here are chic. </p><p>  I would like to pay special attention to the sea - it is gorgeous here.  Crystal clear transparent sea water, a rich underwater world - all this creates the conditions for diving.  It is here, in Vietnam, that many tourists make their first dive under water. </p>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  For most modern tourists, the main indicator in choosing a resort destination and hotel in particular is the cost of living in it.  Of course, it is important and simply interesting for any tourist to know what the Art Boutique Hotel (Ex. Bali) 3 * hotel can offer us.  Prices here start at 2,000 rubles per night in a double room.  Quite affordable price for the set of services offered in the apartment.  If you want to save even more, it makes sense to buy a tour before the start of the season or at the end of it - usually at this time tour operators offer favorable prices and huge discounts. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Of course, on the Internet there is not as much as we would like information about the Art Boutique Hotel 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang).  The reviews are very controversial.  I want to say that it is stupid to wait for something truly gorgeous from an Asian hotel.  If you plan to spend a minimum of your time here, exclusively take water procedures, relax and have breakfast, the hotel will suit you well.  And do not try to find flaws - enjoy the sea, the beach, stunning sunsets and untouched virgin nature.  After all, it was precisely for this that you overcame the many-hour flight and, in principle, acquired a ticket to Vietnam.  Enjoy your stay! </p>
