    <p>  Varna is located farther from Sunny Beach than Burgas, so the fare is higher, and you need to spend more time on the road.  But in general, there are no travel problems.  The local transport network is very well developed. </p><h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  Sunny Beach stretches along the Black Sea coast.  The city was originally built as a resort, so most of its territory is occupied by restaurants, hotels, cafes, shops and other tourist infrastructure facilities.  In the center are the best and most expensive complexes. </p><p>  All the beaches of the city are municipal and completely free, but you have to pay for using umbrellas and deck chairs on them.  Many vacationers simply prefer to purchase a <span>beach umbrella</span> once to avoid further expenses.  The entire coast has a sand cover and a convenient gentle entrance to the sea.  In season, the local beaches are quite crowded.  Along the coast there are a large number of restaurants, cafes, rental equipment for water sports. </p><p>  For diving enthusiasts who wish to dive, local guides offer to visit Varna and Sozopol.  However, the most interesting object - Nessebar - is located just five kilometers from the resort.  There, under water is part of the ancient city.  Thousands of tourists come together every year to see such a sight.  If you are far from diving, you can go on a boat trip on a boat with a transparent bottom.  In calm calm weather, even through the water column, you can see the remains of an ancient civilization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dit majestic beach resort 4 description" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1606198.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is worth noting that the DIT Majestic Beach Resort 4 * complex, the description of which we provided in the article, has a great location.  Not every hotel can boast such a close proximity to the beach.  The resort center with all the shops, boardwalks and interesting places are also in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. </p><p>  The hotel has a fairly large territory, it is not huge, but not small.  It has two large pools, numerous playgrounds.  The territory is very well maintained and clean, it is clear that the staff is following the order. </p><p>  Apartments in DIT Majestic Beach Resort 4 * deserve special attention.  Freshly renovated rooms with excellent furniture are equipped with everything necessary.  All equipment is working properly.

If desired, hotel guests can not only drink tea or coffee, but also prepare their own lunch or dinner.  To do this, the rooms have all the conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dit majestic beach resort 4 rooms" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1606503.jpg"></div>

According to tourists, the administration quickly responds to complaints about any malfunctions in the apartment.  All deficiencies are eliminated very quickly. </p><p>  All rooms have balconies with plastic furniture.  The hotel building is of quality construction.  The apartments have absolutely no terrible audibility, which is often present in many hotels. </p><p>  All evening animation programs end until 23.00, this is very convenient, because loud music does not prevent tourists from relaxing.  Well, and whoever wishes, can continue to have fun in the nearest night clubs. </p><p>  The hotel has wonderful staff.  The maids are very discreet, they can not be seen at all.  Cleaning is done daily in your absence.  Bed linen is changed without any reminder once every three days, but towels - daily.

The description of the hotel would be incomplete if not to mention the quality of food offered in the restaurant.  As we already mentioned, half board is offered to guests.  According to vacationers, food is organized at a high level.  The restaurant is served by a nice friendly staff.  Dishes are served quickly, no hiccups occur.  A large number of ripe seasonal fruits are always present on the tables; their selection is simply huge. </p><p>  Children can be fed from the common table, a good selection of delicious dishes gives such an opportunity.

    <p>  In general, the food is high-quality and good.  At lunch time, you can eat at a hotel restaurant for a fee, so as not to look for a suitable cafe, but you can visit one of the nearest restaurants. </p><p>  The hotel rooms have equipped kitchenettes, so guests have the opportunity to cook sometimes if they wish. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  I want to say a few words about the level of service at DIT Majestic Beach Resort 4 *.  Reviews of tourists regarding the hotel staff are only positive.  Upon arrival, vacationers are expected by attentive receptionists who are always ready to help in solving any problem.  Household problems in the rooms are fixed quickly, without any extra reminders.  Well, cleaning the apartments deserves all praise.  Maids work quietly and quietly, but at the same time the apartments are always clean and linen is replaced. </p><p>  The hotel has a spa center, everyone can use its services.  For example, visit a massage session (an hour massage costs 50 leva).  The gym of the complex is very small.  For adults, daytime animation is carried out - water aerobics, yoga, dancing, water polo.  And in the evenings, an entertainment program awaits everyone. </p><p>  There is a mini club for children at the hotel, animators entertain children with contests and games, there are also several playgrounds with swings and slides.  In the evening, children can have fun at the mini disco. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dit majestic beach resort 4 food" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1606510.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has two swimming pools for adults and two for children (one for the smallest and a second pond for the older age).  The relaxation area is equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas.  In the evenings, the pools are cleaned with special devices, so from the early morning they are ready to visit vacationers. </p><p>  The proximity of the municipal beach is a huge plus of the complex.  Leaving the building, it is necessary to pass the recreation area near the pool, and you are already on the coast.  Of course, the hotel, like any other European complex, does not have its own territory on the coast.  All local beaches belong to the municipality.  But at the same time they are very clean, guarded, well equipped and cleaned daily. </p><p>  Vacationers can rent sunbeds and umbrellas for rent on the beach, which is located opposite the hotel.  There is a discount for hotel guests, so the rental price is five leva.  It is worth noting that the acquisition of a beach umbrella will solve the problem of unnecessary daily expenses.  No one forbids vacationers to sit on beach towels in the sand.  Therefore, taking sun loungers is not necessary. </p><p>  The local coast is covered with fine beautiful sand.  Rangers clean the entire area daily.  But, unfortunately, European tourists themselves litter in the course, polluting everything with cigarette butts and garbage. </p><p>  The entire coast of Sunny Beach has a gentle entry into the sea.  This place is ideal for families with children.  The sea is always warm, sometimes algae come to the shore, but there are not so many of them, so they do not interfere much. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dit majestic beach resort 4 sunny beach" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1606527.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a travel agency that can help you choose suitable excursions.  Although the resort has good transport links with nearby cities, it allows you to visit the most interesting sights on your own.  Not everyone likes group trips, so experienced tourists prefer to travel independently, getting a lot of positive impressions. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel DIT Majestic Beach Resort (Sunny Beach), reviews of which are given in the article, can be recommended for a good comfortable stay on the Bulgarian coast.  Positive enthusiastic reviews about the complex are his best recommendations.  Good location, high level of service and well-equipped rooms will make your stay truly good and unforgettable. </p>
