  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Exchange Game For Beginners. Step-by-step instruction</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, a lot of people are interested in how to start <span>making money on the</span> Forex <span>exchange</span> .  Indeed, this occupation is sometimes very profitable and interesting.  I decided to write a little guide on how a beginner can start trading on the Forex exchange.  So… </p><h2>  Exchange game for beginners </h2><p>  The first thing we have to do is register on the broker's website.  <strong>A broker</strong> is an organization that acts as an intermediary between a <strong>trader</strong> (who trades) and the <span>foreign exchange market.</span>  A trader gives orders to his broker, who, in turn, makes transactions on the exchange on behalf of the trader. </p><p>  So, register on <noindex>  <span>broker website</span> </noindex>  .  This operation is quite simple and does not have to be difficult. </p><p>  Now we need <strong>to open a forex account</strong> through a <span>broker.</span>  <span>The account</span> can be real, or it can be a demo account.  There is only one difference between them - you transfer real money to a real account, which you trade in the future.  And on the demo account, the money is virtual.  You can charge yourself at least a million dollars, and then trade it in real conditions.  You just can’t take what you earned - the money is not real. </p><p>  About how a novice trader to open a live account on the broker's website, read the link at the bottom of this article. </p><p>  Now we need to install a special program on our computer that will allow us to connect to the exchange and give orders to our broker.  Such a program is called a <strong>trading terminal</strong> .  The most popular trading terminal is Metatrader 4 (Metetrader-4).  It can be downloaded for free. <noindex>  <span>here</span> </noindex>  . </p><p>  Download the program and install on your computer.  Enter the logins and password from your trading account (which we opened at the very beginning).  All!  Now you can make full-fledged transactions in the Forex market, and, therefore, make money. </p><p>  I especially want to note that, despite the external simplicity, playing the stock exchange for beginners can be quite a difficult task. </p><p>  The fact is that making deals on their own is not difficult.  You can close at least 1000 trades per day, spending only a few seconds of your time on each.  But this is not the point, but the fact that it is difficult to make <strong>profitable transactions</strong> .  Beginners often have difficulty in doing this.  And all just because novice traders neglect training. </p><p>  To become a good doctor, lawyer or engineer, you need to spend years on training.  And everyone knows that.  But for some reason, when it comes to trading, most people think that they will come to the exchange and start earning millions of dollars every month.  They even manage to make 5-6 profitable trades in a row.  But after that, failure and defeat certainly follow. </p><p>  The only reason that up to 90% of traders make losing trades is the <strong>lack of necessary knowledge.</strong>  This knowledge is not secret, no!  They are published everywhere, they are written about in books, in magazines and on websites.  They can be obtained even for free at 2-week courses of traders. </p><p>  And with all this, almost all beginner traders are first burned, and only then go to study.  So it was with me, it was so with all my familiar traders.  But this does not mean that this should happen to you.  Take training in advance, from the very beginning to approach the game professionally and earn good money on the exchange.  Successful bidding to you! </p></div></article>
