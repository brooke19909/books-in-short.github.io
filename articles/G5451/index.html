One of these places since Soviet times is Gelendzhik.  This small town in the Krasnodar Territory can rightfully be considered a real resort of the <span>Black Sea coast of the</span> Caucasus in the full sense of the word.  It is conveniently located on the coast of the bay of the same name between two picturesque capes.  This geographical location largely determines the climate and makes Gelendzhik one of the most popular resorts on the Black Sea coast.  The city is surrounded by majestic and picturesque ridges of the <span>Caucasus Mountains.</span> </p><h2>  How to get, how to get there? </h2><p>  Every year, tourists going to rest in Gelendzhik, face a choice: "What <span>type of transport to</span> use?"  There are several options.  Can: </p><ul><li>  use a personal car; </li><li>  to travel by plane, especially since the airport has already been fully operational since 2010; </li><li>  get by bus, but in this case it will be necessary to make a transfer in large regional cities; </li><li>  choose railway transport for yourself, but then you need to clearly know <span>how to get to Gelendzhik</span> by train. </li></ul><p>  The city is located near the regional center of Novorossiysk, through which large transport routes pass.  From here to Gelendzhik no more than 50 kilometers.  It is easy to overcome this way with a taxi, regular bus, trolley bus or minibus.  Stops are located near the station, and everyone can choose the type of transport. </p>

You can go to Krasnodar, if there is no direct transport to Novorossiysk.  But this is not the best option.  The capital of the region is much further and the way to Gelendzhik (170 kilometers) will take about 4 hours by bus.  You can choose for yourself another way of how to get to Gelendzhik by train.  First you need to somehow get into Anapa, and then travel more than 100 kilometers by taxi or bus.  This is also not an easy task.  You can, of course, before you get to Gelendzhik by train, first come to Sochi.  But the road from this resort center to a small coastal town is capable of decreasing the money supply of a vacationer.

It is from here that you can get to your desired vacation spot in the shortest possible time. </li></ol><p>  Then you need to determine the order and sequence of movement: </p><ol><li>  Arriving in Novorossiysk, you need to get to the bus station from the train station.

From many large settlements of the CIS countries you can get to the railway stations of the main centers of the Krasnodar Territory.  For example, from Minsk there is a direct train No. 302 to Adler.  It passes through the territory of three states: Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.  The path to the resort town itself will take considerable time, but there will be no need to make transfers, and immediately go from Adler directly to Gelendzhik.  Russian cities in this case are much easier.  In almost any of them, a composition is being formed with a direct appointment to Novorossiysk.  Trains, the starting point of which are the cities: Moscow, Tambov, Arkhangelsk, Rostov, Perm, St. Petersburg and many others, can without any problems deliver with maximum comfort to the destination of citizens who decided to spend their vacation in Gelendzhik.  Train tickets can be ordered in advance, and a small bus "walk" to the final resting place will not overshadow the path.
