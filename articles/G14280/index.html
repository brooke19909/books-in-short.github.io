    <h2>  Bank Information </h2><p>  "Let's go to!"  - This is a commercial institution with a large branch network in Moscow and the regions.  It is part of the financial group Life, therefore it is directly subordinate to the head of Probusinessbank.  If we talk about the history of the bank’s origin, it’s worth pointing out that the organization was established in Novosibirsk in 1993.  Moreover, its current name is somewhat different from the original.  Previously, the financial institution was called "Hals-Bank." </p><p>  A few years later, the bank changed owners, who happily renamed the organization.  And it began to be called the "Investment City Bank", or, in abbreviated form, "IGB".  At that time, take a loan from the bank “Let's go!”  Could only business representatives and business owners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Everything changed at the beginning of 2006, when the management of a <span>credit organization</span> suddenly realized that it was losing potential customers from the retail segment.  At the same time, the bank increased the number of its financial products, which were developed taking into account the characteristics of both corporate and retail customers, as well as individuals. </p><p>  In early 2009, the wind of change blew again towards the bank.  This time, the credit institution was purchased by representatives of Probusinessbank and the founders of the National Savings Bank.  It was thanks to the change of ownership that the financial organization became part of the Life group and moved its central office to the capital of the Russian Federation.  And exactly one year later, the credit company received the name we already know - the bank “Let's go!”.  After a series of rebrandings and other marketing changes, the credit institution received a brand that is quite popular today - the Bureau of financial decisions “Let's go!” </p>

    <h2>  Under what conditions can I get a loan? </h2><p>  Bank “Let's go!”  offers three loan products that are designed for both new and regular customers of the organization.  For example, if you are applying to this bank for the first time, then you will most likely be offered a mini-lending program.  This means that, depending on the level of your annual income, the loan amount will not exceed 30,000 rubles.  The minimum loan amount will be equal to 1,000 rubles.  The terms of the loan will range from 30 days to a year. </p><p>  The second version of the loan program has a funny name - “Steps”.  As part of this product, you can take a loan in the amount of 30 000 and up to 250 000 rubles.  The loan term in this case will be proportionally increased to 72 months.  The main highlight of “Stepenek” is the presence of a falling rate, which directly depends on the terms of lending and the amount of the loan.  This means that if you decide to apply for a loan in the range of 30,000 - 99,999, 99 rubles, then your rate will be 65%.  If the loan amount is equal to 100,000 - 250,000 rubles, then the rate will be reduced to 52%. </p><p>  If you have already managed to establish yourself as a positive client (by the way, the program also allows you to lend to pensioners), then you will find a third product - “For repeat customers”, with special lending conditions.  In this program, let's go!  will depend on the "purity of the credit history" of the borrower, on the timing and amount of lending.  In this case, customers of the organization, applying again, can get a loan in the range of 30 000 - 250 000 rubles for up to 72 months.  Moreover, if the loan amount is up to 99,999, 99 rubles, then the rate will be - 63%.  If more - 50%. </p>

    <h2>  Who can take loans from the bank "Let's go!" </h2><p>  Potential <span>customers of the bank</span> can be citizens of the Russian Federation with registration for at least six months, from the age of 22 to 70 years.  Borrowers can also be persons whose total <span>length of service</span> is at least one year, and length of service at their current place of employment is at least three months. </p><h2>  How to apply for a loan </h2><p>  Get a loan at the bank "Let's go!"  if there are three documents: a passport, a second <span>identity document</span> and an application.  You can apply for a quick and short-term loan online.  The term of consideration of your appeal will take only three business days. </p><h2>  Let's Go! Bank: reviews </h2><p>  So, suppose you decide to contact this particular credit institution.  But first you need to carefully study the real customer reviews of the organization.  For example, some users claim that they previously applied to various banks, but in this they liked both the service and the speed of decision-making. </p><p>  Others argue that the bank has its pros and cons.  So, according to them, an excessively high percentage is not happy when handling.  And vice versa, the opportunity to take a loan without prolonged paperwork is encouraging. </p><p>  Still others say that when granting a loan they illegally imposed insurance.  Because of this, the estimated amount of 25,000 rubles increased by exactly 5,000 rubles.  Fourth were not satisfied with the employees of the organization, who, according to them, behaved incorrectly towards them. </p><p>  Fifth, on the contrary, like the speed of operators and cashiers, as well as the quick response of call center employees. </p><p>  In a word, before contacting the bank, look at the reviews, study loan programs and act as you see fit. </p>
