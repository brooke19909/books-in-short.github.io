Kazan became its capital, and the first ruler was Ulug-Muhammed.  The territory of the khanate extended from the Sura River to <span>the Belaya River</span> and from the Upper Prikamye to Samara Luka. </p><p>  The Kazan Khanate consisted of four main Darug districts: Alatsky, Arsky, Galitsky and Zureysky.  Uluses stood out from the Darugs, each of which included several settlements.  On the territory of the Khanate lived Turkic-speaking and Finno-Ugric peoples.  The population called themselves cauldrons.  Their religion was Islam. </p><p>  According to tradition, the clergy were also considered the most respected estates.  The most important persons of them were part of the only authority - the Sofa.  The military estates included the oglans and Cossacks.  The oglans were commanders of the horse troops, and the Cossacks were ordinary soldiers. </p><p>  Unprivileged estates included merchants, peasants, artisans, and civilian workers.  They had to pay certain <span>types of taxes:</span> yasak (10% of income), clan (dues), kulush, salig, bach, kultika, sala-harajah (village tax), haraj harajat (trade tax), susun (food tax), tyutynsyany (tax on each pipe), gulufe (forage), wait. </p><p>  Also on the lands of the Kazan Khanate, serfdom and slavery flourished.  <span>The serfs</span> (kishi) worked for the landowners.  Prisoners of war slaves did similar work.  After 6 years, such a slave received freedom, but still had no right to leave the country. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The post of head of state was called "khan-genghizid."  His advisers, emirs, were also commanders of the troops.  Often, khan-chingizid only formally ruled the country, but in reality he was completely dependent on the Divan.  Positions in the Sofa were inherited and were lifelong.  In exceptional circumstances, a kurultai was convened, which was attended by representatives of just three of the most important sections of the population: troops, clergy and farmers. </p><p>  Residents of the Kazakh Khanate grew rye, barley, spelled and oats.  Hunting, flight-keeping, fishing, beekeeping, and leatherworking were also developed. </p><p>  No less important was trade.  The external was more developed than the internal, for example, the Kazan Khanate had trade relations with Russia, Persia and Turkestan.  A special place in the state economy was occupied by the slave trade.  Numerous prisoners of war usually became slaves. </p><p>  Islam dominated the Kazan Khanate.  The clergy were led by the Seid, who was a direct <span>descendant of the Prophet Muhammad.</span>  Sheikhs, imams, mullahs, Danishmends, dervishes, hajis and hafizas were also considered persons of a spiritual rank.  In addition to Islam, Sufism that came from Turkestan was widespread in the khanate. </p><p>  The main and most numerous <span>form of troops of the</span> Kazan Khanate was the numerous cavalry.  Infantry and artillery were also present, but were small and rather insignificant in comparison with the cavalry. </p><p>  Since the army of the Kazan Khanate was not large enough for an offensive war, Kazan conducted tactics of a defensive war, periodically raiding the areas in the possession of the Russian princes. </p><p>  In 1467, Russian troops organized a campaign against the Kazan Khanate with the goal of seating on the throne a man loyal to the <span>Moscow principality.</span>  After that, in the 80s of the 15th century, the Russian government regularly intervened in the struggle for the throne of the Khanate.  The result of this confrontation was the seizure of the Kazan Khanate in 1487 by Moscow forces and the occupation of the Kazan throne by Moscow obedient Khan Mohammed-Emin.  In 1552, the army of Ivan IV stormed Kazan, which resulted in the annexation of the Kazan Khanate to the Moscow Principality.  After this event, the Kazan Khanate as a separate state ceased to exist. </p>
