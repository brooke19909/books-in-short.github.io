Of course, there are many good hotels of various categories in this city. </p><h2>  How to choose a hotel in Essentuki </h2><p>  Many wells with healing mineral water in this resort are located closer to the city center.  Therefore, most tourists who come here prefer to rent housing here.  If desired, in Essentuki you can choose a cheap hotel that simply provides guests of the resort with rooms, or a hotel complex on the territory of which vacationers can undergo various kinds of physiotherapeutic procedures. </p><h2>  Are there 5 * <span>hotels</span> in <span>Essentuki</span> ? </h2><p>  Basically, this resort rents rooms in two-, three- and four-star hotels.  But there is one more comfortable 5 * complex in this city popular with tourists.  This hotel is called Pontos Plaza.  The advantages of this hotel tourists include in the first place: </p><ul><li><p>  a very beautiful, well-landscaped area; </p></li><li><p>  a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãrooms; </p></li><li><p>  the presence of a free minibar in the rooms; </p></li><li><p>  Delicious breakfasts and dinners in the restaurant. </p></li></ul><p>  At the moment, this complex is considered the most convenient and comfortable in Essentuki.
