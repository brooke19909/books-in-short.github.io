It is simply impossible to come to this delightful old city and not to walk its wonderful streets.  You fall in love with Prague from the very first glance.  Ancient monuments of architecture and completely new modern buildings are incredibly combined here.  The city forever leaves warm memories in the hearts of its guests, memorized by orange tiled roofs, the charm of towers and an old pavement of large cobblestones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Perhaps one of the symbols of the city is <span>Charles Bridge,</span> which is known even to those people who have never been to Prague.  This is an amazing piece of medieval architecture.  The first stone was laid in the foundation of the bridge by Charles the Fourth in 1357.  But the construction got its present name only in 1870.  This is not the first place through the stormy Vltava, the previous ones were demolished by floods during the flood.  Currently, Charles Bridge is the most favorite place for guests of Prague.  Every tourist wants to walk along it and admire the medieval sculptures and turrets.  There is even a belief that says that one should make a cherished desire and touch the statue of St. John of Nepomuk, and it will certainly come true.  True or not, it can only be verified by personal experience. </p>

    <p>  Another attraction of the city and at the same time a symbol of the country is Prague Castle.  It is the largest castle in the country.  And he was founded the first representative of the Przemyslovich family, the prince of all Czechs, the famous Borzhivoy in the ninth century.  The castle is located on a hilltop on the left coast of the Vltava.  Several temples and palaces of different eras have survived on its territory.  Here, for example, is the well-known St. Vitus Cathedral.  Now Prague Castle is the residence of the President of the Czechoslovak Republic.  At the front gate is always a guard of honor of the serious Guardians of the City.  It is near them that city guests like to be photographed. </p><p>  <span>St. Vitus Cathedral</span> is the pearl of the city.  For many Czechs this is a holy place.  The majestic spiers of the cathedral go up, the Gothic facades are decorated with lace stone carvings.  Since 1836, all Czech kings have been crowned here.  At the same place in the ninth century stood the rotunda of St. Vitus, later the Romanesque basilica, and currently there is a cathedral.  The chapel houses the remains of the protector and ruler of the Czech Republic, and jewels for coronation are stored at the top. </p><h2>  Nearby Attractions </h2><p>  Hotel Louis Leger 4 *, as we have already mentioned, is located near <span>Old Town Square,</span> which is considered to be the heart of the Old Town.  It is here that a monument to the hero of the Czech Republic, Jan Hus, is erected.  The square is surrounded by historic buildings.  The most famous of them are: <span>Tyn Church,</span> St. Nicholas Cathedral, Kinsky Palace. </p>

    <p>  Among tourists, the Town Hall with an astronomical clock is especially popular.  Every hour, crowds of vacationers gather under it with movie cameras and cameras.  With the battle of the old chimes, the performance begins, during which the twelve apostles pass in front of the audience, Voluptuousness, Greed, Panache and Death alternately peek out from the opening windows.  There are always a lot of people in the Old Town Square.  Musicians play here, carriages are waiting for gentlemen, artists are performing, and tourists at this time are chilling in numerous cafes.  Festivities, fairs and holidays are also taking place on the square. </p><p>  Wenceslas Square, which is more like a wide boulevard, is no less interesting for guests of the city.  This is the heart of Prague.  Once there was a horse market.  And now it is a very beautiful place.  Restaurants and shops work in the square, people rush about their business, and life does not stop raging here even at night.  There is also a monument to St. Wenceslas, near which people from Prague make appointments and just meetings, and tourists gather for excursions. </p><h2>  Modern attractions </h2><p>  It is very interesting to see the Dancing House.  This is one of the new attractions (1996), which is unique in its architecture and design.  The house consists of two cylindrical towers: curved and straight.  They symbolize the famous Broadway duo of Fred Astaire and Ginger Roberts.  At one time, the construction of this facility caused numerous disputes between citizens, critics and architects.  Nevertheless, now it is one of the most famous places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="louis leger 4 praha" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1478307.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A unique view opens from the observation deck of the <span>Petrin Tower.</span>  It is very similar to the Eiffel, but significantly higher than it, because it is located on a hill. </p><p>  The pearl and pride of Prague is the National Theater.  This stunningly beautiful building with a blue dome, crowned with a golden crown, is located on the Vltava embankment.  In general, theater is something special for Czechs.  He is a symbol of rebirth.  It was built on donations from the people.  Initially, it was planned to stage only Czech works in it, but now world performances also appear in the repertoire. </p><h2>  Louis Leger 4 * (Prague): reviews </h2><p>  The hotel, according to tourists, is pleasant in every way.  It is located in an old building, however this creates a special romantic atmosphere.  The design of the hotel rooms is designed in the same style.  The main advantage of the hotel is its location.  It is convenient for guests of Prague because of the fairly good transport interchange, allowing you to get in the right direction.  This is a very important point, since almost all guests seek to see as much as possible in this beautiful city. </p>

    <p>  All apartments of the hotel are spacious and made in the Italian style.  Tourists note that the furniture and furnishings are not new.  This is pretty noticeable.  For example, there are scuffs on the furniture.  However, in general, this does not affect the rest.  The rooms have central heating and the hotel is open all year.  Especially a lot of people come here during the Catholic Christmas period, and therefore the issue of heating is very relevant.  Guests note that the apartment is warm and comfortable.  But there are no air conditioners in them.  Each room has a ceiling fan.  The rooms have a safe (it is quite expensive), a minibar (paid), TV. </p><p>  The maids clean the rooms daily, clean the towels according to the internal schedule (it can be found in the bathroom, it is glued to the wall), but sometimes there are problems with this. </p><h2>  Service Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel staff deserves special attention.  Absolutely all vacationers praise its employees.  Employees are always friendly and try to help in solving problems.  Girls at the reception settle very quickly, no matter what time of day you arrive.  Almost no one knows the Russian language at the hotel, but you can somehow explain, even if you do not know English.  It is very pleasant that you can always change the number without problems and surcharges if it does not suit you for some objective reasons. </p><h2>  Food: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists can eat in the hotel restaurant.  A local chef prepares delicious and varied dishes.  The buffet in the morning is filled with several types of salads, yoghurts, boiled eggs and omelettes, cereals, numerous sausages, cheeses, meat, pastries and desserts.  According to tourists, the European breakfasts in Louis Leger 4 * are very hearty and nutritious.  No less tasty food can be ordered for dinner and lunch.  But, as a rule, active guests simply do not have time for them if they walk around local attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Prague Louis Leger 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1478306.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And is it worth it to rush if there are so many historical beautiful places around.  In Prague there are a lot of various cafes and bars on calm and crowded streets.  You can always have a tasty and relatively inexpensive meal in them.  The local cuisine is simply amazing, it is impossible to break away from such wonderful dishes.  Near the hotel there are also budgetary establishments, always open for tourists. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, I would like to note that the Louis Leger 4 * hotel is a good place for those who decide to stay in Prague.  All the advantages of this ancient place more than cover the minor flaws that are here.  In general, the hotel and its staff make a very good impression, which causes a desire to return here again. </p>
