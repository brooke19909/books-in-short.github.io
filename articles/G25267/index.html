    <h2>  From the history </h2><p>  Until the XVI century, the tribes of the Indians Kaalus lived here.  In 1521, the place was visited by the first person from Europe.  The island was given a name meaning "covered with bones," which was associated with Indian battles.  The modern name appeared due to an error.  Spanish words have been replaced over time by similar-sounding English ones.  And now the name of the city of Key West can literally be translated as the "western key."  Over time, the island began to be inhabited by new residents arriving from other territories.  They were engaged in fishing, from time to time they had to save sinking ships from the deaths of passengers.  Salt production was also developed here.  In the XIX century, the island became part of the United States.  Over the years, the place has become popular with tourists and vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="key west attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2065723.jpg"></div>  At the beginning of the last century, the famous railway was laid across the islands, which stretched straight from Miami.  It was destroyed by a severe storm in the 30s and replaced by a car one.  Now a little more than 25 thousand people live here permanently.

Hundreds of residents died after a hurricane in 1935.  But this was not the only such episode in the life of Key West Island.  More recently, in September 2017, the city of Key West was severely damaged after the hurricane Irma.  Houses and buildings were destroyed, trees were torn up by the root.  Wind speed almost exceeded 210 km / h.  The rampage of the elements led to a severe flood.  As a result, many residents were left without a roof over their heads, while people themselves were previously evacuated.  The city is gradually being restored, many objects are being rebuilt. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Why is Key West, Florida so attractive for tourists?  Firstly, a special climate.  In these edges, the temperature regime does not fall below zero degrees.  The weather is usually clear, sunny.  From morning to evening you can spend time on the beach, getting a pleasant shade of tan, swimming in the purest sea water. </p>

    <p>  The coastal zone is dotted with sand.  The most popular tourist destination is the equipped Smaters beach, where there are parking places, retail outlets and cafes, a relaxation area with the ability to rent tables and chairs.  Many come here for diving or fishing.  You can purchase a catamaran or a boat for a while.  There are wild beaches on the island.  For example, one of these is located in Fort Zachary Taylor Park.  A quieter place, which is visited by a significantly smaller number of tourists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The already named park is one of the places that is definitely worth a visit in Key West (Florida).  Until the 40s of the last century, the current fort was located here.  At the moment, this is a historical park where you can take a walk (on foot or by bicycle), rent a kayak or sit in a cafe.  The hours of visiting the park should be specified in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in key west" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2065719.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The main street of the city is Duval Street.  On both sides of it you can see numerous cafes and restaurants.  For example, Sloppy Joe's is a bar that was once visited by Hemingway itself!  Fans of the writer's work must come here to take photos of the interiors and miss a couple of cocktails.  This place often hosts concerts with live music.  Other institutions offer to sing karaoke, and if you come in the evening or at night, you can go to a colorful show and become a member of the carnival. </p><h2>  Key West Attractions </h2><p>  You can move around the city not only on your own feet.  It also offers excursions that take place on a special tourist bus.  And you can rent a scooter or bike to explore the surroundings on your own.  Around a lot of palm trees.  Coconuts from them are sold in retail stores.  They hold a straw inside to drink coconut milk more conveniently. </p><p>  In the southernmost location of Key West, Florida is a local attraction - a large painted buoy.  Sometimes a long line of tourists is lined up to be photographed next to him.  The buoy symbolizes the southern point of the United States (although in fact this is not entirely true).  It is also marked ‚Äú90 miles to Cuba‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="key west florida" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2065728.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Original souvenirs are sold in the city: it is wise to purchase something to commemorate a visit to Key West (Florida).  It can be magnets, small crafts, or <span>Cuban cigars</span> sold in some stores.  They are made on the island, according to local sellers.  By the way, it is forbidden to sell real Cuban cigars in the United States. </p><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  Key West has many interesting museums.  First of all, it is worth mentioning the Hemingway Museum, located in the house where the writer lived.  The building has a long history, and it was built already in 1851.  In the museum you can see antique furniture and things of the famous author.  Hemingway brought some trophies with him from expeditions to distant lands.  The museum is inhabited by amazing animals - six-fingered cats.  These are the descendants of the writer‚Äôs domestic cat. </p><p>  It is unlikely that in any city there is a Museum of Shipwrecks.  Here is an interesting exhibition of things that came to the inhabitants of Key West from sinking ships.  In addition to household items, you can see real gold bullion, as well as watch introductory videos about rescue operations.  Another museum complex where you can get acquainted with sea treasures and treasures is the Fisher Maritime Museum.  And you can look at the inhabitants of the ocean by visiting the Key West Aquarium.  Entrance there, as in museums, is paid, but tickets can be ordered in advance. </p><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  You can get to the island on a large cruise ship.  That is how tourists from China and other distant countries arrive on the Florida Keys.  Another option is to fly by plane.  Key West has a small international airport.  But it is worth considering that the weight of luggage is very limited.  Most often, travelers prefer to reach the island by car.  The bridge offers a stunning view of the sea, coral reefs and sailing ships.  On the way, you can also see what remains of the destroyed railway. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ki west city" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2065706.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The city has virtually no buildings above two floors.  And in some old buildings, according to legend, ghosts live.  An example is the Victorian-style mansion Marrero's Guest Mansion, near which the silhouette of a deceased girl, the beloved of the former owner of the house, has been seen more than once.  And the walls of some other buildings still remember the times of pirate bloodshed. </p><p>  You can stay in Key West (Florida) in a good hotel or in a private house.  Some residents rent visitors rooms or entire villas. </p>
