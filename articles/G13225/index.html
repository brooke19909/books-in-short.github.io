Huge amounts are annually allocated for the renovation of aviaries and research activities.  In 2003, a popular science hall appeared in which lectures on wildlife for all comers are held.  The center is equipped with excellent quality equipment.  The classes are often attended by living representatives of the fauna.  The zoo has 4 awards for its contribution to the research activities on the conservation of the planet.  Today, there are about 30 buildings with cages, aviaries, terrariums. </p><h2>  From the history of the menagerie </h2><p>  Where the <span>zoo</span> is now located <span>, the gardens</span> were set up during the reign of the Qi Dynasty.  Since 1906, animals began to appear here.  First, the zoo was declared the Agrarian Experimental Center.  From 1906 to 1908 preparations were made for the opening of the institution.  The administration was engaged in the expansion of areas, the construction of enclosures for animals.  In 1908, the grand opening of the Beijing Zoo took place.  The appearance of such a place in the city caused a stir among the residents.  The event was attended by a huge number of people.  At the time of opening, about 100 species of unusual animals settled in the natural complex. </p><p>  In 1911, the institution was nationalized.  In the terrible time for China during the Sino-Japanese War, almost all animals died a tragic death.  The horrors of confrontation survived only the ostrich emu and a dozen monkeys.  The Beijing Zoo began to rebuild after the 1949 People's Revolution.  The name "Beijing Zoo" the reserve received in 1955.  A huge number of animals were imported from neighboring countries.  Workers and specialists traveled to gain experience all over the world, including in the USSR. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  From 1965 to 1976, there was a time of cultural revolution in China.  The menagerie was forgotten a little, and its development stopped.  Among the employees of the institution conducted a political "purge".  Unfortunately, due to the policy, many contracts for the purchase of valuable breeds of animals were terminated.  When this period ended, China regained friendly relations with many countries.  Then England, Australia, the United States gave the Chinese zoo many new breeds of animals. </p><h2>  Panda House </h2><p>  The animal, for which it is simply necessary to visit the Beijing Zoo, is a large panda.  Representatives of the fauna appeared on the planet 600-700 thousand years ago.  Since serious changes have not occurred on Earth since this time, the pandas were in danger of extinction, so they were listed in the Red Book.  The number of forests in which the bears lived was greatly reduced.  Initially, pandas belonged to the category of carnivores, but over time they began to eat bamboo. </p><p>  The habitat of giant pandas is wet and dense thickets of bamboo, which are located in the mountains at an altitude of 2 to 4 kilometers.  Animals do not tolerate abrupt weather changes.  They make houses in hollows or caves.  They live in pairs.  Their mating season begins in April, and they lead offspring in the fall.  As a rule, this is one or two cubs, in rare cases three heirs are born. </p>

    <p>  The Chinese government is monitoring the bear population and has funded the creation of 10 reserves.  The giant panda has become a symbol of China.  These animals are brought as a gift as a sign of friendship between countries.  Black and white bears now live in England, Germany, Japan, USA, France, Mexico.  The panda house is a habitat sector for plush animals.  Here you can see how they frolic on the green grass.  Kids know how to play the ball, jump on the hinged stairs and ropes, touching touch on both cheeks bananas and other fruits.  It is strictly forbidden to feed animals! </p><h2>  Oceanarium </h2><p>  The Beijing Zoo houses the largest oceanarium in China.  It was opened in 1999.  Reminds a labyrinth with glass walls.

    <p>  From November to March, the price drops to 10 yuan.  No children's tickets.  Kids taller than 120 cm are free.  The price of visiting the entire zoo is significantly different.  The entrance fee to the natural complex for an adult is 140 yuan.  Child ticket costs 80. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of most people who visited the Beijing Zoo are not just good, but enthusiastic, but you need to be prepared for some of the nuances.  Those who are not visiting China for the first time, they say that you need to be prepared for the fact that institutions rarely speak English, at the checkout everything is also written in Chinese.  Have to explain on the fingers or slowly learn the language.  Tourists talk about the fact that you can have a tasty and inexpensive meal near the zoo.  Chinese bistros often serve waffles with ice cream and sweet beans, many are advised to try this unusual dish.  There is also a cafe on the territory of the natural complex, but there the prices are much higher. </p><p>  According to the stories of visitors, this is not just a zoo, but a whole town.  Shoes on your feet should be as comfortable as possible, since you will have to walk a lot.  All enclosures on the territory are very spacious.  Of the minuses, tourists note that all the signs in the zoo are in Chinese, and you can easily get lost. </p>

    <p>  Another thing that upset some travelers was a lot of exhibits, but not enough time.  The Beijing Zoo is open until 18:00.  If you travel with a guide (which is very convenient for those who do not know Chinese), then you will most likely be taken to the Big Panda House, and then to the aquarium, you will see the rest of the animals in dashes.  According to eyewitnesses, it is impossible to inspect the entire zoo in one day - it is too large. </p><p>  About 7 million people visit the Beijing Zoo every year.  It belongs to luxury attractions.  Many tourists are surprised by the Beijing Zoo crowded at noon on Monday.  Beijing is used to it, and residents perceive it as the norm.  A visit to the menagerie will leave an impression for life.  Here you will see such representatives of the fauna, which very few remain in the world. </p>
