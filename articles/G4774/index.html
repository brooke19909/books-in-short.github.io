It went on sale a few years ago, so I already managed to establish itself as a pretty good unit.  According to the characteristics that the manufacturer offers, its power is at an average level, but in fact it sucks in dust with such force that it is sometimes difficult to move with a brush.  The case is lightweight, small in size, has a nice appearance.  The dust container is made of plastic, therefore, cleaning it from dirt does not have to bother. </p><p>  The small price, of course, hints at the fact that the Samsung SC4520 vacuum cleaner also has disadvantages.  For example, the hose is soft, so after a while with careless use it can become deformed.  After each cleaning, the filters and dust collector will have to be washed immediately, because they become soiled immediately. </p><p>  More details about the device, its advantages, disadvantages, price and reviews can be read below.  The article also describes how to disassemble a Samsung SC4520 vacuum cleaner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner samsung sc4520" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1480757.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  The described vacuum cleaner, which is a device for cleaning dust and small debris, can not be called multifunctional.  Suction power is good.  This indicator is at an average level, however, for a budget option - a quite distinctive plus. </p><p>  On the case of the device there are only two buttons that are responsible for turning the unit on and off.  There are no indicators.  To reduce power, you can open the valve on the hose. </p>

    <p>  One of the brushes that comes with the kit is suitable for both carpet and smooth flooring.  However, buyers complain that the bristles are not enough in order to collect all the hair and wool, you will have to try hard.  The second brush copes with its duties perfectly, thanks to it you can vacuum up behind a cupboard or refrigerator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  <span>Vacuum cleaner Samsung SC4520, the reviews</span> of which are presented below, has a modest package.  However, this is quite expected, given the low cost of the device.  What does the manufacturer put into the box, except for the vacuum cleaner itself? </p><p>  There are: </p><ul><li>  Three filters: pre-engine, motor and output. </li><li>  Instruction </li><li>  Hose. </li><li>  Dust bag (plastic, looks like a container). </li><li>  Two brushes: the main one for carpets and floors, the additional one for collecting dust in hard-to-reach places. </li><li>  A pipe that is designed for suction. </li></ul><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Vacuum cleaner Samsung SC4520, the price of which varies in the range of $ 100-110, is quite simple when it comes to maintenance.  In order to wash the parts, it is necessary to disassemble the device.  This is easy enough to do.  The dust bag is pulled out using the handle.  Moreover, it should be noted that when it is removed, garbage does not fall out on all sides - it is rammed along the walls.  Under the container, you can find two filters: pre-engine and motor.  The output is located on the back side behind the compartment.  Disassembly of the Samsung SC4520 vacuum cleaner in a larger version (before the engine) is described a bit below. </p><p>  The dust bag can easily be washed if it is very dirty.  The same thing is done with pre-engine filter.  Others must not be washed.  But before reloading into the vacuum cleaner, you need to dry all the parts. </p><p>  The difficulties in servicing the device are that the dust collector is designed for only 1.3 liters, so you will have to clean it every time after cleaning.  If this is not done often, then the device will perform its functions poorly.  Brushes must also be cleaned. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Quality of cleaning </h2><p>  Each <span>filter for the Samsung</span> SC4520 <span>vacuum cleaner</span> plays a huge role in the operation of the device.  They function perfectly: direct duties, according to the owners of such an aggregate, the equipment performs well. </p><p>  Due to its strong <span>power, the vacuum cleaner</span> easily draws in all trash.  Consumers are often faced with the fact that the brush "sticks" to the carpet, and it is difficult to move.  It is best to purchase an additional device with a good pile, because the "native" sometimes can not cope with the removal of hair and wool from carpets, especially from carpet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner samsung sc4520 white" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1480751.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Design and construction of a vacuum cleaner </h2><p>  Design is the strongest side of this model's vacuum cleaner.  The device weighs only 4.3 kg.  The case is made of plastic, which is to some extent an advantage, since fingerprints do not appear.  On the panel you can see a black coating on which the name of the manufacturer flaunts and the maximum power is indicated.  The power button is easy to find at the junction with the back wall.  In the center of the black panel there is a key for winding the cord.  There is a handle on the plastic container, but you can‚Äôt carry the <span>Samsung SC4520</span> vacuum cleaner <span>(</span> device <span>reviews</span> - direct confirmation of this) for it. </p><p>  The device is equipped with three wheels.  Thanks to them, the unit has good maneuverability and, judging by the reviews, it rarely falls on its side when driving.  Keep in mind that the wheels are made of plastic, not rubber. </p><p>  The weak points of the vacuum cleaner can be called a hose and a pipe.  The latter is a construction of two small tubes inserted one into the other.  If we talk about telescopic options that are installed on all the more expensive models, then in this case this is a big flaw.  Under its growth, the consumer will no longer push the pipe.  The hose is too soft, often bends, due to which it blocks the air flow. </p><p>  The unit can be stored both assembled and disassembled.  Two color solutions are presented in stores: a Samsung SC4520 vacuum cleaner white and blue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="filter for vacuum cleaner samsung sc4520" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1480752.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  Although the vacuum cleaner fulfills its duties at an average level, does not have an abundance of brushes in the kit, and is also not able to ‚Äúboast‚Äù of functionality, it is still one of the best in its price category.  Compact, lightweight, with a convenient dust collector and suction power, with a long cord.  On average, the device consumes about 1600 watts, the noise reaches 82 dB. </p><h2>  How to disassemble the device? </h2><p>  If you need to disassemble the device, look through the instruction manual: the manufacturer has described in detail in the instructions how to do this.  However, if it is not possible to study the information, then pay attention to the algorithm of actions of the entire process, described below. </p><p>  Step-by-step instruction: </p><ol><li>  Pull out the dust bag. </li><li>  Remove the screws from the front of the housing. </li><li>  A hidden bolt can be found on the back of the vacuum cleaner under the film, it must also be removed. </li><li>  Remove the cover. </li><li>  Disconnect the terminals.  Remove the top panel.  Under it will be an engine. </li></ol><p>  And then you need to act on the basis of what, in fact, the Samsung SC4520 vacuum cleaner was disassembled for. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner disassembly samsung sc4520" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1480753.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Mistresses talk about the strong power of the device.  Many agree that the carpet literally ‚Äústicks‚Äù to the brush.  This is definitely a plus.  In the chamber, the dust is pressed, so it does not settle on the walls.  Thanks to this technology, it is easier to clean the container from debris.  To wash the chamber and other compartments, it will be enough to use running water, no special means will be needed. </p><p>  Buyers note the excellent assembly, nice appearance, compact size of equipment.  According to some, the hose is slightly clumsy, which causes minor inconvenience.  But you can get used to it. </p><p>  Consumers claim that the Samsung SC4520 vacuum cleaner is very noisy, but others who bought this device, on the contrary, talk about the standard sound level.  ‚ÄúIt is not louder than any equipment of this class,‚Äù one can often find such statements on forums.  Among the disadvantages, buyers consider the lack of a power regulator.  But you can control the strength of the stream using a special hole on the handle.  It looks like a regular valve, which was previously installed on vacuum cleaners of old models.  It is he who is responsible for regulating the air flow.  According to many, the hose mount looks a bit flimsy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disassemble a vacuum cleaner samsung sc4520" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1480920.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Total </h2><p>  In general, the vacuum cleaner is good enough for its price category.  It should be noted ease of use, strong power.  The design is minimalistic, no extra details.  However, those who would not hurt, either.  This is a lever for adjusting the suction power.  However, for those people who just need to quickly vacuum and set aside the device for a week, it is perfect. </p>
