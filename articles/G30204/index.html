Many tourists and cultural groups flock to this city.  Here you can meet the participants of conferences and business meetings.  Some come to the city in transit.  Regardless of the purpose of visiting the city, everyone needs housing.  Hotel "Express" (Minsk) offers all its guests comfortable rooms and excellent service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hot.citydog.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel minsk station" class="if uuid-2746223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2746223.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel is convenient for a transit holiday if you need to wait out time to a train, bus or plane.  Also, Railway Station Square is a convenient place for boarding transport to the city center and to the main attractions. </p><h2>  Hotel advantages </h2><p>  What is important for the tourist who first arrived in the city?  Of course, the proximity of the vacation spot to transport links.  Hotel "Express" <span>(Minsk, railway station)</span> is located in close proximity to transport routes. </p><p>  Within walking distance are the bus station and railway tracks.  Here you can find a minibus or a bus that takes you to the airport or another point in the city. </p><p>  Hotel "Express" (Minsk, Belarus) - a quiet and comfortable place.  You will not hear the noise of the railway or the music of a bar or restaurant.  The hotel has very strict internal rules, in violation of which they immediately evict noisy guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kvartirant.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Express&quot;" class="if uuid-2746204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2746204.jpg"></div><h2>  Address </h2><p>  This comfortable hotel is located in Minsk, on Privokzalnaya Square, building 3. Near the Ploshchad Lenina metro station, as well as many shops and entertainment centers. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="53.8906326" data-lng="27.55062099999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/8/4/8/7848.png"></div><p>  If you cross the road, you can find decent catering establishments.  <span>Restaurants, bars</span> and many shops will open their doors for you.  A little walk to Lenin Square, you will find yourself in the magnificent shopping center "Capital", where you can plunge into the world of shopping. </p><h2>  Overview </h2><p>  <span>Hotel Express</span> is a high-rise building that is hard to miss.  A large sign will help you find this object even at night.  The Express Hotel (Minsk) is a high-rise building of 13 floors with large windows.  The upper floors offer a beautiful view of the city center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="minsk.viptop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Minsk express" class="if uuid-2746215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2746215.jpg"></div><p>  Do not rely on the Internet, it is not in the hotel.  Therefore, you have to use mobile.  Nearby is a post office and internet cafe.  The hotel administration and staff will tell you how to get to the desired point. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is no hotel and own restaurant.  Downstairs is a small coffee shop.  But, according to customer reviews, it is almost always closed.  Therefore, it is worth taking care of what you plan to eat.  Near the hotel (across the road) there is a Galileo shopping center, which has a grocery store and several catering outlets. </p><p>  The hotel will offer you a luggage room, however, with such a late eviction (after 18.00), most likely, it will not be needed.  Laundry and ironing services are available upon request. </p><p>  At the entrance to the hall you plunge into the atmosphere of the USSR.  Reception desk behind glass and very "friendly" staff with makeup and hairstyle from the 80s.  All this is a bit reminiscent of past years. </p><p>  The Express Hotel (Minsk) has its own guarded parking lot, which is accessible to guests and employees' cars.  Therefore, you can not worry about your car. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Accommodation in rooms is much cheaper than in other hotels in the city.  This is very strange with this arrangement.  However, overnight stay is paid at the rate of "bed", and not for the room.  It turns out that the average cost of an overnight stay for two will cost around 50-60 bel.  rubles or about 2000 rubles (Russian). </p><p>  The hotel has rooms of three types of comfort.  Their cost differs by 10-20 bel.  rubles (500-700 Russian rubles).  The differences are not very significant.  There are two-room and one-room apartments.  With a large bed and two and a half.  Maximum occupancy is 4 people per room. </p><h2>  Interior </h2><p>  As described above, the hotel in Minsk near the station is made in the Soviet style.  Sometimes it seems that this is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe architect.  However, during the stay it becomes clear that these are remnants of the past.  The hotel just needs to be given to the right designer.  There is no certain style or direction in the interior of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel express minsk rooms" class="if uuid-2746208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2746208.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel "Express" in Minsk: rooms </h2><p>  The floors and rooms are clean and comfortable.  Despite the outward simplicity, the apartment is very comfortable.  The furniture is comfortable and new.  Many things in the room are made for the convenience of vacationers. </p><p>  For example, a large wardrobe with enough drawers and hangers.  Convenient lighting above the bed, there are bedside rugs.  On both sides there are small tables with shelves.  Soft and comfortable chair and several magazines. </p><p>  TV is just a rarity.  Many have long forgotten about such large and heavy boxes with the Horizon logo.  They are not just preserved in the hotel, they show several TV channels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="railway station Minsk hotel express" class="if uuid-2746209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2746209.jpg"></div><p>  There is a small wall table and chairs for tea drinking or a snack.  Unfortunately, the rooms are not equipped with kitchenettes, although that would be helpful. </p><p>  Spacious bathrooms with essential amenities delight all guests.  Soap, shampoo and shower gel in the dispenser.  All sinks and toilets have ‚ÄúDisinfected‚Äù marks. </p><h2>  Conditions in the apartment </h2><p>  The room has a small refrigerator, however, without a minibar, a plate and two cups.  Not enough water bottles or cooler. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ostrovok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="express photo Minsk" class="if uuid-2748799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2748799.jpg"></div><p>  The interior is made in soothing colors.  There is no special stylistic direction in it.  Everything is very simple. </p><p>  The windows in the rooms are large (double-glazed windows).  The view of the evening city from the upper floors is simply beautiful.  However, it is clouded by dirt on both sides of the windows, which should have been removed for a long time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alyans-hotel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel express minsk reviews" class="if uuid-2746214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2746214.jpg"></div><p>  Since the hotel is right next to the train tracks, many worry that they will not be able to relax due to the noise.  However, most of the guests say that the hotel is very quiet.  By the way, for hooliganism and noisy behavior after 23.00 in the hotel immediately evicted. </p><h2>  Description of the corridors </h2><p>  A big plus is that the hotel has a working elevator.  He also stayed here from past times (judging by the description of vacationers).  Corridors are very similar to hospital ones.  On the floor tiles of dubious colors, plastic doors.  Everywhere there are evacuation plans and green signs "Exit".  You can also go upstairs by stairs (optional). </p><h2>  Hotel "Express" of Minsk: reviews </h2><p>  A large number of reviews about the hotel indicates that it is popular and in demand.  Many tourists are advised to pre-book a place in this hotel indicating the number of nights of stay.  After all, a situation may arise when you will need to extend the room, and it has already been booked by other vacationers.  This is exactly what some guests say in their reviews.  During any holidays, there are practically no places in hotels.  Some guests tried to renew the rooms in the Express, but this was not possible. </p><p>  Also, some tourists believe that the hotel does not have its own site, and it is not visible on the portals for booking rooms.  And here is the spirit of the USSR.  You need to look for a number and call the reception (even from another country) in order to book a room. </p><p>  Another surprise for guests is that all vacationers in the room must present their passports.  Their data are handwritten in paper forms, all of which takes a lot of time.  In the age of new technologies, such a relic is very surprising and sad. </p><p>  In their reviews, guests of the Express Hotel talk about a good price-quality ratio.  With this location (near the station) you can almost always find a hotel room.  The exception is only big holidays.  It is very sad that you can not make a reservation through the official website or through other Internet resources.  You have to call a landline phone or just come in the hope that the number will be. </p><p>  At the entrance, at first it becomes a little uneasy.  Outdated interior and very interesting staff.  Service and maintenance are far from European.  However, everywhere is clean and tidy.  After a lengthy registration you will receive a door key.  It is the key, not the card.  Access to the room is by stairs or by elevator.  It is unlikely that you will be able to find a porter or a porter of things here.  The rooms are quite acceptable for relaxing.  There is everything you need.  Simple interior without frills and frills.  Summing up, we can say that this hotel is quite suitable for a one-day inexpensive vacation for those who are not used to luxury. </p><p>  In another review, guests of the Express Hotel talk about their not-so-good experience of staying.  Dirty windows and terrible interior - this is what the guests remembered.  They would rather pay more, but for more comfortable conditions.  Guests say that the dishes on the fridge were dirty. </p><p>  Tourists of the city say that this is a great place to spend the night.  Inexpensive and there is a comfortable bed and bathroom.  Late check-out allows you to take a shower before departure, relax and calmly pack.  The official check-out at the hotel is at 12.00, however you can talk with the administration what time you can check in.  They necessarily make concessions to all guests. </p><p>  Some guests of the hotel leave quite pleasant reviews about this place.  However, one should not expect for a minimum cost of European quality of service. </p><p>  Summing up, I would like to note that the Express Hotel in Minsk, the photo of which was above, is one of the most popular holiday destinations. It is an inexpensive, but comfortable accommodation in a good place in the capital. The interior and service are average. Like any hotel, There are pros and cons. </p>
