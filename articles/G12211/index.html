The level of quality is not limited by visual characteristics such as tone, color and detail, but it is provided by a stabilization system made in the form of a built-in suspension.  This mechanism ensures that the 12.4 megapixel DJI X3 camera will always remain stable and not be subject to the vibrations typically found in compact devices. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  There are a number of buttons on the handle that allow you to fully control the operation of the video capture device and <span>swivel.</span>  A spring-loaded phone holder with a Wi-Fi module is mounted on the side, which expands the capabilities of the camera and also serves as a convenient screen for viewing material being shot in real time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The unique design and almost autonomous movement of the camera make the device look like a product of extraterrestrial origin.  OSMO promises a novice filmmaker or video blogger the opportunity to shoot professionally stabilized material, the quality of which is still unparalleled in systems of similar value available on the market. </p><p>  Setting up most of the small motorized joints for GoPro and other action cameras is often difficult or time consuming.  OSMO is ready to work in seconds.  Its competitors include the Yuneec Typhoon ActionCam manual system.  Although it is a successful model, its design is still significantly inferior to DJI products. </p>

    <h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  DJI OSMO, according to owners, combines a futuristic design with functionality, its design is solid and its assembly exceptional.  The handle has a perfect size, it is ergonomic and fits comfortably in your hand.  The power button is located on the side, and the thumb-controlled joystick for moving the camera, as well as the buttons for stopping video recording and capturing still images, are placed in a convenient place and are easy to control. </p><p>  On the opposite side of the handle to the switch is a holder that allows you to quickly install a mobile device on it.  It is made of metal and can be removed to connect other accessories if necessary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Modifications </h2><p>  OSMO is a modular system.  In the upper part of the handle there is a motorized mechanism and an X3 camera.  It can be replaced with modifications of the X5 and X5R, which offer a higher resolution of 16 megapixels, a Micro Four Thirds sensor and lens mounts.  Reviews of the DJI OSMO X5 model call AF the biggest drawback, since focusing from a smartphone is difficult to control, and a larger sensor and aperture only exacerbate the problem.  Also, users note insufficient battery life, microphone insensitivity and the inability to transfer 4K video to the phone. </p>

    <p>  Modification without a camera takes video using a smartphone.  DJI OSMO Mobile praises user reviews for build quality and great functionality not available in competitors' models, but the GJI Go app spoils the impression of the product, especially for Android phone owners - some of them are not supported for slow-motion single-frame shooting and long exposure.  The limitations of the system are largely determined by the characteristics of the smartphone. </p><p>  The DJI OSMO Plus model is praised for its long battery life, the presence of a 3.5-optical zoom and an input for an external microphone, but criticized for the lack of headphone output, the possibility of losing a wireless connection and poor image quality in low light conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Base model </h2><p>  The X3 is the entry-level camera of the DJI line, but it allows you to shoot impressively high-quality frames with 4K video capture at 25 frames per second, as well as in many other resolutions, including Full HD at 120 fps. </p><p>  The lens has a 94-degree field of view (20 mm equivalent), but unlike other action cameras equipped with a Sony Exmor R CMOS 1 / 2.3 sensor, it provides well-controlled distortion and has a focus range from 1.5 m to infinity, which facilitates the shooting of self-portraits and brings them closer to the scene. </p><p>  Indeed, the minimum focusing distance of 1.5 m is not close enough for a selfie, although only a careful study of the frame will reveal a soft focus, and this is still significantly better than most action cameras.  On the X5R and X5, it was reduced to 0.5 m. </p><p>  Movies are recorded on a microSD card, which fits in a slot on the side of the camera.  On the front panel of the handle there is a standard 3.5 mm audio jack, which allows you to automatically adjust the sound gain with a quality that will annoy even the most moderate audiophile.  A standard  ‚Äùmounting hole can be found on the side surface for mounting accessories such as a mobile phone holder or tripod, although the handle design makes the latter option impossible without an additional adapter. </p>

    <h2>  Customization </h2><p>  Preparation for work OSMO DJI, according to owners, is fast enough.  If the user is familiar with <span>Phantom quadrocopters,</span> then the connection process is identical.  On your mobile device, you need to download and install the DJI Go application, turn on OSMO, select a Wi-Fi connection, launch the application and select the required model from the list.  After connecting, the opportunity will appear on-screen sight in real time and access to all camera settings.  The application interface is well designed, but since its concept has no analogues, it will take some time to understand and quickly navigate the settings and modes.  At the bottom of the interface are the options and the record button, as well as settings for resolution, frame rate and other functions. </p><p>  Suspension settings allow you to adjust the reaction of the mechanism, and not control its movement.  This is ideal for custom panning and automatic photography.  Another nice feature is the ability to use on-screen sighting as a trackpad to change the position of the camera.  The direction of finger movement will determine the direction of rotation of the lens.  The settings are pretty simple and, as you would expect, include resolution, frame rate, and sensitivity. </p>

    <h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  It's easy to start shooting - just click on the record button.  Pressing it again will stop it.  During recording, the joystick under the thumb can be used to adjust the tilt and rotation in the vertical and horizontal axis.  Another control is located on the back of the handle.  This is the trigger used to activate various commands.  In normal recording mode, triple pressing will expand the camera to take a selfie, and repeating it will return it back.  If the trigger is held pressed, the orientation of the lens will be fixed in such a way that no matter how the device rotates, its optics will be directed to the same place. </p><p>  After a short period of acquaintance with various functions and buttons, the use of DJI OSMO, according to owners, becomes intuitive. </p><h2>  Video quality </h2><p>  The X3 has similar features to the <span>GoPro Hero 4</span> Black, capturing 4K video at 25 fps, compared to GoPro and Full HD at 120 fps compared to 30 fps.  All settings must be made through the DJI Go application interface on a mobile device, and it is quite simple to find and change them.  There is also a manual mode, which allows you to adjust the shutter speed and sensitivity, which may be required in insufficient or too bright lighting. </p><p>  DJI OSMO, according to reviews, copes well with changes in lighting.  Moving the lens from shadow to light shows a smooth exposure control, without overexposure or under-exposure of the frame during the transition.  As the brightness of the light decreases in the frame, noise becomes noticeable, but for a sensor of this size this is not surprising, and the noise reduction technology allows you to keep interference levels under control.  There are several options for manually adjusting the sensitivity for videos from ISO 100 to 3200. </p>

    <p>  Color and saturation are fixed.  There is no way to change any of these parameters, which users regret.  However, automatic white balance and saturation balance colors well, and tones have many details.  High quality video DJI OSMO X3 owner reviews attributed to the high recording speed of the footage.  In the test with 4K video, the average bitrate was 60 Mb / s, and when shooting in Full HD at a speed of 60 fps, the data transfer rate dropped to 40 Mb / s. </p><p>  These values ‚Äã‚Äãare very high compared to other cameras that have a sensor of a similar size, so when playing back, the movements look incredibly smooth and saturated. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The design of the device may seem strange, but when it is used, everything immediately makes sense, and fears that the sphere, the hinge mechanism and the handle design are fragile will disappear immediately as soon as the stabilization suspension is in the hands.  The mechanics of the <span>gimbal, the</span> operation of the camera and the connection to the mobile application at DJI OSMO, according to the owners, work incredibly well.  The video quality is exceptional and the lightweight device allows filmmakers to capture professionally stabilized shots in a way that is very difficult or impossible to make for the money. </p>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Despite the well-thought-out layout and design of the buttons, users note some problems.  The construction is solid, but it is not a device that can simply be put in a bag, so it is best to store and transport it in the attached semi-rigid case.  This does not mean that the design is fragile, but it is better not to tempt fate.  The only mount on the handle is used for a mobile phone, and if you remove it, the shape of the handle will not allow you to connect a tripod without a special adapter.  A simple base mount would be ideal, but access to the battery is located here.  And although there is a slot for an external recording device, its positioning makes it difficult to use. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  DJI OSMO, according to user reviews, allows you to shoot as before it was possible only with the help of a professional kit.  The setup and use of the device is incredibly simple, the suspension is exceptionally well designed, there are no additional wires or screws that are often found in such action cameras.  If you need to take it off hand, then the smooth movements obtained on this model, at this cost, really have no analogues.  There are several other minor issues, such as connecting to the audio jack and the feeling that the full potential of the device is not yet fully realized, but compared to competitors, the tool provides quick capture of incredible frames that could not be obtained otherwise. </p>
