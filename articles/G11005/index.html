Whether you are in Heraklion, or in the Rethymno region, or in Chania, or in Gouves, for example, at the Gouves Maya Resort 3 * hotel, Crete will reveal to you the secrets of its caves, palaces and temples.  So, next to Gouves is the Paraskeva Cave.  She fascinates with her beauty.  Decorated with <span>stalactites and stalagmites of</span> bizarre configurations and shapes, it delights hundreds of tourists who were not too lazy to look into its mysterious depths.  According to archaeologists, the ancient inhabitants of the island performed their sacred rituals in this cave.  In the same places is the Cretan aquarium, which presents thousands of species of inhabitants of the deep sea.  The outskirts of Gouves are not rich in sights, therefore tourists, according to their desire, are taken to architectural monuments that are located throughout the island. </p>
