    <p>  Start by creating a foundation.  To do this, inflate the balloon to the desired size of the openwork form of threads.  After this, the workpiece should be arbitrarily wrapped with threads dipped in glue, changing their direction.  There are two ways.  In the first case, the thread should be threaded into a large needle and pierced through it with a bottle of PVA.  Next, you need to stretch a floss or iris through a bottle and wrap it.  The second option is to pour glue in the saucer and immerse the end of the thread there.  Next, slowly pull and wrap.  When there are enough layers of thread, cut off its end and hide it carefully.  Then the finished workpiece must be put to dry for several hours in a warm place.  We figured out how to make openwork balls, but how to make a snowman out of thread and glue?  To create a decorative figure, you will need 2-3 blanks that differ in size from each other.  Make them right away and put them to dry, and only after they have dried, start the most interesting part of the creative process. </p><h2>  How to make a snowman out of threads: step-by-step instructions for assembling crafts </h2>

They must be dry and hard to the touch.  If the result is achieved, you can gently pierce the balls with a needle and pull them out.  You should get openwork and hollow inside the workpiece of thread.  Arrange the balls in the correct order relative to each other.  After which it is necessary to glue the workpieces together.  It is advisable at this stage to choose the option of placing souvenirs in space and make a suitable mount.  The snowman from the balls can be hung by attaching a rope on top.  No less spectacular your craft will look and installed on a stand.  After choosing the mounting option, stick the resulting <span>figure from the balls</span> to the base or fix the ribbon at the top. </p><h2>  Decorate a snowman </h2><p>  Do not forget to make the finished figurine eyes and mouth of rhinestones, beads or buttons of a suitable size.  It is easy to build a carrot nose out of colored paper glued with a cone, or a light and dense fabric that can hold its shape well.  You can put a bucket of cardboard on a snowman‚Äôs head or a New Year‚Äôs cap made of fabric.  A figurine may also have pens.  You already know how to make a snowman out of thread with your own hands.  In the same technique as the ‚Äúbody‚Äù with the head, make the two smallest workpieces in size.  Attach them to the middle ball (or bottom if the snowman is two) on the sides.  Another option for making hands is to stick wires or threads to the body.  You can also decorate a snowman with a scarf and a pair of mittens specially made or knitted for him. </p><h2>  Placement in the interior </h2>
