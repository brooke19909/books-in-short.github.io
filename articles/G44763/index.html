According to them, to submit an application you just need to fill out a simple questionnaire, indicate your passport details and bank card number, but be sure to a Russian credit institution.  At the same time, unnamed and salary plastic in this case is not suitable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The high percentage of approval of applications is striking.

    <h2>  What are the loan conditions at Webbankir? </h2><p>  By contacting Webbankir (user reviews confirm this fact), each potential borrower can get from 1000 to 15 000 rubles for personal expenses.  However, he does not have to mention the ultimate goal of the loan.  Therefore, you can spend them on anything.  The terms of the microloan range from 5 to 30 days. </p><h2>  Who can count on a loan? </h2><p>  Contact the Webbankir com website (customer reviews in most cases agree with this information) can citizens of the Russian Federation, whose age is not younger than 20 years.  At the same time, the age maximum of the company is 100 years.  The main criterion for MFIs, increasing the chances of getting a microloan, is the availability of stable monthly earnings. </p><h2>  Are conditions changing for new and old customers? </h2><p>  According to users who have repeatedly left positive feedback about Webbankir, conditions for customers may change.  In particular, these changes relate to lower interest rates of the organization.  For example, upon first contact, new customers receive a rate of 1.9% per day.  However, after successful repayment of the previous loan, the rate decreases to 1.8% per day.  And with each subsequent appeal, it will fall further.  Ultimately, your percentage will reach 1.2% per day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Moreover, due to lower rates, the amount of the final overpayment is also reduced.  For comparison: with an initial application and an amount of 6,500 rubles for a period of 12 days, the borrower will have to pay 7,982 rubles, which is 1482 rubles.  With a client who has successfully paid the previous loan and applied again, the overpayment is reduced to 936 rubles. </p><h2>  How does lending work at Webbankir? </h2><p>  Making a microloan on the MFI website takes place in three stages.  First, a potential borrower needs to fill out a simple application or application form with contact details and other financial information about himself.  At the same time, he does not need income certificates and the availability of official employment.  Guarantors and collateral are also not needed by Webbankir representatives.  A personal account (reviews about it can be heard mainly from the positive side) in this case will be activated after a short authentication procedure. </p><p>  At the second stage, you should sign a loan agreement, which will be sent to you by e-mail.  It is signed by entering the code from SMS in the appropriate window.  And, finally, it remains only to receive money in any way acceptable to you. </p><h2>  What are the options for getting money? </h2><p>  After the microloan has been approved at Webbankir, you will be able to indicate a convenient option for crediting funds.  For example, organization borrowers can receive almost instant money transfers to their cards. </p><p>  If you want to take money in cash, everyone has the right to do this using the Contact payment system.  And finally, the third option for transferring funds is the Yandex Yandex.  Money".  According to numerous reviews, from the time of application submission to the transfer of funds, no more than 25-30 minutes pass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="webbankir bank reviews" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/1932357.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Is there a loan extension? </h2><p>  According to information received from users, the established loan period is quite realistic to extend.  This can be done starting from 4 days of using credit money.  This service is executed using your personal account.  Moreover, the maximum extension period is not more than 30 days.  It is noteworthy that the number of such extensions can be unlimited. </p><p>  However, it is worth saying that this service is far from free.  As it turned out, the cost of renewal for each day is 60 rubles.  Therefore, for 30 days you will pay 1800 rubles.  Here are just a percentage of the loan has not been canceled.  Therefore, in addition to this money, the borrower will need to pay interest.  And this means that the size of the overpayment for such a loan will increase further.  Therefore, before extending the loan term, you must carefully consider everything. </p><h2>  How can I repay a loan? </h2><p>  According to regular customers of this MFI, there are at least 5 diverse ways to repay a loan at Webbankir.  For example, the simplest repayment option is done through your personal account and with a credit card.  The second option is to pay the loan through the terminals of the ICD, Qiwi, Zolotaya Korona and Eleksnet.  Also available is a transfer through Russian Post offices, the Sberbank Online service and the Yandex.Money virtual wallet. </p><p>  If you have a balance suitable for payment on your mobile phone account, you can make a payment using your gadget. </p><h2>  User opinions on loans in MFIs </h2><p>  User reviews about this <span>microfinance organization</span> can conditionally be divided into positive and negative.  If we talk about positive reviews, then most users thank the company for loyalty, speed of response, and also a great opportunity to get a loan amount with minimal effort.  This especially helps when money is needed urgently. </p><p>  Other borrowers complain of high interest rates and a large amount of overpayment.  However, it is interest and overpayment - these are two integral components of any loans.  But their value directly depends on urgency and risks.  Since microloans in this MFI are provided without information, guarantors, down payments, and even collateral, the risks of the company will be increased.  Therefore, it is simply unrealistic to expect low interest rates on such loans. </p><h2>  What non-payers think about Webbankir: debtor reviews </h2><p>  Despite the company's loyalty to customers, many of them simply ignore the positive attitude of MFIs.  Some inattentively read the contract or naively believe that a non-bank organization will not levy a penalty for non-payment of a loan.  But this is not so. </p><p>  Any non-banking organization is an officially registered company.  This is a private lender.  Therefore, if you take a loan from him, you should treat this procedure with full responsibility.  Recall that for each day of late payment the company imposes a fine of 20% per annum, taking into account the amount of your main debt. </p><p>  That‚Äôs why most of the negative reviews about the company‚Äôs work come precisely from malicious defaulters.  They are very offended by the presence of fines, which tend to accumulate. </p>
