    <h2>  Or maybe we fly to Becici? </h2><p>  Have you ever heard about the paradise of Becici?  This is a place where you are sure to get an exceptional and memorable vacation.  Montenegro (from Minsk by airliner it takes only two hours to fly there) will even seem to you to be the dearest and closest country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What is interesting about this unknown land with such a beautiful name? </p><p>  I must say that by choosing the village of Becici for living in the hospitable Montenegro, you can "kill two birds with one stone."  The first is that the place is located only three kilometers from the famous Budva.  Thus, you can visit all its places of interest and gambling establishments.  By the way, you can get there by unhurried steps along the seaside boulevard or on a small "road train" plying between the settlements.  And secondly, settle in a quieter and quieter corner, without even moving far from the center of civilization. </p>

    <p>  Becici is famous for its small pebble beach, which extends for almost three kilometers.
