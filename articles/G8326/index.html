    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city of Vidnoye (Moscow region) is located close to the capital and is practically a part of it.  The administrative boundary here is rather a convention.  The historical center immersed in greenery, represented by old cottages, is located 3 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road. </p><p>  Near low-rise buildings are being built.  Thanks to modern standards, the introduction of innovative building technologies, the level of comfort in them is higher than secondary housing.  At the same time, LCD ‚ÄúBitsevsky Hills‚Äù offers areas cheaper than used apartments both in Vidnoye and in neighboring Biryulyovo. </p><h2>  Green Zone </h2><p>  According to the <span>architectural concept, the</span> project received the status of a cultural and residential complex.  It is made cultural by its proximity to a historical monument - the Timokhovo estate in the town of Vidnoe (Moscow region). </p><p>  Restoration work involves the improvement of part of the territory of the prince's park and, in fact, the estate.  An updated view of the ensemble will allow the ravines and hills that sheltered the park to be an important city attraction.  The attractiveness of the Bitsevsky Hills for residents and investors naturally increases, so investments in landscaping the green zone are justified. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Architectural performance </h2><p>  The Bitsevsky Hills (Vidnoe) are called upon to become the visible embodiment of the concept of a harmonious combination of residential and park areas.  Workmanship corresponds to the comfort class.  The natural-historical environment in the urban landscape is certainly a premium option.  Walking paths were laid in the arboretum, rest spots were marked out, and a private mini-park was set up. </p><p>  Monolithic brick houses are faced with warm shades of brick (sand, coffee, chocolate).  Architectural and decorative elements of facades, curly friezes at interfloor joints, porcelain stoneware with double-glazed windows under a tree are called to akin to modern buildings with an old manor style.  As conceived, the ‚ÄúBitsevsky Hills‚Äù should become a place pleasant for life. </p><p>  The complex consists of two buildings, divided into blocks of different floors.  The houses are arranged sequentially, so there is no one to look into the windows.  The best apartments have panoramic views of the park area. </p><p>  In the buildings of 624 studios or apartments with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã49,000 m <sup>2</sup> (in some - two bathrooms and two dressing rooms).  Of them: </p><ul><li>  three-room apartments - 12 (from 89.3 to 105.8 m <sup>2</sup> ); </li><li>  two-room apartments - 88 (from 59.7 to 97.6 m <sup>2</sup> ); </li><li>  one-room - 352 (from 42.6 to 71.6 m <sup>2</sup> ); </li><li>  studio apartments - 172 (from 32.1 to 38.8 m <sup>2</sup> ). </li></ul><p>  The protected area is fenced, thanks to this there are enough parking spaces. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Landscape </h2><p>  The natural environment is an important attribute of the attractiveness of housing.  The houses are being built close enough to the transport arteries of Vidnoye and the Don highway to visit Moscow without difficulty.  At the same time, a wide forest belt lies between the highway and the complex. </p><p>  The name ‚ÄúBitsevsky Hills‚Äù itself reflects a complex, yet diverse relief near the complex.  Hills overgrown with trees, alternating with ravines, form a favorable microclimate.  They block the way to strong winds, and in the heat they cool the air, filter the dust, saturate with oxygen and volatile.  Nearby is <span>the Bitsa River.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Bitsevsky hills: reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the complex are the most controversial, which is expected.  A number of residents are not satisfied with the quality of the finish.  They note the discrepancy between the design layouts and the real situation.  Other buyers consider this to be insignificant factors, which are offset by a good entrance and location in the green zone. </p><p>  The main advantage of buyers consider attractive the cost of housing for such a complex and location.  A number of apartments differ from the declared area (often up) by 2-3 m <sup>2</sup> .  But buyers were warned in advance of this possibility.  On average, reviews on the strong "four". </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Bitsevsky Hills (Prominent) is a good place to live and a profitable investment tool.  With the expansion, consolidation of Moscow, its value will increase.  Well-developed house and city infrastructure, convenient transport routes, and the proximity of the capital make the residential complex attractive. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the main advantage is the cultural and park landscape: Rastorguevsky pine forest on one side and the green zone of the Bittsy river on the other.  Living among the trees in the metropolitan area is becoming a big luxury. </p>
