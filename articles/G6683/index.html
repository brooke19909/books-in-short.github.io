    <p>  Having walked around the city during the day, it is so nice to relax in the home.  And for tourists with kids in the yard there is a playground. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another good example of a <span>hotel in</span> Kronstadt is the Ksenia Apartments, located at Kronshtadt, ul.  Navy, 21. Travelers will be met by a cozy comfortable room.  Excellent service, free internet and even a laptop, necessary appliances.  But here, unfortunately, they do not accept guests with children and animals.  But the price is the most favorable - accommodation for a day will cost 2500 rubles. </p><p>  The listed hotel apartments are located in the central part of the city.  That is, without wasting time on the road, you can see much more attractions of Kronstadt in a day.  Among them, a specially sorted "gap" in the wall of the fortress, called the "Petersburg Gate".  Or you can walk from Petersburg Pier along the city boulevard, Pig-iron bridge on the Anchor Square, along the paths of parks and gardens buried in flowers and greenery.  And make sure that the once famous city-fortress is rightfully called the garden city.  Any tourist is interested in the criteria and parameters of living conditions, affordable prices, convenient booking of free rooms and other guest services. </p><h2>  You need to prepare in advance </h2><p>  So, if you specifically know the time of vacation, it is better to look at the pages of hotels in Kronstadt in advance.  It is very important to make an acceptable choice for yourself for the price and interior design of the room.  An important fact is the ability to receive reporting documents on accommodation, this is important in the case of a business trip. </p><p>  One thing is certain - the proposed hotels in Kronstadt are cheap for the price, given the level of service and comfort offered. </p><h2>  Who came for what </h2><p>  Real local lore tourists do not stay in hotel rooms.  Most of the day they spend in search of unforgettable impressions, select the most interesting routes for excursions to visit unique places, touch history, sights and capture a vacation or a three-day weekend in their memory for a long time. </p><p>  In Kronstadt, you can rent housing at a price of 350 rubles per bed in <span>Hostel</span> 101, located at Lenin Ave. 18. But here you can also choose a room according to the degree of comfort: single or bunk bed, 2-, 3 -, 4- or 6-seater number.  But the price will be higher - up to 2400 rubles. </p>

    <p>  Hostel translated from English means "hostel".  This is a democratic, economical and affordable way of temporary residence or overnight for a tourist.  This type of overnight stay and relaxation for travelers "light" is common in all countries of the world. </p><h2>  For lovers of something special </h2><p>  There is a hotel in Kronstadt, which is distinguished by its originality.  The interior of the rooms is decorated with natural wood and creates a relaxing summer mood, fresh sea air invigorates, and the cries of seagulls, the splashing of waves and the ships sailing past the windows give a complete illusion of a trip around the world.  Comfort and a full range of hotel services will help you get the most out of your life. </p><p>  The moored landing stage ‚ÄúFort Konstantin‚Äù is perhaps the only hotel in Kronstadt and St. Petersburg that has its own pier with views from the hotel rooms to the Gulf of Finland.  Fort Constantine is located at Kronshtadt, Toulon Alley, 1. </p>

    <p>  It is advisable to get to this floating hotel by car or taxi.  But on your own yacht or another vessel is also acceptable.

A small fee for the uniqueness of the place and comfort. </p><p>  This is Kronstadt - severe and beautiful in history and in architecture, friendly to guests.  And to appreciate, to see all of his beauties, it is worth coming, not putting off into the unknown future. </p>
