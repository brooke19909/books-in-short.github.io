There are several reasons for this.  Firstly, this Asian country is one of those where you can spend your long-awaited vacation relatively safely and inexpensively, and secondly, both the hotel service and the <span>quality of services</span> offered in Turkish resorts improve from year to year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cinar Family Suite Hotel" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/664767.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  An important advantage is the local climate with natural landscape.  Turkey has everything: mountains and waterfalls, <span>historical monuments of</span> ancient times and nature reserves.  But the most important thing is the stunning coast and beaches. </p><h2>  Cheap vacation </h2><p>  This country has one more definite plus: here you can have a good rest for fairly little money.  Cheap hotels in Turkey offer a very wide range of services.  True, their level is somewhat different from the European one, but for many, including Russians, this circumstance is not a problem. </p><p>  The tourist service here is well developed, so you can find a cheaper and calmer hotel even in the famous noisy resorts where young people relax.  However, many prefer to go to such Turkish cities, where you can relax while enjoying peace.  Judging by the reviews of vacationers, the most inexpensive can be called Fethiye, Alanya and Side.  Turkey, whose 4-star hotels are not very different from those that have a higher category, today accepts tourists of all kinds of incomes.  Her hotels can be a great place to relax, if, of course, correctly determine their choice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cinar Family Suite Hotel reviews" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/664764.jpg" width="376"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The Russians who come to this budget hotel are mostly satisfied with an inexpensive and comfortable stay.  They are satisfied with everything: the arrangement of rooms, the food offered, and the territory of the hotel.  There are especially many positive reviews about the sea, which is surprisingly warm in this part of the Turkish Riviera, and the sun is gentle. </p><p>  Cinar Family Suite Hotel is designed for discreet guests.  Disadvantages, as in any other hotel, can be found.  Nevertheless, for a budget holiday, it fits perfectly.  The only drawback, according to many Russians, is the lack of Russian-speaking personnel.  Some in their reviews complain about the remoteness of the hotel‚Äôs own beach, although they add that the nearest public area for sunbathing and swimming is a good alternative.  Nevertheless, almost all agree on one thing: value for money is just perfect. </p>
