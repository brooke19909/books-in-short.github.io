In the device settings, in order to be able to set protection, the tab "Password protection" is provided.  There you can set any protection configuration, for example, set the period of time after which the device is blocked.  An interesting feature is the ability of the device to self-destroy all data if the password is entered incorrectly 10 times.  However, it is not recommended to use this function for those who have a lot of necessary information stored in the device.  This menu item appeared on the iPhone 5, in iOS firmware version 7.1, which appeared in March 2014.

It is possible to bypass the set limit by resetting password attempts.  So, the device writes: ‚ÄúConnect to iTunes‚Äù, and full formatting and resetting to factory settings are impossible due to the fact that unique or important information is stored in the memory.  Most often, users do not want to lose data from the tablet on which the message appeared: "iPad disabled, connect to iTunes."  In this case, you must connect the device to the desktop computer and reset the password counter.

    <h2>  ITunes sync issues </h2><p>  The need to restore access to the device can occur at any time outside the home, far from the computer with which the gadget has already been synchronized.  The password counter is rolled back, as mentioned above, using iTunes.  Usually this method is accessed after the message ‚ÄúiPhone is disconnected, connect to iTunes‚Äù appears.  If at the moment access to your PC is not possible, then you can try to establish a connection with another.  When you connect to a copy of iTunes with which the gadget was not previously synchronized, you will see a notification asking you to allow access to the computer to the information stored in the device‚Äôs memory.  After you allow access, the program will try to synchronize, but for its successful completion you need to respond on the smartphone or tablet itself.  In the event that the message on the screen that the iPhone is disconnected, it is impossible to make a response from it.  Since this is not possible in your case, it is possible to quickly restore access to the device only when the device is detected in the program or after a complete reset (in this case, the information will be lost). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to reset password counter if device is detected </h2>

Use the supplied cable to connect.  In some cases, the inscription ‚ÄúiPhone is disconnected, connect to iTunes‚Äù may disappear immediately after authorizing the device in the program, there is no need to perform other manipulations in this case.  If this does not happen, then you must continue to work.  To interact with the program was more convenient, you must enable the left <span>side panel.</span>  After the connection is established, an image of the phone will appear on this panel, as well as basic information about it.  Right-click on the picture symbolizing the device and select ‚ÄúSync‚Äù from the context menu.  The top panel will notify you of the start of the synchronization process, a bar and a message on the start of the process will appear on it.  However, you do not need to wait for the end, and synchronization must be canceled by clicking on the cross.  Usually, after this procedure, it is possible to restart the password selection process.  You can do the same with a tablet if a message appears on it: "iPad is disconnected, connect to iTunes."

Users have verified that the reset occurs during any interaction between the gadget and iTunes.  After the number of attempts, you can reconnect the device to the computer and reset the counter.  The fact that the "iPhone" asks to connect to iTunes, the manufacturer prompts us a solution to the problem of a forgotten password.  If you at least vaguely remember what the password was, or hope to remember it quickly, then this method will suit you.  However, if the password was not recalled after a long time, it is necessary to resort to a complete reset of the device.  If you have a <span>backup copy of the data,</span> then after the reset you can restore the information.

Synchronizing a device with it is possible only with the help of authorization in the application.  In order to keep a copy of the information in iTunes, you must synchronize the device with it.  The developers recommend that owners do this procedure periodically so that the information on the computer is up to date.  If the iPhone is disconnected and its recovery is necessary, the data will not be permanently lost. </p><h2>  Putting the device into DFU mode </h2><p>  <span>Device Firmware</span> Update Mode - device debugging mode, it is possible to restore the device's factory settings in it.

To start this process, click OK.  Once again, you need to confirm your decision and start the recovery process on the side panel, which displays the model and technical data of the device.  After launch, you must confirm your agreement with the provisions of the license.  The recovery procedure is not quick, during the recovery download a message may appear that the iPhone is not connecting to iTunes.  Do not take any action until the update download is complete.  Then put the device back into recovery mode and update the device firmware via iTunes.  As a result of the work done, you can again use your device.  Initially, it will be absolutely clean: applications, photos, contacts and more will disappear.  If you have a backup copy of this data, then a few minutes are enough - and your phone will become almost the same as it was before the password was forgotten.  If you are going to protect your personal information with a password again, then you should choose a number that is difficult to forget, or write the code in an ordinary notebook or computer file.  That's all we wanted to share in this material.  We hope that the information presented will be useful to readers and will help to resolve the difficulties encountered.
