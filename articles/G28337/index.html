    <p>  Saint-Paul-de-Vence is located on a hill, fifteen kilometers from Nice.  This is not a city, since the size of the settlement does not allow it to be called that, but it is not a village, because they don‚Äôt do this with culturally and historically significant places.  Locals and many tourists call this place the city of one street. </p><p>  Arose Saint-Paul-de-Vence (photo can be viewed above) at the turn of the 8th century.  In these times, coastal residents went to the mountains, tired of the raids of the Saracens.  There they built a home for themselves.  And in 1538 the settlement was fortified by Francis I. </p><p>  Saint-Paul-de-Vence is built up of small houses of 16-18 centuries, made of stone.  The facade or entrance of each is decorated with flowers in tubs and pots, as well as climbing plants.  The town is very fond of creative people.  Therefore, it is not at all surprising that most of the buildings are reserved for galleries or workshops of artists and sculptors.  At one time, celebrities such as Catherine Deneuve, Sophia Loren, Bridget Bardot, Jean-Paul Sartre, Yves Montand, Alain Delon, Marc Chagall stayed here.  The latter, by the way, spent the last years of his life here and rests at the local cemetery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Things to do? </h2>

The most famous is the only hotel "Golden Dove".  In it, artists of the 20th century loved to spend time, who often paid bills with their paintings.  Now within the walls of the hotel is a rich collection of scripts of popular artists.  Also, famous actors, writers, poets stayed here. </p><p>  In addition to the fact that various art objects are located on the streets of the town, there is also the Fund Mag Mag Gallery.  It contains collections of paintings, drawings, graphic works of the 20th century, sculptures.  There are permanent and temporary exhibitions. </p><p>  In the narrow streets you can find a horse statue made of horseshoes, several monuments and many fountains, next to which there will definitely be green spaces.  Also in Saint-Paul-de-Vence there is an old chapel of the Order of the White Penitents.  When you enter it, you get the feeling that you are in the past.  On the walls of the building are preserved frescoes by Giovanni Canavecio. </p><p>  The local cemetery deserves special attention.  As stated above, Marc Chagall rests here.  But not only that, it is popular.  A small area does not look depressing, as you might imagine the first time.  It's the other way round: the cemetery seemed to have become another platform for creativity. </p><h2>  Gastronomic tourism </h2>
