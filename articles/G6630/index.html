    <p>  So, the unique <span>identification number of</span> such a means of payment as a bank plastic card consists of 16 (and sometimes 18) digits.  If you look at the card number (where it is located - we will tell you later), you will not see the patterns in the numbers of which it consists.  Most likely, you will even think that this number is completely random.  But this is not so. </p><p>  In fact, card numbers consist of numbers arranged in a completely logical, conditional order.  In particular, the first 6 characters is a payment system (Visa, MasterCard), which services card transactions;  as well as the code of the bank that issued the plastic carrier.  Thus, knowing these figures, you can get information about the issuing bank and the <span>processing system</span> for the card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Next, in fact, are the numbers that are generated in such a way as to make it unique.  Although, if you look at the two cards issued together, you can see that their numbers are adjacent and go in order. </p>

    <h2>  Where is <span>the bank card number?</span> </h2><p>  So how do you know what card number you have, where it is and how to find it?  We tell in this section.  So, everything is very simple - you just need to pick up your card and turn it with your face to it.  So you will see what is shown on it from the "main" side (meaning the opposite side to the one on which there is a magnetic tape).  On it you will see the numbers stamped by stamping, creating a card number.  They are actually placed right in the center, and finding them is very simple. </p>

    <p>  With this number, you can make transactions on your card - accept money from other people on it and pay for your purchases (including on the Internet).  Therefore, in fact, the card number (where it is located, we assume you understand) is a part of <span>confidential information,</span> knowing which you can spend money from this payment instrument. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Find out the card number in other ways </h2><p>  By the way, you can get information about what your card number is in other ways, including without its physical presence.  You may need such data, for example, in case of loss of a card.  Then, so that no one can withdraw money from your account, you can call the bank and ask to block it, while naming its number. </p><p>  So, answering the question of where is the Maestro card number, let's call Internet banking, which today works with many banks.  Going into it under your account, you will immediately see a list of cards tied to you and your phone number.  There, in particular, there will be information about the room. </p>

    <p>  An alternative option is to contact the bank office.  So, employees of any department have access to the electronic database of their customers.  There you will find information about your accounts and cards.  Knowing where the Mastercard (or Visa) number of their customers is located, any bank employee will help you and inform you.  Just do not forget to present some document to identify your own personality. </p><p>  In addition, the card number can be seen in the agreement that you signed with the bank. </p><h2>  Bank account number </h2><p>  If you are looking for where the card number of Sberbank is located, please do not confuse this indicator with the account number. </p><p>  This is completely different data that is attached to your bank account as another means of payment that allows you to accumulate and spend money.  In fact, a plastic card is attached to the account and is an electronic key to access it.  But card and account numbers will be different. </p><p>  In addition, losing a card, you will receive a new one with an updated number.  In this case, <span>the account number</span> will remain the same.  It‚Äôs a little harder to see where the card account number is.  About this in the next section. </p><h2>  How to find out the account number? </h2>

    <p>  So, the ways to find out your bank account identifier are about the same as with a card.  Only on the plastic card itself, of course, such a number will not be indicated - this is unreasonable. </p><p>  You can see it in the contract for servicing a bank account, which you sign when you first contact a financial institution.  You can also find it in some online banking (as a rule, these are the most advanced banking institutions). </p><h2>  Why do I need a card number? </h2><p>  You ask: "Why know the card number?"  We answer: "To perform all operations with her."  Simply put, there are two types of operations - accrual and write-off.  Accordingly, by the card number (as, by the way, of the account), the client can receive funds from his counterparties.  Only in this way, by a unique number, you can find it and send money. </p><p>  As for the write-off of funds, the procedure here is somewhat more complicated.  In this case, of course, the number also serves for identification, however, in addition to it (and where you already know the number of the Sberbank card number), you also need to provide other security parameters.  This is the CVV code (not all plastic carriers have it) and the date on which the card is valid.  Knowing these three parameters, you can withdraw any amount of funds, even from someone else's card.  Therefore, you must understand their importance. </p><p>  CVV-code is a three-digit number that not every card has, but it is located on the back of the plastic (under the magnetic tape).  Validity is four digits separated by a slash.  They show how long the asset card is.  This characteristic looks, for example, like this: 02/23.  This means that the card is valid until February 2023. </p>

    <h2>  Remember safety! </h2><p>  So, describing the parameters of bank cards (including the issue number of the card, where it is located, as well as other parameters and their location), do not forget their main purpose - access to funds on the account!  Accordingly, if you leave this data somewhere and they fall into the hands of fraudsters - do not be surprised when you suddenly lose all the funds that are on the card! </p><p>  Be careful about everything.  Starting from simple sites of online stores and services where you can pay by card, to calls from supposedly ‚ÄúSecurity services of your bank‚Äù - be vigilant.  Of course, in fact, the security service will not call you and ask for the card data;  as for services and sites, we recommend that you use only the most reliable and reputable ones, on which data cannot be leaked ‚Äúto the side‚Äù. </p>
