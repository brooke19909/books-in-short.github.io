This is common practice for any operating system.  In this article we will talk about the error code 805a8011 Windows Phone: how to fix, causes and effects of the error.  This article is recommended for novice smartphone users working with the Windows operating system. </p><h2>  Causes of the error </h2><p>  The reasons may be different.  Since this operating system is not as popular as its Android and OS X counterparts, some errors may not be known for years until some application developer accidentally activates it.  If you are already a developer yourself, we recommend that you go to the next paragraph of the article, where we tell you how to fix Windows Phone error code 805a8011. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.sqlauthority.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="error 805a8011" class="if uuid-2355388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2355388.jpg"></div><p>  The causes of this error may include the following: </p><ol><li>  The Internet only works through Internet Explorer. </li><li>  WhatsApp cannot connect to the network, or it takes a very long time to load. </li><li>  There is no way to update the software or use at least some of the services of the Microsoft online application store. </li><li>  There is no way to go to email and SMS. </li></ol><h2>  How to fix error code 805a8011?  Windows Phone: Store </h2><p>  As already mentioned, this item is especially useful for beginning developers, therefore, after reading the instructions below, you can draw certain conclusions, and then through Debug look exactly what function is the cause of the error. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The error correction is performed as follows: </p><ol><li>  Check the date and time for compliance with reality.  Connecting to a secure server, the device synchronizes with it.  Thus, if the date and time are set incorrectly, this may be one of the causes of the error.  To do this, you must manually set the parameters, and not synchronize them over the network. </li><li>  Connect to another network.  Seeing the error code 805a8011, you just need to replace one network with another.  That is, use other Wi-Fi or mobile Internet. </li><li>  Clear the memory.  This error sometimes occurs due to the small memory on the device.  To do this, you must delete any files.  The main thing: for the full functioning of the device, you must leave at least 150 megabytes of empty memory. </li><li>  Set up a profile.  An empty profile can also lead to an error.  To do this, you need to log in to your personal account from a personal computer by filling out a larger number of fields, and also give consent to the license agreement. </li><li>  Sync account.  This action must be performed manually, following the sequence: ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúMail and Accounts‚Äù, - press the button and do not release until the process begins. </li><li>  Go to your new account.  To do this, connect the phone to the Internet, open a browser and go to the Mail.live.com page, after which you need to register a new account.  After creating an account, go to "Settings"&gt; "Mail and Accounts" and click on "Add Email".  The last step is to activate a new account, and then enter the username and password. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="windows-phone-7.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="application store" class="if uuid-2357000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2357000.jpg"></div><h2>  How to fix Windows Phone error code 805a8011 if previous methods did not help </h2><p>  If a positive result cannot be achieved after the above methods have been tried, the most radical remains.  Soft reset will help restore factory settings.  The advantage of this method is the fact that all your personal data will remain.  To do this, you must simultaneously press and hold two function keys - volume down, as well as power.  Using this method, be sure to check the time zone settings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is also a software reset method.  To perform this action, go to "Settings"&gt; "Phone Information", click on the "Reset All Settings" button and agree to the warning that appears.  In conclusion, we set up the phone, as when buying. </p><p>  A hard reset is the roughest and most unwanted way to resolve error 805a8011.  Using this method, it should be borne in mind that all information will be erased.  To save it, you need to back up the data. </p><p>  To perform a hard reset, you need to turn off the phone while holding the function key with the ‚Äú-‚Äù icon.  We also recommend connecting a power source.  The system will display an exclamation mark, which assumes that the following actions are performed in strict order: up volume function button&gt; volume down button&gt; power button&gt; function button to decrease the volume.  Having completed this procedure, we are waiting for the full launch of the phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thurrott.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="line of phones on windows" class="if uuid-2350919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2350919.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  These are all ways that can help you fix the 805a8011 error.  We think that you have found the necessary method here that helped you fix problems with the phone.  We also strongly recommend updating the firmware of your smartphone, because with each new version, certain system vulnerabilities disappear. </p>
