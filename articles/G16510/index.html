They are responsible not only for <span>skin elasticity,</span> but also support the structure of internal organs.  Today, collagen is also actively used in cosmetology.  Thanks to this, the skin looks younger and more attractive.  In our article you can find more detailed information about collagen fibers and their functions. </p><h2>  General information about collagen fibers </h2><p>  Collagen fibers are a <span>fibrillar protein.</span>  It is one of the components of the connective tissue of the body.  Fibers provide her with elasticity and strength.  They are present in all multicellular animals.  Collagen fibers are absent in plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms. </p><p>  Collagen fiber is the most common protein in mammals.  Its content in the body ranges from 25%.  The product of collagen denaturation is gelatin. </p><p>  The function of collagen fibers plays an important role in women's lives.  It's no secret that they are more worried about their appearance than the males.  Due to the high fiber content, you can slow down the aging process and get rid of some wrinkles.  They are also used in many areas of our life, namely in the food industry, cosmetology, science and medicine. </p><h2>  Fiber synthesis </h2><p>  The synthesis of collagen fibers is a complex process that proceeds in the presence of a sufficient amount of vitamins and minerals.  It passes in fibroblast.  One of the most important points in the process is the hydroxylation reaction, which allows you to continue the further process of collagen formation.  The catalyst is specific enzymes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="collagen fibers" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1497997.jpg"></div>

In this case, the so-called abnormal collagen will form.  By its consistency, it is more loose.  Such synthesis may be the cause of scurvy. </p><p>  Collagen, elastin fibers are the basis of the skin.  The first stops producing enzymes at the age of 20-25 years, and the second at 13-14 years.  After this, the skin does not recover, the aging process begins.  However, today there is a huge number of cosmetics, which include collagen.  Thanks to them, you can partially restore the skin and get rid of superficial wrinkles. </p><h2>  Fiber formation </h2><p>  The formation of collagen fibers is regulated by procollagen peptidases.  Such molecules are not capable of spontaneous formation.  For the formation of fibers, preliminary cleavage of the N- and C-terminal peptides is necessary.  It follows that the formation of collagen fibers coincides with the formation of fibrin filaments.  In these two processes, the main condition is specific proteolytic cleavage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="collagen fiber synthesis" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1497998.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Collagen fiber is formed in the extracellular fluid near the surface of the fibroblast, but in no case inside it.  This is due to the fact that procollagen peptidases are located outside the cell.  Final peptides inhibit untimely protein formation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fiber composition </h2><p>  Collagen fibers are composed of fibrils and include a specific protein - collagen.  They are extremely durable and have the ability to swell.  More than 10 types of collagen protein are distinguished depending on the location of amino acids in the polypeptide chains, as well as on the quality of the carbohydrate component.  These varieties are included not only in the composition of collagen fibers, but also in the basement membranes of epithelial and cartilage tissues, as well as other structures.  With the development of certain pathological processes, collagen can decompose.  In this regard, it enters the bloodstream. </p><p>  The composition of collagen fibers also includes: </p><ul><li>  arginine; </li><li>  leucine; </li><li>  valine; </li><li>  serine; </li><li>  tyrosine and other beneficial substances. </li></ul><h2>  Fiber aging </h2><p>  Collagen fibers age over time.  This is an inevitable process that cannot be stopped.  It affects all aspects of life.  Disability gradually decreases, health and well-being worsen, and a significant change in appearance occurs. </p><p>  Aging of collagen fibers causes a change in the skin at the age of 33-35 years.  In this regard, wrinkles appear.  Modern rejuvenation procedures and plastic surgery can significantly slow down this process.  However, they are quite expensive.  The duration of the effect of such procedures is individual.  Unfortunately, they are not suitable for some.  According to the results of a study conducted by experts, some people have an excess of collagen of the third type.  Because of this, they are predisposed to early aging.  Rejuvenation procedures performed will have a short-term effect. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is no secret that with age a person can hardly reach the floor with his fingertips without bending his knees.  This is due to the fact that over time the amplitude of flexion of the spine and limbs decreases.  The limiter of the degree of stretching is collagen.  It protects tissue from overstretching, as well as damage to blood vessels and nerves.  Experts recommend regular exercise, regardless of age.  They argue that this will improve collagen fibers and feel as good as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="collagen fibers of the skin" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1498006.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Collagen fiber recovery </h2><p>  For many years, specialists from all over the world have been wanting to create the ideal substance that will allow you to restore collagen fibers.  A similar function has ascorbic acid, peptides and plant extracts.  They are actively used to create special creams and masks.  However, such a composition does not give a 100% result.  Scientists have learned to break down the molecules of these components and enclose them in special formulations.  Due to this, the substance passes through the epidermis. </p><p>  Today, anyone can buy a cosmetic product, which includes collagen fibers.  However, experts argue that in this case, the molecules are large and not able to penetrate the skin in order to restore the amount of collagen in the body.  The positive qualities of such a tool can only be attributed to the fact that it moisturizes the upper layer of the cover. </p><p>  To prevent the aging process and restore collagen levels, experts recommend injections.  Thus, the protein is delivered deep into the skin and has a positive effect on its condition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="collagen elastin fibers" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1498013.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In order to slow down the aging process that occurs due to the cessation of the production of enzymes by collagen fibers, it is necessary to lead a healthy lifestyle.  Five enemies of collagen fibers are known: </p><ul><li>  smoking; </li><li>  alcohol; </li><li>  stress; </li><li>  insufficient hydration of the skin; </li><li>  excessive ultraviolet. </li></ul><h2>  Proper nutrition for collagen production </h2><p>  Nutrition plays an important role in collagen production.  It is important to give preference only to high-quality, healthy and fresh products.  This is due to the fact that collagen fibers are formed from a number of amino acids that enter the body only with proteins.  Their lack can affect the condition of the skin, nails and hair. </p><p>  Eating foods that are rich in proteins helps build a complete collagen molecule.  This can explain the change in the skin condition of those girls who often resort to a wide variety of diets. </p><p>  Amino acids that enter the body along with protein allow the body to form its own collagen.  However, if at least one amino acid is deficient, the process of fiber formation is suspended.  Gradually, hair begins to fall out, the skin fades, and the nails become brittle. </p><h2>  Which foods should be preferred for collagen production? </h2><p>  Not all products can help restore collagen fibers.  The most valuable product is fish and seafood.  Salmon is especially useful.  It contains omega-3 fatty acids in its composition, and is also rich in natural collagen.  Any cosmetologist knows that sea fish is a source of health, beauty and youth.  It must be included in the regular diet.  Shrimps, crabs, oysters, mussels and sea kale have the same properties.  Thanks to these products, you can not only restore collagen fibers, but also get rid of iodine deficiency. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="collagen fiber formation" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1498015.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Another valuable product is turkey meat.  Thanks to it, the production of collagen fibers is stabilized and their premature destruction is prevented.  Few people know, but pork and beef slow down the formation of collagen.  That is why it is recommended to give preference to a turkey. </p><p>  It is no secret that vegetables are extremely beneficial for the body.  They are a source of a variety of vitamins and minerals.  To restore collagen fibers, it is important to give preference to green vegetables.  In addition, they will normalize metabolic processes.  Also, the condition of the skin improves with the use of apples, carrots and tomatoes. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to products that contain vitamin C. It is the main stimulant on which the elasticity of the skin depends.  Vitamin C is found in oranges, tangerines, apricots, lemons and peaches. </p><h2>  Collagen Injection </h2><p>  Collagen injections are becoming more and more popular every year.  The cost of this procedure depends on the type of collagen used.  There are three types of substance: </p><ol><li>  Animal.  It is obtained from cattle hides.  It is believed that this is the most dangerous and ineffective type of collagen.  It can cause a serious allergic reaction. </li><li>  Vegetable.  It is obtained biotechnologically from wheat proteins.  Such collagen does not cause allergic reactions.  It is used in luxury cosmetics and has a high cost. </li><li>  Nautical.  The molecules of this collagen are similar to those produced by the human body.  It is affordable, but in some cases can cause an allergic reaction. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="collagen fiber aging" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1498019.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  Collagen Fibers and Medicine </h2><p>  Collagen fibers of the skin play an important role in human life.  Scientists have proved that a violation of collagen synthesis in the body is the basis of many hereditary diseases.  The main manifestations of such diseases include: </p><ul><li>  damage to the ligamentous apparatus; </li><li>  cartilage damage; </li><li>  the presence of heart valve defects. </li></ul><p>  Diseases caused by defects in collagen biosynthesis occur due to a variety of reasons.  They may be associated with mutations in the genes or collagen modification errors.  Another reason is the lack of enzymes.  To combat such diseases, it is necessary to normalize their number. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="collagen fiber composition" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1498021.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Almost everyone wants to slow down the aging process.  However, not everyone knows what it is connected with and how to deal with it.  Today there is a huge amount of collagen cosmetics.  When purchasing them, it is important to pay attention to the composition.  Collagen fibers, which are included in a particular product, can not always guarantee a 100% result.  To restore collagen in the body, we recommend that you exercise regularly and consume only quality food.  Thanks to this, collagen fibers will function to the maximum benefit for the body, and your skin will remain supple and attractive for as long as possible. </p>
