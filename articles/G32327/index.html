Someone gets here for the first time, someone travels for many years, but very often the routes of both of them intersect at specific points on the map.  Everyone goes to the Admiralty, to the Winter Palace, to Nevsky Prospekt, visits the most famous bridges, defends huge lines at some museums, while others (no less interesting) remain a bit in the shade. </p><h2>  King's gift </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.peterburg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Menshikov Palace - side view" class="if uuid-2285173" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2285173.jpg"></div><p>  One of these historical places is the Menshikov Palace - a rather simple building in comparison with the buildings of Palace Square, Tsarskoye Selo and Peterhof, but no less interesting from the inside.  Once, at the time of laying the foundation of St. Petersburg, this building seemed an inadmissible luxury and often caught the sidelong glances.  At the time of its construction, there was not a single building of this kind in the city - there simply was nothing to erect on them.  However, Peter I generously endowed his favorite - Alexander Danilovich Menshikov. </p><p>  In our article you will learn (or maybe discover from a new perspective) about the Menshikov Palace located on Vasilyevsky Island: a bit of history, interesting facts, working hours, as well as excursions that are held here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A bit of history about the wooden building of the palace </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pantv.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drawing of the Menshikov Palace" class="if uuid-2285166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2285166.jpg"></div><p>  A few years before the construction of the Menshikov Palace, a wooden palace was located next to this place, the structure of which was erected since 1704 and often underwent changes - the territory had to be reliably protected from the continued small raids of the Swedes, who still claimed land.  The final decoration was completed only in the 1710th year.  The building had a U-shaped plan, two floors, a high porch leading directly to the second level, and the main entrance in the form of a specially excavated Neva canal, there was also a pool in front of the entrance.  The construction was the first in a series of buildings for dignitaries of higher ranks, the best masters worked on it, including the famous architects: the elder Rastrelli and Trezzini (indirectly). </p><h2>  The new palace building </h2><div class="photo" data-original="samsebeturist.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Menshikov Palace inside" class="if uuid-2285176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2285176.jpg"></div><p>  In the 1710-1720s, construction of a new palace took place on Vasilievsky Island, on Universitetskaya Embankment 15, which Peter I handed over as a gift to his favorite - Alexander Danilovich Menshikov, who at that time became the first <span>governor of St. Petersburg.</span>  This building was already three-story, has survived to the present day and has become a repository for many paintings, statues, silk paintings and other works of art.  On the ground floor office premises and workshops were equipped, and on the second floor the family of Prince Menshikov was located. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Alas, the royal favorite did not last long to live in his luxurious house at that time.  After a series of intrigues and conspiracies, Prince Menshikov was exiled to the Tobolsk province.  After the incident, the palace in a short time turned into a warehouse, and in 1731 the building was transferred to the disposal of the land gentry cadet corps.  During this period, the palace was rebuilt for the needs of the Cadets: they changed the facade, gave it a less luxurious, but more harmonious look. </p><h2>  Capital restoration </h2><p>  For the first time, the Menshikov Palace underwent a major restoration at the end of the 19th century, then, until 1966, the building was only slightly renovated, but it was not taken up for anything.  In 1966, yet another large-scale work on a <span>historical monument of</span> architecture began.  After <span>restoration, the mansion</span> was returned to its original form, and the complex itself was transferred to the custody of the State Hermitage Museum.  In 1981, the Menshikov Palace Museum was opened in the building, where the beautiful interiors of that time, household items, armor, clothes, works of art and many wonderful things of masterful work are carefully preserved. </p><h2>  Menshikov Palace.  Mode of operation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="deletant.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inside the Menshikov Palace" class="if uuid-2285143" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2285143.jpg"></div><p>  Monday is a day off at the Menshikov Palace. </p><p>  On Tuesday, Thursday and on weekends the museum is open from 10:30 to 18:00 (tickets at the box office can be purchased until 17:00). </p><p>  On Wednesdays and Fridays - from 10:30 to 21:10 (ticket office is open until 21:00). </p><p>  The museum‚Äôs timetable allows you to enjoy the beautiful at a convenient time for you, most importantly - do not forget that the ticket office closes an hour earlier. </p><h2>  Ticket price </h2><p>  The Menshikov <span>Palace in St. Petersburg</span> has a system of benefits.  Pensioners of the Russian Federation, as well as children, students and schoolchildren (regardless of citizenship) can visit the museum for free. </p><p>  An adult ticket to the palace will cost you 300 rubles. </p><p>  And every month on the first Thursday and the seventh of December the museum opens its doors to all comers - any visitor can go for free. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="spbhi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Menshikov Palace in St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2285153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2285153.jpg"></div><p>  - In St. Petersburg, the Menshikov Palace was built for so long because of the capricious nature of its owner, Prince Menshikov.  In the process of building the building constantly had to change something to cater to all the whims of the customer, who was eventually exiled to Siberia. </p><p>  - The palace building is one of the few administrative and residential buildings of the city that have survived since the founding of St. Petersburg. </p><p>  - Menshikov Palace is a real treasure in terms of introducing new technologies in construction and using various expensive materials or imitating them in the interior.  Here, many rooms are devoted to the marine theme, there are halls decorated with tiles on the water theme, and an office lined with expensive wood species, resembling a cabin on a historic ship, and much more. </p><p>  - All interiors have been carefully restored, guarded and maintained in good condition to this day. </p><h2>  Menshikov Palace.  Excursions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.culture.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Menshikov Palace in St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2285159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2285159.jpg"></div><p>  If you are interested in history, want to know more about the era of Peter and the palace interiors, it might be worth taking a tour of the Menshikov Palace. </p><p>  It so happened that excursions around the Menshikov Palace are possible only with pre-submitted applications, but this is not a big problem - you can always cross your guide at the entrance, arrange a time with him or leave a request on the website and find out about the possibility of holding an event in specific day.  A lecture on the history of the palace, its inhabitants and interiors lasts about an hour on average.
