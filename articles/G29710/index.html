For this, they come here.  After all, Tunisia is white sand by the sea, it is the magnificent ruins of Carthage, it is healing with the help of the sea and wraps, called thalassotherapy.  Of course, in luxury this country can not be compared with Turkey and even Egypt, but still there are many lovers of relaxation in Tunisia.  These are mainly Europeans who come here because of the cheap sea and procedures.  Let‚Äôs try and take a closer look at this country, its hotel fund, and, using the Ecosol Houria Palace 4 as an example, find out how to relax in Tunisia and whether it is worth choosing this hotel.  Let's start with a review of housing. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ecosol houria palace 4" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/622476.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  Hotels in Tunisia </h2><p>  In truth, the hotel fund of the country's resorts often leaves much to be desired.  Hotels here are mostly not very new, most of them were built in the nineties of the last century.  Their territory is small, although often very green and attractive.  If you come for a chic vacation, then you will have a very long time to figure out where such <span>Tunis hotels</span> are located <span>.</span>  The first line of the sea, however, almost all built up in resort areas.  There are "Five" among them, but they can be counted on the fingers in each resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe country.  Most of the hotels demanded by tourists are the ‚Äúfours‚Äù.  Despite the fact that all beaches here are municipal, many first-line hotels have their own land plots allocated only for their guests.  It is interesting that "treshki", as a rule, charge guests for sun loungers and umbrellas, while the "fours" do not.  On the other hand, 3 star hotels often have chic parks.  They say that they were built when the land was cheap.  And now even the "fives" envy their territories.  It can be said that Ecosol Houria Palace 4 Sousse is a typical four-star hotel for relaxing on the sea.  Only he combines the features of a city and beach hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ecosol houria palace 4 reviews" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/622468.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tunisia, Sousse </h2><p>  This is a fairly democratic resort, at least compared to Hammamet.  Most hotels here have three or four stars.  Although it is precisely in this resort area that the most luxurious ‚Äúfives‚Äù with modern thalassotherapy centers are concentrated.  In the center of Sousse is a beautifully preserved medieval quarter that is worth a visit.  The best photographs can be taken from the height of the Khalifa Tower, from where everything can be seen, clearly.  In Medina there are ancient mosques, a fortress, and even catacombs, where the first Christians hid.  In the new city there are many clubs, cafes and discos, almost as many as in Hammamet.  Municipal beaches are very crowded because it is cheaper to live and eat in Sousse. </p><p>  Mostly tourists settle in the new resort suburb of Port El Kantaoui.  It is here that our Ecosol Auria Palace Hotel is located.  This place is considered the most respectable and safe area in the district, there is a very beautiful nature.  And the local beaches are the best on the whole Tunisian coast.  The yacht port, from which this suburb got its name, is very busy.  There are the best fish restaurants, as well as diving centers.  Souvenirs are usually bought here. </p><h2>  Ecosol Houria Palace 4 (Tunisia) Location </h2><p>  This hotel, as we have already mentioned, is located in the center of the resort area called Port El Kantaoui, which is six kilometers from the Medina of Sousse, to the north.  It is also not very far from the airports.  There are about thirty kilometers to Monastir, and twenty-eight to Enfida.  The hotel is located right next to the water park.  Its location is very good for walking.  With a leisurely step you can walk to the picturesque port for yachts.  There you can ride pleasure boats.  To the beach - a couple of hundred meters.  Near Hannibal Park with attractions and a musical fountain with lighting, as well as shopping streets with many shops, a disco "Platinum", a cafe with very reasonable prices.  To visit the clubs and discos of Sousse (especially the most popular of them, ‚ÄúBora Bora‚Äù), you will need to use taxi services.  And during the day you can take a special tourist trip. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ecosol houria palace 4 sousse" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/622477.jpg" width="350"></div>
