Recently, this direction has been very popular among Russians.  And this is not surprising: sandy and small-pebble beaches, combined with the resort resorts of Kos Island, which are buried in verdure and numerous historical sights, including ancient castles, become indisputable pluses when choosing a place for relaxation.  Another advantage is the developed tourist infrastructure, as well as the availability of numerous hotels from which you can choose the most convenient for the cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sooveign beach 4" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1424822.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The second most popular place on the island after the city of Kos itself, where Russians prefer to buy tours, is Kardamena.  There are many hotels of various categories, an abundance of bars and taverns.  In general, Kardamena on the island is considered the center of nightlife.  Bars, clubs and taverns are open all night.  Moreover, many of them are not only in no way inferior to the capital's counterparts, but sometimes even better than the latter. </p><p>  Kardamena itself is a fairly small town with interesting streets.  Blue balconies and carved shutters on the windows, bushes of grapes crawling along the walls of the houses, a small church with an azure roof, numerous taverns - all this creates an amazing atmosphere that tourists like so much.  And, of course, there are a lot of hotels in the city, among which Sovereign Beach 4 * (Greece, Kardamena) is not the last.  Kos, being a relatively small island, receives about four hundred thousand tourists every year, most of which stop on its southern coast.  It is here that Kardamena is located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Sovereign Beach 4 *: description </h2><p>  Built in 2000, this tourist complex annually receives several thousand guests, including from our country.  This is greatly facilitated by its good location and the infrastructure corresponding to the declared category. </p><p>  Sovereign Beach <span>Hotel 4 *</span> is located on the first line from the sea.  Nearby are many entertainment facilities: a water park, taverns and bars.  The center of the resort town of Kardamena, where life begins at night, is only two kilometers away.  In addition, those who choose this hotel can independently visit the famous Asklepion and the national museum.  The last overhaul in Sovereign Beach 4 * was carried out in 2014.  It was at this time that the furniture was updated and the plumbing was completely replaced in the rooms. </p><h2>  Justification of choice </h2><p>  The indisputable advantage of this hotel is the maximum proximity to the international airport of the island of Kos - only ten kilometers.  I must say that some find this a drawback, because sometimes the sound of aircraft going to land is heard.  But those who come to this hotel with small children consider this fact a plus, since the transfer time to the hotel complex is minimized.  And this is undoubtedly very convenient, because the kids do not tolerate the long road. </p><p>  Sovereign Beach 4 * has a small area, fully planted with lush greenery.  It has everything you need not only for family, but also for a romantic getaway.  The hotel, judging by the reviews, is an ideal option so that tourists can completely relax and disconnect from the hustle and bustle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="playroom for children" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1424832.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Those who come from the Sovereign Beach 4 * hotel remember for a long time all those attractions that they managed to see and photograph.  Around the small town of Kardamena, you can see several ancient ruins at once: the castle of the Order of St. John, the Temple of Apollo and a small ancient theater.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Those who stayed at this hotel complex were mostly satisfied with the services provided.  Many liked the bungalow rooms.  The Russians especially note the delicious food provided by the chef.  Mussels, shrimps, fish, grilled octopuses, a variety of meat and chicken - everything is cooked deliciously at home.  Very well equipped and a playroom for children. </p><p>  There is some dissatisfaction with the small number of seats in the pool bar and the lack of hygiene products in the rooms.  As for the beach, it is sandy and very comfortable.  Many tourists express their special gratitude to the team of animators who occupy the guests from morning till night.  Summing up, we can say that this hotel is great for families. </p>
