    <p>  The lack of a headset in the kit is not the only drawback that owners of the LG Spirit H422 smartphone complain.  Reviews often affect the much-praised performance and speed of the device - far from always users can agree that the gadget is really ‚Äúsmart‚Äù.  After three to four months of use, the smartphone begins to "slow down", freeze and reboot itself.  However, this scourge does not pass any budget smartphone.  Users also note that the claimed convenience due to the curved case does not live up to expectations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Advantages of the LG Spirit H422 model </h2>

    <p>  Most smartphone owners note a representative and yet unusual design.  The black model is especially in demand - LG Spirit H422 Black Titan.  Reviews clearly emphasize the solidity of the model, which masks the "budget" of the gadget.  This color is popular with both women and men.  White color is usually chosen by girls and women, those who like to show off and ‚Äúshow off‚Äù in society will choose LG H422 Spirit Titan Gold.  The reviews also praise the new function of shooting with a gesture of the hand - the inconvenience associated with taking a selfie simply disappeared. </p><h2>  In-cell touch display </h2><p>  The most common and annoying annoyance for the gadget owner is a sudden breakdown of the display screen due to mechanical damage.  Often human negligence leads to sad consequences - cracks on the screen make the smartphone unusable, since the touchscreen no longer accepts user commands.  The phone has to be returned to the repair shop, which, of course, is very inappropriate - sometimes the repair of such devices is almost more expensive than their cost.  Budget phones are often not subject to repair at all, since ordering parts and the volume of work itself are incomparably more costly.  However, cracks on the screen are no longer a problem for those who choose the LG Spirit H422.  Owners' feedback on In-cell touch technology is unambiguously positive - if there are cracks on the screen due to a fall or impact, the phone screen still functions and responds to user commands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  RearKey Control Button </h2>

    <p>  When considering smartphones of the LG Spirit H422 Titan line, buyers may involuntarily feel that the device is large and heavy, because the titans from Greek mythology were creatures of very impressive sizes.  Thin and weightless gadgets have recently been valued much higher, which is why some buyers are initially confused by the name of the smartphone LG Spirit H422 - "titanium".  The reviews nevertheless make it clear that such a train of thought is erroneous.  <span>The control button</span> located on the back of the smartphone eliminates the need for side buttons, which makes the device thinner and more compact.  Despite the seeming unusualness, the usability of such a button is not criticized. </p><h2>  Knock code </h2>

    <p>  The security problem very often worries the owners of smartphones, because if the device falls into the wrong hands, valuable information can irrevocably go to third parties.  Standard codes on Android devices often, with due diligence, can be cracked.  LG also offered a completely new method of blocking smartphones - Knock code.  Unlike standard smartphone unlock schemes, the Knock code system has hundreds of times more combinations.  Hacking such a system is much more difficult than standard, since it is almost impossible to find the right combination of taps. </p><h2>  Accessories for the LG Spirit H422 </h2><p>  The most popular accessory for any smartphone is a case.  It is the case that can protect the screen from cracks and scratches, soften the drop, and also give the gadget a unique look.  For the LG Spirit H422 model, you can purchase an original case that will not only decorate your smartphone, but also make it more functional - on the back of the QUICK CIRCLE case there is a special round window that allows quick access to the 6 most used applications.  The style and taste of the owner of the gadget will emphasize the soft backlight around the quick access panel on the case. </p><h2>  Dual Sim feature in LG Spirit H422 </h2><p>  For several years, phones and smartphones with the ability to install two or more SIM cards have not left the shelves.  Nevertheless, a greater number of budget smartphones hardly support the claimed function - one of the slots for SIM cards is necessarily floundering or does not work at all.  One exception to this rule is the LG Spirit H422.  Reviews about the device mostly praise the smooth operation of both SIM cards. </p><h2>  Photos with the LG Spirit H422 </h2>

    <p>  In recent years, the most important function of a smartphone is the ability to take selfies, that is, own photos without the help of outsiders.  To do this, any gadget has a front camera.  However, often budget smartphones equipped with it do not contribute to the creation of good pictures - in poor lighting, photos turn out to be dark, plain and dull.  <span>The front camera</span> with flash is a huge plus for budget smartphones in the LG Spirit line, especially for the solid and sought-after LG Spirit H422 Black Titan.  The reviews confirm the quality and brightness of pictures taken with the front camera, as well as ease of use. </p><h2>  Hand gesture </h2><p>  More than once, users of gadgets have encountered such a problem as blurry pictures on the front camera.  When trying to capture an exciting moment, the owners of smartphones received low-quality photos: unsuccessful movement of the body or eyes, an impatient partner, unexpectedly distracting a relative - it would seem natural life situations, but nevertheless after this the frames have to be re-shot, since they are hopelessly corrupted.  Similar problems were provided by the developers of the LG Spirit H422 Black Titan model.  The absolute majority of reviews about the hand-held shooting function are positive - just leave the gadget in a stable position, wave your hand and take an ideal position for a selfie - in a few seconds the device will do everything for the user. </p><h2>  Fakes model LG Spirit H422 </h2><p>  It's no secret that smartphones of popular brands very often are faked and copied, despite all the warnings.  Unfortunately, the fate of the copied gadget did not pass by the LG Spirit H422 Black Titan smartphone.  Reviews often indirectly or directly indicate the possibility of running into a fake.  How to avoid problems with the acquisition of a popular brand? </p><ul><li>  You should make purchases in verified and officially registered trade organizations, avoiding ‚Äúflea‚Äù markets and dubious persons selling goods without a license. </li><li>  The brand name of the sold phone model must strictly correspond to the full name indicated by the manufacturer.  Do not trust advertisements if, for example, the LG Spirit H422 Black smartphone is put up for sale in them.  Reviews of defective and counterfeit models, unfortunately, confirm the need for attention to the selection of goods.  However, the device may well have alternative names for other countries.  For example, the same smartphone model in Ukraine appears on sellers' websites like LG Spirit Dual Y70 H422 - reviews about a gadget with this name can only be found on domains with Ukrainian addresses. </li><li>  In no case should you save time and be lazy to check the device at the place of purchase.  If obvious malfunctions are found on the spot, the buyer does not have to go through long quests to return low-quality equipment and prove to the seller that it was not his fault that he was to blame.  In most cases, consultants at points of sale, desiring to fulfill the sales plan, forget about the needs of customers and are extremely reluctant to respond to requests for a full audit, so perseverance in this matter is a question of tens of thousands of rubles.  This is especially true for budget smartphones - very often the seller can try to convince that inexpensive devices will be ‚Äúbuggy" in any case.  Do not forget that such malfunctions can occur with cheap gadgets six months to a year after purchase, but not immediately after unpacking. </li></ul><p>  Buying a budget device can be almost more expensive than purchasing an expensive smartphone, if you approach the matter at random.  A careful study of reviews is exactly the step from which you should always start the buying process.  Much more worth trusting is not positive, but negative reviews about the product, since, most likely, they carry the truth in themselves.  In the case of an unconscious attitude to the purchase of a ‚Äúcombat comrade‚Äù and your own rights as a buyer, overpayments and loss of time will not take long. </p>
