Modern enterprises do not provide apartments for length of service, as it was during the time of our parents, respectively, you will have to earn your own housing on your own.  Of course, choosing an apartment for ourselves, we are based primarily on our budget, and then we want to fit into it the convenience and comfort of accommodation.  An apartment is a serious and long-term purchase, in most cases made for a lifetime, which is why it is necessary to be more demanding.  Let's go to Yaroslavl.  LCD "Sosnovy Bor" - a project that attracted a lot of attention immediately after the presentation.  Our task is to make its most complete and objective review within the framework of this material. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  The Sosnovy Bor residential complex (Yaroslavl) is a vivid example of a modern low-rise building project.  Such projects are becoming more popular day by day, as they save residents from many neighbors, endowing them with the charms of suburban life.  Several multi-sectional three-story buildings made of brick will be an excellent option for those who have long dreamed of a quiet, calm and measured life surrounded by greenery of nature.  Location in an ecologically clean area, as well as the minimum number of apartments per floor - this is how the dream complex looks like for many modern residents of the metropolis. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krasnybor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslavl LCD pine forest" class="if uuid-3181671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181671.jpg"></div><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The construction of the Sosnovy Bor residential complex (Yaroslavl) is being led by the construction company Cosmos, which is quite well-known in the local real estate market.

All those who have already managed to get to know him better noted the spacious kitchens where they can gather all their households and meet guests, the presence of a wardrobe and glazed loggias, where you can organize a full-fledged workplace or set up a "winter garden".  Each planning decision is carefully thought out and organized in such a way that residents can use every square meter of the area, realize any design.  There are only six apartments on each staircase - you can easily make contact with your neighbors, maybe make friends.  In such low-rise buildings there will never be a sensation of ‚Äúanthill‚Äù, where the neighbors on the floor are not even familiar with each other.

Negative reviews about ZhK Sosnovy Bor (Yaroslavl) - about transport accessibility.  In practice, getting to the city center is still convenient only for those who have personal transport.  On a public road turns into real torment.  However, the developer assured that by the time the construction is completed this problem will be solved, additional public transport routes will be launched in the direction of the complex </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Definitely, Sosnovy Bor residential complex (Yaroslavl) is a successful project, where all the necessary conditions for the life of modern people are created.
