    <h2>  Two gifts in one </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself candy bouquets have become especially popular in recent years.  This is a very beautiful and special idea for a small gift.  Especially for those who love flowers and sweets.  So why not surprise your loved one by combining these two elements together?  This is an incredibly simple, but at the same time original idea.  For example, small teddy bears in a bouquet also look very cute, which is also not new.  It is doubly pleasant that it is not at all necessary to go to a special salon to purchase them.  You can make this tidbit bouquet without leaving your home.  This is really great, because you do not need to spend a lot of money, since the prices for materials at hand are quite reasonable.  As for the effect produced, it is much more than from an ordinary bouquet and a box of chocolates. </p><h2>  Universal gift </h2><p>  Such a gift is truly universal.  Fresh flowers will fade, and this work of art will bring joy to its owners for a long time, of course, if the sweet tooth has willpower and does not eat everything in one sitting.  The optimal combination of soulfulness and good energy makes this surprise suitable for everyone.  If everything is correctly formalized, then this will be an unforgettable event not only for women and children, but also for the strong half of humanity.  It is not necessary to be a new-fashioned florist to try to compose a composition for February 23 in the form of a flower tank with a pipe in the form of a bottle of cognac or a gold champion‚Äôs cup.  You just need to have a little patience and imagination. <br><br>  Originality is always in fashion.  From ordinary, it would seem, objects, you can create real masterpieces.  With your own hands you can create an amazing miracle that you can give to relatives and friends not only for the holiday, but also just like that.  Having spent a little time, you can really amaze and make something pleasant for a person.  After all, it is always interesting to try yourself in something new, and composing bouquets is not only a useful and inexpensive activity, but also an exciting hobby.  The approximate step-by-step instruction in this article can help beginners create individual elements, and a photo will help wake up their creative ideas.  Of course, preparation is needed and not everything will work out right away, but the efforts are worth it. </p>
