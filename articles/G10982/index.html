  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Polymer clay cat - step by step instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Polymer clay is an excellent material for creativity, possessing the properties of plasticine.  This is a plastic mass that hardens at high temperatures, which is achieved by the presence of plasticizers.  Craftsmen loved this material for ease of use and durability.  It is interesting to make from it both small figures for a keychain and pendants on a bag, to give a child for play or to mold a voluminous decorative figurine on a shelf. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make a cat out of polymer clay, how to connect individual parts together, at what temperature to bake crafts using a conventional oven.  The cat figurine can be made of polymer clay of different colors or painted with a solid color option.  If you like to sculpt animal figures from plasticine and want to perpetuate the result of your efforts, then make a craft from polymer clay. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  The first time a polymer clay cat can be made is modeled on the article.  Since the cat‚Äôs head is large, they use an internal shaft, for example, a toothpick or a piece of wire.  A clerical knife is also useful for separating pieces of the right size from a large breast, a rolling pin, preferably a metal one and dots for making holes (this is a stick with a ball at the end). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fimodiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a cat out of clay" class="if uuid-3072227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3072227.jpg"></div><p>  During the work, the masters advise using a silicone mat, rolling up the sleeves, so as not to accidentally touch the clay (threads from clothes or hair may stick to it) and have wet wipes nearby.  They wipe their hands after changing the color and wipe the surface of the part so that it is smooth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We sculpt a polymer clay cat </h2><p>  Thin and long details in the shape of a cone are molded separately.  These are the front legs, tail and trunk of a cat.  Carefully smooth all parts so that the surface of the element is smooth. </p><p>  Insert a toothpick into the body as a rod and for stability immediately attach the hind legs to the sides.  They are made in the form of a dumbbell and bent along the lower part of the body at an angle. </p><p>  With a sharp edge, attach the tail at the back and wrap it in a smooth bend around the body.  The front legs have a thickening downward, so they are smoothed at the top with the fingers to the body. </p><p>  The head is the largest detail of a polymer clay cat figurine.  Roll up the ball first, and then flatten it in your palms.  Make holes for the eyes with a metal dots.  There remains work on small details.  Here you will have to try, as this is the most difficult part of the work.  Eyes need to be set in recesses and slightly pressed down.  Try to make the same effort in two eyes.  Attach the black balls to the sides of the mouth and make a small red nose. </p><h2>  Cat head </h2><p>  Ideas for clay seals can be different.  It is interesting to make a cat sitting on its hind legs or curled up, to make a pair of Siamese cats in an embrace, or to sneak up on a prey kitten.  Each time the sculptor conveys different movements, but the head is often depicted according to the pattern.  We will consider it further in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.usefuldiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cat head" class="if uuid-3072229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3072229.jpg"></div><p>  The main detail is the ball, which is slightly flattened on both sides.  The ears are molded triangular, with a rounded notch in the middle. </p><p>  Using a metal rod, push the strip in the center of the front of the head.  In it, make a dots two indentations for the design of the eyes. </p><p>  Dry your hands with a damp cloth and attach two white balls.  The pupils themselves can be made by pressing beads.  The volumetric part of the cat‚Äôs face is also made of white balls - first, the central element is attached, and then the side ones are slightly larger. </p><p>  It remains to make a nose, and the cat's head made of polymer clay is ready. </p><h2>  Product drying </h2><p>  To keep crafts for a long time, sculptures must be dried in the oven at the temperature indicated on the package.  Each type of clay will have a different one, so you cannot give advice to all readers at once.  Spread the parchment on a baking sheet, and after drying, be sure to ventilate the kitchen and wash the baking sheet thoroughly.  Then you can cover the product with acrylic varnish to give a gloss surface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wonderfuldiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to dry crafts" class="if uuid-3072237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3072237.jpg"></div><p>  Try to use polymer clay in crafts, embody the plan in the work!  Good luck </p>
