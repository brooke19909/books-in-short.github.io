    <p>  How many different tariffs and services does MegaFon offer its customers.  Sometimes they are difficult to understand even for mobile specialists.  What can we say about novice subscribers.  Sometimes they first connect them, and then think about how to disable paid services.  MegaFon specifically for such clients has provided a variety of ways to do this, so that everyone can choose the right option for themselves. </p><h2>  For those who are "friends" with the Internet </h2><p>  For regular Internet users, of course, it will be most convenient to view information about connected services, to connect and disconnect them in your personal account.  These clients will appreciate the online assistant "Service Guide".  Having visited the site, you can view detailed information about your phone number: balance, tariff, call details and, of course, available services. </p><p>  Immediately on the main page of your Personal Account you can see information about all connected services, as well as about the tariff, bonuses and charges for the current month.  However, to disable paid services, MegaFon offers its customers a look at special bookmarks.  So, to disable tariff options, the subsection "Options, services and tariff" is provided.  The rest can be disabled in the "Additional Services" and "Call Forwarding and Call Barring" subsections. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  If the Internet is unavailable ... </h2><p>  But what if there is no access to the network and will not be in the near future, but I would like to disable paid services right now?  In this case, MegaFon suggests using the voice assistant 0505. Listening carefully to the prompts (it will be very convenient to use the speakerphone), you can listen to information about all connected services and disconnect those that are no longer needed. </p>

    <p>  If listening to information is not very convenient, you can use the USSD-command * 105 * 05 #.  In this case, all the information will appear on the mobile display.  The subscriber can only type the numbers he needs on the keyboard to move forward on the menu.  After the system processes the application, an SMS will necessarily come to the phone informing about the disconnection of services. </p><h2>  Specialist to help </h2><p>  However, it is not always possible to figure out the services connected on the phone yourself.  In this case, you can and should seek help from MegaFon specialists.  This can be either the employees of the nearest service office or consultants of the contact center.  The latter, by the way, works around the clock, unlike offices.  They work most often from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time.  Sometimes there are exceptions (holidays, weekends, and the like). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In order for a specialist to be able to help resolve the issue, it will be necessary to provide <span>passport data.</span>  The owner of the room with his document should come to the office at all.  Only after that it will be possible to disable paid services.  Thus, MegaFon is trying to protect its subscribers from <span>unauthorized access</span> to personal data.  And in just a few minutes, an employee will turn off all options and services on the room that are no longer needed by the client who has applied for help. </p><h2>  It's important to know! </h2><p>  Of course, disabling any services of a mobile operator is a completely free procedure.  No one will take a single ruble from a subscriber.  However, on the day when the service is disconnected, the <span>subscription fee</span> for it will still be charged (unless, of course, it is provided for by the tariff plan).  It is important to remember this so that there are no misunderstandings.  Also, money is not returned for those services that were disconnected prematurely if the monthly fee is debited with one payment monthly.  And, of course, no one will return the money already spent for their connection, even if the subscriber has never used the service. </p>

    <p>  Before disabling paid services, Megafon offers to once again evaluate their merits.  Most tariff options offer discounts on calls, SMS and Internet.  Often, after they are disconnected, communication costs increase.  To understand this, you can take the call details for the previous month and calculate the cost of the services provided with and without a discount.  The difference will be a benefit.  Some services are connected for the sake of prestige, for example, "Change the dial tone."  Or calm - Black List and SuperAON.  It is important to understand that they are no longer necessary. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Before disabling services, it is important to understand them.  Sometimes, resentful because of debiting money from the account, subscribers make rash decisions, refusing tariff options that are advantageous to them.  Moreover, not knowing which services are connected (MegaFon will provide all the information about them at the client‚Äôs request), it‚Äôs difficult to choose the right way to turn them off.  After all, money can be debited not only for tariff options and additional services, but also for mobile subscriptions.  And to the latter, unfortunately, the clients have the most complaints and complaints, possibly due to their opacity for MegaFon subscribers. </p>
