    <p>  Built-in high dynamic range (also known as WDR).  This is a feature that allows you to shoot video in a sharp difference in illumination of a particular area.  An ordinary camera, as a rule, either works to correct overly illuminated areas by reducing brightness (then the shaded areas in the video turn out to be completely black) or increases the brightness in dark fragments (then the illuminated areas are illuminated).  WDR technology calculates the arithmetic mean between the darkest and brightest areas captured by the lens, and ‚Äúprocesses‚Äù the image. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The built-in function of protecting the recording from deletion or overwriting is provided in case of an accident or any other important event where the recorded video may be needed. </p><h2>  Beneficial features </h2><p>  It has a viewing angle of 360 degrees, allowing you to capture a significant part of what is happening on the road events. </p><p>  No need to keep track of whether recording has begun or not.  The human factor is excluded, allowing cases when the driver forgot to turn on the recording mode on the device - the video starts to be recorded from the moment the car starts to move. </p><p>  There is a built-in module for determining the coordinates of the iBOX Combo F1 plus GPS, which contains in its database information on the location of existing cameras and radars in the village. </p><p>  In addition to the standard <span>GPS module, the</span> GLONASS system is also used to determine coordinates. </p><p>  You can find the instructions on the manufacturer's website iBOX Combo F1 plus, updates are available there.  This can be transferred to the gadget via a USB drive.  If the database has not been updated within two months, the device will issue a reminder. </p><p>  When the driver approaches the radar, the gadget voice alerts you to the approach of one.  If there is an irresistible desire to find out the type of radar, it is possible to set the appropriate setting. </p>

    <h2>  Restless mode and more </h2><p>  Anti-Sleep mode is a setting due to which the device emits a sharp and annoying signal that turns off only if the driver presses the appropriate button.  Exposed in case there is a chance of falling asleep at the wheel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As you approach the camera, the sound signal amplifies.  The function is similar to a <span>Geiger counter</span> that makes a crack as it approaches a radiation field.  In the device, this setting was called the ‚ÄúGeiger effect‚Äù because of a similar analogy.  It is possible to adjust the volume of the sound being emitted, as well as mute the sound as you approach the camera or radar. </p><p>  If the driver has information about the frequency range of operation of some radars and their absence in a certain area, these frequencies can be excluded using the gadget options.  Thanks to this setting, the frequency of false positives is reduced. </p><p>  It is known that on some car models the taximeter overestimates the real speed of movement.  Thanks to the appropriate settings, you can set the display of the correct speed on the gadget. </p><p>  Thanks to the user-friendly interface, all settings are saved, there is no need to re-enter everything. </p>

    <h2>  iBOX Combo F1 plus: negative reviews </h2><p>  According to numerous reviews of the owners, there are practically no shortcomings in the work of the gadget.  Some buyers note as a minus such a criterion as the bulkiness of the device. </p><p>  Indeed, judging by the photograph, this device looks very large, resembles a <span>Polaroid camera.</span>  Most likely, everything is relative.  Owners of less reliable devices most often, choosing those, paid attention to the small size.  But over time, they were forced to abandon the use of those, choosing a more reliable model - ibox Combo F1 plus. </p><p>  Reviews also note cases of failure of this gadget.  Moreover, the problems are recorded both in the form of a small freeze in the image, and in the form of a complete shutdown of the device.  The problem is easily fixed, because the manufacturer gives a guarantee of as much as 5 years - the device can be replaced at the place of purchase. </p><p>  Owners note a low-power battery, which is short enough.  The problem is solved by the charger or portable battery. </p><h2>  The fattest minus </h2><p>  Some of the most significant comments should be described separately, they relate to isolated cases of incorrect operation of ibox Combo F1 plus.  Reviews broadcast that when recording videos at high speed, numbers of cars passing by are displayed blurred, recording is jerky.  With a decrease in speed, the problem seemed to disappear, but periodically returned. </p><p>  A description of such a problem is not found everywhere in reviews; moreover, it should be noted that this is an isolated case.  The conclusion suggests itself: either the buyers came across a batch of defective goods, which (most likely) was successfully replaced under the guarantee, or these comments are the machinations of ‚Äúblack seo-shniks‚Äù that leave negative reviews for money in order to deliberately denigrate this product and scare off buyers. </p><p>  Honestly, this does not always work.  Even provided that positive reviews can also be left for money, especially about the iBOX Combo F1 plus.  The firmware downloaded from the official site also solves a number of problems. </p><h2>  iBOX Combo F1 plus: positive reviews </h2><p>  Most of them - many buyers say that the price (about 10 000 rub.) Fully justifies itself.  For some, the cost seemed disproportionately high, but, using less quality and cheaper equipment, they come to the conclusion that it is better to pay a large sum for the iBOX Combo F1 plus.  Miser pays twice. </p><h2>  Shock sensor </h2><p>  Separately, it is necessary to note the presence of such a useful feature of the gadget as a G-sensor.  Better known as an accelerometer.  The line of the mentioned advantages of iBOX Combo F1 plus (GPS, radar detector, video recorder, WDR technology) is continued by the functionality capable of protecting the driver from false charges. </p><p>  The mechanism captures the acceleration of the vehicle, sharp turns, braking, sharp speed drops, as well as the impact force at the time of the accident.  In addition, the DVR records incorrect overtaking, exit to the oncoming lane and other incidents on the road that can provoke the occurrence of a traffic accident. </p><p>  This sensor is an integral part of any modern DVR.  Moreover, a recorder without a G-sensor is generally considered inferior, no matter how rude it may sound. </p>

    <h2>  Coordinate system </h2><p>  A number of buyers also spoke positively about another iBOX Combo F1 plus module - GPS.  The reviews sound mostly positive.  They relate to the precise location of cameras and radars.  They also talk about the possibility of adjusting the speed displayed on the screen of the gadget using the iBOX Combo F1 plus module - GPS. </p><p>  Reviews are also negative.  Some gadget owners believe that the GLONASS and GPS signals simultaneously involved in determining the coordinates contribute to incorrect operation: each system sees the driver at a different point, which can lead to malfunctions and ‚Äújumps‚Äù of coordinates, which leads to incorrect display of speed and track (according to navigators from Google and Yandex). </p><h2>  GLONASS </h2><p>  If a lot of things is known about the GPS system, it is well-known to everyone, then they say less about its double - GLONASS.  It should be noted that it was developed back in the USSR.  It uses two types of navigation signals: FDMA and CDMA. </p><p>  The basis of the system are satellites in Earth orbit, which move in different orbital planes.  The system is largely similar to GPS, the only difference is that the satellites do not resonate with the rotation of the planet.  Because of this, the signal is more stable.  But the life of the satellites is much shorter than that of GPS. </p><p>  In total, 25 satellite complexes of the GLONASS-M type and two GLONASS-K are involved in orbit.  In 2018, it is planned to launch the upgraded GLONASS-K2 satellite system. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It should be noted that in modern society, the presence of a DVR in a car is something like a rule of good taste.  It is hard to imagine a motorist without this gadget. </p><p>  Situations on the roads are quite delicate.  And in the event of a traffic accident, the driver is simply vital to secure conclusive evidence of his innocence.  Video recording is just that.  Therefore, it must be of high quality.  Because of this, the choice falls on the <span data-mce-mark="1">iBOX Combo F1 plus.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Owner reviews are proof of this.</span> </p><p>  Taxi drivers use this device especially often - people for whom their own car is not only a means of transportation, but also a source of income. </p><p>  On May 7, 2016, a legislative amendment entered into legal force, according to which, courts accept DVR materials as evidence.  Earlier this was done only at the discretion of the judge. </p><p>  In view of which, it is recommended that drivers in case of an accident in the presence of witnesses report that a video recorder is installed in the car.  Next, remove the USB flash drive from the gadget and seal it in an envelope for all, so that there is no doubt about the authenticity of the video. </p>

    <p>  A legislative amendment applies not only to drivers in fact.  For example, upon receipt of complaints by the police about hooligan actions of specific individuals in the courtyard (for example, a fight or shooting from a traumatic pistol), the materials of the video recorders of nearby cars can be used to collect materials and further initiate criminal proceedings. </p><p>  Complicated cases in the analysis of insurance cases can also lead to the use of video materials not only from DVRs, but also from ordinary outdoor surveillance cameras and even cell phones. </p><p>  It should also be mentioned separately that the court still has the right not to accept video surveillance materials as evidence if there are doubts about the authenticity of such materials or if there are clear signs of video editing. </p><p>  The installation even provides for criminal prosecution as for the obvious falsification of evidence.  This applies not only to video materials, but also to photos.  Simply, if previously the materials of the video recordings could be considered by the court as information for the formation of the evidence base solely by decision of the judge, then now they are in any case accepted.  But judges have the right not to consider them if the authenticity of those is suspicious. </p>
