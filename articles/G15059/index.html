It is located directly on the coastline, and the distance to the sea is only 50 m. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  The six-story building combines urban modern and Asian styles that harmoniously complement each other.  A beautifully decorated entrance with monumental columns looks great against the background of strict geometric lines of the structure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coral beach resort sharjah 4" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1063996.jpg" width="600"></div>
