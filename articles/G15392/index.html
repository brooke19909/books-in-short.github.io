After some time, the Khlevinsky moved to Dzerzhinsk, where his father was appointed head of the Deaf Society.  Mom Valeria took part in the amateur circle in society, he soon began to study there himself. </p><p>  In 1958, the family moved again.  This time to Vladimir, where Mikhail Khlevinsky also leads the deaf community.  In a new place, Valery Khlevinsky goes to study at school number 1.  Fascinated by the theater, the boy’s class teacher, Zinaida Semenovna, organizes productions of children's performances.  To participate in them, the teacher attracted little Valera.  The boy liked the theater so much that in addition to school performances, he began to study in a drama circle at the House of Officers, under the direction of Alexander Vasilyevich Brandt (leading actor of the <span>Vladimir Drama Theater).</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Valery Khlevinsky" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39141/1413359.jpg" width="200"></div>

By the end of school, his choice left no doubt, and, having received a certificate, he immediately went to the capital to submit documents to the Moscow Art Theater School.  But the young man was disappointed - in the second round of exams, he failed.  Returning to his native Vladimir, the guy masters the profession of a turner.  After working at the plant for about a month and a half, he goes for an interview at the local drama theater, where he is accepted as an auxiliary staff.  Gaining experience in the next half season, he carefully prepares for admission to the theater. </p><p>  Having become a student of the Nizhny Novgorod Theater School, he learns the basics of acting from the People's Artist of Russia V. Lebsky.  By the way, it was he who at one time brought to light Evgeny Evstigneev.  The year spent at the school, Valery Khlevinsky recalls with special warmth. </p><p>  This is followed by a three-year army service in a <span>guard of honor company.</span>  Valery gives all his free time to the drama circle at the Moscow House of Officers.  In parallel with the service, Valery Khlevinsky entered the Moscow Art Theater, where he continued his studies after demobilization. </p><h2>  Years in the Contemporary </h2><p>  In the school-studio Khlevinsky studied with <span>V. Markov.</span>  On the same course, Nelli Kornienko and <span>Tatyana Vasilieva</span> studied with him <span>.</span>  The graduation performance of Valery in 1969 attracted the attention of Oleg Efremov.  It is he who invites the gifted student to the troupe of the Sovremennik Theater. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The scene of "Contemporary" became native to Valery Khlevinsky.  Here he shared his talent with the audience for thirty-two years.  Such a long service to art allowed the actor to create many unique images: Ashes from the play “At the Bottom”, Dolittle from “Pygmalion”, Alphonse from “Three Comrades” and Ridge from “Anomalies”.  In general, in order to list all the multifaceted images created by Khlevinsky, you can write a separate article.
