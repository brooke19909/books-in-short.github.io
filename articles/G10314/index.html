Italy has incorporated all natural objects: seas with picturesque coasts, lakes, mountains, dangerous slopes for ski slopes.  One of the most famous cities of this country is Florence and Venice.  But how to get from Venice to Florence?  First, understand why. </p><h2>  The beauties of Florence </h2><p>  Narrow medieval streets with fortresses have been preserved here.  However, the dominant architecture of the Renaissance - the heyday of the city.  There are three main attractions: </p><ol><li>  Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore. </li><li>  Giotto's bell tower. </li><li>  Signoria Tower on the Palazzo Vecchio, which belonged to the medieval city hall. </li></ol><p>  The historical center is Piazza Signoria with a collection of sculptures: "David" by Michelangelo, "Perseus" by Cellini.  It was on this square that the most important and major events of the city took place.  The main cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore is the third largest in the world.  Next to it rises the bell tower of Giotto, decorated with multi-colored marble. </p><p>  The most famous church is the gothic basilica of Santa Croce.  Florence has a picturesque promenade with ancient bridges.  The oldest of them - Ponte Vecchio - houses jewelry shops. </p><p>  Florence retains its historical appearance, so it is an open-air museum city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="view of florence" class="if uuid-2551701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90737/2551701.jpg"></div><h2>  Inimitable Venice </h2><p>  Venice is built on 122 islands connected by 400 bridges.  Monument city founded in the 5th century  BC, where all the buildings are monuments of architecture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most of the streets are narrow, you can rest your hands on the opposite houses, and the height of the building is 7 floors.  There are no coasts at the canals; in this regard, houses stand in the water.  A large canal 4 km long runs through the whole city.  It flows to the central square - San Marco.  Here are the Basilica di San Marco Cathedral and the famous Palazzo Ducale Palace.  A huge number of pigeons live on the square, who were brought from Egypt specifically as a gift to the Doge's wife. </p><p>  In St. Mark's Square you can also see the Doge‚Äôs Palace itself, a magnificent building for noble people.  Nearby is the <span>Bridge of Sighs,</span> which is made in the Baroque style.  The name of the bridge is related to its history.  Here the prisoners were taken to execution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photosatthespeedoflife.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="canal of venice" class="if uuid-2551688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90737/2551688.jpg"></div><p>  Today, scientists often argue that due to the number of canals and the structure of the earth, Venice can go under water for several decades.  However, this fact attracts tourists even more. </p><h2>  Distance between cities and ways to get there </h2><p>  Venice and Florence are the two main points on the map of Italy, so the question of how to get from Florence to Venice should be resolved.  Cities are separated by 270 kilometers, which can be overcome in different ways: </p><ol><li>  By plane. </li><li>  By train. </li><li>  By bus. </li><li>  By car. </li></ol><p>  Depending on the budget, convenience and travel time, you can choose the most suitable option for you.  This information is valid for two directions: Venice-Florence and vice versa. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="draw2c.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="map of italy" class="if uuid-2551723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90737/2551723.jpg"></div><h2>  Airplane: is it worth it? </h2><p>  How to get from Florence to Venice?  Of course, buy plane tickets. </p><p>  Venice has an international airport, but there is no airport in Florence itself, it is a couple of kilometers in the vicinity of Pisa, since it is the main airport of Tuscany.  But do not rush to look for tickets; there are no direct flights between cities.  The fact is that travel time by plane takes about half an hour. </p><p>  Although it is possible that there will be non-stop flights, since a solution with a stop increases not only travel time to three hours, but also the cost of the ticket. </p><p>  But if you decide to still use this type of transport, then we present to you the flight schedule for the direction "Florence - Venice". </p><p>  11:50 - departure from Florence, at 14:30 arrival in Venice.  Travel time: 2 hours 40 minutes with a change of 45 minutes in Rome.  <span>Airline: Alitalia</span> SPA Ticket price - 9 000 rubles, this price does not include baggage, only hand luggage. </p><p>  There is another plane from this airline with the same route.  At 15:25 it flies out from Florence, at 18:45 it lands in Venice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.northeastfamilyfun.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="by plane" class="if uuid-2551734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90737/2551734.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, this option is not very convenient and for a budget tourist is not suitable.  So how to get from Florence to Venice on your own? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  On rails we rush towards a fairy tale </h2><p>  The most optimal and popular mode of transport is the train.  Many tourists, and Italians themselves, choose the Florence - Venice train.  Reviews of tourists are mostly positive, they highlight the price, speed and comfort.

Ticket price - 20-30 <span>euros (1500-2000</span> rubles). </p><p>  How to get from Florence to Venice by train?  There are several transport companies that travel along this route.  These are Trenitalia and Italo. </p><p>  The first option is a state-owned company that provides trains with and without transfers.  Of course, it is most profitable to buy a ticket for a high-speed train.  Its travel time is 2 hours 5 minutes, and the cost is 30 euros.

However, you can change the data in the budget ticket itself.  For example, you can change the name for one euro.  Also, tickets are divided according to the comfort of movement, width and fabric of seats.  It is important to note that in the wagons of trains of this company there is WI-FI. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="by train" class="if uuid-2551744" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90737/2551744.jpg"></div><p>  It is also important to note that the terminal station in Venice is called "Venice Santa Lucia".  And in Florence - ‚ÄúSanta Maria Novella Train Station‚Äù.

To come initially to Europe by car or rent a car in a special center.  However, be prepared to pay for toll roads in Italy, entrances and parking in cities.
