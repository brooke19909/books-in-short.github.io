This is a land of contrasts and extraordinary beauty.  The serenity and tranquility of these villages contrasts with the vibrant and colorful cities, distinguished by their cosmopolitanism.  The island surprises with a significant number of long-livers inhabiting it, which is explained by the fact that the local climate is the most moderate and healthy in the world.  Almost all year round the island shines bright southern sun. </p>

    <h2>  For future guests New York Plaza Hotel Apartments (Cyprus, Paphos): get to know the resort </h2><p>  Paphos is a resort located in the southwest of the island between the coast and the Troodos Mountains.  The city has a huge number of hotels of various categories.  There are both 2 * category establishments and 5 * hotels providing high quality service.  Among other quite popular analogues, the New York Plaza Hotel Apartments (Cyprus) warmly welcomes visitors in Paphos, and grateful guests left a lot of positive reviews about their stay in Paphos. </p><p>  Tourists, going on vacation, are always interested in the history of the place in which they have to spend leisure time, as well as other conditions of stay.  Paphos is known primarily as the birthplace of Aphrodite, the famous goddess of beauty from ancient Greek mythology.  The place where the goddess, according to legend, appeared from the foam, is especially noted here.  Back in 1980, the city became the very first object in Cyprus, taken under the protection of UNESCO as a place teeming with historical and cultural monuments.  Paphos fully justifies its name: it is considered the most elite resort on the island, where mainly wealthy people can afford to relax.  According to reviews, this resort is completely non-focused on families with children; neither animation programs for children, nor playgrounds are provided for here.  This should be taken into account by potential tourists considering choosing a place to stay.  But in Paphos there are a lot of secluded beaches and cozy bays, first-class restaurants and other places that make up the infrastructure of a "beautiful life", which, if you believe experts, would be more than enough for the whole southern island. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  More about beaches </h2><p>  Whatever the hotel was chosen for accommodation on vacation in Paphos - New York Plaza Hotel Apartments or any other - information about the conditions of stay on local beaches will never be superfluous.  According to the reviews of tourists who have been here, the beaches in Paphos are rocky and sandy.  Entrance to the sea, vacationers warn, is not always convenient: often it is complicated by a steep rocky descent.  The beaches are all free, but sunbeds and umbrellas can be used for a fee.  The best and longest in Paphos is the long and wide sandy beach located in the bay of Coral Bay. </p>

    <p>  Guests consider it a drawback that there are no clothes dryers on the balconies, the furniture in the rooms is old and rustic.  Of the toiletries in the bathroom, according to the guests, only two pieces of soap are provided.  Some reviewers do not recommend coming here with young children: according to them, nudists can arrange their "games" in the hotel pool.  Residents also complain about weak Wi-Fi. </p>
