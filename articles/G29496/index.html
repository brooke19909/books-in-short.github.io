    <h2>  Hypothesis </h2><p>  It would seem, how is the scientific problem of research related to the hypothesis?  In practice, there is a direct relationship between them.  Before you start working on a project, you need to find out what exactly you will analyze throughout your research.  A hypothesis is <span>an assumption</span> made at the beginning of a scientific project or experimental study.  As you study the object or a certain phenomenon, it can be confirmed or refuted. </p><h2>  Problem finding </h2><p>  Given that the research problem is a specific task that the researcher will have to solve after the experiment is completed, it is important to take seriously the selection of the topic of work or project. </p><p>  How to do it right?  If we are talking about school <span>research</span> or projects, then the selection of topics is carried out in close cooperation with the supervisor. </p>

    <h2>  Topic selection examples </h2><p>  Depending on the scientific field chosen for experiments, the topic can be both voluminous and specific.  For example, if you plan to study the history of one photograph, then as a study of this problem, you can consider the search for relatives, places associated with the picture.  For example, as an option for such a project, you can consider an old school photograph of a graduating class.  The guys can find out during their project how the fate of each of the guys was, learn about their attitude to studying at school. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Working methods </h2><p>  In addition to the subject matter, it is important to choose the appropriate methods of research problems.  Otherwise, it will be difficult to talk about the relevance and reliability of the results.  For example, if the study is conducted in the field of chemistry or ecology, it is advisable to use the experimental method. </p><p>  During a series of experiments, you can identify the average indicator, based on the results obtained, draw conclusions.  Decided to conduct a study in the humanitarian field?  In this case, a sociological survey can be applied. </p><p>  For example, for adolescents, the choice of a future profession is relevant.  You can analyze, using your own methods, how temperament affects the career guidance of the younger generation. </p><p>  How to conduct a similar study?  <span>Analysis of the problem</span> involves the selection of theoretical material, that is, a literature review.  First you have to find out what <span>types of temperaments</span> exist <span>,</span> look for techniques that allow them to be detected in adolescents. </p><p>  Next, you can select a group of volunteers for whom the selected tests will be offered.  Summing up the results of the research, it is possible to offer the guys those professions that were determined as optimal during the test. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Targets and goals </h2><p>  <span>The tasks of researching the</span> problem should be specific, defined, realistic.  After choosing a topic, you need to determine the purpose of the project.  On its basis, it is possible to single out tasks that the researcher will solve as he works on the project.  Assume that the purpose of the experiment is to quantify the content of ascorbic acid in rowan berries.  As those tasks that should be set at the same time, we highlight: </p><ul><li>  the study of scientific literature on the issue of research; </li><li>  the selection of the set of techniques that will be optimal and realistic in this case; </li><li>  collecting material for the experiment; </li><li>  experiments </li><li>  conclusions and recommendations on the research problem. </li></ul><p>  As an addition to the experiment, it is possible to note applications in which tabular indicators of the vitamin C content in the studied samples will be indicated. </p><p>  A young scientist can compare the obtained and tabular values, draw conclusions. </p>

    <h2>  Object of study </h2><p>  How do schoolchildren solve the problems of modern research?  As an object of research, the guys choose vitamins, fats, carbohydrates when it comes to projects in the field of chemistry and ecology.  For example, as an object of study, you can choose the coast of the White Sea.  Considering the fact that in 2002 there was a serious release of oil from the tanker in the Onega Bay, we can analyze how this situation affected the flora and fauna of this sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Subject of study </h2><p>  The problem of research is an important aspect for the formation of logical thinking in the younger generation.  The direction of all project activities depends on the choice of the subject of research. </p><p>  As part of the introduction of a new generation of federal state standards of a new generation, the relevance and relevance of student research is increasing. </p><p>  For each child should be built their own educational development path, involving the implementation and project activities.  The Ministry of Education has set the task for educators to form a harmoniously developed personality, capable of self-development, socializing successfully in modern society.  To accomplish this task, teachers actively apply exactly the project methodology in their pedagogical activity. </p>

    <h2>  Novelty and relevance </h2><p>  The peculiarity of the study, the solution of the problem in the framework of the school project is that the results obtained are relevant and significant.  In order to choose the right research topic, you need to consider several important aspects.  If the research problem is the starting mechanism for any project, then its essence is scientific novelty, as well as practical significance. </p><p>  For example, even when choosing the classical methodology for conducting experiments, you can find an element of novelty.  If the work is devoid of this, it loses all meaning.  The research problem is the most important moment to which the attention of his ward is drawn up by the supervisor of research or project work.  Prior to its nomination, it is necessary to carefully study the scientific literature, existing practices on the issue of research. </p><h2>  Problem criteria </h2><p>  There are certain standards that the research problem must comply with: </p><ul><li>  objectivity of the issue; </li><li>  practical significance. </li></ul><p>  Relevance suggests the importance of a given issue at a particular point in time.  By identifying relevance in your project or study, you can emphasize the relationship between the current state of the issue and the near future. </p><h2>  School Project Example </h2><p>  We offer, as an example of designing a school project, work related to the quantitative determination of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in tea.  In the introduction, the significance of the topic is analyzed, historical facts of the application of the object of research are given. </p><p>  Even in Russia, they used an infusion of Ivan tea as a drink and a medicine for various diseases.  Confirmation of the unique properties of this tea can be found in the works of the Russian researcher Pyotr Aleksandrovich Badmaev.  He lived for more than a hundred years, largely due to the use of the infusion of this amazing plant. </p><p>  Ivan tea has a unique chemical composition, which can rightfully be called a "pantry of nature."  Residents of Europe appreciated the benefits of Ivan tea, which contains 6.5 times more ascorbic acid (vitamin C) than in lemon. </p><p>  By the beginning of the XIX century, this product was the second in the list of export goods from Russia to European countries (after rhubarb).  After the British seized the territory of India, black tea plantations appeared in the colonized territories, familiar to all modern Russians to their taste.  The British, seeking to obtain material profit, ‚Äúconquer‚Äù Russia and ‚Äúimpose‚Äù a new product on its inhabitants.  Gradually, the traditions of the use of Ivan tea are lost, and this useful product is undeservedly forgotten. </p><p>  The difficult economic situation, the complication of relations with European countries, made the issue of the revival of the traditions of classical Russian tea drinking, associated with the use of Ivan tea, important from an economic and political point of view. </p><p>  Given the relevance of this issue, in our research work, we decided to conduct a comparative analysis of the organoleptic and chemical properties of willow tea and classic Indian tea, to identify their similar and distinctive parameters. </p><p>  <span>Objective: to</span> determine the quantitative content of ascorbic acid in the original tea samples. </p><p>  Tasks of work: </p><ul><li>  to study the organoleptic characteristics of the samples taken by tasting; </li><li>  to conduct a quantitative analysis of the content of vitamin C in the samples by titration. </li></ul><p>  Subject of study: the quantitative content of vitamin C in the initial samples of tea. </p><p>  Object of study: Ivan tea and classic Indian tea. </p><p>  Research Methods: </p><ul><li>  literature review; </li><li>  iodometry (titrimetric analysis); </li><li>  statistical processing of results. </li></ul><p>  Hypothesis: in terms of the quantitative content of ascorbic acid and organoleptic characteristics, classic Indian tea is significantly inferior to Ivan tea. </p><p>  The following is a description of the importance of ascorbic acid; a technique for the experiment is selected. </p><p>  After the study is completed, conclusions are drawn on the significance and feasibility of using willow tea as an alternative to classic black tea. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Design technology has become an integral part of modern education.  They are used not only at the senior level of education, but also in preschool institutions. </p><p>  In order for each Russian schoolchild to have the opportunity to demonstrate their creative abilities, to acquire new skills, they must be involved in design and research activities.  No matter what type of project they create, in any case, its subject should be correctly selected, the goal of the study should be set, the tasks defined, a hypothesis put forward.  Even in the case when in the process of work it will be refuted or partially confirmed, this does not reduce the relevance and significance of the created project.  In the near future they will introduce a professional standard for Russian teachers.  One of the points in it will be conducting research with students, as well as involving the younger generation in project activities. </p>
