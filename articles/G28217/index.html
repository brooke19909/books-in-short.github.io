    <h3>  Location </h3><p>  Understanding where Abkhazia is located on the map can be a problem for those who have never been there and never heard of it.  Two seas help to navigate - the Black Sea and the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, between which there is a chain of mountains.  It is here, on the Black Sea coast, that this amazing corner of our planet is located. </p><p>  Where is Abkhazia located?  This question can often be seen on thematic forums that are devoted to interesting and non-banal travels.  Interest in unusual places is growing among many people, because banal and hackneyed by tourists routes are not what modern people want. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is abkhazia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15653/312295.jpg"></div>

Where is the main center of attraction of this country?  Traveling on it is most loved by travelers by car.  It is this option that will allow you to enjoy the country and go around the maximum number of unique and amazing places.  It is worth noting that the local population treats tourists kindly and without prejudice.  It also makes the country attractive in the eyes of free travelers. </p><p>  But Abkhazia is not only open to tourists by car.  Where this country is located and why it attracts tourists so much remains a mystery to many.  However, several decades ago there was no person in the Soviet Union who would not rest in the boarding houses and sanatoriums of this beautiful region.  For many, Gagra and Sukhum are still close and dear to all, preserving the charm of the southern relaxed atmosphere in photographs in <span>family albums.</span> </p><p>  Many residents of other countries do not understand what kind of country is Abkhazia?  Where is?  Currently, in the political world, it is considered the territory of Georgia, which Russia occupied. </p><p>  The climate and nature of the country are determined by its location.  Abkhazia stretched along the Black Sea coast for 210 km.  On its territory, pebble wide beaches are most often found, behind which hills and mountains begin almost immediately.  The main territory is limited <span>by the Psou</span> and Ingur <span>rivers</span> .  Throughout the country, nature is unusually picturesque and diverse: rivers, lakes, tropical climate, a huge amount of vegetation, mountain peaks and ridges - all this makes it truly unforgettable and unique. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is abkhazia on the map" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15653/311700.jpg" width="600"></div>

The rest of Abkhazia is open to tourists and glad to them as good guests.  Traveling and relaxing on the beaches of this country will leave the best memories. </p>
