But the trouble is that modern amplifiers from giants such as Yamaha and Pioneer cost fabulous money.  What if the budget is limited, but you want a high-quality sound?  There is a solution: Soviet audio devices. </p><p>  They cost a penny, and in quality they are not inferior even to many modern Hi-End class receivers.  One of them is the Amphiton-002 amplifier.  This monster is able to provide high-quality sound for purely symbolic money.  Of course, subject to the availability of the appropriate speaker system and the "right" connecting wires.  Now let's take a closer look at this device.  But first, a few words about the manufacturer. </p>

    <h2>  A little bit about the company </h2><p>  There were many good amplifiers in the Soviet Union.  One of them was Amphiton.  It was produced by the Lviv PA named after Lenin (now PO Lorta).  The release of Amphiton-002 began back in 1983.  And since then, the design of the amplifier has not fundamentally changed.  And really, why change something that already works fine?  That is precisely the opinion held by the leaders of the Lenin PO.  However, since the mid-nineties of the last century, software has ceased to exist.  Accordingly, Amphiton devices disappeared from store shelves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that in addition to amplifiers under the Amphiton brand, very decent acoustic systems with power from 25 to <span>150 watts</span> were also produced <span>.</span>  Moreover, these were "real" watts, and not invented (which are popular with modern manufacturers).  We can say that the Amphiton-002 amplifier is the last successful creation of a software named after Lenin.  After him, all development stopped.  And soon, the software itself ordered a long life.  But the Amphiton technique is still appreciated by music lovers.  Even some audiophiles respect this brand. </p><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  The Amphiton-002 Stereo amplifier looked very impressive.  It is made of thick metal.  Moreover, the metal covers it from all sides.  The front panel has controls.  Here, the huge <span>volume control knob</span> is striking <span>.</span>  This is very convenient, as you can freely navigate the controls in complete darkness.  The side faces of the device serve as a heat sink and have a ribbed surface.  This gives the amplifier a somewhat futuristic look.  It looks powerful and dignified. </p>

    <p>  On the rear panel is a set of connectors, a speaker switch and an additional power connector.  Weighs Amphiton-002 Stereo 9 kilograms.  This is a decent result.  Any high-quality amplifier is quite heavy, since its components are far from budget.  On the upper panel, which is also made of a single sheet of metal, there are "gills" of the cooling grate.  This allows you to more efficiently remove heat from the components of the amplifier.  However, let's move on to other features of this device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Amplifier Specifications </h2><p>  So, let's take a closer look at Amphiton-002.  The characteristics of the device allow it to be used in tandem with Hi-End speakers.  Judge for yourself.  The rated power is 25 watts.  The maximum short-term power is 100 watts.  The frequency range varies from 40 to 16,000 hertz.  This is a perfectly acceptable result.  Especially when you consider the "age" of the amplifier.  The frequency range is between 20 and 25,000 Hz.  This already sets the device apart from similar Soviet-made amplifiers. </p>

    <p>  The Amphiton U-002 Stereo also boasts a decent bass boost, perfect treble reproduction and excellent mid-range reproduction.  Moreover, it does not matter from what source the sound comes from.  Also there is no hissing at high volume, which is characteristic of many Soviet entry-level amplifiers.  Five-pin sockets are used as connectors for connecting equipment.  Connecting a computer or CD player will not be difficult, as there are many adapters in retail. </p><h2>  Additional options </h2><p>  The Amphiton-002 amplifier has some features that make its use more comfortable.  These include the ability to connect multiple <span>sound sources.</span>  On the front panel there is a knob type selector, which allows you to select a playback device.  There are also two modes of operation: mono and stereo.  There is a button to correct the sound picture when listening to sound from vinyl records and a button for equalizing low frequencies at minimum volume.  In general, many people consider this particular amplifier to be the best of Amphitons.  And the point here is not at all in his class.  It is simply made very high quality and has many useful options. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Amphiton-002 is capable of delivering excellent, deep bass.  Many use this device as a low-frequency amplifier.  And they are partly right.  However, the amplifier does an excellent job with other frequencies.  To fine-tune the sound image, there are special controls that help you adjust the tone and all the main frequencies.  This amplifier can be considered one of the most functional, among those that were produced in the Soviet Union before and after.  Now let's move on to another section of our material. </p><h2>  Amplifier repair </h2><p>  Like all Soviet equipment, this device is highly repairable.  If any component fails, replacing it will not be difficult.  It is only necessary to correctly determine what exactly is broken.  And then everything goes like clockwork.  However, in order to repair the amplifier yourself, you need at least a little understanding of radio engineering.  Without this, there‚Äôs nothing even to climb into the inside of Amphiton 002.  Repair is also simple because finding the right parts or their analogues is not a problem.  It‚Äôs enough to go to any radio store.  Capacitors, windings, wires, transformers - all this is on sale. </p>

    <p>  However, there is another feature of the Amphiton-002 repair.  <span>The amplifier circuit</span> must be present before the eyes.  Without it, it is not possible to figure out what Soviet engineers had done.  If you do not have time to repair the amplifier, you can bring it to any workshop.  There they will gladly undertake the repair of this unit.  And they‚Äôll take it not very expensive, because the details are cheap.  And for repair you just need a regular soldering iron. </p>

    <h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  As mentioned above, Amphiton-002 is a Hi-End class device.  And this means that the amplifier is capable of providing very high quality sound.  True, quality depends on many factors.  The first thing you need to pay attention to the sound source.  It should be either a good-quality CD player or a computer with an external DAC.  But on the computer it is necessary to reproduce not ordinary MP3 files, but formats without loss of quality (FLAC, APE, WavPack).  Only then can you enjoy really high-quality sound. </p>

Use cheap cords from unknown manufacturers is unacceptable.  They will not be able to provide decent quality.  Yes, and some components of the amplifier itself can be replaced with modern analogues, which are sometimes much better than Soviet ones.  Then the amplifier will sound exactly as intended by the manufacturer.  But revision is not required.  And without that, the sound is very good.

    <h2>  Where could I buy? </h2><p>  At present, it is not possible to find the original Amphiton-002 in retail.  That is, it is unrealistic to buy a new device.  It can be sought only in the secondary market.  Here at various "flea markets" it is quite possible to buy such an amplifier in good condition.  Sometimes even modified models can come across that boast better sound.  The price of such an "Amphiton" can vary from 1,000 to 2,000 rubles.  It is not expensive.  Especially when you consider the class of the device. </p><h2>  Positive feedback from owners </h2><p>  It is necessary to study reviews.  Especially with devices such as amplifiers.  It is they who are able to explain to a potential buyer how high-quality sound this or that receiver is capable of delivering.  So what do people say about the Amphiton U-002?  Reviews about this device are mostly positive.  Owners praise high-quality and clear sound, rich low frequencies and full high-end ones.  Also, many people like the design of the amplifier.  It looks really impressive: shiny, metallic, with reliable controls.  The robust case of thick-walled metal is also a reason for pride.  But most of all, users are impressed by the price and compatibility of the device with all passive speakers. </p>

    <h2>  Negative owner reviews </h2><p>  There is almost no constructive criticism here.  For example, many complain about the excessive weight of the amplifier.  Any opinion should be heard, but for comparison - the Brig amplifier weighs 25 kilograms!  There are users who do not like the sound of the device.  Of course, you should not expect a Yamaha or Bowers &amp; Wilkins level Hi-End Soviet amplifier.  There are no such miracles, especially for 1,000 rubles.  No further negative reviews were found for this amplifier.  And this can only mean one thing - the product is really high-quality </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  So, we examined the Amphiton-002 amplifier.  What can be said about him?
