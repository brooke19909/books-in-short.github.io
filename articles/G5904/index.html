  <section class="page js-page"><h1>General scientific methods of cognition. In search of truth.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The concept of "method" includes a set of operations and techniques of theoretical and practical development of reality.  The method offers a person a whole system of principles, rules, requirements, following which he can quickly achieve the intended goal.  There is a special field of knowledge that assigns special importance to the study of methods; it is called methodology.  Its main task is to study the characteristics of cognition methods: origin, effectiveness and essence. </p><p>  The methods of cognition are usually divided according to the breadth of application in the process of scientific research.  Moreover, general scientific methods of cognition are divided into two large groups: metaphysical and dialectical.  In the middle of the XIX century, metaphysical methods were increasingly replaced by dialectical methods, due to the rapid development of natural science.  The dialectical group of methods is represented by general scientific <span>methods of cognition,</span> which are widely used in various scientific fields, that is, they have a fairly wide range of applications. </p><p>  Observation is always the main tool that accompanies general scientific methods of cognition.  It always plays a very important role in <span>scientific knowledge,</span> since it allows you to collect a huge amount of information about the environment.  An experiment refers to a more complex <span>method of empirical</span> consciousness compared to observation.  It involves a targeted, active and strictly controlled impact of the researcher directly on the object, to study its connections, properties or other aspects.  The experiment has a number of inherent features: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The experiment allows you to study the subject in its pure form, eliminating various side factors that impede the research process. </li><li>  During the experiment, you can put the subject in unusual, extreme conditions. </li><li>  During the experiment, you can intervene in its development, and adjust the further course of the experiment. </li><li>  An experiment can be performed any number of times as needed to obtain reliable results. </li></ol><p>  The preparation and conduct of a scientific experiment requires the fulfillment of certain conditions on the part of the experimenter. </p><p>  So, conducting a scientific experiment: </p><ol><li>  Never at random.  An experiment always assumes a strictly formulated research objective. </li><li>  Never done blindly.  An experiment is always based on any theoretical premises. </li><li>  It is not carried out without a plan.  The contractor must have a preliminary plan for the experiment. </li><li>  It always requires certain technical equipment necessary for its proper implementation. </li><li>  Requires a high level of specialization of people who will carry out the experiment. </li></ol><p>  Dialectics and metaphysics are not only philosophical concepts on the basis of which general scientific methods of cognition are based.  These are the greatest universal methods of cognition, which allow us to understand not only the scientific picture of the world, but also to develop our own theory of discoveries. </p><p>  The knowledge and use of general scientific methods of cognition does not exclude the use of private and special <span>scientific methods of</span> cognition of various phenomena.  Particular scientific methods of cognition are a set of principles and methods of cognition, scientific procedures and techniques that are used in a particular field of science, corresponding to the basic <span>forms of matter motion.</span>  As a rule, these methods relate to mechanics, chemistry, physics, biology, and some humanities. </p><p>  Despite the most diverse methods of cognition used in various fields of science and technology, all scientists strive for one goal - to make the most reliable picture of the world.  Most likely, in the very near future they will succeed. </p>
