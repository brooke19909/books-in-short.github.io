    <p>  According to the popular tourist portal, the hotel has a rating of nine points out of ten possible.  The total score is derived on the basis of intermediate ones received from people who visited the resort.  They separately give points for cleanliness and comfort, location, the availability of wireless Internet, amenities, staff work, value for money. </p><p>  The location of the hotel and the level of comfort in it were most appreciated.  Surrounded by mountains, sea and forest, the resort complex offers a relaxing holiday.  The air, sea and sand are clean.  Guests note that this is a good, new hotel, the rooms are beautifully furnished, the central air conditioning system is in place, the plumbing is in excellent condition, there are huge pools and a unique style is observed.  Of the minuses, some guests emphasize loud music not only in the daytime, but also at night, which interferes with sleep. </p><p>  Regarding the service at Rixos Premium Gocek and the work of the staff, the hotel also has practically no complaints from travelers.  The reviews noted the coordinated work of the guys at the reception.  The presence of a Russian-speaking administrator is especially pleasing to our compatriots, since the language barrier is still strong.  Hotel guests note that all staff are responsive and attentive, trying to ensure that vacationers have only positive impressions.  The cleanliness of the rooms is maintained at the proper level. </p><p>  Separately, guests emphasize the quality and very varied buffet at the hotel.  The food served on the beach is prepared literally before your eyes and with the freshest products.  It‚Äôs a joke, but some guests didn‚Äôt manage to try everything that is prepared for the buffet for ten days of rest. </p><p>  Hotel guests appreciate the ratio of quality of rest in it and the price of eight points.  One of their main wishes is the organization of a free transfer to the nearby resort town of Fethiye. </p>
