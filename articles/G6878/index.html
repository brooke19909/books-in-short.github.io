  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where is it profitable to open a deposit in Samara? List of banks</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Samara, many of the largest Russian commercial banks operate.  Among the services which include deposits that allow customers to earn income.  Consider the most advantageous offers of banks, as well as the features of a particular deposit product.  We pay special attention to deposits with a high percentage.  In Samara, they can be issued both at the bank branch, and in most cases online. </p><h2>  Deposits from Alfa Bank </h2><p>  The profitable deposit offered by Alfa Bank is called Alfa Account.  The minimum replenishment amount is 1 ruble.  Deposit term starts from 1 month.  The interest rate is 7% per annum.  What are the benefits of this contribution?  These include: </p><ul><li>  interest is paid monthly; </li><li>  partial withdrawal and replenishment; </li><li>  preferential termination available; </li><li>  interest capitalization. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="alfabanker.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alfa Bank" class="if uuid-3125900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3125900.jpg"></div><p>  We give an approximate calculation.  If the client deposits 100 thousand rubles, then in a month his income will be 575 rubles. </p><h2>  Contribution from Renaissance Bank </h2><p>  Renaissance Bank invites customers to open an accumulating account ‚ÄúWithout Borders Online‚Äù in Samara.  The amount for replenishment starts from 1 thousand rubles.  Deposit term - 181 days.  The interest rate is 6.5% per annum.  Payment of accrued interest is carried out monthly.  The deposit can be replenished, and partial withdrawal is also available.  Accrued interest is capitalized. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This deposit can also be opened not only in rubles, but also in currency.  A savings account in dollars is opened for an amount of $ 100.  Interest rate - 0.25% per annum.  A deposit in euros opens from 100 ‚Ç¨.  Interest rate - 0.15% per annum. </p><h2>  Contribution from Gazprombank </h2><p>  One of the profitable deposits in Samara can be found at Gazprombank.  Namely, ‚ÄúSavings Account‚Äù.  The proposed interest rate is 6.2% per annum, with interest accrued every month on the minimum account balance.  The minimum deposit amount should be 5 thousand rubles.  Duration: from 1 month.  You can replenish the deposit without loss of interest; partial withdrawal without loss of income is also available.  Customers can take advantage of the preferential termination of the deposit agreement. </p><h2>  Contribution from Sberbank </h2><p>  The largest commercial bank in Russia also offers the opportunity to open deposits in Samara.  Consider one of the options, namely a product called "Manage."  You can open it both in rubles and in dollars, but we will dwell on the ruble in more detail.  The deposit amount should not be less than 30 thousand rubles.  Duration: from 91 days and above.  The possibility of extension is available. </p><p>  The deposit rate reaches 4.25%.  The main characteristics of the deposit include the following advantages: the payment of accrued interest is carried out every month, partial withdrawal of funds from the account is also available, in addition, the client can replenish the deposit throughout the term. </p><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank logo" class="if uuid-3125911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3125911.jpg"></div><p>  Consider one of the options for an example.  A client opens a deposit in Samara at Sberbank in the amount of 400 thousand rubles.  The term is 182 days.  Income at an interest rate of 4.25% per annum will amount to 8552 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that customers serviced by the Sberbank Premier service package can count on higher interest rates on deposits.  To do this, they need to contact a personal manager.  More complete information can be clarified in the support service of Sberbank and in any branch where there is a Premier zone. </p><h2>  Contribution from BystroBank </h2><p>  BystroBank offers one of the most profitable deposits in Samara, namely the Maximum Rate deposit.  The minimum amount for this product is 100 thousand rubles.  The interest on the deposit in Samara reaches 7.53% per annum.  However, it is worth considering that the deposit is opened for a period of 3 years.  What additional conditions are there?  It should be noted immediately that partial withdrawal of funds is impossible, but replenishment of the savings account is allowed.  Interest is paid out every month.  In other words, the interest rate is capitalized.  The deposit can be terminated on preferential terms. </p><h2>  Deposit "Mail Bank" </h2><p>  Quite recently, Post Office Bank branches opened in Samara.  Clients are invited to open a deposit in Samara with high interest rates, namely, ‚ÄúAccumulative‚Äù, the interest rate at which reaches 7% per annum.  The minimum deposit amount is 5 thousand rubles.  Duration: 1 year.  It is worth noting that replenishment of the savings account is possible, but partial withdrawal is not provided.  Interest is paid at the end of the deposit term.  But it is worth noting that with early termination, preferential terms apply. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vdomodedovo.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mail bank" class="if uuid-3125913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3125913.jpg"></div><p>  We give an approximate calculation.  If a client wishes to open a deposit in Mail Bank in the amount of 50 thousand rubles and a term of 367 days, then at the end of the deposit he will receive an income of 3613 rubles. </p><h2>  How to choose a contribution </h2><p>  When choosing this or that contribution in Samara, clients must determine for themselves what criteria are most priority for them.  Some banks allow you to replenish the deposit throughout the term, as well as partially withdraw funds if desired, but it gives a very low percentage of return.  On the contrary, other financial institutions offer customers a fairly high percentage, but without the right to partial withdrawal, and sometimes without the right to replenish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samara city" class="if uuid-3125901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3125901.jpg"></div><p>  It is also important to pay attention to the stability and rating of a commercial bank.  For example, Sberbank is one of the most hopeful financial institutions in the Russian market.  However, this bank offers a rather modest interest on deposits.  If you want to invest a large amount, a small percentage should not scare customers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pravdaurfo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank of Russia" class="if uuid-3125912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/3125912.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the interest on deposits in Samara depends on the package of services of the bank, which is used by the consumer.  For example, having an Alfa-Bank premium card, you can get a higher percentage of return on deposits in this financial institution. </p>
