    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  It was this situation of the city that served as the reason that in its history he saw many battles.  And although in official written sources you can find references to the city, or rather, about the watchman ‚ÄúIzumskaya Sakma‚Äù, only from 1571, scientists are inclined to believe that the age of this settlement should be counted from an earlier time.  So, in the territory where it is now located, in the XI-XII centuries wars were fought between the Polovtsy and the Russian princes, and in 1111 the army led by Vladimir Monomakh won the battle on the Salnitsa River.  This river is chronicle, and it cannot be found on the maps.  However, historians are sure that it was a tributary of the Seversky Donets and flowed into it just near the place where Raisins are now located.  The city as such was certainly not formed immediately.  In the 16th century, the Izyum Sakma was one of the main roads along which the Tatars raided Russia.  Therefore, watch fortifications were erected on Kremenets.  And already in the second half of the 17th century, the Izium fortress was built.  The city began to grow gradually around, and in 1685 it became regimental. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The 20th century was also marked by bloodshed in this village.  The brutal massacre of Denikin‚Äôs over almost a hundred political prisoners of the Izyum prison.  In memory of this tragedy, a white stone obelisk was erected, located on Mount Kremenets.  Fierce battles during World War II.  It was here that the Kharkov operation was carried out.  Raisin is a city that has held back the advance of the Nazis for eight months.  His <span>fascist Germany</span> rightly considered the "door" to the Donbass, so it was so important for the enemy army to capture it. </p><h2>  Modern city </h2><p>  Now the city of Izyum in the Kharkov region is a picturesque small town with a population of (over the 2001 census) a little more than 56 thousand people.  Shanties by the riverbank are still preserved.  Walking around the city, you can meet the surviving county houses, not destroyed by the war.  Although prevailing in the city are five-story buildings.  Very close is one of the largest forests in Ukraine.  Mostly pine forests occupy about 60,000 hectares of land, with 430 in the city.  At 9 kilometers is located Chervonoskolskoe reservoir - one of the largest in Eastern Ukraine.  In the XIX - XX centuries.  industrial development of the city was leaps and bounds.  The railway passing through it was extremely important even in tsarist Russia, to say nothing of the times when mining was carried out in large volumes.  Raisins became the first city in Russia to produce optical glass.  In 1916, the construction of a plant for its production began. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Polovtsian women </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Raisins is a small city, travelers who love history have something to see.  The most ancient monuments include statues of the so-called "Polovtsian women".  Historians do not have a single opinion about their origin.  But there is one legend.  According to her, these statues were once people worshiping the sun god.  An angry deity once turned them into stone.  On the slope of Kremenets they were not always standing.  Statues were collected from all over the county.  The time of their appearance is about the 12th century.  If we leave aside legends and talk about scientific hypotheses, some historians believe that these are idols for worshiping the fertility goddess.  However, there is another opinion: these stone statues are tombstones.  Be that as it may, but if you study them, you can get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlife, tools, jewelry, weapons of the ancient nomads. </p><h2>  <span>Memorial complex</span> to the 40th anniversary of the Victory </h2><p>  A memorial was opened on the top of Mount Kremenets for the fortieth anniversary of the Victory in World War II.  It can be seen from anywhere in the city.  A monument ‚ÄúThe Sorrowful Mother‚Äù was erected on the territory and the grave of the ‚ÄúUnknown Soldier‚Äù is located.  The road to the top passes through Victory Park.  A somewhat unusual and amazing place.  Even the urns in it resemble a bursting shell.  There is also a monument, which is a soldered bomb.  Also on the central avenue is military equipment from the Second World War.  There are artillery pieces, T-34, KV tanks and, of course, the legendary Katyusha.  It is on this place that festive events, <span>torchlight processions</span> and fireworks are held annually on May 9. </p>

    <h2>  Transfiguration Cathedral </h2><p>  Raisin is a small city, as already mentioned.  There are only three churches in it, but each of them is worthy of attention.  Almost the same age as the city is the Transfiguration Cathedral, built in 1684, shortly after the foundation of the Izyum fortress.  In 1751, it was repaired, and in 1886 the complex was supplemented with a bell tower and a vestibule.  The next restructuring took place at the beginning of the 20th century.  As a result, the appearance of the temple has changed significantly.  He began to resemble buildings in the style of Ukrainian wooden architecture.  The Great Patriotic War did not spare the cathedral either.  It was very badly destroyed.  However, already in the 50s of the last century, it began to be reconstructed.  As a result, the temple almost regained its original appearance and interior.  The walls cleared of traces of all repairs.  And even if it was necessary to restore part of the masonry, the bricks were made according to old technologies. </p>

    <h2>  Nicholas Church </h2><p>  In 1809-1823  St. Nicholas Church was built.  Its other name is the Holy Cross Exaltation Church.  Later, side aisles were erected.  It is much smaller and built in a classic style.  And although it is not so interesting in terms of architecture, the painting of internal interiors is amazing. </p><h2>  Ascension Church and the miraculous icon </h2><p>  Finally, the third temple is the Ascension Church (Holy Ascension Cathedral).  It was built in 1792 on the site of an old wooden church.  In 1903, side chapels appeared, and the bell tower increased by one tier and became four-tier.  Each of them is made in its own style.  The lower one is in harmony with the facade of the church.  The second is square.  It is limited by a cornice and window frames.  The third has the shape of an octahedron and is decorated with flat porticoes with pilasters, reminiscent of the style of the <span>Corinthian order.</span>  Triangular pediments complete the design. </p><p>  Holy Ascension Cathedral is also known for the fact that it stores a relic, which the city of Raisins is proud of.  Ukraine reveres the miraculous <span>icon of the Peschansky Mother of God.</span>  For the first time she appeared to St. Josaphat of Belgorod.  And in 1999, she was found again.  And then a religious procession was held which had no analogues: on an airplane for five days the icon was carried along Russian borders. </p>
