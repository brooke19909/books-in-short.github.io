Located in the Mediterranean Sea, it is one of the largest tourist centers of the country.  Moreover, Crete today is called one of the most popular resorts not only in Europe, but, perhaps, all over the world.  And this is not surprising: the tourist infrastructure of this amazing island, the largest in Greece, is at such a high level that even the most spoiled travelers come here to relax. </p><h2>  Crete - Milatos </h2><p>  Tourists come here too, eager to relax with comfort and scope ‚Äúin a European way‚Äù, accustomed to spend time idly in entertainment, and those who prefer to relax with their families.  In addition, Crete is not only first-class beaches and hotels.  This idyllic corner on the planet has a very interesting past that dates back to the era of Odysseus and the Greek gods. </p><p>  In the north of the island is the picturesque quiet resort town of Milatos.  Traditionally Mediterranean architecture with white stone houses, narrow streets, neat clean paths, an abundance of flowers and plants, benches with fragrant spices, delicious fruits and vegetables, a variety of fish sold in the bazaar, hospitable locals - all this gives the impression that it was not in a modern tourist center, and in the era of the Minoan culture. </p>

    <p>  A lot of positive feedback on the work of the staff, which the Russians rated at the highest score.  As for the rooms, they are not satisfactory either - large and comfortable with everything you need.  Our compatriots were dissatisfied with the beach, or rather, the entrance to the water.  Because of the stones constantly had to wear special shoes.  There is a category of vacationers from our country who did not particularly like the food.  In their opinion, it could have been more diverse, although many believe that this is not entirely true. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that the Radisson Blu Beach Resort is a decent hotel to visit. </p>
