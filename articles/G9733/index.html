    <h2>  Securities custody </h2><p>  According to the depositary <span>agreement, the shareholder</span> who wishes to transfer his securities to the depository organization is assigned an individual account in the same way as is done with ordinary settlement and savings accounts.  Only securities in this case are credited to the account, and not cash.  And the unit of measure here is precisely certain assets, and not a specific amount of currency.  Banking services for legal entities are now the most diverse. </p><p>  The shareholder has the right to manage his account, as well as the assets stored on it, as he sees fit.  This can be done using a special interface, as well as software that is provided by the depository organization.  These transactions also bear great resemblance to those carried out with respect to ordinary accounts.  What are the service rates? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Payment to the address of the organization providing the depository services is carried out in proportion to the number of days during which the securities account was opened.  This is about 0.12% per annum, at least 10 rubles per day.  There is no charge for storing assets whose circulation has expired.  For example, opening a new <span>account for a nominee</span> holder will cost approximately 10,000 rubles.  For each operation, on behalf of the depositor (the person who made the deposit), a fee of 150 to 800 rubles is charged, depending on its type. </p>

    <h2>  About securities </h2><p>  In order to ensure the fulfillment of any obligations related to loans and bank guarantees, the following securities are accepted - promissory notes, savings, as well as certificates, shares, assets of constituent entities of the Russian Federation and municipalities, corporate issuers and credit organizations, as well as ordinary shares of OJSC NK ‚Äú Lukoil, OJSC NK Rosneft, OJSC Rostelecom, OJSC Gazprom, RAO UES of Russia, OJSC Surgutneftegas, OJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel and others. </p><h2>  Services of banks that are provided to legal entities </h2><p>  Banking services for legal entities differ significantly from those that can be provided to individuals.  Their difference lies in the very nature of economic relations and participants in financial turnover.  On the one hand, the range of services for organizations and companies is much wider than for citizens, and on the other, responsibility here is much higher.  These services include: </p><ol><li>  <em>Lending.</em>  Loans are the most convenient way out for those entrepreneurs who experience significant financial difficulties when purchasing any movable property, equipment or real estate to carry out their business tasks.  The parameters and forms of granting loans to them can also vary significantly, it depends on the level of relationship between the bank and this organization, on the form of ownership and on the scope of activity of a particular entrepreneur. </li><li>  <em>Deposit services.</em>  In this <span>area of ‚Äã‚Äãbanking</span> services, there are also differences between deposits for individuals and <span>legal entities.</span>  <span>Deposits</span> mean the accrual of interest on the free funds of a legal entity, and additional conditions for such accruals are usually negotiated in advance with each specific client of the bank.  Depositary service is very convenient. </li><li>  <em>Maintenance of current accounts.</em>  This service may not be single, but even complex.  When servicing the accounts of organizations, it implies a high speed of settlement and monetary transactions, as well as their high quality.  This area includes a service to optimize cash management operations. </li><li>  <em>Service as well as issue of plastic cards.</em>  Usually this service involves the maintenance of so-called payroll accounts. </li><li>  <em>Investment.</em>  The client of the bank in this case can be both an investor and an investee. </li><li>  <em>Factoring services.</em>  They provide for the transfer of financial resources to an enterprise that is a client of the bank, in exchange for the right to demand from the debtor (third party) the transfer of goods, services, debt recovery.  However, the debtor is entitled to a deferred payment.  This service is very convenient for those enterprises for which this is standard practice. </li><li>  <em>A variety of operations related to documents.</em>  These may be international operations conducted in order to minimize the risks arising from the implementation of foreign economic activity. </li><li>  <em>Collection.</em>  This service consists in timely transportation, as well as the safety of cash or other valuables. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In addition to these services, the bank provides legal entities with audit services for their financial activities, as well as the opportunity to act as a guarantor or intermediary of transactions, and provides the right to participate in auctions.  Thus, before choosing a partner, you need to analyze the activities of a banking organization and evaluate how convenient depositary services are.  Judging by customer reviews, custody services have many advantages.  You can receive, verify, transfer income on securities, store them, open and maintain accounts, much more.  Customers are guaranteed safety and respect for their rights. </p>
