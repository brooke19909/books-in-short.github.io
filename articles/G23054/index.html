    <p>  Hugh Marston Hefner (future owner of the mansion and founder of Playboy magazine) lived an exciting life.  He served in the army during World War II, studied at the Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and worked for Shaft and Esquire magazines. </p><p>  Hugh came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating his own magazine as a student.  But the idea came to life only after the dismissal from the advertising department of Esquire magazine.  According to Hefner himself, he had to do this, because the authorities refused to raise salaries at all. </p><p>  Self-collecting money, Hugh Hefner published the first issue of the magazine with Marilyn Monroe on the cover.  At that time (the 50s), the Playboy circulation was 70 thousand copies, three quarters of which were sold out in the first week! </p><p>  Gradually, the affairs of the owner of Playboy magazine began to improve, and he allowed himself to purchase one of the oldest houses in Los Angeles.  Then the purchase cost Hefner's company $ 1.1 million.  A little later, this house became known to many as the famous Playboy Mansion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mansion History </h2>

    <p>  The true story of the Playboy Mansion begins when it was built, not acquired by Hefner. </p><p>  Designed by Arthur R. Kelly back in 1927.  The mansion was made in the then fashionable Gothic-Tudor style. </p><p>  The first owner of the house was Arthur Lates Jr., the son of the founder of The Broadway Department Store.  Later, Louis D. Statham (a famous engineer, inventor and chess lover) became the owner of the house.  It was from him that Playboy bought the mansion for Hugh Hefner in 1971. </p><h2>  Famous parties at the Playboy Mansion </h2>

    <p>  Many singers and actors loved visiting the mansion.  Among the regular guests, the paparazzi noticed actors: Charlie Sheen, <span>David Hasselhoff,</span> Paul Shore and <span>Corey Feldman.</span>  Even at parties, Snoop Dogg, John Lennon and Leonardo di Caprio often appeared. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù celebrations, the mansion hosted annual theme parties, such as the Midsummer Night <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="2" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">'s</span> Dream Party, better known as the Midsummer <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="2" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">'s</span> Party, which took place on the first Saturday of August.  For example, above, you can see a photo of the Playboy mansion, which was made in 2015.  Then the theme for Midsummer <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="2" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">'s</span> party was Halloween. </p><p>  In addition to celebrities, more than a dozen Hefner's friends were constantly present in the mansion.  The owner himself spent some time with some of them, while others entertained the guests at parties.  Of course, each such girl received a good weekly allowance of $ 1,000.  In addition, Hugh Hefner bought them expensive jewelry, cars, and paid for plastic surgeries. </p><h2>  Death of the owner and sale of the mansion </h2>

    <p>  Sadly, it all ends once.  Hugh Hefner passed away on September 27, 2017 at the age of 91, and the new owner of the famous mansion was Daren Metropoulos, manager of the investment company Metropoulos &amp; Co, as well as the deceased‚Äôs neighbor.  The amount he laid out for the house is not known to anyone, but the starting price was about $ 200 million. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the house in which Metropolos lived before Hefner's death was also purchased from the deceased and designed by the same architect.  According to rumors, it is even known that initially the Playboy mansion and Darren's house were to become two parts of the same residential complex, so the new owner plans to merge them soon. </p><h2>  What is a mansion? </h2>

    <p>  The mansion is located in the south of the bright and sunny state of California, in Los Angeles, namely in the Holmby Hills area.  Nearby are the <span>Country</span> Club, the University of California, Los Angeles and the Bel-Air Country Club. </p><p>  The mansion itself covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 2 hectares.  On such a rather large territory, there is not only the main house, but also the guest building, a tennis court (part-time basketball court), a golf lawn and a jogging track.  In addition, next to the place where the Playboy Mansion is located, there is also a large parking lot, a special relaxation area with a small waterfall, a swimming pool, a patio and a barbecue area. </p><p>  Looking at the photo of the Playboy mansion, one can also see that the landscape design consists of a small garden with citrus fruits, a large pond with carps and carefully groomed trees that surround the entire territory.  Among exotic trees, sequoia and fern are found here. </p><h2>  What's inside? </h2>

    <p>  The way the Playboy mansion looks from the outside is already known.  This is a large, majestic estate, made in the Gothic-Tudor style, surrounded by parking, a grove, areas for recreation and sports.  But inside, the main house looks even better. </p><p>  The Playboy Mansion is a large two-story building consisting of more than twenty rooms, many of which are bedrooms.  On the ground floor there is a kitchen, dining room and main hall, made in a classic style.  On the walls you can see portraits that were made at different periods of Hugh Hefner's life, as well as his own metal statue, standing alone in the farthest corner. </p><p>  Leaving the hall, you can get into the remaining rooms of the mansion.  For example, after a long, exhausting day, you can relax in a room equipped with a cinema.  You can also visit the wine cellar, gym, a small library, a games room or go up to the second floor to choose one of the bedrooms for going to bed. </p><p>  Of course, besides all of the above, in this large house there are a lot of other, no less interesting premises.  For example, there is a corner for carnal pleasures, called the Grotto cave.  It was a favorite place of many celebrities who came to Hefner to relax and have a good time in the company of pretty girls. </p><h2>  Interesting facts about the mansion </h2><p>  And finally, some interesting facts about the mansion: </p><ul><li>  The Playboy Mansion has been featured in many Hollywood films.  For example, he is in the movie ‚ÄúBoys Like It‚Äù, where the famous actresses Anna Faris and <span>Emma Stone</span> starred <span>.</span> </li><li>  When Hefner was still alive and had parties, he established some rules of conduct for all guests, breaking which even celebrities lost the right to visit the house again. </li><li>  This house was famous not only as the noisiest place in Holmby Hills County, but also as a haven for exotic animals.  During his life, Hugh Hefner received a zoo license for his mansion.  Here you could see monkeys, rabbits, parrots, peacocks and flamingos. </li><li>  Despite the fact that maids often worked in the house, many visitors complained about the dust and dirt that were present in some rooms. </li><li>  According to many guests, in the Playboy mansion, there is an Elvis secret chamber in which the legend of rock and roll spent the night with several girls.  Until now, no one has been able to see her. </li></ul>
