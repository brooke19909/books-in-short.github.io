    <p>  You do not have to deal with frayed walls, old furniture and leaking plumbing if you decide to stay here when you arrive <span>in Kursk.</span>  Reconstruction of the hotel "October" was carried out relatively recently - in 2009.  At the same time, the classic interior was completely preserved, which was so loved by the employees and guests of this institution.  It is also worth noting that the rooms are equipped with all the necessary amenities that a modern traveler needs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about nutrition, then the Oktyabrskaya Hotel (Kursk) also took care of this.  Breakfast is served in the restaurant every morning, as well as the possibility of ordering a comprehensive meal.  If you feel hungry during the day, light snacks and drinks will be available at the lobby bar.  You also have the opportunity to organize a banquet in the restaurant of this hotel on the occasion of a holiday or special occasion. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Quite a favorable location is characterized by the hotel "October".  Kursk is a large city, and this institution is located in its very center, at 72 Lenin Street.

The international airport is approximately 12 kilometers from the hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel Rooms </h2><p>  Hotel "October" (Kursk) offers its guests to stay in rooms of the following categories: </p><ul><li>  Standard is a double one-room apartment, which is equipped with the minimum necessary set of amenities to ensure a comfortable stay.  In addition to the bed, there is furniture such as a desk and chairs.  The bathroom has a shower and a washbasin. </li><li><p>  The family room is designed to accommodate three guests, but taking into account additional beds this indicator can be increased.  There are two beds (double and one and a half), as well as folding upholstered furniture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div></li><li><p>  Studio apartments are a spacious room, which is divided into a bedroom and a living room by means of decorative zoning.

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Of the negative comments, the following should be noted: </p><ul><li>  it seems that the hotel has been undergoing ongoing repairs for several years, which causes a lot of inconvenience to guests; </li><li>  the hotel has a total lack of towels; </li><li>  the drain in the bathroom does not work well; </li><li>  in some rooms the air conditioners do not work (while the cost of living is not reduced); </li><li>  the carpet in both the rooms and the corridors is very dirty; </li><li>  the repair was done in very bad faith, and therefore wallpaper and false ceilings leave in some places; </li><li>  ventilation works very poorly. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Despite the fact that ‚ÄúOktyabrskaya‚Äù refers to high-class hotels, at the moment it does not correspond to the declared status.  The reason for this is the constant repair, which has not stopped for several years.  It would be more reasonable for some time to completely close the hotel to carry out the reconstruction, but, apparently, the owners are not ready to lose profits.  However, in order to somewhat compensate for this inconvenience, hotel prices have been slightly reduced.  That is why the institution is always a lot of guests. </p><p>  If you do not take into account the constant repair work, then accommodation in this hotel is quite attractive for most guests of Kursk.  This is due to a convenient location in the central part of the city.  In addition, the rooms here are very large and bright, as well as a jacuzzi.  But as for nutrition, it leaves much to be desired.  Repair also affected the work of the kitchen, and therefore the food will be served to you cooled down.  In addition, its range is very limited.  Reviews of the Oktyabrskaya Hotel (Kursk) suggest that all the shortcomings are brightened up by the friendly and attentive attitude of qualified staff. </p>
