  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IQ options. A way of earning or cheating.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More recently, on the Internet, a way to make money such as iq options has appeared.  A satisfied strong advertisement shows how to make money on a car and even an apartment in a week.  But is it really so, as they say, that in a short period of time you can increase your capital several times. </p><p>  IQ options are a type of options.  The principle of work with which is in determining the growth or decrease in the value of assets and securities.  For example, currency pairs, oil prices and many stocks of valuable companies.  In simple words, you need to make a forecast on the value of the stock at a certain point in time, and if the forecast coincides with reality, then you make a profit, if not, then suffer a loss. <noindex>  <span>Iq option reviews</span> </noindex>  real people write, and some managed to win, some lost their entire invested deposit.  In order to make an accurate forecast, you need to know what causes currency fluctuations in the market, and the more factors you know, the more accurate the forecast will be, and accordingly, the higher the profit. </p><p>  <strong>History of creation.</strong> </p><p>  Iq options were listed in 2008 on a Chicago stock exchange.  And literally in an instant, this way of trading has become one of the most popular in the world.  The difference from trading in the forex market is that you do not buy and sell any currencies and stocks, but simply make a forecast on the increase or decrease in the price of assets.  The same thing as sports betting, but instead of football, charts are displayed on your screen. </p><p>  <strong>How to make money on the forecast?</strong> </p><p>  Firstly, it does not matter whether you are a beginner or an experienced expert, you need to set a real bar for your desired income.  If you plan to increase your bank several times in a couple of days, you will burn through immediately.  10% of the income for the first month will be a good figure.  It‚Äôs better to win a little than lose.  No need to make a forecast for stocks whose name you have not even seen before.  Better such rates will be less, but better. </p><p>  Secondly, you should decide on a strategy.  On the Internet, you can find a huge number of them.  The trader gives you the opportunity to practice on a demo account, i.e.  you are trading not in real, but in virtual money and therefore do not risk anything.  Here you should work out strategies that are comfortable and profitable for you. </p><p>  Some companies offer the game on turbo options.  It is necessary to give a forecast currency for 1 minute.  There is already a game of luck, and it is difficult to make a correct forecast.  In a few minutes you can either burn out or make good money. </p><p>  You should not trade a bank.  Otherwise, in an instant you will be left with nothing.  You should bet up to 10% of the bank and then in case of unsuccessful forecasts there will be a chance to return the bank to its original state. </p><p>  According to statistics, only about 5% of people receive stable income from trading on iq options.  Will you enter these 5% or not, it is only up to you. </p></div></article>
