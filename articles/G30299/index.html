  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do-it-yourself pergola: step-by-step instructions with photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To decorate the infield, create a recreation area, the owners of the cottage or cottage decide to build a pergola.  It can have a different configuration.  This design is decorated with grapes or other climbing plants.  Here you can create a cozy gazebo, put a dining table.  Even a novice master can create a pergola with his own hands.  To do this, he must follow the step by step instructions that will be presented later. </p><h2>  Design Varieties </h2><p>  To create a pergola with your own hands (a photo of one of the design options is presented below), you need to create a project.  At the initial stage, the owners must decide for what purpose a similar structure is being built.  After that, it will be possible to make the right decision about the optimal location of the pergola on the site, as well as the choice of its design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.denbow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pergola in the country" class="if uuid-2418150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2418150.jpg"></div><p>  Such a building can stand at a certain distance from the main building.  In some cases, it is advisable to build a pergola next to a house or other building.  In this case, you can perform the correct zoning.  A beautiful, shaded place will appear, where it will be nice to relax on a hot summer day. </p><p>  There are several options for making a pergola with your own hands.  You need to choose the best option.  One type of pergola is the overlap.  This is one of the most common designs.  It can be mounted above the recreation area, swimming pool, playground, car park. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can also make a screen.  This allows you to decorate the territory of the site, as well as to delimit it, to perform zoning.  Screens protect plants from drafts.  If you want to hide outbuildings, you can also install this type of pergola here. </p><p>  Another design option is the visor.  This is a small canopy that shades the most illuminated wall of the building. </p><p>  One of the popular types of pergolas is the arch or tunnel.  Such designs are suitable for a site with large dimensions. </p><h2>  Metal constructions </h2><p>  To build a pergola with your own hands (photo is presented below), you can choose a design of arbitrary shape.  It is necessary to correlate its size with the dimensions of the site.  You should also choose a place for construction, where the wind will not bend the structure.  It should be less than 2 m in height. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ofdesign.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pergola decor" class="if uuid-2418154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2418154.jpg"></div><p>  The choice of material also needs to be approached responsibly.  One option is metal.  It makes strong, durable pergolas.  However, the disadvantages of metal must be taken into account. </p><p>  Connecting rods and other elements of this design will be required by welding or bolting.  In the first case, not every master will be able to handle the inverter.  However, not everyone has such equipment.  If a bolted connection will be used, it will be necessary to drill holes for fastening. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The structure may become loose due to wind.  She will require constant attention.  When the frame is entwined with dense vegetation, it will be difficult to do.  With a high degree of probability, the stems of the plants will be violated.  They will lose their beauty. </p><p>  It is also worth considering that self-built arches, metal pergolas, require periodic staining.  Temperature extremes, weather conditions and sun rays destroy the paint layer.  Each year, the metal will require additional restoration.  However, this will be difficult if plant stalks are on the frame. </p><p>  If you consider that metal is quite expensive, you can understand why this material is rarely used.  There are many other options. </p><h2>  Plastic and wood </h2><p>  More often do-it-yourself pergolas are made of wood or plastic.  These materials have a number of features.  Shield pergolas are not built from plastic.  In this case, the windage of the material will be high.  However, a plastic canopy can be built. </p><p>  The design is created from plastic or metal-plastic pipes.  This material bends well and is easy to cut.  Therefore, arched structures from metal-plastic pipes are often built.  The casing of such a frame is often made of polycarbonate sheets.  Installation does not take much time.  This type of design will be assembled even by a master without experience. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.econologie-maison.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo pergolas" class="if uuid-2418147" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2418147.jpg"></div><p>  Do-it-yourself wooden pergola is also erected quite quickly.  This material for the construction of such structures is used more often than others.  Pergola, made in accordance with all the rules, will be more durable than plastic and metal structures. </p><p>  Most often used for such construction is pine.  It must be well dried and properly processed.  For the construction of a pergola, a beam is used.  It must be treated with an antiseptic.  Wood pergola does not require restoration for many years.  This allows you to grow different climbing plants on them. </p><p>  You can make all the details for the canopy with your own hands.  Even a master without experience can do this.  Assembly also does not require much effort and time. </p><h2>  Foundation </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself pergolas and arches for summer cottages can be built using various technologies.  If the canopy is small, you can not do the foundation.  Pillars just dig into the soil.  So that the wood does not rot, it is treated with used engine oil at least 2 times.  Also, before deepening the supports, they are covered with tar. </p><p>  However, a foundation-based construction will be more durable.  The supporting structure must be strong if the mounted pergola is equipped.  A beam is laid at the base.  The racks are fixed on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ofdesign.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Homemade Pergola" class="if uuid-2418149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2418149.jpg"></div><p>  This design is suitable for pergolas made of plastic or wood.  This allows you to create a solid pergola.  Plastic frames are installed in metal glasses.  You can also do otherwise.  Pins are driven into the beam, which are made from pieces of reinforcement.  Frame pipes are put on them.  In some cases, the pergolas are dismantled, so they are not installed on special supports.  If you install a strong harness, it will be difficult to disassemble or move the pergola. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Knowing the recommendations of specialists, you can begin to consider the methods of building a pergola with your own hands.  A step-by-step instruction involves conducting design work at the beginning.  It is necessary to draw a future design on a sheet of paper, indicating its actual dimensions.  The pergola consists of supporting pillars, a roof and decorative elements. </p><p>  The roof and walls should provide adequate shading on a hot summer day.  However, under such a building should not be too dark.  It is better to develop a design that will create partial shade.  However, it should not cast a shadow on nearby plants.  They will not develop in such conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ofdesign.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pergola with flowers" class="if uuid-2418152" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2418152.jpg"></div><p>  It is recommended to place the pergola from north to south.  In this case, it is necessary to make a sufficient distance between the supports so that in the evening and morning time the sun's rays penetrate the area around the building. </p><p>  When developing the design, it is worth considering that pergola for relaxation or for climbing plants is slightly different.  A decision is made on the need to bring additional lighting here for evening gatherings.  Here you can also install a barbecue, make a small fountain or even equip a summer kitchen under such a canopy.  A small pergola is suitable for giving.  If the plot is large, the place for rest can also be made spacious. </p><p>  It is necessary to create harmony in the arrangement of landscape design.  To do this, take into account what other buildings are on the site.  The plan indicates the exact configuration of the future design, creating a pergola with your own hands.  Step-by-step instructions allow you to build a canopy correctly. </p><h2>  Procurement of materials </h2><p>  A novice will be able to build a durable, solid construction by following step-by-step instructions.  Do-it-yourself pergola is built according to the plan created earlier.  Based on the developed drawing, materials are procured.  If the design will be used for breeding garden plants, its height does not exceed 1.5 m. For recreation, the pergola will be slightly higher.  Its height can reach 2.5 m. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ofdesign.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pergola for relaxation" class="if uuid-2418151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2418151.jpg"></div><p>  The plan should indicate the main dimensions of the structure.  It is necessary to indicate the distance between the supports, calculate the size of the roof.  Also, the width and length of the pergola do not go unnoticed.  When choosing materials, you need to give preference to durable wood or plastic easy to assemble.  The pergola should look light. </p><p>  To build a recreation facility, you will need to purchase a beam (4 pcs.) 10 √ó 10 cm thick. Also, longitudinal beams will be required.  They will also be 4 pcs.  They should be thinner than the supports.  Cross bars will be required in the amount of 7 pcs.  To create a decorative finish, about 10 pieces of slats will be required.  For trellis (lathing), thinner materials can be used.  So the structure will look more elegant. </p><p>  To create the foundation you will need sand, gravel, cement mortar.  You can also use screw piles.  Wood must be treated with flame retardants, antiseptics, resin, waste oil.  As a waterproofing for the foundation, roofing material is used.  You should also purchase varnish or paint.  As fasteners, self-tapping screws, screws, metal corners are suitable. </p><h2>  Foundation building </h2><p>  According to the instructions, do-it-yourself pergola can be installed on the foundation.  This design will be more durable.  She will not deform in the winter.  To create it, you need to mark the area, align it and dig in the corners of the future design of the recess (about 60 cm).  Pergola for flowers in the arrangement of the support base does not need. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ofdesign.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pergola made of wood" class="if uuid-2418153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2418153.jpg"></div><p>  The column foundation will allow you to install a canopy in almost any part of the site, regardless of its topography and type of soil.  10 cm of crushed stone are poured into the prepared recesses.  As much sand is poured on it.  Each layer is carefully tamped.  Next, the roofing material is lined inside the fossa.  Bricks are laid on it or piles are poured into the cement.  After this, the recess is sprinkled with earth at the edges.  After checking its level, the structure is installed on the created base. </p><p>  If the site already has a prepared base, you can install the pergola using anchors.  Such fasteners enhance the stability of the structure.  The canopy will not deform under the influence of wind and other adverse weather conditions. </p><h2>  Installation of supports </h2><p>  After creating the foundation for the pergola in the country with your own hands, you need to install vertical supports.  On the prepared columns fasten the lower harness.  A support beam is mounted to it in the corners. </p><p>  If the foundation has not been created, deepenings are made on the site with the help of a drill.  Moreover, the depth of such pits should be 1/3 of the length of the support beam above the ground.  Before installation, the beam must be treated with antibacterial impregnations.  You can use resin or other similar substances. </p><p>  At the top of the supports create grooves.  Using such cutouts, the roof will be installed.  In order for the supports to hold firmly in the pit, you need to pour sand into it.  Such a pillow will prevent skewing of the structure in the future.  Next, a support is installed in each recess.  Her position is checked using the building level. </p><p>  Then concrete is poured into the recess.  It must dry thoroughly.  To do this, you need to cover the surface with a film and periodically moisten the concrete.  Otherwise, it will crack.  When the concrete has dried, you can begin the subsequent work.  This will happen no earlier than 3 weeks after pouring cement. </p><h2>  Assembly assembly </h2><p>  When assembling a pergola with your own hands, you need to correctly mount its frame.  Experts recommend the use of a stud connection.  First, do the roof trimming along the upper edge of the support pillars.  Next, lay the crossbeams.  This will be the roof of the building.  Between them make gaps. </p><p>  If necessary, the roof is covered with a tarp.  This will protect the interior from the weather.  On a warm bright day, the canopy can be removed.  Then pergola walls are formed.  They will be made in the form of trellis.  To do this, thin rails are stuffed across.  Sometimes, instead of wooden slats, wire or ropes are used.  For fasteners, self-tapping screws are used. </p><p>  After this, the surfaces are ground again at the installation points of the fasteners.  Further, all wooden elements must be varnished.  It is better to use waterproof, high-quality compounds for this.  Cover the pergola with varnish in several layers.  Do it sequentially.  Each layer should dry well. </p><p>  You can also use waterproof paints.  The choice of shade depends on the taste preferences of the owners.  White pergola is considered a classic.  However, other options may come up. </p><h2>  Dressing </h2><p>  Creating a pergola with your own hands, you need to pay attention to the decorative finish.  When the paint or varnish dries, you can bring light into the structure, hang a light fabric, which will create additional shading.  If free space allows, you can install beautiful statues inside, build a fireplace or barbecue.  Also often a place to relax is complemented by a small fountain or waterfall. </p><p>  Climbing plants are planted next to the canopy.  You can choose from a wide variety of ampelous plants.  They can be both the most familiar and exotic.  With proper care, such creepers will entangle trellis, creating a cozy place for summer outdoor recreation. </p><p>  Pergolas decorated with plants in pots look spectacular.  Next to such a canopy, you can plant a palm tree, plant decorative bushes, etc. A lot of flowering plants that will grow here will become the decoration of the entire garden. </p><p>  Having considered how to mount a pergola with your own hands, you can quickly and easily make a comfortable place to relax.  The canopy or arch will be strong and durable if you follow the step by step instructions. </p>
