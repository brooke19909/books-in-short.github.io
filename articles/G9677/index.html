It attracts both fans to soak up the beach, and those who prefer to explore the sights and other outdoor activities.  Young people are attracted to nightlife, because the city's clubs offer entertainment until the morning.  Even those who relax in other resorts, even for a day come here.  And the majority begins acquaintance with the city from the arrival at the Yalta bus station. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Oddly enough, such a popular city does not have either an airport or a train station.  Their construction is complicated by the proximity of mountains and the sea, so the Soviet authorities decided that it was more profitable to develop a road network.  Now the Yalta bus station has a large number of routes that intercity and even international buses run. </p>

    <p>  If you need to get to Yalta from any other city of the Crimean peninsula, feel free to go for a bus ticket.  This is the most profitable and fairly quick way to travel around the country.  Guests of Yalta can just as easily travel around the peninsula, taking buses to attractions of interest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The way to Yalta from Simferopol </h2><p>  Travelers from afar can fly by plane to the only Crimean airport located near Simferopol.  Only Russian airlines fly to Crimea, international flights as of spring 2016 are still banned due to the political situation.  But ticket prices are available to most tourists, they are compensated by state subsidies.  It is especially beneficial to travel by plane if the flight replaces the road with land transport, which takes several days. </p>

    <p>  Direct buses go to the Yalta bus station directly from the terminal building.  If it‚Äôs a few hours to the nearest departure, but you want to get to the sea sooner, then just take any bus that passes by the central bus station or the Kurortnaya station.  Many buses and minibuses to Yalta constantly run from them, which will deliver to their destination in a maximum of 2 hours.  The cost of a ticket for different routes is slightly different, on average it is 100-150 rubles. </p><p>  A taxi will cost at least 1,500-2,000 rubles, and the journey will take a little more than an hour.  It is better to book a car through the service than to catch a private driver.  If you nevertheless decided to agree on your own, then immediately specify the amount and specify whether it is indicated for all passengers or for each. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The most famous trolley bus </h2><p>  This type of transport is worth mentioning separately.  In addition to lines within cities, in the Crimea there are intercity routes.  In just an hour, you can reach your destination by trolleybus number 53 from Alushta.  The road from Simferopol takes up to 2.5 hours.  There is route No. 55 from the airport and route No. 52 from Kurortnaya station near the railway station.  The route connecting Simferopol with Yalta is recognized as the longest, which is noted in the Guinness Book of Records.  The length of the <span>route is</span> 84 km, and from the airport to Yalta - 96 km. </p>

    <p>  The Crimean trolley bus is not much slower than intercity buses, and the price is also not much different.  The final stop of the trolleybus is located on the same street (Moskovskaya) as the Yalta bus station - you just need to cross the road. </p><h2>  The history of the appearance of the bus station </h2><p>  Passenger traffic with the southern coast of Crimea began to develop especially actively since 1861.  Then people traveled by carts and malposts (multi-seat carriages) to the station at the intersection of Massandra and Pochtovaya streets.  The very name of the latter came from the fact that, in addition to people, the carts delivered letters and other mail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yalta bus station" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1215627.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <p>  A century later, the bus station moved slightly along Postal Street.  The appearance and distribution of vehicles with gasoline engines was reflected in transportation: guests arrived at the resort in buses and diesel trolleybuses.  The number of vehicles grew, and new roads were built.  After the construction of the district highway, from which the routes to Simferopol and Sevastopol departed, it was decided to build a new station near such a convenient transport hub. </p><p>  The architect G.V. Chakhava was involved in the work.  It was he who proposed the project, thanks to which the Yalta bus station looks modern for many years.  Due to the many windows merging into two glass walls, the structure is sometimes called an aquarium.  In addition to the station building, road junctions were created.  The grand opening took place in mid-December 1966 in honor of the half-century anniversary of the Soviet regime. </p>
