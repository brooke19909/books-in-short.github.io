    <h2>  Communication with customers </h2><p>  The NPF Lukoil receives very mixed reviews for contacting employees with employees.  Some emphasize that it is in this organization that one can meet with an attentive attitude and receive answers to all questions without much difficulty.  Workers treat everyone with respect, respect, and try to give everyone due attention. </p><p>  However, some reviews contradict positive comments.  It is indicated that unprofessional personnel work in Lukoil.  They simply lure customers to themselves, but withheld important information about cooperation.  Some workers cannot answer a number of simple questions. </p><p>  What to believe?  Rather, it‚Äôs better to be neutral.  The thing is that the Lukoil Pension Fund receives diverse opinions.  The organization is distributed throughout the country, in each branch there are different employees.  Therefore, in some regions it is indeed possible to encounter not the best workers.  No one is safe from this.  Nevertheless, Lukoil is trying to quickly rectify the situation, getting rid of unprofessional personnel and apologizing to its visitors. <span><br></span> </p><h2>  Deceivers or not? </h2><p>  Some accuse NPFs of fraud.  And there are a lot of such opinions.  All this is due to the fact that people suddenly discover their funded parts of pensions at Lukoil.  But it is noted that the person did not sign any contracts personally.  Accordingly, there is a suspicion of misappropriation of money by a non-state pension fund. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lukoil Guarantor License" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1526257.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Lawyers and experienced citizens say that there is no illegality.  That is, the Lukoil Pension Fund operates within the framework of the established legislation.  Surprises with the discovery of pension savings in the company under study are found mainly in officially employed persons.  Such negative situations occur due to the fact that Lukoil enters into cooperation agreements with employers.  All subordinates automatically transfer accumulative pension contributions to NPF Lukoil-Garant.  But the employer should notify about it.  A non-state pension fund does not assume this responsibility.  Therefore, you should not blame the organization for fraud. </p><h2>  About Payments </h2><p>  The last nuance that customers pay attention to is the payment of pension savings.  In this area, the Lukoil Pension Fund is not receiving the best reviews.  Rather, they are ambiguous. </p><p>  Some say that pension payments occur on time and without any negative aspects.  And someone says the opposite.  Moreover, there are more negative opinions than positive ones.  The population says that pension payments are delayed.  In some cases, you have to repeatedly ask the organization to make transfers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf Lukoil reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1526260.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Draw conclusions </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing?  NPF Lukoil receives different reviews.  In general, this is a good non-state fund, but with its own shortcomings.  It can be said for sure that Lukoil-Garant offers stable, albeit small profitability, as well as the reliability and security of pension savings. </p><p>  This company has problems with payments.  But they cannot be avoided 100%.  Accusing Lukoil-Garant of dishonesty is not worth it because of delays in payments. </p>
