Compensation for contracts concluded before 1992</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Payments anticipated under insurance contracts that were signed before 1992, the state attributed to domestic debt to the population.  Registration and collection of documentation necessary for the calculation and subsequent payment of compensations is carried out by the Rosgosstrakh insurance company.  She was appointed the full assignee of the insured "Gosstrakh" of the USSR. </p><p>  To process requests that come from the population, a special unit was created, called the Settlement Center for Compensation Payments.  This office is located in the city of Ryazan, and it is it that has the corresponding responsibilities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1954546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/1954546.jpg?1547054418"></div><p>  This article will discuss the compensation payments of Rosgosstrakh. </p><h2>  Official data </h2><p>  Rosgosstrakh does not make compensatory payments on its own and is only an intermediary (operator) between the insured person and the state.  Thus, the main responsibility of the center is to collect and process requests from the population.  Direct payments are made by an organization such as the Federal Treasury. </p><p>  In order to apply to the RCCV, it is necessary to prepare a package of certain documents, and then send it via the Russian Post by registered letter.  At the same time, a request for receipt of delivery notice will not be out of place.  A letter of inquiry should be sent to the official address of the organization: 390046, Ryazan city, Vvedenskaya street, house 110. The recipient is required to indicate the RCCC.  This center is one for residents of the whole country; it accepts applications regardless of the region in which the insurance contract was concluded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How are Rosgosstrakh compensated? </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1954540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/1954540.jpg?1547054418"></div><h2>  Scheme of work </h2><p>  The RCSC ‚ÄúRosgosstrakh‚Äù first receives documents from the citizen, and then performs their registration.  After that, a search and entry into a single database is carried out, the amount of the compensation payment is calculated, which is laid in accordance with the documents provided.  The next step is to fill out a special application for payment of compensation. </p><p>  Documents are considered no more than two months. </p><p>  The RCSC draws up an application, and then sends it to the Regional Department of the Federal Treasury in the city of Ryazan.  This department makes direct compensation payments from the state budget.  Money is transferred to the bank account indicated by the applicant. </p><p>  It should be noted that before submitting documents for payment, a citizen should check with his bank whether the contract for the provision of services involves the transfer of additional amounts or whether such an action is prohibited. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1954541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/1954541.jpg?1547054418"></div><h2>  Who is eligible to claim insurance compensation at Rosgosstrakh? </h2><p>  In accordance with the fifteenth article of <span>federal law</span> No. 415 of 12/19/2016, the state guarantees the continuation of the payment of compensatory compensations under accumulative insurance contracts that were concluded by citizens before the onset of 1992.  Only one condition must be observed: the insured amount (redemption) should not have been paid before 1992. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thus, persons who filed insurance contracts before the beginning of 1992 have the right to submit documents for processing the compensation payment.  Citizens who have concluded contracts with the Gosstrakh insurer and their receivers can also receive compensation.  However, the citizen must have all the necessary documents. </p><p>  RCCV works exclusively with citizens of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  What documents are needed to receive compensation from Rosgosstrakh? </p><h2>  Drafting a statement </h2><p>  Specialists working in the RCSC are strongly advised to check the date of conclusion of the contract: whether this was actually done before 1992. In addition, clarification of the insurance group is required.  It can be children's, retirement, wedding and mixed.  Rosgosstrakh deals with payments only for these insurance groups. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1954542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/1954542.jpg?1547054418"></div><p>  First of all, in order to register a compensation payment through Rosgosstrakh, it is necessary to write a statement.  A directly insured person, as well as a person having a notarized power of attorney, has the right to compose it. </p><p>  When writing an application, a citizen should state the situation in more detail and list all the documents that he attaches.  In the event that the corresponding record is not found in the database, the insurer has the right to request additional documents.  In this case, you will have to attach to your copy of the insurance certificate an extract from the place of work about insurance contributions made every month.  The application form can be downloaded from the official website of the intermediary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Package of required documents </h2><p>  The list of necessary documents for obtaining insurance compensation at Rosgosstrakh is quite extensive.  A citizen will need to attach to the application: </p><ul><li>  Copy of the passport of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Insurance policy.  It can be replaced by an extract from the personal account or an explanatory note, which can be obtained from the insurer. </li><li>  Confirmation of recount.  In 1991, a 40 percent increase in insurance premiums was made. </li><li>  If a citizen changed his surname during the insurance period, then supporting documents are required. </li><li>  If the application is drawn up by the heirs, then a copy of the death certificate is required. </li><li>  A document confirming the citizenship of a deceased person.  For this, a certificate from the registry office, the FMS or from a notary is suitable. </li><li>  Documents that confirm the right of inheritance. </li><li>  Current details of the bank account, if it is supposed to be transferred to the account, or a notification from the Russian Post, if the money will be withdrawn through this organization. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1954543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/1954543.jpg?1547054418"></div></li></ul><h2>  Where to send paper? </h2><p>  Papers must be sent using a registered letter to the address that we indicated a little higher.  An alternative is to personally bring the package of documents to any department of Rosgosstrakh. </p><p>  After the Center considers the citizen‚Äôs application, he will notify him of the possibility of receiving compensation at Rosgosstrakh (insurance was issued before 1992) and the terms during which the payment will be made.  If during the examination it turns out that the applicant has not provided all the necessary papers, then he will receive a letter containing a request to submit documents that are missing.  Judging by the feedback from consumers about compensation payments, only the statement itself should be sent to the organization first.  And after receiving a response, send a package of required papers. </p><h2>  Volumes of compensation payments </h2><p>  When calculating compensation before 1992, Rosgosstrakh relies on some rules.  Firstly, if the applicant was born before 1945, he will receive the amount that remained on his account until 1992, tripled.  The only thing from the amount will be deducted payments that were received earlier.  If the applicant was born from 1946 until 1991, then the balance of the account doubled is payable.  So says the amount of compensation "Rosgosstrakh." </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1954544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/1954544.jpg?1547054418"></div><p>  If the assignee submits the application, then he can count on receiving compensation for the money spent on funeral services.  This rule applies if the contributor died from 2001 to 2016.  The total amount of such material assistance will be no more than six thousand rubles.  In the event that the contribution of the deceased insurer exceeded 400 thousand rubles, the assignee may receive compensation for the entire amount spent on the funeral.  Alternative option - the policyholder will offer the applicant the amount of the account balance increased by 15 times.  Compensation for Soviet insurance at Rosgosstrakh is easy to obtain. </p><p>  When calculating compensation payments, the value of money in 1991 is taken into account. </p><p>  The amount of compensation may also depend on the date when the insurance contract with Gosstrakh was terminated.  The RCSC considers each case individually.  The applicant will be informed only of the amount of funds payable and the time period for its implementation. </p><p>  If the applicant needs more detailed information, then he can contact the special RCCV hotline.  Before making a call, you will need to prepare all the documents that can confirm the oral information. </p><p>  What are the nuances of calculating compensation for Soviet insurance at Rosgosstrakh? </p><h2>  Reducing factors </h2><p>  All <span>decreasing coefficients</span> along with compensation amounts are regulated by law.  They depend on such a factor as the duration of the insurance contract.  The coefficient can be from 1 to 0.6, more detailed information can be clarified by telephone hotline. </p><p>  For example, if the contract was valid until 1995, and in the same year the payment was made, then a reduction factor of 0.9 will be applied.  If the contract was terminated in 1992 and the payment was received in the same year, another downward coefficient will be used - 0.6. </p><p>  Where can I write an application for payment of compensation to Rosgosstrakh?  We will talk about this later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1956733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/1956733.jpg?1547054418"></div><h2>  Compensation through a bank </h2><p>  Today, it is possible to make all compensation payments through Rosgosstrakh Bank.  He has been working in the financial sector for over 20 years and occupies a leadership position.  If the applicant draws up compensation for Rosgosstrakh to an account opened with this bank, then he should take into account the following nuances: </p><ul><li>  A bank account will be opened automatically after receiving the application.  That is, any additional steps to open an account will not be required. </li><li>  The Bank announces that the compensation payment has been credited via SMS message or registered letter.  However, the applicant will not incur additional costs. </li><li>  Money can be withdrawn from the account at any additional branch of the bank or at the post office of Russia, showing only a passport. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that consumers on compensation payments at Rosgosstrakh Bank leave completely positive reviews.  The only desire of customers at the moment is the ability to remotely execute documents. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  Experts advise not to delay the submission of a request to the RCCV.  The main reason is the lack of legislatively established deadlines for considering applications and the procedure for the implementation of compensation.  Each year, the Government determines the amount to be allocated for compensation payments. </p><p>  In practice, every year, by the beginning of autumn, there are many outstanding applications due to a lack of funds.  As a result, the RCSC is forced to suspend the receipt of documents until a new order of the Government of the Russian Federation is received.  For example, this year the state allocated more than eight billion rubles for compensation payments. </p><p>  So, we have examined the compensation payments of Rosgosstrakh. </p>
