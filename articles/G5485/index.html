    <p>  In cases where it concerns products with some defects that the seller did not notify the buyer, the latter has the right to demand the return of the spent amount, free elimination of the defect, reimbursement for the restoration of the product, a significant reduction in the sale value or replacement with another equivalent product . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Poor quality </h2><p>  Before demanding a refund to the card when <span>returning the goods, it is</span> necessary to understand what exactly can be regarded as a marriage.

    <p>  It must be remembered that a refund for goods purchased with a card is made on the basis of its inconsistency with the requirements prescribed in officially valid GOSTs.  Also, the consumer can return a thing back to the store that does not satisfy him with his equipment, colors, dimensions or shape. </p><h2>  Refund period for goods on the card </h2><p>  Everything is important to do on time.  For example, if the consumer returns the product within the first fourteen days after its purchase, it will be much easier for him to deal with the seller.  According to the current legislation, before the expiration of this period, you can return not only a defective item, but also one that was purchased in good condition.  A person who is not happy with something may demand his money back.  To do this, he needs to write an official complaint to the director of the store.  It should contain an accurate description of the problem.  After that, the seller must return the purchase price within three days.  In addition, low-quality products can be sent to the seller throughout the warranty period. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Those who want to understand how to demand a refund on the card when returning the goods will be interested to know that the manufacturer has the right not to reimburse the cost of the defective item, but to pick it up for repair.  Especially it concerns those cases when the warranty period has expired.  Money can be claimed only when the manufacturer does not fit within the twenty-day period prescribed by law. </p><h2>  How to recognize low-quality products? </h2><p>  Those who care about how the money is returned to the card after the return of the goods should understand that for this they will have to observe several mandatory conditions.  One of them is the presence of defects that allow you to require that the product be taken back to the store according to your written claim. </p><p>  The seller must exchange the item or refund its full price, subject to the availability of: </p><ul><li>  defects that appeared during the manufacturing process; </li><li>  deficiencies arising from the transportation of products to the place of their sale; </li><li>  the actual discrepancy between the appearance of the product and its configuration to the exhibited sample; </li><li>  incorrect specification of product specifications. </li></ul>

    <p>  Also, the basis for a refund may be the presence of mechanical damage that does not allow the use of all the functionality of the product. </p><h2>  What requirements should the returned product meet? </h2><p>  Each buyer has the right to demand that the store takes back the previously purchased thing, which: </p><ul><li>  have not been in operation; </li><li>  retained proper presentation; </li><li>  has all the original properties; </li><li>  It has all the labels, seals and packaging. </li></ul><p>  In addition, the return of goods is not always possible.  Not every purchase can be returned to the store.  At the legislative level, a list of goods not subject to exchange and return has been developed.  This list contains items of personal hygiene, medicines and cosmetics. </p><h2>  Action algorithm </h2><p>  Those who have every reason to demand that a refund be made to the card when returning the goods, <strong> </strong>  can safely contact the seller and initiate the documentary procedure.  According to the laws in force, in order to get the money spent back, the consumer must provide the seller with the product itself, a sales receipt or cashier‚Äôs check, a <span>warranty card</span> and a document identifying the buyer. </p>

    <p>  In addition, you will also need a bank card with which you paid for the purchase.  The dissatisfied consumer will also have to make a corresponding claim statement, which will detail the reasons for the return of the product.  A sample can be requested from the seller.  Usually they have blanks of such statements. </p><p>  In turn, the seller must draw up an appropriate act on the reimbursement of cash to consumers.  After completing all the necessary documentation, he will be able to return the money using a bank transfer or give it to the buyer through the cashier.  As a rule, no more than ten calendar days pass from the moment a claim is written until the amount is credited to the card.  For those who <span>paid</span> for the purchase <span>in cash, the money</span> will be refunded on the day the product is returned. </p>
