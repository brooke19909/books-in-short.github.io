  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bus stations in Ryazan: description, addresses, services, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ryazan is one of the largest cities in Russia.  According to historical documents, it was founded in the eleventh century.  More than five hundred thousand people live here, and more than ten thousand tourists come annually.  The city has a large number of temples, historical monuments, cultural attractions and other interesting places.  Today we will introduce you to Ryazan bus stations.  After all, it is here that tourists and locals come and leave from here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="outgress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Bus Station" class="if uuid-3204715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/3204715.jpg"></div><h2>  Bus station "Central" (Ryazan) </h2><p>  This place is considered one of the business cards of the city.  A huge number of people come here from different parts of Russia.  And many residents of the city use the “Central” bus station to travel.  Most often they leave from here to Moscow, as well as to other cities.  There is one hall in which there are armchairs for relaxation, and, in addition, a number of ticket offices.  Help desk is working.  The necessary information can also be obtained by phone, his number is on a special site.  Tickets can be bought in cash and by bank transfer, which is very convenient.  After all, many people use plastic cards. </p><p>  There are eleven landing platforms at the bus station.  Ten of them carry passengers to various cities.  Among them: <span>Lipetsk, Voronezh,</span> Moscow and other areas.  And one platform serves for the landing of visitors to the city of Ryazan.  This institution has its own website, where you can find information about the bus station, as well as purchase an electronic ticket. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Address: Moscow highway, 31. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rusmania.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="prioksky bus station" class="if uuid-3204722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/3204722.jpg"></div><h2>  Bus station "Prioksky" (Ryazan) </h2><p>  The building is small, but there is everything you need for those who go on the road.  Ticket offices where you can purchase tickets in cash and non-cash.  ATMs where it is easy to withdraw the required amount of money.  There is a cafe on the territory of the bus station where you can thoroughly reinforce your strength in front of a long road.  All information about any bus flights is recorded on an electronic scoreboard, which is clearly visible even from afar. </p><p>  Address: Oksky Prospekt, 35. Opening hours: 05.20-21.00. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.foursquare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bus station addresses in Ryazan" class="if uuid-3204723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/3204723.jpg"></div><h2>  Passenger reviews </h2><p>  Bus stations in Ryazan leave a very pleasant and positive impression.  There are only two of them, but they are doing quite well with their tasks.  On the Internet you can find a variety of opinions about the work of Ryazan bus stations.  Among the advantages, passengers usually include the attentive and polite attitude of employees, cleanliness of rooms, a convenient electronic display, punctuality of drivers and much more. </p><p>  Some people leave negative comments about the work of bus stations in Ryazan.  Among the shortcomings include a fairly large distance from the train station and the lack of additional amenities. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.63460269999999" data-lng="39.76465659999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/0/1/8/17018.png"></div><p>  In general, the Ryazan city administration pays enough attention to bus stations.  But I would like them to listen to the individual comments of passengers, so that more active work was carried out to eliminate the shortcomings that we have already talked about.  We hope that Ryazan bus stations will cause only positive emotions and will become a decoration of the city. </p>
