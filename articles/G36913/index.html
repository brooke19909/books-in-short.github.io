  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is better to buy a secondary housing or a new building?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><br><br>  Remember, after putting the house there, for another two years at least the sounds of a drill and hammer knocking will sound. <br><br>  Many people basically want to live in new homes.  And they often don’t even think about what moral difficulties they have to face. <br><br>  How does an adventure called "house in a pit" begin.  "House in the pit" is when they handed over the money, but there is nothing in the ground besides the pit.  Nearby is construction equipment, and people walk in the clothes of builders. <br><br>  Risks in life are everywhere, but here they drag on for a couple of years.  By the way, often they pay with builders apartments instead of salaries.  This is to be prepared for neighbors who may not work for you intellectually. <br><br>  Before giving the money, you should definitely see in the picture made on the computer what the yard will be and how much space is allocated for parking cars, if you have one.  Then imagine that each of the tenants will have at least one car and understand the chances of evening parking.  And just in case, ask if she is nearby so as not to be nervous every day.  After you learn this, find out how to get there, and what time is public transport if you do not have a car.  Often in advertisements do not talk about these nuances. </p><p>  If you decide to buy an apartment in a new building, we advise you to pay attention to New buildings in Mytishchi from the developer on the website <noindex>  <span>http://7888265.ru/</span> </noindex>  . <br><br>  It is important to know how the area adjacent to the house will be ennobled, whether there will be landscaping of the yard, a playground and a place for walking dogs.  If you choose a house by the lake or canal, do not forget to ask how underwater behave. <br><br>  When everyone knows and you are comfortable, you need, by the way, to clarify the house management will be your own or you will be deducted to the "city".  It happens that people are confronted with the fact that the boiler room is its own and therefore the heating is more expensive than in ordinary houses, which can unexpectedly upset you very much.  The difference is about one and a half times more expensive. <br><br>  It happens that the elevator service is paid, or the elevator is generally turnkey.  If guests come to you without a key to the elevator, they simply cannot get into it. <br><br>  You paid the money and you have a couple of years ahead to set aside or make money for repairs and furniture.  In the event that the developer meets the deadlines and on time will hand over the house to the balance of the city. <br><br>  Dust in and around the porch will often appear the first couple of years until the tenants finish repairs.  In general, the sounds of repairs stretch for 5 years. Not everyone gets apartments to live.  Many for the purpose of resale after repair. <br><br>  Of course, it is up to you to decide, but as practice shows, so far the secondary raw materials are famous for their reliability, and have been tested by time, which cannot be said, unfortunately, about all new buildings. </p></div></article>
