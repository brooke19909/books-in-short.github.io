    <h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  I must say that in Niriides <span>Hotel 4 * (Rhodes)</span> fairly low prices for rooms.

So, for example, a double room with two beds will cost 48 thousand rubles for two (for three - 50,000) for seven nights.  The apartment has all the conditions for a good rest and healthy sleep: air conditioning, excellent soundproofing, fully equipped bathroom, free internet access.  And the indicated price also includes half board.  In an improved double room, the cost for two will be about 50 thousand rubles.  The apartments are more spacious and have a plasma TV.
