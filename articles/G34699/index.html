    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  Knitting arose a very long time ago.  For years, people have come up with and saved up various patterns and techniques.  One of the oldest is the technique of “aran knitting needles”.  Schemes of such drawings first appeared on the Irish islands.  Women living there knitted sweaters with original patterns for husbands.  Most of the population was engaged in fishing, so dense, warm things were simply necessary. </p><p>  Each family living in Ireland at that time created its own unique pattern.  From it one could easily find out which village the fisherman was from.  “Arana” became the basis of Irish culture.  In the complex, unique interweaving of strips and "cones" - deep symbolism and hidden meaning. </p><p>  And to this day, knitting ("arana") has not lost its relevance.  Their schemes are original, unique and original.  They are decorated with many warm things - sweaters, hats, scarves, mittens.  They are ideal for both men and women of any age. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Execution technology </h2><p>  Many people think that “arana” and “braids” are one and the same thing.  But this is not so.  "Braids" include only one type of loop, their weaving regularly.  When performing the pattern “Arana” with knitting needles, the schemes often contain a large number of elements.  In drawings, movements or crossings bizarrely intertwine with bounding loops.  In some patterns, bumps may occur.  That is why it is sometimes difficult even for experienced needlewomen to correctly knit according to this pattern. </p>

    <p>  A huge number of symbols and signs can confuse anyone.  Before you begin to work, you need to carefully study all the designations necessary to complete the pattern of "Arana" with knitting needles.  Schemes are almost never alike.  There is no unified system for designating knitting elements.  Therefore, the needlewoman must be extremely careful not to dissolve the canvas. </p><p>  Of great importance are the devices used in the knitting process.  Many cross loops by simply holding them with their fingers.  But, if there is no certain dexterity, you can miss them.  In addition, this method is absolutely not applicable when crossing blocks consisting of more than three loops.  That is why the craftswomen resort to the help of pins or an extra knitting needle.  It is most convenient in this case to use a specially designed tool.  It is a knitting needle that is pointed at both ends and has a bend in the center that prevents the loops from slipping. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next, we will consider in more detail the elements that are most often used in drawing up the “arana” pattern with the needles of the scheme. </p><h2>  Crossed loops </h2><p>  Crossed loops are the basis with which the patterns of “arana” are made with knitting needles.  Schemes often contain only an abbreviated description of their implementation: to cross any number of loops in a certain direction.  However, not everyone knows how this technique is performed. </p>

    <p>  Crossing loops will be pronounced if it is tied to the wrong side.  That is, to obtain the background, it is necessary to knit the <span>wrong loops</span> in odd rows <span>,</span> and the front ones in even rows.  In this case, the tracks themselves are formed on the front side of the canvas with facial loops.  Let us consider in more detail the intersection of four loops left and right.  The direction in this case indicates which direction the slope will be. </p><p>  In order to cross four loops to the left, it is necessary to remove 2 loops on an additional knitting needle without knitting, and leave it in front of the canvas.  Then, knit the next 2 stitches in the front stitch and, returning to the additional knitting needle, also stitch out stitches from the stitches.  The only difference when performing crossing with an inclination to the right is that the deferred loops are left behind the knitted fabric. </p><h2>  Loops </h2><p>  When performing the “arana” pattern with knitting needles, the pattern and description of the pattern may contain a technique called “looping loops”.  It is quite simple and quickly mastered even by inexperienced knitters. </p><p>  You can wrap one or more loops.  The most commonly used single wrap loop.  For its implementation, the needle is inserted into the gap behind the last winded loop and the working thread is pulled.  After this, the first loop on the left knitting needle is knitted face and stretched through an elongated loop.  The remaining loops in girth are knitted according to the pattern. </p><h2>  Bumps </h2>

    <p>  Getting to know, if you want to perform “arana” with knitting needles, with schemes, needlewomen often come across circles, which are described in the description as “bumps”.  Their execution requires some skill.  First, the indicated number of loops is tied from one loop, alternating between the front and the back.  Then, constantly turning the knitting, perform the desired number of rows on the resulting "bump".  After that, all the loops that make it are knitted together. </p><h2>  Tips &amp; Tricks </h2><p>  It is important to remember a few tips before you start knitting “arana” with needles.  The schemes and description can be quite detailed, but without the use of the recommendations of experienced craftswomen, the work can drag on for a long time. </p><p>  When choosing yarn, it should be borne in mind that “Arana” is best knitted from plain threads.  In this case, the relief and pattern will be favorably emphasized.  The consumption of yarn for such patterns is greater than for a smooth canvas.  It is better to take this into account at the stage of purchase. </p>

    <p>  Special marks can help not to stray when knitting a canvas with a large number of sections of various patterns.  They are put on a knitting needle between the loops of individual patterns, and in the process of knitting they are simply thrown from a knitting needle to a knitting needle.  If knitting is too tight, crossing the loops can be very difficult. </p><p>  “Arana” require knitters not only skill but also patience.  However, the result is worth the time. </p>
