Since the price of the device is low, you should not expect too much from it.  The Scarlett SC-037 coffee maker does not have a water level indicator, but do not take this as an obvious minus, because the manufacturer assures of comfortable home use of the device, it will not work for serving the flow of people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The compact, convenient and easy-to-use coffee machine Scarlett SC-037 is capable of creating a vapor pressure of 4.3 bar, which is quite enough for home use.  The power of the device is 800 watts.  The size of the flask for water is not too large, but you can cook about 3-4 cups of your favorite aromatic drink.  The operating mode is adjustable in two positions: coffee and cappuccino.  The model is very easy to operate, does not require special care.  The coffee maker has a special drip tray.  Any housewife will appreciate the new kitchen assistant, not only for its functionality, but also for its modern design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="espressadiko.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cappuccino and coffee" class="if uuid-2925479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102731/2925479.jpg"></div><p>  So, let's start with the numbers that will help you to present in more detail the dimensions of this model of coffee maker.  The volume of the flask for water is 200 ml.  Dimensions of the device: 326 √ó 170 √ó 330 mm.  Only ground coffee is used, but this does not affect the quality of the drink.  The model in question can neither perform self-cleaning nor heating cups, although this cannot be called disadvantages, because the price of the device is indecently low. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Scarlett SC-037 is the perfect coffee machine, and it won the hearts of many buyers with its price, design and the ability to make cappuccino.  Most of the reviews are extremely positive, every second consumer praises the coffee maker for the speed of preparation of drinks and the infinitely long operation of the filter.  One of the most frequent negative reviews is that the water flask is too small. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ek.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Compact and convenient coffee maker" class="if uuid-2925482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102731/2925482.jpg"></div><p>  Many customers claim that after a while using this coffee maker, the taste of coffee worsens and the brewing function is intermittent.  It turns out that bolted connections quickly weaken, and water trickles through the joints, and pressure does not form.  You just need to tighten the bolts, perhaps during transportation the assembly of the coffee maker was slightly damaged, and the fasteners were loosened. </p><p>  For continuous operation of the cappuccino function, you need to monitor the cleanliness of the nozzle, which is located at the end of the tube.  When milk is heated, it quickly clogs.  But, as with any device, you need to monitor it and repair it in time to enjoy the taste of your favorite drink longer. </p>
