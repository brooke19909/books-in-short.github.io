In today's world, you can find decor for any part of the body.  And in all cases there are certainly flowers.  Beauties in ancient times decorated themselves with flowers, they decorate themselves with them now.  And in this article we will consider the master class ‚ÄúFlower of Satin Ribbons‚Äù, which came to us from Japan and has recently gained more and more popularity. </p><h2>  What is Tsumami Kanzashi </h2><p>  Kanzashi is a hairpin made of wood or bone, which Chinese girls fastened their hairdo.  When she fell into the hands of Japanese beauties, they began to decorate her in every possible way.  It was believed that decorating themselves with fresh flowers, the girls drove away evil spirits.  But living plants die very quickly.  That is why Japanese masters learned to imitate them using finest silk and rice glue in their work.  The work is so jewelry that sometimes one small hairpin can cost you a fortune.  And masters who are able to perform such beauty are considered the national Japanese treasure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="master class flower of satin ribbons" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/788296.jpg" width="350"></div>  Of course, contemporary art has undergone a number of changes.  Now its basis is a <span>flower made of satin ribbons with their own hands, the</span> master class of which is discussed below.  And this was reflected not only in materials, but also in folding methods, but it has successfully taken root in the current needlework world and is developing all the time.

On their basis, this or that flower is created from satin ribbons with your own hands.  A master class of such a product is the basis of any jewelry created using the kanzashi technique.  Sharp petals can be with or without a hole, and even double or single.  A round petal can also consist of two halves of different colors.  One of these halves is always smaller than the other.  Based on the petals, more complex and interesting options are created.  Such as, for example, a spiral petal with a curl.  In general, there are a large number of derivatives of both round and sharp petals. </p><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  It is necessary to prepare slightly to make a flower of <span>satin ribbons.</span>  A kanzashi workshop will require some materials and tools.  First of all, you will need tapes.  The materials from which they are made should be selected based on what you want to get in the end.  For example, for round petals, crepe satin is best suited.  Petals come out of it more tender.  But from sharp petals, a flower from satin ribbons with your own hands will perfectly turn out.  For beginner needlewomen, this is the best option. </p><p>  Using satin ribbons is easier.  They are easily scorched and almost do not deform.  But there are also disadvantages.  Among satin ribbons, it can be difficult to choose the necessary shades.  Great petals come from organza.  Its disadvantage is too high flowability.  In addition to the ribbons, you will also need scissors, tweezers, a candle or a lighter, a needle and thread matching the tone of the ribbons, and glue.  It will be good to use the "Crystal" or hot melt. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Flower made of satin ribbons.  Master class (kansashi) </h2><p>  If you decide to master the kanzashi technique, you should carefully consider what you need.  Do not immediately gain a lot of everything, if you still have not decided exactly how much you are interested in this occupation.  Do not grab onto very complex things right away.  Choose something very simple if you are going to create a flower from satin ribbons with your own hands for the first time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY Satin Ribbon Flower for Beginners" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/788297.jpg" width="234"></div>  For beginner needlewomen, a small flower in one row of sharp petals is perfect.  By the way, for training it is not necessary to use a satin ribbon.  Take any simple material that is not thick and does not roll too much.  Or purchase a small amount of tape five or seven centimeters wide.  Cut it into squares of the right size and fold the sharp petals so that they can already be used to make a flower from satin ribbons with your own hands.  Schemes for folding such petals are similar to each other.  According to the same algorithm, completely different flowers can be obtained.

    <h2>  Kansashi Chrysanthemum </h2><p>  Chrysanthemum is a very <span>beautiful flower,</span> and in natural conditions has many color options.  It consists of a large number of petals.  In the kanzashi technique, there are several options for creating this flower.  Chrysanthemum is like a flower made of satin ribbons, the master class of which is located below, has several layers and is suitable as an ornament for any flat surfaces.  But such a flower can also be convex if you glue the petals in a single layer on a spherical surface. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Preparing to create a Chrysanthemum </h2><p>  To create a flower from satin ribbons, the master class of which is described below, you will need to collect the necessary materials.  Firstly, you need a tape that has a width of two and a half centimeters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="satin ribbon flower master class" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/788298.jpg"></div>  Or rather, the sharp petals made of it.  Secondly, this is the base on which the petals will be attached.  It can be a plastic ball wrapped in cellophane.  In this case, the flower will be concave on the back side.  But the master class ‚ÄúA Flower of Satin Ribbons‚Äù, which will be used to create a chrysanthemum, suggests using a multi-level cardboard blank made from cardboard circles of different sizes.  And you also need tweezers and glue.

    <h2>  Master class "Flower of satin ribbons."  Petal technique </h2><p>  In this section we will look at how the very unit is created, the element from which any of our products will then be composed.  At this stage, you will have to stock up on some patience.  And this is due to the fact that it will take a lot of petals to create a flower from satin ribbons with your own hands.  Naturally, chrysanthemums are very rich in petals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY satin ribbon flower master class" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/788310.jpg" width="215"></div>  But we still strive to accurately recreate all the natural beauty of this flower.  So, to create a petal, you should cut the ribbon into squares.  Now the square needs to be folded along one of the diagonals of the square and then again twice in the fold line.  You get something like a <span>right triangle,</span> which should be folded in half again.  Now clamp all the layers with tweezers and scorch them with a lighter or a candle.  If you want to get narrower petals, then you need to slightly trim them from the bottom.  The main thing here is to trim all the petals equally.  You can make all the petals of one color or combine several colors.

    <h2>  Flower assembly </h2><p>  When all the elements are created, the flower from satin ribbons using the kanzashi technique will be quite easy to put together.  If the flower should consist of several layers, then several cardboard circles of different sizes or one multi-level blank are used.  First, the smallest diameter of the upper layer of the flower is collected, then from below it closes with a larger circle, turning the flower with its face to it, glue the next layer of petals, placing them between the petals of the first layer.  When creating the second row, make sure that the shape of the flower is not broken.  Thus, you can grow as many layers as you want.  You can collect multilayer chrysanthemum in another way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="satin ribbon flower kanzashi master class" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/788299.jpg"></div>  A self-assembled <span>flower from satin ribbons, the</span> photos of which are presented in this master class, is located on one multi-level blank.  But that is not all.  Chrysanthemum can be collected using a ball base.  With this method, the flower will come out more airy, and most importantly, it will weigh less than previous versions.  It is necessary to select a plastic ball that is suitable in size and cover it with a plastic bag.  First, we collect the middle of the flower with a thread and glue it on the ball.  In this case, the <span>glue gun is</span> best suited, because hot melt adhesive quickly hardens.  Glue the next row, placing the petals between the previous ones.  Gluing each row, place it so that the petals fit as tightly as possible to the surface of the sphere.  This can be continued indefinitely.

But also various pendants, laces, sequins and sequins are used.  Acrylic paints are often used to paint the petals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself satin ribbon flower" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/788294.jpg" width="385"></div>  The middle of the flower can be made using artificial flower stamens.  In addition to flowers, you can use artificial leaves or those that are also made using the kanzashi technique.  Using various decorative elements, you can create excellent compositions, the center of which will be a flower of ribbons.

They do not like dust, so you should store such jewelry in a bag or box that you can close.  To increase the wear resistance, spray the flowers from the ribbons with hairspray.  Moreover, such a varnish should be strong fixation.  Do not pull on individual parts of the composition and sleep in these jewelry.  It is also not recommended to walk in them in the rain or snow.  If the flowers get wet, the colors may change.  If clues appear on the petals, you need to burn them with a lighter, then the product will look good again.  Over time, dust deposited on the flowers should be removed.  This is done with a hand wash.  To wash the product, you need to dilute a few drops of shampoo in warm water to form a foam.  Now gently rinse the jewelry and wipe with a cotton swab especially contaminated places.  Rinse again, but already in clean water.  In no case should you use brushes so as not to cling to the surface of the petals.  Dry only when flat.  To do this, you can lay the product on a flat surface or hang it.  When everything dries, sprinkle the petals with hair spray. </p><p>  The master class ‚ÄúFlower of Satin Ribbons‚Äù considered in our article will help you recreate all the beauty of nature with your own hands.  And you surround yourself with the grace and beauty of beautiful flowers that retain their charm for a long time. </p>
