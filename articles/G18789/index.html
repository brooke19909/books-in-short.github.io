When collecting stems, pay attention to their color, length and elasticity.  For weaving, straws of cereals such as rye should be used.  You can use wheat stalks, but they are more thick and rough.  Use oatmeal to make small items.

    <p>  Before work, the material should be well dried.  Otherwise, it will begin to churn and rot.  Straw can be stored in boxes and in bunches only after ventilation and drying.  Also, it should be thoroughly cleaned from dust. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Before starting work, the stems must be processed.  That is, you should fill the straw with warm water for half an hour (or several hours, if last year‚Äôs material), cover with plastic wrap or a simple cloth and press down with some kind of load.  This process lasts until the stems are soft and supple. </p><p>  If you are going to do some kind of artistic decoration of the paintings, you may need to bleach or stain the elements.  This is not at all difficult to do.  For example, to lighten elements, use regular bleach for natural fabrics.  For coloring, you can apply the calcination method, as well as aniline or natural dyes.  Thanks to this, the product will turn out to be very beautiful and bright.  During the procedure, soda should be added to the solution to fix the color. </p><p>  Last of all, iron the elements along the fibers. </p><h2>  What are ‚Äúpellets‚Äù and what are they used for? </h2>

This material is quickly restored and, when ignited, gives a sufficiently large amount of heat.  So, it can be used for heating rooms instead of wood.

However, as a heating material, they are much superior to sawdust in terms of heat transfer and economy.  The fact is that the composition of the granules contains a lot of volatile substances that provide long-term burning of the material.  The material presented does not require special storage conditions.  The fact is that it is very resistant to moisture, rot.  The only drawback is the high ash content of pellets.  However, the waste is environmentally friendly. </p><h2>  Features of straw weaving </h2>

It is desirable that the surface is dry and hard.  In order for it not to be damaged, be sure to lay an oilcloth on it.  You may also need such tools and materials:

During operation, observe safety precautions as much as possible.  Before you begin, you must definitely think over the product that you want to build, choose the method of its manufacture, and also draw a sketch on paper. </p><h2>  What are the ways to weave straw products? </h2><p>  There are several methods for connecting elements: straight, spiral, flat and three-dimensional.  To apply the first method, a <span>loom</span> is required <span>.</span>  The straws can be flattened.  The products that result are used as rugs, panels or individual elements for more complex crafts. </p><p>  In spiral weaving, a bundle of straws is wrapped tightly with twine.  Then they need to be laid in tight turns.  If the product is large, then the tourniquet should be thick. </p><p>  The last two weaving methods are quite simple.  For work, you need separate straws.  At the same time, they need to be flattened well.  To do this, just swipe the blunt end of the knife several times over them.  Weaving from straw is not only a great way to decorate your home.  Through the process, you can show your imagination, relax and get moral satisfaction. </p><h2>  Construction of thatched houses </h2>

In some countries, houses are built from it.  At the same time, housing has many advantages: good sound and thermal insulation, low cost of walling, environmental cleanliness, good ventilation of the structure.  And the construction is quick enough.

    <p>  The material for the construction should be absolutely dry so that over time it does not begin to decay.  For work, wooden beams are used (as the frame of the house, as well as for the roof truss system <span>), straw</span> bales, concrete mortar (for making the foundation), roofing material (for insulation of straw from the base).  It will also be necessary to use other materials for the subsequent decoration of the structure.  Bales are attached to each other with the help of bent reinforcement, which is installed in each corner. </p><p>  First of all, the frame of the house is built.  To do this, the beams are mounted at the corners of the previously marked area, as well as in those places where doors and windows will be installed.  Now you can proceed to stacking the bales.  The evenness of installation must be constantly checked by level and level. </p><p>  In order for the corners of the structure to be smooth, make special brackets of wood.  Before making a house out of straw, try to pick up bales of the right size.  You cannot force them into the remaining gaps.  Therefore, the elements must have different lengths. </p><h2>  Features of the construction of the goby and horse from the presented material </h2>

For example, often children are interested in how to make a horse out of straw.  For work, you will need three main bundles of material: from the first we make the head neck and front legs (divide it into two parts down), from the second - tail and trunk, and from the third hind legs will be built.  These elements are connected by twine.  For mane you will need additional straw. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <p></p>
    <p>  So, first you should bandage the first bundle from one edge, then it must be turned out.  Next, the twine separates the head and neck of the future horse.  Here you must observe the proportions.  .  Then a small part of the straw bends to the side at a right angle to the head (the body will be attached to it).  From the remaining material make the front legs.  The rest of the horse is constructed in much the same way.  Lastly, a mane, ears and tail are attached. </p><p>  If you do not know how to make a bull from straw, then the principle of construction is the same as that of a horse.  Only additionally it will be necessary to twist the horns. </p><h2>  What crafts can be made from straw? </h2>

Making the simplest product is not too difficult.  For example, before you make crafts for the Christmas tree from straw, try to learn how to construct various types of geometric shapes.  For example, to build a square, you need to bind the straws at right angles.  Then the prepared frame is wrapped with flat elements.  Drawing depends on your imagination.

    <p>  For more complex figures, it will be necessary to make a cross, which is subsequently braided with a straw ribbon.  In addition, from such materials you can build beautiful braids of various sizes and shapes that will decorate any thing or panel. </p><h2>  Features of making dolls </h2>

To work, you need straw, scissors, colored threads (sometimes wire), a brush and paints (for decoration).  First, the straw needs to be bundled, bent in half and bandaged closer to the edge.  This will be the head of the doll.  Be sure to consider the proportions of the crafts.  Next, on each side, separate a small bundle of material.  Their ends should be cut and bandaged.  Now you have your hands ready.
