And this means that it is time to think about warm accessories.  However, many people are not used to being content only with the warmth of the product.  It is also important for them that the purchase effectively beat the winter bow.  For this reason, in the current article we will talk about how to knit stylish mittens for lovers. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Before starting work, it is extremely important to think over the desired product.  Choose a pattern or pattern for mittens, and then go shopping for yarn and knitting needles.  Experienced craftsmen say that there can be no advice on designing an idea.  Therefore, each needlewoman can safely rely on her own taste.  But acquiring material and tools, you need to be extremely careful.  First, mittens for lovers knit for the winter.  Therefore, preference should be given to warm wool yarn.  Secondly, for accessories with a complex pattern, it is more reasonable to choose a plain knitting thread.  But a simple pattern can be beaten with unusual yarn.  Thirdly, knitting needles should be chosen only after buying a thread.  Because the diameter of the required tool is indicated on the coil.  Otherwise, the pattern or drawing will turn out to be sloppy, and the product itself will not warm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="mittens for lovers step by step" class="if uuid-2986703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2986703.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of taking measurements </h2><p>  When buying mittens for lovers in the store, we are guided only by the size of accessories.  At the same time, we do not care with what parameters they were implemented.  We just take and try on the thing we like.  But if we have to knit mittens on our own, it is important not only to find out what measures are needed, but also to correctly remove them.  To do this, prepare a centimeter tape.  Then we measure the following parameters: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  girth of the wrist; </li><li>  distance from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger; </li><li>  distance from the wrist to the base of the thumb; </li><li>  girth of the palm with the thumb pressed; </li><li>  girth and thumb length. </li></ul><p>  You can consider the points of measurement of the necessary parameters for knitting mittens for lovers in the photo below.  All parameters taken must be fixed on paper.  If desired, you can draw a hand and indicate the measurements directly on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="we knit mittens" class="if uuid-2986701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2986701.jpg"></div><h2>  Calculation of the parameters necessary for work </h2><p>  Measuring the palm will not help much when translating ideas into reality.  And all because it is extremely inconvenient to knit, constantly comparing each step with a centimeter.  And this is not to mention the fact that even dialing loops will be extremely problematic.  Therefore, experienced masters advise beginners to turn to mathematics and translate centimeters into loops and rows.  The task is quite simple: </p><ol><li>  First, we knit a sample of the selected pattern.  Traditionally, mittens cuffs are decorated with a single elastic band, and after that the main pattern follows.  For this reason, it is required to knit two square patterns (10 x 10 cm) - one for each pattern. </li><li>  After we count the loops and rows in the samples. </li><li>  Divide each value by 10. </li><li>  Loops are multiplied by horizontal measures, rows by vertical. </li></ol><p>  All the parameters necessary for knitting mittens for lovers with knitting needles are always fixed on the diagram. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bizator.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mittens for lovers description" class="if uuid-2986707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2986707.jpg"></div><h2>  We knit single mittens </h2><p>  Needleworkers who knit simple mittens can easily perform this part of the product.  For beginners, we offer a detailed and step-by-step master class: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we prepare hosiery knitting needles. </li><li>  We collect the number of loops equal to the circumference of the wrist. </li><li>  We distribute into four knitting needles and with the help of the fifth we knit with a single elastic band of cuffs, moving in a circle and gradually knitting mittens for lovers. </li><li>  In the next row add loops. </li><li>  To do this, we subtract the current ones from those that are equal to the girth of the palm with the thumb pressed. </li><li>  We find out the number of additional loops. </li><li>  Distribute them evenly.  That is, at regular intervals. </li><li>  We knit a row with additional loops. </li><li>  Next, we knit a number of rows equal to the distance from the wrist to the base of the thumb. </li><li>  Separate from the total number of loops those that are equal to the girth of the thumb. </li><li>  We knit the product until then, until the end there are 7 rows left. </li><li>  Divide the total number of loops by 7 to find out how many decreases per row. </li><li>  Based on our calculations, we finish the work. </li><li>  In conclusion, we tie the thumb to the desired length. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.bizator.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="we knit mittens for lovers" class="if uuid-2986705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2986705.jpg"></div><h2>  Knit double mittens </h2><p>  It is much easier to make paired mittens for lovers, as it seems to many beginning masters.  The main thing is to follow the instructions and then there will be no problems with the work: </p><ol><li>  First of all, according to the technology described in the previous paragraph, we knit two identical cuffs (elastic + a row with additional loops). </li><li>  Then we connect the two parts into one common, knitting a row in a large circle. </li><li>  Since in this case you don‚Äôt have to knit your thumb, you will be able to complete the creative process much faster. </li><li>  From the junction to the moment when there are 14 rows left to the end, we knit, moving in a circle, without making increases and decreases. </li><li>  Then we also divide the total number of loops by 14. </li><li>  Reduce the stitches and finish knitting. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit mittens for lovers" class="if uuid-2986706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2986706.jpg"></div><p>  That's all the features of the technology.  There is absolutely nothing complicated in it, so even novice masters can make an original and romantic gift to their soulmate. </p>
