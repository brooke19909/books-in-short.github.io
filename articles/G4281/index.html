The American company provides financial services through agents in other countries.  Read more about how to get Western Union translation in Russia and Ukraine, read on. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Western Union was founded in 1851 by a group of businessmen from New York.  At first, the management was engaged in the redemption of bankrupt telegraph stations, combining them into one network.  In 1860, the company won a tender to create a transcontinental 2000-mile line.  In 1866, the system was connected to the stock market.  The first money transfer was made in 1871.  This segment will become the main specialization of the company in subsequent years of development.  In 1914, debit cards appeared.  In 1920, the first transatlantic transmission of photo images was carried out.  Since 1981, the company entered the international market and now provides funds transfer services in all countries of the world.  Money can be sent through the system even to a neighboring city. </p>

    <h2>  More about the system </h2><p>  The principle of operation is to assign a unique code to the translation by which the recipient can be identified anywhere in the world.  Transfers are instantaneous - funds are available for withdrawal within a few minutes (sometimes hours) after the application is formed. </p><p>  In fact, the money is paid before they are actually transferred to the bank to the recipient, and then mutual settlements between credit institutions are carried out.  The main advantages of the system are the speed of information processing and a wide network of service points. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get a Western Union translation? </h2><p>  Transaction conditions are highly dependent on the legislation of a particular country.  Firstly, the Central Bank sets limits on domestic and international transfers.  Citizenship is also of great importance - for non-residents, the limits are often overstated.  The system accepts dollars and euros for transfer, but transactions within the same state are carried out in the national currency.  Currency conversion (send rubles, receive euros) will have to pay extra.  Tariffs are set separately for each region, but the sender always pays the commission. </p>
