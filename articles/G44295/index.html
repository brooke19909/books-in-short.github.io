    <p>  Consider mutual funds - one of the most profitable areas offered under the Sberbank Premier program.  What is it, try to parse in order.  The main value of the proposal is that it allows you to personally experience all the advantages of stocks and bonds.  Funds invested in <span>mutual funds are</span> supervised by professional managers.  The unit holder may not independently monitor the situation on the market, may not analyze it, and may not make decisions regarding the purchase and sale of securities.  The ratio of the expected level of profit and profitability of the product will depend solely on which securities are poured into assets: in stocks, bonds or both assets simultaneously.  Premier Sberbank offers to do all the basic work for the investor.  Thanks to the collection of investments in one asset, experienced managers collect the most profitable and differentiated, economically stable portfolios. </p><h2>  Compulsory medical insurance - offer only to the elite </h2>

    <p>  Clients of the program can become owners of depersonalized metal accounts or CHI, which are calculated in grams of metal.  Profit from this type of deposits is derived from changes in the value of precious metals in the international market.  This offer from Sberbank Premier receives only positive reviews, which has a certain connection with the advantages that it offers.  The main advantage of the program is the complete absence of VAT and difficulties with metal storage.  The likelihood of theft and damage to property is completely excluded, since the grams of the precious metal are virtual.  All incoming and settlement operations for each of the accounts are carried out very simply.  The offer is indispensable for conservative investors who pay quite a lot of attention to risk sharing and invest in Sberbank products.  A Premier deposit in the compulsory medical insurance format with gold made for a long time is a great opportunity to increase your capital with almost no risk.  As for silver, platinum and palladium, such MHIs are more suitable for investors with good experience. </p><h2>  Dominant Investment Rules </h2>

    <p>  Serving privileged customers at the highest level is not the only thing that Sberbank offers.  The Premier contribution to the Deposit + Mutual Investment Fund product is available to the VIP sector when investing from 100 thousand rubles.  It is worth focusing on the fact that the size of the investment deposit, which is included in the product structure, can be all 50%.  Funds spent on the acquisition of shares must either be equated or exceed the size of the deposit itself.  Under the program ‚ÄúDeposit, mutual funds and compulsory medical insurance‚Äù, the minimum amount of investment should be equal to 150 thousand rubles.  The size of the ‚ÄúPortfolio‚Äù deposit should not exceed 33.3% of the funds on the account.  At the same time, the size of investments in units or in CHI must either correspond to the volume of the deposit or exceed it. </p><h2>  Interest Rates, or Rate of Increased Income </h2><p>  The Sberbank Premier service offers partnership conditions that are very attractive.  For example, interest rates for the Investment and Portfolio programs are an order of magnitude higher than for standard deposits.  Depending on the specifics of the product and the duration of investing in it, the percentage can vary from 7 to 12.5% ‚Äã‚Äãin rubles.  Charging to the account is carried out in case of increase in the value of quotations for securities and precious metals.  The ratio of risk and profitability can easily be regulated by the acquisition of a certain type of depersonalized metals and shares from different mutual funds. </p>

    <p>  Premier Sberbank Bank (branch for privileged customers) provides for certain partnership conditions.  Deposits are drawn up for a short term: 1 month and 1 day, 3 months and 1 day.  All other deposit prolongations are available under the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù program.  When the term of deposit programs expires, they can simply be closed.  A more profitable option is the expectation of an increase in the value of assets in the international market with a view to their further sale at the highest possible value.  Each complex product is accompanied by individual investment programs. </p>
