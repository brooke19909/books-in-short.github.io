However, with the construction of the dam, the population of species began to decline sharply.  The first dam, located on the Iset reservoir, caused the death of many representatives.  Unfortunately, the installation of dams touched almost all (even mountain) rivers, so the number of fish inhabiting other streams is reduced to this day.  The rarest species of vertebrates, such as grayling, taimen, nelma, are found only in Tavda and its large tributaries.  The remaining rivers of the Sverdlovsk region are not impressed by the species diversity. </p><h2>  Main rivers </h2><p>  The subject of the state, the center of which is Yekaterinburg, includes more than 50 water flows.  All of them differ in size, nature of the flow, parameters, etc. But among them, nevertheless, one can distinguish leaders by their length.  Large rivers of the Sverdlovsk region: Iset, Sosva, Ufa and some others. </p><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  Fishing in these places is good.  The bottom of the rivers is very unstable, the rises are constantly replaced by depressions.  And this allows you to choose fishing places and "sort" them according to the desired species.  Also, the rivers of the Sverdlovsk region allow you to travel by boat, so you can get into the new backwater area.  In such bays, a large number of waterfowl are often found. </p><h2>  To go </h2><p>  This water stream is the left tributary <span>of the Tobol River.</span>  It captures several territories at once - Sverdlovsk, Tyumen and Kurgan regions.  The length of the channel is more than 600 km.  In the upper part, the coast is mostly covered with cliffs and forests.  There are destroyed dams, parts of which must be destroyed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sosva </h2><p>  Sosva flows only in the Sverdlovsk region, the right tributary of the Tavda River.  The length is also more than 600 km.  Like other rivers of the Sverdlovsk region, it is one of those where fishing is allowed.  In the upper reaches of the stream there is the Denezhkin Stone Reserve Fund.  Belongs to the Kara Sea basin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rivers of the Sverdlovsk region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1134096.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ufa </h2><p>  The river belongs to the Volga.  It is the right and largest sleeve of the Belaya River.  Ufa flows through the Sverdlovsk region, captures the Chelyabinsk region and Bashkiria (named after its capital).  Its total length is almost 1000 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="large rivers of the Sverdlovsk region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1134095.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tour </h2><p>  One of the most popular rivers and the second longest is the Tura River (Sverdlovsk Region).  Fishing, which often ends with unprecedented success, is not the only reason for the popularity of this stream.  It is known for its history and the beauty of landscapes.  Since the Tour is one of the largest rivers in the region, it is navigable.  As you know, it was from here that the chieftain Yermak began the conquest of the <span>Siberian Khanate.</span>  Also along the river was the famous Babinovskaya (Gosudareva) road, which lost its due significance after the construction of the <span>Siberian-Moscow highway.</span>  In the 19th century, deposits of gold and platinum were discovered on the tributary of the Tura.  Then a village was built on this place.  And the gold rush began.  Even now there are travelers who are trying to find a piece of gold on the banks of the river. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plants and animals of the river tour of the Sverdlovsk region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1134092.jpg" width="600"></div>
