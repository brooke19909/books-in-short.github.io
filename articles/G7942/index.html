This is hard to believe, but Schwepp's invention of 1783 is considered to be the first such device.  In many ways, this is surprising because machine guns came to the USSR many times later and became popular since the 1950s. </p><h2>  What is it about? </h2><p>  Those who do not know what they are talking about should explain what exactly is a soda machine.  In the USSR and other countries, the so-called trading apparatus, which prepared and sold carbonated drinks.  The base for such soft drinks was a saturator that produces carbon dioxide in liquids. </p><p>  The appearance of the machine was due to Thorburn Ulaf Bergman, who just developed the saturator.  Later, this apparatus was improved and became an industrial device for supplying mineral water.  Johann Jacob Schwepp worked on such an invention in 1783.  It was thanks to this German specialist that a sparkling water machine appeared in the USSR. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Almost all machines operated on the same principle.  Inside was a water cooler, a saturator, and syrup containers.  Thanks to them, a drink was obtained.  For dispensing a liquid, a water distributor was used.  It was also necessary to take care of the pressure of water and gas, so a special relay was invented. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet machine gun" class="if uuid-3250765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3250765.jpg"></div><p>  There was also a carbon dioxide cylinder, thanks to which the saturator saturated the liquid.  Some machines received a display, a control panel and a coin acceptor.  All this made it possible to choose, order and pay for the desired drink.  All this complemented the mechanism for issuing lemonade. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First appearance </h2><p>  The Soviet sparkling water machine appeared approximately in 1932.  In one of the Moscow newspapers there was information that the employee Agroshkin made an interesting invention.  Journalists wrote that the first saturator is already ready for use and is located at a specific address. </p><h2>  Active use </h2><p>  But they began to actively use sparkling water machines in the USSR only in the early 1950s.  Already then in Moscow it was possible to find more than 10 thousand automatic machines.  Their main advantage was the location of the devices in almost every public place. </p><p>  The devices worked in a certain season: from May to September.  In winter, they were protected from adverse conditions by a special metal ‚Äúcover‚Äù.  They gained popularity due to the fact that they were available, and drinks were sold cheaply.  Therefore, in the summer a line could be gathered for them. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Soda water vending machines in the USSR offered two drinks: carbonated water without syrup cost 1 kopeck, and with syrup it cost 3. A little later, it was decided to add a few flavors for the syrup.  So there was apple and pear syrup and cream soda. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.3dexport.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="USSR automatic machine for selling sparkling water" class="if uuid-3250763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3250763.jpg"></div><p>  Many users noticed that for a drink with a high concentration of syrup, it was necessary to remove the glass from the machine before it was filled to the top.  This was due to the fact that at first the dispenser served all the syrup, and then added ordinary carbonated water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, the cost in some regions could be different.  For example, in the Georgian SSR, devices took 5 kopecks, but poured a double portion of syrup. </p><h2>  Types of machines </h2><p>  At that time, two types of devices were produced: under glass (AT-100C, AT-101C) and cardboard (AT-102) glasses. </p><p>  Automatic machines with glass cups had a special design, which included a separate device for washing containers.  It consisted of a metal grill and a gate valve.  It was necessary to use an inverted glass as a lever for pressing.  At this point, a jet of cold water rinsed the container. </p><p>  Of course, this washing method had a drawback: the outer side of the glass, to which the lower lip of the person touched, was not washed in any way, so the saliva remained on the glass.  Despite such seemingly unsanitary conditions, there were no officially known cases of infectious diseases.  The machines themselves, according to the standards, should have been washed with hot water and soda. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soda water machine" class="if uuid-3250762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3250762.jpg"></div><p>  Soviet production was established, so the machines were produced almost identical design.  Saturators worked with a freon compressor refrigeration unit.  For their work, it was necessary to connect through the power grid, as well as to the city water supply. </p><h2>  Using </h2><p>  Soviet-era sparkling water machines could stand alone or in a group.  As a rule, the complexes included more than five automatic machines, and nearby was a special item for exchanging coins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pond5.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coin acceptor" class="if uuid-3250766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3250766.jpg"></div><p>  It was also possible to discover a whole pavilion in which the sale of sparkling water was organized.  Such points could be located in very crowded places, for example, at VDNH. </p><p>  The appearance of the machines also did not change much over all the years of its existence.  But still, they tried to introduce some minimal changes.  For example, back in the 60-70s, the devices had rounded corners, chrome parts, moldings, advertising windows.  The case itself was often red.  Already after the 70s, devices with right angles, a calm light gray color and a concise inscription began to appear. </p><p>  By the way, practically no one stole glass glasses themselves.  The only exceptions were people who wanted to drink alcohol on the street.  Sometimes such a container was replaced with a metal one and chained with its chain. </p><h2>  Features of devices </h2><p>  It was later discovered that such machines can be fooled.  Some tied a coin on a fishing line, lowered it into a coin acceptor, and then pulled it out.  It was also possible to find washers of suitable dimensions. </p><p>  The plot of "Jumble" told about one of the most absurd secrets.  One of the episodes was dedicated to a soda machine.  It turned out that you can hit it well, and water will pour for free. </p><p>  There were also free devices, which were usually located in specially designed places.  For example, in fire departments or in special industries.  Such devices were not equipped with a coin accepting mechanism.  People could choose water, soda and a serving of salt.  The latter was given so that anyone who sweats excessively could make up for the salt content in the body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet-era sparkling water machine" class="if uuid-3250764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3250764.jpg"></div><h2>  The emergence of new drinks </h2><p>  Later, other drinks began to appear in soda machines.  Devices began to offer juices, beer and wine.  A glass at that time cost 15 kopecks.  During the 1980 Olympic Games, they began to sell licensed Fantu.  Later in some regions appeared the drink "Tarhun". </p><h2>  Current situation </h2><p>  Since then, there have been not only photos of sparkling water machines in the USSR, but also shots from popular films: ‚ÄúThe Most Charming and Attractive‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Adventures of Shurik‚Äù.  But the production of automatic machines in the post-Soviet space has become unprofitable. </p><p>  They stood broken for a long time, and afterwards they were scrapped.  Partially affected by vandalism.  Some machines were no longer in automatic mode ‚Äî they were serviced by a special employee who took banknotes and gave a cup. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hiveminer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sparkling water apparatus" class="if uuid-3250769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3250769.jpg"></div><p>  Now, to meet such a machine will be for happiness to everyone who is nostalgic for that time.  Some companies are trying to repeat the Soviet design.  Modern machines accept coins and paper bills. </p>
