The project includes the construction of ten multi-panel panel houses in the territory of the Lyubertsy city district.  In this article we will tell you how to get to this place, about the construction company and the deadline for the completion of houses. </p><h2>  About the complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="lyubertsy.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential complex Lyubertsy Park" class="if uuid-3077567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077567.jpg"></div><p>  LCD "Lyubertsy Park" has a number of characteristic features that immediately demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of this project.  The main disadvantages of these houses is that they are built of panels, the apartments do not provide loggias and balconies.  At the same time, they are already being finished with fine finish, and in a pleasant place, nearby is Natashinsky Park. </p><p>  A number of attractive infrastructure facilities are planned to be built on the territory of the Lyubertsy Park residential complex.  This is a school, kindergartens, clinic, parking.  Currently, the company sells in new buildings of studios, as well as one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments.  It is important that the developer is a large Moscow developer PIK group of companies, which we will talk about in more detail. </p><p>  This is a standard project that can attract a relatively convenient location and proximity to the park.  It is important that the company builds houses according to its own set of rules.  For example, their residential complexes are always easy to recognize by the bright colors of their facades and minimalistic architecture.  For the developer, the Lyubertsy Park residential complex in Lyubertsy is an ordinary project.  At the same time, new buildings are classified as a comfort class, houses are built on the principle of quarterly development of europanels.  Entrance groups are located at ground level.  It is noteworthy that in parallel with housing, social infrastructure facilities are being commissioned that will be relevant and necessary for new residents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  LCD "Lyubertsy Park" is located next to two large ponds and <span>Natashinsky Park,</span> about four kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road. </p><h2>  Address </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.702669" data-lng="37.886113199999954" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/3/0/7/14307.png"></div><p>  The residential complex itself is located in the suburbs between Natashinsky park and Ukhtomsky village. </p><p>  The construction site is located on the site of the former military unit, near the Kamov Helicopter Plant.  To the south of the high-rise buildings is Lermontov Avenue and railway lines.  The Moscow Ring Road is just four kilometers from the Lyubertsy Park residential complex. </p><p>  The sales department is at the construction site.  Address LCD "Lyubertsy Park" - Moscow region, the city of Lyubertsy, March 8, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhouse number 16.  The office works without breaks and days off from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.  Managers are always ready to give you all the necessary additional information, introduce you to the layout, additional information, available floor plans, help you choose the option you need, and, if necessary, arrange a mortgage. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to the residential complex by public or private transport.  If you decide to go by car, then the best option is to get through Kosinskoe highway.  Departure to it is located about one and a half kilometers from the residential complex.  You will be able to get to the Kosinskaya flyover without traffic jams in about ten minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An alternative is about 25 minutes to get from the Third Ring Road to new buildings on Ryazansky Prospekt. </p><p>  By public transport you can get to the residential complex per meter.  About two and a half kilometers from the residential complex is the Lermontovsky Prospekt station on the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya line.  It is worth noting that this is one of the busiest lines of the metro.  True, it is worth recognizing that this option is unlikely to be suitable for new settlers, since walking to the station is about half an hour, and there are no direct flights of ground public transport to the metro. </p><p>  But you can take a minibus or bus to the Vykhino station, located on the same line.  Travel time is about 25 minutes. </p><p>  Another option to get to Moscow is to use the train.  One and a half kilometers from the apartment buildings is the Ukhtomskaya passenger platform.  From here, you will reach the Kazan Station in just half an hour. </p><p>  In the future, in the immediate vicinity of the residential complex, a new metro station "Luhmanovskaya" of the Kozhukhovskaya line should appear.  Before it will be less than two kilometers.  The main lobby will be built at the intersection of the Lyubertsy-Veshnyaki highway with Lukhmanovskaya Street. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kvartirny-control.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction progress LCD Lyubertsy Park" class="if uuid-3077582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077582.jpg"></div><p>  According to the general plan, the residential complex will consist of ten panel high-rise buildings, of which two residential blocks of variable number of storeys and eight tower houses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the summer of 2018, the sale of apartments began only in the first building.  The deadline for the residential complex Lyubertsy Park is the third quarter of 2021.  Mass settlement is planned for the end of 2020. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="novostroev.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about LCD Lyubertsy Park" class="if uuid-3077569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077569.jpg"></div><p>  The developer of the residential complex "Lyubertsy Park" is a group of companies "PIK".  This is a well-known construction holding in the country, which by decision of the federal government was included in the list of backbone enterprises for the domestic economy.  The company is represented in ten regions of Russia.  Among the most famous objects that have already been implemented by her, the residential complex Putilkovo in the Krasnogorsk district, Orange Park in Kotelniki. </p><p>  The developer "Lyubertsy Park" "PIC" in the domestic market since 1994.  He specializes in affordable housing.  At the moment, the company has already commissioned about 19 million square meters of housing.  About 300 thousand people live in these apartments. </p><p>  Since 2007, the developer "Lyubertsy Park" "PIC" entered the stock market.  The company strives to adhere to international standards in corporate governance, which in every way contribute to the successful development of the business.  Since 2015, a group of companies entered the market with fundamentally new products of monolithic and industrial housing construction, radically changing the formation of the internal living environment of complex development areas. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pronovostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residents reviews about LCD Lyubertsy Park" class="if uuid-3077566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077566.jpg"></div><p>  The residential complex attracts many with developed infrastructure in the district.  Directly next to the new buildings are five kindergartens and four schools.  However, the density of buildings around is very high, so even with such diversity it will be difficult to find free places. </p><p>  Also, a five-minute walk from the residential complex is the city hospital, nearby is the house of culture with a workshop of ceramics and painting, the Iskra sports complex with an adjacent stadium.  To the large shopping center "Traffic Light" about two kilometers. </p><p>  Own additional infrastructure is provided on the territory of the residential complex.  Two kindergartens with 350 and 220 places, respectively, will be built here, a secondary school for more than a thousand students, a clinic for 155 visits per shift. </p><p>  The appearance of the first kindergarten is planned in the winter of 2020, the clinic should open in the third quarter of 2021, and the school should accept the first students in the fall of 2022. </p><p>  The center of leisure and relaxation in the district should be Natashinsky Park.  On its territory there are fountains, two large ponds, moorings.  In summer, you can rent catamarans and boats, sunbathe on the beach.  In addition, the park has sports and playgrounds, attractions, a rope town, stables, a mini-zoo, snack bars and summer cafes. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vsenovostroyki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews from real estate investors about LCD Lyubertsy Park" class="if uuid-3077580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077580.jpg"></div><p>  Several large industrial facilities are concentrated in Lyubertsy itself, but they should not have much influence on the complex itself, since it is being built around a greened private sector and a park.  New buildings will be located in the center of a residential area, away from major highways. </p><p>  However, the residents still have something to be afraid of.  In the immediate vicinity of the new buildings is located the Kamov Helicopter Plant, owned by Rostec State Corporation.  Modern helicopter models are developed here, and experimental models are constantly tested.  At the same time, the company does not engage in mass production, so it does not pose a special threat to the environment. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><div class="photo" data-original="novostroyman.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New buildings in the residential complex Lyubertsy Park" class="if uuid-3077581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077581.jpg"></div><p>  The apartments that are currently for sale have an area of ‚Äã‚Äã20 to 80 square meters.  It is worth emphasizing that they are all without balconies and loggias.  This is the main feature of most projects from the PIK group of companies, and this residential complex was no exception. </p><p>  The rest of the housing is quite comfortable.  Available studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments.  Prices in the LCD Lyubertsy Park are the most affordable, especially when you consider that they include decoration. </p><p>  For example, the cost of a one-room apartment of almost 39 and a half meters will amount to 4.1 million rubles.  A standard two-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 56 and a half "squares" costs 5.2 million rubles, a three-room apartment is sold at a price of 5.7 million rubles with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 65 square meters.  Traditionally, the most affordable option is studio apartments.  You can get ownership of 27 "squares" for 3.2 million rubles. </p><h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  All apartments here are sold with fine finish according to a standard project from the developer, which is made in neutral colors.  The apartments have everything you need to move, you just have to get furniture. </p><p>  Layouts exist the most diverse, in total more than 45 options.  At the same time, the developer decided on certain experiments, expanding the choice of "pseudo-twin" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã37-38 square meters, which in reality are the most common "Euro-twin". </p><h2>  Technology </h2><div class="photo" data-original="lyubertsy.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Developer LCD Lyubertsy Park" class="if uuid-3077570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3077570.jpg"></div><p>  All new buildings in this residential complex will be panel.  For projects of such a significant scale, a widespread technology is used when the hulls are assembled from concrete slabs like a designer, which significantly increases the speed of construction. </p><p>  If we talk about performance, the modern panel that is used is inferior to monolithic technology in noise and heat insulation.  In winter it is too cool, you can clearly hear everything that the neighbors are talking about. </p><p>  The developer rents the house with plastic windows with double-glazed windows.  On the facades there are steel baskets designed for external air conditioning units. </p><p>  The architectural concept is presented in a standard minimalist style for PIK.  The cladding is made of ceramic tiles of different colors, the facades are of the same type.  During construction, quarterly development is used, when enough space is left between the buildings to organize a closed courtyard. </p><p>  Sports and game complexes, recreation areas with benches, small architectural complexes and street lighting are equipped in the adjacent territories.  The courtyards of the project will be landscaped - there will be shrubs and trees, flower beds. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In the reviews of the residential complex Lyubertsy Park, equity holders who have already made a choice in favor of this builder note that there is a real opportunity to purchase decent housing at an adequate price.  It is important that the project is aimed at different segments of the population, among them young families with children, students, and pensioners.  The main advantages are the park next door and the relative availability of the metro. </p><p>  Also the pluses include proximity to the Moscow Highway, reasonable cost, turnkey delivery of apartments. </p><p>  Among the negative aspects, it is worth highlighting the absence of balconies and loggias, the late construction of infrastructure, kindergartens, a school and a clinic will appear when most of the buildings have already been completed. </p>
