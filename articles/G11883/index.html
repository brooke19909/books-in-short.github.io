One of these devices is the air-grill cap from the popular manufacturer Redmond.  First of all, this is an optional accessory for a multicooker.  But judging by the reviews, the universal redmond aerogrill lid can be used with any heat-resistant cookware of suitable diameter.  The most important condition is that the tank can withstand the effects of high temperatures. </p><h2>  The new all-rounder in the kitchen </h2><p>  Judging by the manufacturer‚Äôs statements and user reviews, the Redmond air grill lid can replace a number of technical kitchen appliances: </p><ul><li>  an oven; </li><li>  <span>electric grill</span> ; </li><li>  toaster; </li><li>  a microwave; </li><li>  electric oven. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pleer.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="multicooker grill" class="if uuid-2272052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2272052.jpg"></div><p>  As a result, you can save not only on energy consumption, but also free up a fairly large space in the kitchen.  Ideal for small apartments or student dormitories.  In addition, the air grill solves the issue of the acquisition of other equipment, since it simply disappears. </p><h2>  Standard equipment </h2><p>  In a package of durable cardboard, together with the main device, there are: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  gratings 6 and 2 cm high, each diameter 19 cm; </li><li>  lattice 2 cm high, diameter 16 cm; </li><li>  tongs for gratings; </li><li>  cookbook with recipes; </li><li>  stand; </li><li>  rubber mat for hot dishes (depending on model); </li><li>  rubber expander ring (depending on model). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="multivarka.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="redmont air grill packaging" class="if uuid-2272063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2272063.jpg"></div><p>  To cook a main course, meat or fish with a side dish, it is enough to immediately install a couple of wire racks.  It is important to take into account that when using deep-frozen products for proper cooking, it is necessary to increase the cooking time.  The thicket where the products are laid is not standard. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  As a heating device in the aerogrill, a halogen heater is used, which is mounted in a glass cover made of heat-resistant glass.  There is also a fan that distributes heat.  On the top of the lid are mechanical regulators - temperature and runtime.  The handle serves as a button on / off the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ixbt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cooker hood redmont" class="if uuid-2272050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2272050.jpg"></div><h2>  Work system </h2><p>  Thanks to its lightweight and versatile controls, the universal air grill lid has gained great popularity among modern housewives of various ages.  All that is required to prepare a dish using this appliance is: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  to lay the necessary products, pre-installing the lattice; </li><li>  set the required temperature and cooking time.  The remaining grill will do it yourself. </li></ul><p>  How to use the Redmond air grill lid is described in sufficient detail in the instructions.  Cooking occurs due to the effects of hot air.  When choosing a container for installing the device, you must remember that the distance between the products and the lid should be at least 2 cm. Otherwise, the food will burn from above and remain moist inside.  The temperature range of 125-250 degrees makes it possible to cook not only meat or fish, but also fragrant vegetables that will preserve all the vitamins.  In addition, there is an additional function that will help to quickly defrost food. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tehnosektor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="air grill cover redmont" class="if uuid-2272049" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2272049.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews, with a cover-redmond grill, you get very tasty meat, fish, vegetables (sliced ‚Äã‚Äãin a thin layer).  Almost like a fire, only without a characteristic smell.  For whom it is critical - you can use liquid smoke, but from the point of view of the usefulness of the products, they should not be abused. </p><h2>  The main advantages </h2><p>  Based on the many reviews of the Redmond airgrill lid, the following series of positive features were installed: </p><ol><li>  Cooking fatty meat varieties, vegetables, cereals has now become possible without the need for oil.  Thanks to this, the dish does not contain carcinogens, which negatively affect the state of the digestive tract. </li><li>  For people who support a diet, such a device will come in handy.  Cooking lean and tasty foods with it is quite easy and simple. </li><li>  To store the device does not need a large amount of space.  It fits compactly even in a small kitchen.  In addition, when using it, there is no need to purchase other devices. </li><li>  Now, to cook meat, fish or vegetables on the grill, there is no need to wait for good weather, since the device is intended for home use. </li><li>  It can be used to get a crisp, even if the dish has already been cooked, for example, in a slow cooker. </li><li>  The device is easy to operate. </li><li>  It can be used with any heat-resistant cookware of suitable diameter. </li><li>  No splash.  For example, when cooking bacon in a pan, you often have to wash not only the dishes, but also everything around it.  With the universal redmond grill lid, the housewives are exempt from this job. <div class="photo" data-original="cookdevice.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hot grilled sandwiches" class="if uuid-2272055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2272055.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  Since the air grill contains a heating element, it is necessary to use the device in accordance with safety precautions: </p><ol><li>  Avoid contact with other types of dishes that are unstable to high temperature conditions. </li><li>  Own manipulations should be controlled to avoid burns. </li><li>  Install the air grill exclusively on a flat surface. </li><li>  When the lid starts to work, it should not get wet. </li><li>  It is necessary to protect children from a working device in order to avoid injuries and burns. </li><li>  It is forbidden to include an air grill together with a working multicooker at a temperature regime above 150 ¬∞. </li></ol><p>  It is recommended to lay a special silicone mat, included with most models, on the work surface.  This will protect the countertop from possible damage, as well as organize a safe cooking process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.multivarka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="roof grill equipment" class="if uuid-2272047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2272047.jpg"></div><p>  Cooking takes a considerable amount of time, so you should think about uninterrupted power supply in advance to avoid damage to equipment.  Thanks to the self-cleaning function, the user will not need a large amount of time to wash the device.  It is recommended to wash it only after it has completely cooled down. </p><h2>  A few secrets of cooking </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews about the Redmond air grill lid, its main advantage is the fact that with it you can cook absolutely any dish. </p><p>  Most importantly, there is no need to add oil.  At the same time, the products retain their taste, and most importantly, the health of their owners, alleviating the burden on the cardiovascular system. </p><p>  To make meat or fish cook evenly, some housewives who have already managed to get used to this appliance recommend using foil.  Cooking time, of course, increases, but the dish turns out to be juicy and retains most of the vitamins. </p><p>  And although manufacturers claim such a function as steaming, according to reviews of many users, it is not effective enough in this device. </p><p>  Newly made owners of such a device should understand that it will be necessary to experiment with time and temperature conditions.  Different varieties of meat, fish and vegetables require an individual approach. </p><h2>  The issue of acquisition and choice </h2><p>  As a rule, there are no questions about where to buy the Redmond air grill lid.  This kitchen accessory is sold both in specialized network stores of the manufacturer and in universal hypermarkets for household appliances.  The average cost of the device - from 1500 rubles, depending on the technical characteristics and configuration.  You can save on a purchase by considering the profitable online offers of popular online stores.  For example, at a discount at Yulmart, the Redmond airgrill cover will cost the buyer only 1,100 rubles. </p>
