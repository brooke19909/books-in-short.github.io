Phuket, beaches, hotels: photos, prices and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You have not visited the tropical island of Phuket with stunning natural beauty?  In this case, you still have to enjoy the trip!  All ahead.  And for a more complete sense of pleasure, it is worth staying at the Lamai Guesthouse 3 * hotel.  And do not think that a three-star hotel will not satisfy your needs.  Why?  You will find the answer to the question in the material of the article. </p><h2>  Phuket attracts exotic and beauty! </h2><p>  The picturesque tropical island of Phuket belongs to the Kingdom of Thailand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand hotels Phuket" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/589872.jpg" width="600"></div>  Located in the west of the country and washed by the waves of the Indian Ocean.  A direct flight to the island makes the trip comfortable and attractive.  Numerous bays with beaches provide conditions for lovers of a relaxing holiday on the sea coast, and for lovers of active water and land entertainment.

    <p>  If you plan a trip to the island of Phuket in October, then there is the opportunity to witness the holiday - the day of Chulalogkorn, a holiday in honor of King Lama the Fifth - and see a grandiose <span>fireworks festival.</span>  It is worth noting that the entire period, from October to February, is the most comfortable for visiting the island.  Its tropical flavor and exotic lifestyle of the local population will long beckon to return to this mysterious territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Wonderfulness" paradise </h2><p>  Why, then, among all the variety of <span>islands in Thailand</span> (Koh Samui, <span>Koh Chang,</span> Phi Phi), is it worth choosing this one? </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Firstly, on this island, unlike those around it, it has its own airport, so the transfer will not be long, there are no transfers from flight to flight, which is often terribly tiring. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Secondly, the nature in Phuket is simply magnificent, and the cleanliness of the sandy beaches is amazing.  In addition, you can relax on the island all year round - Phuket in October and April will be equally attractive. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Thirdly, the island is the most developed resort (after Pattaya) and has excellent infrastructure.  While resort areas on other islands are only developing, besides admiring the natural beauties, there is nothing more to do there. </p><h2>  Rest in the guest house </h2><p>  A popular accommodation option today is the so-called guesthouse.  Places where guests of the country come to take a break, spend the night and refreshment.  As a rule, guesthouses do not have their own territory or developed infrastructure on it.  But living in such a hotel will be inexpensive and quite comfortable, and breakfasts (they work on such a concept of food) will be delicious. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket in october" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/589874.jpg" width="600"></div>  Guesthouses are rarely located on the first coastline, more often on the second.  It's not scary - a walk lasting seven minutes has not killed anyone yet.  It‚Äôs even good - the hotels are located a bit far from the promenade and from the noisy streets, so sleep and rest will be calm.  Naturally, for your stay you can choose a chic five-star hotel.  But this may not be a pleasure.  In order to study the entire infrastructure of the hotel, you will have to spend a lot of time without having time to ‚Äútry‚Äù the country outside the hotel fence.  For each - his own.

But it pays off great thanks to many factors.  You can choose the top five in Egypt at the price of a similar three rubles in Phuket, but their quality is quite comparable.  Choosing a 3 star Lamai Guesthouse hotel for your relaxation, you should not be afraid for the results of your trip: they will be excellent! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket lamai guesthouse 3" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/590141.jpg" width="416"></div>  This guesthouse is located on one of the three main beaches - Patong.  The resort is very popular, which is why it has a developed infrastructure - a lot of fun cafes and bars.  The hotel does not accept a large number of guests, as it has a small number of rooms - 26 rooms, deluxe categories (each room is 30 square meters, in addition, there is a king bed in rooms of this class only), superior (these rooms are the same as deluxe - 30 meters, but there is no huge bed, and guests are provided with two separate ones) and several standards (with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã20 square meters).  A clear advantage of the hotel is the date of its construction - 2008, therefore, the hotel is new and clean.

    <h2>  Priceless vacation </h2><p>  The cost of the tour for the traveler will not be high in the guesthouse.  The main burden falls on air travel, since it is the main part of the costs when organizing a package of a tourist operator.  For example, a voucher with departure from Moscow at the end of February for 10 days in a deluxe room will cost 30 thousand rubles per person.  Enough budget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lamai guesthouse 3" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/590135.jpg" width="430"></div>  The cost of rest in May will be slightly higher due to the greater demand of tourists for this vacation in late spring.  For example, a Lamai guesthouse with an 8-day flight from Moscow when booking a deluxe room will cost 50 thousand rubles per person, despite the early booking action.

    <p>  The cost of a trip with a departure from Novosibirsk will be slightly lower due to a shorter flight to the dream island.  For example, deciding to go on an unforgettable trip in March for a whole week with the concept of food - breakfast, you will have to pay about 22 thousand rubles per person for double occupancy. </p><h2>  Judging by the reviews </h2><p>  Assessing the guesthouse, you can safely put "excellent."  Almost all the reviews (the vast majority) are positive: travelers note not only attentiveness to the guests of the service staff (which is mainly characteristic of small guest houses and hotels), but also delicious food in the restaurant.  Of course, many "experienced" tourists, as well as travel agents, more than once faced with the implausibility of the reviews left on various Internet resources, so they need to be trusted very carefully. <strong></strong></p><h2>  Phuket: beaches, hotels - it's hard to make a mistake in choosing </h2><p>  The beaches are located along the entire coastline of Phuket.  The map demonstrates this fact quite colorfully.  The most famous of them are comfortably located in the bays of Patong, Karon and Kata.  Bangtao Beach is famous for its white sand coast.  This is a more secluded and relaxing place to relax.  The most populous and noisy with the most developed infrastructure is Patong Beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket beaches hotels" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/589873.jpg" width="459"></div>  But here you can organize a two-in-one vacation: find a good quiet hotel near the vibrant center of nightlife.  In turn, the beaches of Karon and Kata are considered to be elite, secluded, with slightly cleaner water than in Patong.  Accordingly, they have a higher cost for living in "local" hotels.

    <p>  We should also talk about hotels in Thailand.  Phuket is not an exception here - sometimes a hotel even at a level of 2-3 * is far superior in quality to similar European star options.  The tradition of evaluating quality by the number of stars is European.  Certification in Thailand is not officially accepted. </p>

Therefore, a discrepancy in the assessment of the hotel base in Thailand is a common occurrence, and when choosing a hotel, you should pay more attention to the adequate reviews of customers who have been here and the advice of your travel agent.
