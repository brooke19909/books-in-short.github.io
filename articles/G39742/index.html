This is a large sand ridge, stretching for 4.5 kilometers along the Curonian lagoon.  This dune is the largest in Europe, therefore, attracts many tourists from neighboring Lithuania, the <span>Kaliningrad region,</span> and from all over Russia and Europe. </p><h2>  What is the dune of Efa </h2><p>  In fact, this is a <span>large mountain of</span> sand, which is actually called Walnut.  However, more often it is called by the name of the highest point - the height of Ef, which, by the way, rises up to 64 meters.  The dune begins at about 16 km of the Curonian Spit and stretches to the very border with Lithuania. </p><p>  Throughout the length of the spit laid hiking trails.  Desert landscapes are picturesque: the sky, the waves of the bay and vegetation - this is what is unique in the dune of Efa.  <span>The Curonian Spit</span> is also a place of bird migration, for example, at the end of summer and autumn, you can find many gulls here.  Nearby, by the way, there is also an ornithological station where birds ring.  But besides the seagulls there is something to see. </p>

    <h2>  The history of the strengthening of the "dancing" sand </h2><p>  Once the dune of Efa was surrounded by trees, but in the 18th century they were cut down.  Why, why and who - history has no answer to these questions.  But everyone knows exactly what happened after - the sands, no longer restrained by the roots and trunks of trees, commanded by the force of the wind, began their free movement.  Over the years, they destroyed 14 neighboring villages - the sand slowly penetrated into the houses, fell asleep in the cracks and gradually crushed everything under themselves.  They say that local houses even had <span>double doors</span> - if the sand starts to support it, one narrow leaf can be opened. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the year, the dune stood 20 meters ahead.  People were not able to stop this natural phenomenon and simply threw home and moved away.  Soon, the sands began to threaten not only villages, but also shipping, as well as rich fisheries.  Therefore, in 1768 in Europe they decided to fight the elements.  No one knew how, so they announced a competition for the best solution to the problem.  Professor Titius won, who proposed to restore the spit to its original form and plant it again with trees.  To do this, they built cells from dry reeds that trap the sands and allow the dune to grow up.  When the desired height is reached, grasses that grow well in the sun and have long roots holding back the dune in one place are planted in similar cells.  And then shrubs and pines are planted, which with their roots help the common cause. </p>

    <p>  The work stretched for as long as 100 years, 40 of which the process was supervised by the arborist and dune inspector Franz Ef, who named the highest point of the dune in his honor.  He earned such gratitude from the residents of the local village of Pillkoppen (now it belongs to Russia and is called Morskoy).  It was Ef's contribution that stopped the advance of sand on the village and saved its inhabitants and houses.  On the dune there was even a memorial plaque dedicated to the arborist, but today it is no longer there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To date, work on deforestation of the dunes is still ongoing, it remains to plant about 15 percent of all sand.  Although, according to some reports, these 15 percent are the most mobile dune of Ef, which was left as a highlight of this place.  Like the cells from the branches designed by Efa, modern technology would support the sands without them, but the uniqueness of the object encourages you to save everything as it was intended a century ago. </p><p>  Hiking not on special floors is strictly prohibited and punishable by a fine.  However, the reality is that tourist groups go to the dune directly under the prohibition signs and go down to the bay, risking ruining the long two-century work. </p><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  The most important thing that the dune of Efa offers is natural attractions, namely breathtaking views.  For viewing nature there are two viewing platforms.  It offers amazing views of the <span>Curonian lagoon,</span> the Baltic Sea on the other hand, the village of Morskoy and the alien landscapes of the dune itself. </p><p>  When the wind rises in fine sunny weather, millions of grains of sand in the air create the feeling of being in a real desert, as if caught in a sandstorm.  This is an amazing experience for the Baltic region. </p>

    <p>  From the first observation deck, Staroselskaya Gora is visible.  Here (according to legend), the local Curonian worshiped their pagan gods, and the crusaders built a fortress in the 18th century.  But all this is buried and destroyed by nomadic sands.  From the second platform you can see Morskoye - a picturesque village with houses under a red tiled roof. </p><h2>  Hiking trails </h2><p>  Since it is strictly forbidden to walk along the dune, wooden platforms are installed along it, on which you can take a walking tour.  The length of the path is about 2.8 kilometers, the entire road will take about 2 hours. </p><p>  The entrance to the trail begins on the 42nd kilometer of the dune and is indicated by a sign, but it is difficult to drive past - there are always a lot of tourists, cars and buses, souvenir tents.  The route is called ‚ÄúAltitude Efa‚Äù and it is laid along the southwestern slope of the dune. </p><p>  So, the route begins in a forest clearing, after passing along which only 200 meters, you can climb to the first observation deck.  A wooden staircase leads to it along a very picturesque pine forest.  The second platform is set a little further, at the highest point of the dune.  Keep in mind that the platform is small and the stairs leading to it are narrow.  In season, due to the large number of tourists it will be difficult to go down and up it. </p>

    <h2>  Visit Features </h2><p>  Since the dune Efa is a national park, you need to get a pass to visit it by car.  It is drawn up at the checkpoint of the park.  Travel to the territory costs 250 rubles. </p><p>  The weather in the Baltic is very changeable - the rains are replaced by the sun, and vice versa, so bring along an umbrella or raincoat, as well as a cap and sunglasses, in any weather to explore the local sands that are unique to the dune of Efa.  Reviews from tourists and locals say: if you don‚Äôt like the weather, wait five minutes.  However, and if you like it, then in five minutes everything can change. </p>

    <p>  The hiking trail, laid on a wooden platform, is rather narrow, the flooring is old and rotten in places, so look underfoot.  In addition, it is slippery after rain or fog. </p><h2>  Dune Efa: how to get there </h2><p>  You can come to see the dune Efa by car.  If you go from Kaliningrad, then in front of the Sea, to the right of the road, there will be a sign. </p>

    <p>  You can also come by bus from Kaliningrad.  There is a route right to Morskoye, but it rarely runs, so you can get to Zelenograd and transfer to the Zelenograd-Morskoye bus there.  By the way, large regular buses on this route travel longer than small minibuses. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  You can stop for the night to explore the dune and the entire Curonian Spit in Kaliningrad or in the village of Morskoye.  The city has many accommodation offers - from luxury hotels to affordable hostels and private apartments.  Marine, as the reviews say, is an actively developing tourist village where it is nice to relax.  There are many pensions and recreation centers that are open all year round. </p>
