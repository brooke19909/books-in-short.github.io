Residents of the city with joy families and fun companies actively relax, swimming and riding on different slides.  This is a whole complex with modern equipment occupying 7.5 hectares of coastal zone.  This is an open place, so the water park operates only in the warm season, from the second half of May to the end of September, depending on weather conditions. </p><p>  For people who do not have the opportunity or time to go to sea, such a replacement meets all expectations.  In the article, we will consider what services the Equator water park in Krasnodar offers visitors, what attractions are available for children and adults, how much the ticket and additional features will cost.  We will answer the main concern of people about the location of the water park. </p><h2>  Variety of slides </h2><p>  In the Krasnodar water park mounted nine slides for adults: </p><ul><li>  "Wave" - ​​here you can carry out the descent in inflatable boats.  During a free fall from a ten-meter height, you will feel how adrenaline will roll throughout your body.  This ride is not for the faint of heart.  Children are not allowed there, only from the age of 14 and who has a height above 135 cm. </li><li>  "Black hole" - a slide created in the form of a closed pipe with backlight and various lighting effects.  An inflatable boat is also useful here. </li><li>  Rafting is an open attraction with sharp bends and turns. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="krasnodar861.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Equator in Krasnodar" class="if uuid-2238387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2238387.jpg"></div><ul><li>  "Toboggan" - two open slopes with a more gentle slope. </li><li>  “Pigtails” are three closed pipes twisted together with smooth bends. </li><li>  “Kamikaze” - the name implies that the slide is quite extreme, intended only for adult visitors. </li><li>  “Flag” - three shallow and long slides standing next to each other in the colors of the Russian flag - white, red and blue. </li><li>  “Free fall” is a very sharp break down a hill.  Only the most courageous and desperate thrill-seekers are sent there. </li><li>  “Aladdin’s lamp” is a two-color blue-white nine-meter closed pipe. </li></ul><h2>  Children's slides </h2><p>  For children whose height is below 135 cm, in the "Equator" of Krasnodar, access to serious attractions is closed due to the danger to the health of children.  But for them, too, there is a lot of adventure.  There are as many as 5 slides for children in the park: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  "Children's Toboggan" - a slide similar to an adult analogue, only the height is only 4 meters. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="foto.rufox.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Equator Krasnodar price" class="if uuid-2238391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2238391.jpg"></div><ul><li>  "Rainbow" is a slide reminiscent of a rainbow in color. </li><li>  “Weightlessness” - a smooth descent into the pool. </li><li>  “Octopuses” - from one platform diverge in the form of tentacles of a hill in different directions. </li><li>  "Snake" - a hill, painted with snake scales and strongly twisted. </li></ul><h2>  Poolside relaxation </h2><p>  In the "Equator" of Krasnodar, the price includes a stay on the rides all day.  An adult ticket will cost 800 rubles, and a children's ticket is half cheaper.  But this is only on weekdays, when there are fewer people.  At the weekend, you have to pay accordingly - 1000 and 500 rubles.  Rent an inflatable raft or circle - 200 rubles, but still take a deposit - 300. </p><p>  Visitors can not only ride the slides, but also swim and sunbathe near the five pools.  One is the most popular among children and adults, called the Wave.  There you can ride on rubber rings or simply jump over the crests of the wave. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geometria.org.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnodar water park Equator photo" class="if uuid-2238393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2238393.jpg"></div><p>  The rest are equipped with fountains and small waterfalls, under the jets of which you can do jet massage. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Around all pools are sun loungers with towels and sun umbrellas.  You can lie down, relax and enjoy a refreshing drink. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The water park "Equator" in Krasnodar operates from 11:00 to 21:00.

The answer is mixed.  Previously, it was located on Parusnaya street, in the area of ​​Hydro-builders.  If you go by bus number 2, then the stop was called CHP.  Also, minibus No. 39 went to the water park. But then it was decided to build a multi-storey building on such a wonderful place.  Water park covered.  But after numerous indignation of citizens, construction did not begin on the banks of the Old Kuban.  And where the water park will now be transferred is still unknown.  You need to follow the news closer to the summer season.  According to rumors, a new water park will open near the Oz Mall.  Many residents, especially outdoor enthusiasts and parents with children, are looking forward to opening a water park in a new place. </p>
