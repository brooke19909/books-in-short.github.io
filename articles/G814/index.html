    <h2>  What do customers say? </h2><p>  Finally, we can talk a bit about what kind of feedback about the work of banks is left by people who have used their services. </p><p>  Comments are different.  The previously mentioned Sberbank, for example, receives both negative and positive reviews.  The fact is that this organization makes too high demands on potential borrowers.  And to get a loan at favorable small interest rates can only be the person who, due to the amount of money earned by him, is unlikely to ever feel the need to take a loan.  So, for example, in the description of the service it is stated that the maximum amount is 3,000,000 rubles (with a guarantor).  But even two and a half million can be issued for 60 months only to a person with experience of several years and a salary of 150,000 rubles / month.  But this is disadvantageous, since the annual rate will be 14.9%, and the total amount of overpayment - 1,130,000 p.  So the rates are controversial. </p><p>  Customers make other claims to VTB-24.  In terms of rates and services, everything is in good faith - as in the description, but too long a wait.  The application can be considered for more than one or even two weeks.  Therefore, if it was decided to take a loan at VTB-24, it is better to get it done earlier.  The same applies to Rosselkhozbank.  And the likelihood of obtaining a loan for a large amount and at favorable interest increases if a person has a pledge in the form of expensive property.  So assure the people who issued the loan at the Rosselkhozbank. </p><p>  And a few words about <span>OTP</span> bank <span>.</span>  <span>This</span> organization, as its clients say, is confidently on its feet and pleases with good interest rates.  Even people who have taken a loan regularly receive reminders from the bank about paying off the debt.  Someone doesn‚Äôt like it, but this is done so that a person does not forget - for convenience. </p><p>  In general, in Russia there are a lot of good banks.  And the decision to take a loan is a serious and responsible step.  So to make a choice in favor of this or that organization you need only to think carefully and familiarize yourself with the conditions of all verified banks. </p>
