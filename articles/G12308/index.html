Is the Leonardo Club Eilat 4 * hotel (Eilat) so good, as tour operators describe it?  According to guests of the institution, the hotel is certainly worthy of attention.

    <p>  The hotel complex has quite the same type of rooms, the difference between which is only where the windows of the apartments go.  The rooms located on the ground floor have their own access to the pool.  Otherwise, the equipment in all apartments is almost the same. </p><p>  According to the guests, the hotel‚Äôs room stock has long been in need of updating, as the rooms show signs of scuffs on the walls and furniture.  Defects are not so significant, but still noticeable to others, which slightly spoils the overall impression of the institution. </p><p>  The hotel has a very friendly staff, among which there are Russian-speaking employees, so there are no problems with the translation, there is no language barrier.  Registration at the reception takes place very quickly and without delay.  Although the administration of the institution warns that check-in occurs at 15:00, in practice, tourists, as a rule, do not have to wait for the appointed time if there are free rooms. </p><p>  After paperwork at the reception, a pleasant surprise awaits the guests - a compliment from the hotel, which includes a large fruit plate and a bottle of wine.  Such little things make your vacation more enjoyable. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are equipped with double and single beds, as well as sofas and terraces.  Comfortable apartments make it possible to have a good vacation. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Guests note a fairly high level of service at the hotel.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  However, vacationers express rather conflicting opinions regarding housekeeping.  If some tourists remain fully satisfied with its frequency and quality, then others express dissatisfaction, declaring the practical absence of restoring order.  It is rather difficult to explain the reason for such opposite statements.  Perhaps you should not discount the human factor.  Apparently, not all personnel are equally good at their duties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Leonardo club hotel eilat 4 israel" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1719101.jpg" width="600"></div>
