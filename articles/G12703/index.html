Since then, the city has gone the way of rapid development and serious trials, and by the middle of the 18th century it turned into one of the largest Russian centers of the grain trade.  In the XX century, the Eagle was awarded the title of "city of the first salute" and "city of military glory."  Today, the regional administrative center attracts visitors with its unique attractions.  Thanks to its countless temples, monuments, green squares, the Eagle is famous among tourists as a pleasant place to relax. </p>
