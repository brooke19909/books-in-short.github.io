Of course, the victory in the war was the merit of the Soviet people, who at the cost of countless sacrifices gave the future generation a peaceful life.  However, this was made possible thanks to the unsurpassed talent of the <span>Soviet commanders.</span>  <span>Generals</span> - participants of the Great Patriotic War forged a victory together with ordinary citizens of the USSR, demonstrating heroism and courage. </p><h2>  Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov </h2><p>  One of the key figures of World War II is considered to be Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov.  The beginning of Zhukov‚Äôs military career dates back to 1916, when he took a direct part in the First World War.  In one of the battles, Zhukov was seriously injured, was shell-shocked, but, despite this, did not leave his post.  For courage and valor, he was awarded the St. George Crosses of the 3rd and 4th degree. </p>

    <p>  WWII generals are not just military commanders, they are real innovators in their field.  Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov is a prime example.  It was him, the first of all representatives of the Red Army, who was awarded the insignia - the Marshal Star, and also awarded the highest <span>rank of military</span> service - Marshal of the Soviet Union. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Alexey Mikhailovich Vasilevsky </h2><p>  The list of "Generals of the Great Patriotic War" is impossible to imagine without this outstanding person.  Throughout the war, Vasilevsky was at the front for 22 months with his fighters, and only 12 months in Moscow.  The great commander personally commanded in battles in the heroic Stalingrad, during the days of the defense of Moscow, repeatedly visited the most dangerous territories from the point of view of the attack of the enemy German army. </p>

Thanks to his strategic thinking and lightning fast understanding of the situation, he was able to repeatedly repel the onslaught of the enemy and avoid many casualties. </p><p>  For the successful results of the <span>counterattack near Stalingrad,</span> as well as the defeat of Field Marshal Paulus‚Äôs group, Alexei Mikhailovich Vasilevsky was awarded the title ‚ÄúMarshal of the Soviet Union‚Äù and also awarded the <span>Order of Suvorov</span> 1st degree. </p><h2>  Konstantin Konstantinovich Rokossovsky </h2><p>  The rating ‚ÄúOutstanding WWII Generals‚Äù would not be complete without mentioning an amazing person, a talented commander K. K. Rokossovsky.  Rokossovsky‚Äôs military career began at age 18, when he asked to join the Red Army, whose regiments passed through Warsaw. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The biography of the great commander has a negative imprint.  So, in 1937 he was slandered and accused of having links with foreign intelligence, which served as the basis for his arrest.  However, the <span>hard nature</span> and tenacity of Rokossovsky played a significant role.  He did not confess to the charges against him.  The justification and release of Konstantin Konstantinovich took place in 1940. </p>

    <p>  For successful military operations near Moscow, as well as for the defense of Stalingrad, the name of Rokossovsky is listed in the forefront of the list of "great generals of the Great Patriotic War."  For the role that the general played in the attack on Minsk and Baranovichi, Konstantin Konstantinovich was awarded the title "Marshal of the Soviet Union."  Awarded with many orders and medals. </p><h2>  Ivan Stepanovich Konev </h2><p>  Do not forget that the list of "Generals and Marshals of the Great Patriotic War" includes the surname of I. Konev. One of the key operations, which is indicative of the fate of Ivan Stepanovich, is the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky offensive.  This operation allowed to surround a large group of enemy troops, which also played a positive role in turning the tide of the war. </p>

    <p>  Alexander Werth, a popular English journalist, wrote about this tactical offensive and Konev‚Äôs unique victory: ‚ÄúKonev carried out a lightning attack on enemy forces through slush, dirt, impassability and muddy roads.‚Äù  For innovative ideas, perseverance, valor and tremendous courage, Ivan Stepanovich joined the list, which included generals and marshals of the Second World War.  The rank "Marshal of the Soviet Union" commander Konev received the third, after Zhukov and Vasilevsky. </p><h2>  Andrei Ivanovich Eremenko </h2><p>  One of the most famous personalities of the Great Patriotic War is considered to be Andrei Ivanovich Eremenko, who was born in the settlement of Markovka in 1872.  The military career of an outstanding commander began in 1913, when he was drafted into the Russian imperial army. </p>

    <p>  This person is interesting in that he received the title of Marshal of the Soviet Union for other merits than Rokossovsky, Zhukov, Vasilevsky and Konev.  If the listed generals of the WWII armies were awarded orders for offensive operations, then Andrei Ivanovich received an honorary military rank for defense.  Eremenko took an active part in operations near Stalingrad, in particular, he was one of the initiators of the counterattack, which resulted in the capture of a group of German soldiers in the amount of 330 thousand people. </p><h2>  Rodion Yakovlevich Malinovsky </h2><p>  Rodion Yakovlevich Malinovsky is considered one of the most prominent commanders of the <span>Soviet Union</span> during the Great Patriotic War.  He was enlisted in the Red Army at the age of 16.  During the First World War, he was seriously injured.  Two shell fragments got stuck in the back, a third pierced his leg through.  Despite this, after recovery, he was not commissioned, but continued to serve his homeland. </p>

    <p>  Special words deserve his military successes during the Second World War.  In December 1941, being a lieutenant general, Malinovsky was appointed commander of the Southern Front.  However, the defense of Stalingrad is considered the most striking episode in the biography of Rodion Yakovlevich.  The 66th Army, under the strict guidance of Malinowski, launched a counterattack not far from Stalingrad.  Thanks to this, the 6th German army was defeated, which reduced the enemy's onslaught on the city.  After the war ended, Rodion Yakovlevich was awarded the honorary title ‚ÄúHero of the Soviet Union‚Äù. </p><h2>  Semyon Konstantinovich Timoshenko </h2><p>  The victory, of course, was forged by all the people, however, WWII generals played a special role in the defeat of German troops.  The list of outstanding commanders is supplemented by the name of Semyon Konstantinovich Timoshenko.  The commander repeatedly received the angry <span>statements of Stalin,</span> which was due to the failed operations in the early days of the war.  Semen Konstantinovich, showing courage and courage, asked the commander in chief to send him to the most dangerous section of the battles. </p>

The most striking facts in the biography of the commander are the battles in Belarus, in particular the defense of Gomel and Mogilev. </p><h2>  Ivan Khristoforovich Chuykov </h2><p>  Ivan Khristoforovich was born in a peasant family in 1900.
