    <h2>  Signs of a swollen battery </h2><p>  You can determine that the battery has started to swell by the following signs: </p><ol><li>  The back panel of the smartphone, which covers the battery, constantly flies, it is difficult to close it. </li><li>  A phone with a fully charged battery lasts only a few hours. </li><li>  There was a need for constant recharging of the phone. </li><li>  The smartphone is often overloaded, spontaneously turns on and off. </li><li>  The gadget has been working for over 2 years. </li></ol><p>  It is generally accepted that the <span>battery for the phone</span> lasts no more than 3 years.  It is for such a period that it is designed.  After that, the battery gradually loses capacity and swells. </p><h2>  Can I use the phone (the battery is swollen)? </h2><p>  After detecting this defect, many will decide that an instant battery replacement is not needed, since it can last a while.  Of course, the phone will often crash and require recharging.  If you do not replace the battery in time, then at the most unexpected moment the device will stop working, and it will have to be taken for repair or generally thrown away.  This is because the batteries contain dangerous substances that can penetrate the gadget, which will cause irreparable damage to it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A swollen battery is dangerous not only for the device itself.  Increasingly, on the thematic forums you can find reports of mobile phone explosions.  And this, as you know, is dangerous not only for the owner himself, but also for his relatives, friends, neighbors.  Explosion occurs due to the fact that gases accumulated in the battery.  Therefore, keeping a bloated battery in a house is extremely dangerous. </p><p>  It is also important to note that <span>lithium-ion batteries</span> cannot be disposed of with regular waste.  The fact is that even after disposal, they continue to be hazardous to the environment.  A failed battery should be taken to specialized collection and disposal points. </p>

    <h2>  The battery on the phone is swollen - a warranty case? </h2><p>  Are cases of swelling of the battery related to warranty?  First of all, it is worth noting that a failed battery will not be repaired, since it is subject to disposal.  The warranty also includes telephone repair, but this case is still a warranty.  The seller must provide the buyer with a similar phone model for the repair period.  Also, the device can be returned to the seller, for this it is necessary to write a corresponding complaint. </p><h2>  Procedure </h2><p>  So what to do if the battery on the phone is swollen?  Since the battery is very dangerous, further use leads to fire, and sometimes to explosions.  If a defect is found, turn off the phone and do not connect it to the charger.  If the battery is removable, remove it and contact a service center.  Throwing it into a regular garbage container is not worth it, for this you need to contact the collection point, which can be found using the Internet. </p>
