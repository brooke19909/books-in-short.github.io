    <p>  Firstly, the village itself is located in a very picturesque place.  On the one hand, it is adjacent to the coastline, and on the other, it stretches deep into the continent along the Teshebs and Vulan rivers that flow into the Black Sea.  The village has a well-developed infrastructure, which is mainly focused on numerous tourists.  The Victoria Hotel itself is located very well.  From its windows opens a picturesque view of the sea, which you can admire while sitting on the balcony.  For many people, living conditions are very important.  Therefore, they should pay special attention to the photos of the rooms in which tourists are accommodated.  Even in small pictures, you can appreciate the spacious and comfortable rooms, furnished with comfortable upholstered furniture.  The owners of the hotel made sure that the guests were as comfortable as possible. </p><h2>  Price of pleasure </h2><p>  The address where the Victoria Hotel is located is Arkhipo-Osipovka, Morskaya, 15 and 13. Entrance to the hotel is from the street through the central five-story building.  Further through the patio you can get to other rooms. </p>

    <p>  For visitors, the reception is open around the clock, where a friendly administrator will help with check-in.  Accommodation in such a hotel is relatively inexpensive.  Owners of rooms in the three-story building number 1 per day will have to pay from 700 to 900 rubles.  By resort standards, this is quite a bit.  Those who have purchased tickets to the five-story building number 2, rest will cost more (from 900 to 3000 rubles).  Everything will depend on the season, specific room and time of stay.  Residents of building No. 3 should expect that they will have to pay 800-1100 rubles for 1 day.  The price, as a rule, includes accommodation and the ability to use additional services (parking, internet, 2 swimming pools).  For the average Russian, such a price is quite acceptable.  Perhaps that is why the hotel rarely has free rooms due to the influx of tourists. </p>
