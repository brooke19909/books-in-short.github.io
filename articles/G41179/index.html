To make the fairy tale come true and fulfill the most fantastic hopes of thousands of Petersburgers, it was decided to erect the unique Triumph Park residential complex right in the center of the city.  Its distinctive features are perfectly thought-out design, environmental friendliness, modern technology and a flexible system of buying apartments.  But first things first. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  For the construction of a new complex, a plot was allocated in the Moscow region of the city of St. Petersburg, one of the most prestigious and beautiful.  Two large federal highways to Moscow and Pskov pass through it, and Pulkovo Airport is located here, which is only 10 minutes away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex Triumph Park" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1111841.jpg" width="534"></div>  Just on the Pulkovo highway, more precisely at its intersection with Dunaysky Avenue, the Triumph Park residential complex is being built.  It will be extremely convenient for its residents to get to any end of St. Petersburg, as public transport stops already exist near the complex, plus it is planned to add new ones, and you can walk to the Zvezdnaya metro station in 15 minutes.  Nearby is the Moskovskaya station, to which buses will be home in just 5 minutes.  A big plus for the residents of the complex is the fact that there are about a dozen large shopping centers, such as Auchan, Metro, MassShtab, Matrika and others.  Also very close are the entertainment centers "Summer", "Pulkovo-3", and a walk to the Heroes Town park takes only 3 minutes.

The project was developed by MirLand Development, which has been successfully developing in the real estate market since 2004.  Its main business is the implementation of investment projects, expansion of production, construction of residential and industrial facilities, their sale or lease, minimization of risks that may arise during the performance of work.  Residential complex "Triumph Park" is one of the 13 most ambitious programs of this company.  Contracting work on the construction and installation of equipment was entrusted to UESP LLC, which has been working in this field since 2010.  Financing is provided by Sberbank of Russia; Petersburg Real Estate is the exclusive seller.  Construction and other risks are controlled by Ingosstrakh.

On the first floors of residential buildings it is planned to place bank branches, shops of various profiles, children's sports and creative centers, and household services.  For children, 2 schools and three kindergartens will be commissioned here, and <span>playgrounds</span> and <span>playgrounds will be</span> equipped in the yards <span>.</span>  The eternal problem of all new neighborhoods is car parking.  But here, the Triumph Park residential complex was at its highest.  St. Petersburg is a city in which for every two people there is 1 car, which creates many difficulties for both drivers and pedestrians.  In the complex being built, all parking lots will be either underground or buried so as not to disturb anyone.  The courtyards in the "Triumph Park" according to the project will be all closed, with landscape design, playgrounds and playgrounds, flowerbeds and comfortable benches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex Triumph Park Ulyanovsk" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1111830.jpg" width="557"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  It is not in vain that many people call this area nothing more than Triumph Park residential and eco-complex.  The additional word "eco" means that this project is fully consistent with international environmental standards and has the prestigious BREEAM certificate.  Activities for the benefit of the environment in the new residential complex are not limited to landscaping yards and bringing parking lots to the underground level.  Designers have developed a number of unique events, namely: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  installation of three-stage water filters; </li><li>  layout of all buildings with maximum natural light; </li><li>  the use of environmentally friendly materials for construction; </li><li>  installation of silent Kone elevators manufactured in Finland; </li><li>  arrangement in the courtyards of sites for smokers; </li><li>  equipment of bicycle parking spaces; </li><li>  installation of garbage containers in strictly designated and fenced areas, in addition, their division into categories (household waste, glass, cardboard, batteries, plastic, <span>mercury lamps);</span>  utilization of each type of waste has its own technology, therefore, such a separation, as conceived by the designers, should help preserve the environment. </li></ul><p>  Ecologists are present at the construction site, monitoring compliance with absolutely all environmental standards. </p><h2>  Cost-effective innovation </h2><p>  Triumph Park is a residential complex in which the installed equipment will help residents save up to 40% in water and electricity consumption.  In order to save water resources, each apartment here is equipped with an individual unit for accounting for consumed water, economical plumbing equipment is installed in kitchens and bathrooms (faucets with a single lever tap, the service life of which is at least 15 years).  Each residential building will be equipped with a system that monitors leaks and prevents their occurrence. </p><p>  In order to save electricity on the territory of the LCD, energy-saving, but harmless to health lamps are installed in all common areas.  It is planned to install motion sensors in the entrances of the houses, and in apartments - two-tariff nodes for electricity metering. </p><p>  In order to save heat during construction, materials with low heat transfer are used. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Triumph Park is a residential complex under construction according to a project designed so that all buildings and courtyards provide good sunlight.  For this purpose, houses are being built of different floors (from 9 to 24 floors). </p><p>  The halls in them are designed according to international standards.  Wall decoration is done using light-colored porcelain stoneware and contrasting inserts of beautiful acrylic panels.  Lighting lamps are installed only luminescent, energy-saving.  In addition, it is planned to mount motion sensors and LED-backlight.  Intercoms are installed at all the entrances of the new complex, and the entrances to the territory are equipped with barriers.  In addition, a video surveillance installation is planned in the front rooms. </p><p>  To maintain a uniform design style, all the houses of the complex surrender with glazed loggias and balconies. </p><p>  Much attention is paid to the decoration of apartments.  There are several options: ‚ÄúVanilla‚Äù, ‚ÄúChocolate‚Äù and ‚ÄúAzure‚Äù, which implies a different color scheme of the laminate on the floor and tiles in the bathrooms.  The ceilings in all apartments are covered with light water-based paint, the walls in the rooms are glued with wallpaper (for further painting), the walls in the bathroom are faced with decorative tiles. </p><h2>  Used technologies </h2><p>  Residential complex "Triumph Park" is being built using new advanced technologies that ensure maximum reliability of structures, long service life and comfortable, safe for health living.  Bearing walls of all buildings and columns are made on the principle of monolithic-frame construction, providing high reliability and strength.  Frames are made without seams, by pouring concrete in a structure of removable formwork.  External walls are being built up on the finished frame.  For floors, reinforced concrete monolithic slabs are used.  The ceiling height in apartments with this technology is at least 2.7 meters, and the area is at least 22 and maximum 116 square meters, and the layout in each apartment can be modified without violating the overall strength of the building. </p><p>  The windows in the apartments are mounted with <span>double-glazed windows</span> from the company Rehau (Germany), each equipped with an Air-Box ventilation valve. </p><p>  Outside, all houses are equipped with a ventilated facade, and comfortable and safe elevators are designed with the ability to descend from the living area into the underground parking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="residential eco-complex Triumph Park" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1111823.jpg" width="566"></div>

    <h2>  Change queues </h2><p>  Advanced technologies and reliable financing allow us to finish construction in a short time.  In total, 4 lines are planned here.  Work on this facility was started in 2012.  The 1st stage was commissioned already in 2013.  It meant a residential building and underground parking.  The 2nd stage also included one residential building with parking, which was commissioned in 2014.  In further works, it is planned to begin to equip Triumph Park.  The residential complex, phase 3 of which, along with houses for living includes infrastructure facilities, will provide comfort to those citizens who have already managed to move to the purchased apartments.  This includes shops and related businesses.  According to the plan, the delivery of the 3rd stage is due to happen in 2016.  Now approximately 95% of the funds have been spent.  Apartments in this queue can already be booked and redeemed.  The fourth stage, which also provides for the construction of residential buildings of various floors, a large network of shops, schools, kindergartens, related enterprises, is planned to be commissioned in the second half of 2017.  "Triumph Park" is a residential complex, the 5th stage of which is also in the plans of the developer, who is the owner of the land allocated for construction.  However, due to the crisis in the Russian real estate market, MirLand Development specialists will analyze the situation and begin to deal with the last - the 5th stage, only if there is a demand for housing in this complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Triumph park housing estate reviews" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1111822.jpg" width="565"></div>
