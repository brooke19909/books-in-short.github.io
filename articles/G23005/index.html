    <p>  Such an approach allows you to make as close as possible to the real state of affairs the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat awaits tourists here.  Therefore, we bring to your attention the generalized comments of our compatriots regarding their stay at VDB Nha Trang Hotel 4 *.  Reviews about the hotel, I must say, the vast majority are positive.  So, Russian tourists were satisfied with the living conditions, service and price.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  In general, our compatriots were satisfied with the accommodation in this hotel.  According to them, the rooms here are freshly renovated, bright and comfortable.  They are small, but there was enough space for everyone, especially since most tourists come to their apartments only to change clothes, as well as in the evening before going to bed.  Guests note that the room has everything you need for a comfortable stay - bathrobes, slippers, a hairdryer, toothbrushes, paste, soap, shower gel, shampoo and much more.

    <p>  According to tourists, the use of a minibar is paid.  However, maids bring several bottles of drinking water every day.  It's free.  Drinking tap water is not recommended here.  Many guests are advised to choose rooms located on the upper floors, if possible.  So you will be provided with a magnificent view from the window.  The only minus of some guests considered the lack of a balcony in the rooms where they could dry things.  However, this did not become any serious problem for the guests. </p><h2>  Check-in, cleaning </h2><p>  Tourists leaving their reviews regarding VDB <span>Nha Trang Hotel 4 *</span> were very pleased with the quick check-in.  So, according to them, upon arrival at the hotel they were offered a soft drink and invited to sit in comfortable armchairs near the reception.  The key to the apartment could be obtained literally in 10-15 minutes.  Moreover, the hotel employee escorts guests who have just arrived in the room designed for them and carries the luggage.  Also, some time after checking in, they will bring you a plate of fruit.  By the way, maids leave fruits in the room a couple of times a week.  In addition, if your birthday falls during your stay at this hotel, then you can count on congratulations and a cake from the administration. </p>

    <p>  As for cleaning, in general, there were no complaints about its quality.  According to some of our compatriots, it would be possible to carry out wet cleaning more often.  But most of the guests were quite satisfied with the work of the maids. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  According to travelers, the price of accommodation at the VDB <span>Nha Trang Hotel 4 * (Nha Trang,</span> Vietnam) includes breakfast only.  In general, according to tourists, this approach is typical for hotels in this country.  Our compatriots were very pleased with the breakfasts.  Judging by their comments, it was always possible to choose food to your taste - differently prepared eggs, delicious pastries, fruits, vegetables, sausages, cereals, soups and much more.  However, some guests did not really like the fact that instant coffee is served here, and tea is brewed from bags. </p><p>  During the day it was possible to eat both in the hotel restaurant and in cafes located outside.  According to our compatriots, in the vicinity of the hotel there are a couple of excellent places where you can try delicious dishes of national cuisine at a very reasonable price. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Vacationers note that the beach from the hotel can be reached in just five minutes.  However, you must cross a busy road along the way.  According to tourists, a hotel employee helps to do this.  As for the beach itself, it is public.  However, on its part VDB Nha Trang Hotel 4 * places its sunbeds and umbrellas, which guests can use for free.  According to travelers, it is advisable to go to the beach no later than nine in the morning.  Since at a later time all the sun loungers of the hotel may be busy.  Here, on the card, towels are given out, which must be passed upon leaving the beach.  Taking them to the room is not allowed.  So, as our compatriots note, if you plan to visit other beaches during your holidays, you need to grab towels from your home or purchase them already in Vietnam. </p>

    <p>  As for the sea, most tourists were satisfied with it.  According to them, there are often waves, but everyone really enjoyed swinging at them.  The beach itself is sandy, quite clean. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Since VDB Nha Trang Hotel 4 * (Vietnam) is a city-style hotel, it does not have its own large territory and, therefore, cannot offer any special entertainment to its guests.  Nevertheless, on the third floor of the hotel building is equipped with an outdoor pool, where you can swim in fine weather.  The hotel also has a gym, spa and massage services.  As some guests note, they also gladly went up to the roof of the hotel, which offers stunning views of this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNha Trang, the beach and the sea. </p>

    <p>  Travelers also recommend that you definitely go for at least a few excursions, especially if you have not been to Vietnam before. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  The work of the staff as a whole, our compatriots were satisfied.  According to them, the staff here (however, like almost all Vietnamese) are very friendly, smiling, always ready to listen and help.  True, almost none of the hotel staff speaks Russian.  Therefore, it will have to be explained in English.  As a rule, for the vast majority of travelers this is not a problem. </p>
