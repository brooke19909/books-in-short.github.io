  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vacations abroad - where to go to relax in the winter.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Holidays abroad are always attractive for active people who want to spend their long-awaited vacation with benefit and as interesting as possible.  Especially often, such thoughts come to mind when it is known for certain that vacation time falls in the winter.  In fact, there are a great many options - last-minute tours abroad are offered by many travel agencies.  But if you want to save money, then you should not go on a voyage during the New Year holidays.  It is much better to wait until all the holiday fuss settles down, the financial situation recovers after stormy celebrations and boldly set off on the road. </p><p>  Each person sees his own vacation in his own way and dreams of different things.  Fans of hot beaches with golden sand and the azure sea usually choose holidays abroad in hot countries.  A fairly economical option is a trip to the UAE.  Here you will find many impressions and the opportunity to see a lot of interesting places.  Magnificent bays, <span>high mountains,</span> boundless desert and the cleanest beaches of the <span>United Arab Emirates</span> attract a large number of tourists all year round, including in winter.  It is in February that the most comfortable air temperature is here, namely +25 degrees.  In the UAE you can find a lot of interesting activities for yourself: take a sail, go surfing or underwater fishing, visit water parks or go on a safari, hunt for crabs and even swim in the local hot springs. </p><p>  Many prefer last-minute trips abroad to ski resorts.  And even the cold winter that reigns at home is not a hindrance to them.  Resting abroad in Courchevel is considered quite elite.  Many fans of various winter sports come here to have a good time.  Tourists are attracted primarily by the ski slopes, which are considered super-modern, a large number of hotels with excellent service, amazing restaurants and unforgettable nature.  Here you can visit the fitness center, play squash, bowling or go-karting, and go to the rink.  Rest abroad in such a place, not everyone can afford financially, so there is a more economical option - Bulgaria. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ski resorts in this country are attractive for tourists with safe slopes, snowboard schools, comfortable hotels, new ski lifts, numerous restaurants and cafes, as well as adequate prices and a high level of service.  This country boasts rich folklore, a large number of historical places and attractions. </p><p>  In winter, numerous carnivals and festivals take place in different countries of the world.  That is why those who like to have a bright, unusual and colorful time choose a vacation abroad in Brazil.  The famous carnival, which takes place every year in the city of Rio de Janeiro, is truly enchanting.  The Brazilian dancers taking part in it have glorified their country all over the world.  Many tourists who have visited this action at least once, are sure to come here again. </p><p>  It is impossible to forget about the <span>Venice Carnival,</span> which is famous for a large number of expensive masks and exquisite costumes.  All kinds of concerts, fireworks, loud music, funny laughter, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãwine and a festive atmosphere will be remembered for a long time.  In addition, Venice is known worldwide for its magnificent architecture and a large number of attractions. </p><p>  Thus, if fate is unfavorable to you, and your vacation falls on the winter period - this is not a reason to be upset.  There are many places on earth where you can interestingly, and most importantly usefully spend time and bring home a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãimpressions, souvenirs and pleasant memories.  The most important thing is to decide on a tourist destination and tune in to the best. </p>
