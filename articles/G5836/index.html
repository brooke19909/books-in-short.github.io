Holidays with children in Bulgaria, reviews of which in recent years have again become frequent by travel enthusiasts, are gaining popularity every year.  Interest in this country is due to a variety of reasons.  For example, the close distance to it allows you to take even children up to one year old. </p><p>  You can go to Bulgaria by plane and train.  The difference in the choice of travel method is a prerequisite for a certain category of people: someone likes to quickly change the situation, someone prefers to look at the world from a compartment window, someone is afraid to fly airplanes.  It is the last reason that causes many people to rest with children in Bulgaria.  Reviews of those who choose a train or car as a means of transportation are no worse than those people who decided to get to this country by plane.  Bulgaria always affectionately meets tourists with children.  The inhabitants of this country are especially well treated for Russian children and adults, which is due to the past of the Bulgarians: the liberation of the country from the Turkish yoke occurred with the help of Russian soldiers in the 19th century.  Throughout the country, there are currently many monuments, museums that tell about the "Russian brothers." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays with children in bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11969/218801.jpg" width="431"></div>

    <p>  And Bulgaria is following its ecology.  Holidays with children, reviews of which are more likely to be positive than negative - it's clean air and a clear sea.  There are few cars and other modes of transport, practically no heavy industry, a small number of factories.  In the coastal zone, there is no production at all, because the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe country of roses is so clean and gentle. </p><p>  Mountains with a <span>pine forest,</span> European comfort, a high level of <span>culture, environmentally</span> friendly products - these are what attract Russians to the resorts of this country.  The Slavs-Bulgarians understand our speech, many speak Russian - this is one of the reasons why holidays with children in Bulgaria - reviews and comments - eloquent evidence of this - are tempting.  After all, it is always easier to speak the native language, and not remember English words, afraid to look ridiculous and stupid.  In this country, it is easy to communicate with hotel staff, sellers in the store, waiters in the cafe.  Walking along the streets, Russians at any time can turn to local residents to find out how to get to their place of interest, and they will always get a friendly answer. </p><p>  A great place to spend a vacation is <span>Bulgaria.</span>  Holidays with young children in it are becoming more and more comfortable, as hotels of European quality are being built here, which include animation for children and adults, television with Russian channels, playgrounds and pools. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria holidays with young children" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11969/217148.jpg" width="600"></div>  When visiting various cities, Bulgarian attentive attitude towards kids is evident: in the parks and on the streets of the resorts you can use sports facilities on the grounds for free, children‚Äôs attractions are offered for a meager fee.
