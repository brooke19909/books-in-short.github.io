Each city in Italy has its own image, its own unique features.  <span>Holidays in Italy</span> will allow tourists to get acquainted with the cultural heritage of this country, broaden their horizons and leave an unforgettable experience.  The main feature of this country is the cordiality and hospitality of local residents who know how to be carefree and have fun from the heart, which is manifested in street festivities and carnival processions. </p><p>  Almost all travel companies offer tours to Italy.  The price includes round-trip airfare, accommodation in a three-star hotel, comfortable bus transfers, excursions and a Russian-speaking guide.  Last-minute tours to Italy will save money.  At your request, you can choose the <span>type of food:</span> HB or BB, and for an additional fee you can apply for an Italian visa.  True, due to the tourist attractiveness of last-minute tours to this country, there are almost no. </p><p>  If the main tourist is a beach holiday in Italy, then you need to visit Rimini, which is the most famous resort on the Adriatic coast.  Sandy beaches stretch along the coast for fifteen kilometers.  Here you will find first-class hotels, restaurants and bars, discos and nightclubs, surfing and diving schools, yacht clubs and various attractions. </p><p>  All this attracts a lot of young people here on vacation.  But not only young people come to Rimini, but also many couples, some bring children with them.  For children there are water parks, theme parks, dolphinariums and other entertainments.  You can simply leave your child on the playground under supervision and take a quiet trip on a yacht or go diving. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Holidays in Italy will be incomplete without visiting the famous cities of Venice, Milan, Pisa, Florence.  Fans of excursions can buy last-minute trips to Italy with a combined rest program, for example, excursions plus <span>rest at sea.</span>  This may be a three-hour walking tour of the ‚ÄúEternal City‚Äù of Rome, accompanied by a Russian-speaking guide with a visit to the Coliseum, Capitol, Pantheon, Antique Forums and other attractions, the study of which, probably, will not last a lifetime. </p><p>  Rome is called an open-air museum or a tourist mecca.  Italy is also famous for its artists, poets and opera singers - apparently, the very air in Italy is permeated with art.  Many cultural monuments are located on the territory of the smallest state of the Vatican, which occupies only a few blocks.  Here is the famous <span>Sistine Chapel</span> with the paintings of the great Michelangelo. </p><p>  Opera lovers can dine at the opera restaurant called Papa Rex and listen to Roman opera singers.  True, for this pleasure you will need to pay extra.  For an extra fee, you can take a bus tour of Rome at night.  Many tourists dream of visiting the city on the water - Venice, the birthplace of magnificent carnivals, or Milan, and visiting the Dominican monastery, where the famous fresco of Leonardo to Vinci ‚ÄúThe Last Supper‚Äù has been preserved.  Holidays in Italy are possible in any season.  In summer, these are well-equipped magnificent beaches with soft, delicate sand, and in winter, world-class ski resorts.  Well, you can make excursions and get acquainted with numerous cultural and historical monuments at any time of the year. </p><p>  In almost every city in Italy there are many temples and houses that are of cultural value.  From the number of shops and boutiques in Rome, Venice, Milan and other cities of Italy, eyes just run wild, so in your free time you can make a fascinating and inexpensive shopping. </p>
