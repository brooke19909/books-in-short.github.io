    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  Considering the map and thinking about the question of where the city of Johannesburg is located, you should look to the south of the African continent.  The city is located almost in the center of the <span>Republic of South Africa.</span> </p><p>  The settlement was located on a high plateau, on the veld, between the <span>rivers Limpopo,</span> Baal and Orange.  The city is located on a flat, arid part of the plateau at an altitude of 1700 meters above sea level.  The relief of the city is mostly flat, only in the northern part there is hillyness. </p><p>  Geographical coordinates of Johannesburg: 26 ¬∞ 12 '8 "south latitude and 28 ¬∞ 2' 37" (28 ¬∞ 2 '61) east longitude. </p><p>  The city is the largest population center of the country, today it is home to just over 3 million people.  The ethnic diversity of the inhabitants is great, about 73% of the population are black.  The most popular language in the city is English. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Johannesburg is the capital of the Gauteng province.  This is the richest region of the state, providing about a third of the total gross product of South Africa.  The settlement is located in a very picturesque place, near the Witwatersrand mountain range.  For many years, the main growth factor of the city was the nearby rich gold deposits.  The administrative division of Johannesburg includes several districts.  The business center is the fashionable Sandton, and the areas of Hillbrow and Berey are its absolute antipodes. </p>

In June and July, the average daily temperature is about 15-17 degrees.  The same months are the driest. </p><p>  High tourist season falls on April, May and August.

The development of these lands in the XVII-XVIII centuries led to the complete extermination of the local population.  Until the end of the 19th century, the Basuto and Zulus tribes who fought with the Boers succeeded each other here. </p><p>  In 1886, everything changed dramatically.  The Australian gold digger found the first mine here, and a stream of wealth hunters poured here. </p><p>  Here the city begins to be built, first spontaneously, then with the help of architects.  The settlement is filled with people of different races and cultures.  A wealthy city attracted the attention of British conquerors.  In 1899, the Boer War begins, as a result of which the land went to Britain.  Rapid construction in the city began in the 1930s, due to the economic boom in South Africa.  Until the mid-1970s, Johannesburg grew and developed, by this time its business and residential infrastructure had formed, its architectural appearance had developed, it was even called ‚ÄúAfrican New York‚Äù. </p><p>  When the struggle against apartheid politics led to the fall of the regime in the early 90s, the development of the city came to an end.  Over the next decades, he gradually loses his infrastructure and decent appearance.  When most of the white population left the city, entire neighborhoods populated by squatters appeared.  At the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries, the authorities made efforts to maintain the attractiveness of the city for residents and tourists.  In 2010, it even hosts the World Cup.  Today, the flow of tourists to Johannesburg is very small, but it exists and even increases slightly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Orientation in the city </h2><p>  Today, Johannesburg, where the economic and business center of South Africa is located, is clearly divided into decent and relatively safe north and south, in which there is a lot of extreme.  The city center is the center of attractions, shops, museums, as well as offices.  Hotels are better to choose in the northern regions.  And it is better to go to the areas of Hillbrow, Soweto and Berey only with a reliable guide or to take a sightseeing bus or to abandon this dangerous undertaking altogether. </p>

    <h2>  Security </h2><p>  Until recently, Johannesburg was one of the most dangerous cities in the world.  But over the past 20 years, the government has been taking effective measures to combat crime.  And today the city is becoming less dangerous.  However, the Berey and Hillbrow districts in Johannesburg, where the real ghetto is for the poor, continue to be a place with low levels of personal safety for tourists.  Therefore, travelers are advised to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and their belongings. </p>
