  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to check the remaining minutes on the “MTS” in several ways?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sooner or later, phone owners are faced with a situation where there is a need to view not only the balance of the phone, but also how to check the remaining minutes on MTS.  Modern tariffs are more adapted to the user than their predecessors.  MTS allows not only choosing the number of minutes, but also the number of GB traffic suitable for a particular client. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mts-smart.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to check the rest of minutes on &quot;MTS&quot;?" class="if uuid-2324215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2324215.jpg"></div><h2>  Verification Methods </h2><p>  Sometimes you need to be aware of not only the balance, but also the number of minutes spent talking.  Unfortunately, MTS customers can not always rely on free calls within the network, which are positioned by the operator as a constant satellite of almost any tariff.  Sometimes it’s these calls that cause a waste of balance, which recreates the need for knowledge of how to check the rest of the minutes on MTS. </p><p>  The following methods are popular among users: </p><ul><li>  Verification through SMS service. </li><li>  Checking through your account on the operator’s official website. </li><li>  Mobile app. </li><li>  Operator. </li></ul><h2>  SMS service </h2><p>  Most often, this method becomes the most convenient, especially for customers who, for some reason, can not go online.  SMS service is located under the number * 100 * 1 #, when requested within a few minutes, the data will be processed and issued in the form of SMS.  For some phones, the function displays the balance balance directly on the screen, so there are no problems how to check the balance of minutes on the “Smart” tariff from “MTS”, most importantly, have the necessary knowledge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="setigid.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Verification through the application" class="if uuid-2324227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2324227.jpg"></div><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  Many customers of the operator do not go into the details of using all the features.  For inexperienced users, entering your personal account is already a whole problem, but you don’t have to talk about how to check the rest of the minutes on “Smart” from “MTS”.  Despite all the fears, it is the Internet that is the best assistant in this difficult matter.  First you need to log in to the operator’s official website using your username and password.  Next, you need to find the tab "Number Management" and go to the menu on the line "Account Status".  In the window that opens, the current balance of minutes and traffic will appear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="e-mts.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Minutes and check &quot;MTS&quot;" class="if uuid-2324232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2324232.jpg"></div><p>  Among other things, the page reflects not only the minutes remaining by default in the individual tariff, but also the balance of additional packages, if connected.  Also, the operator has an SMS alert function informing that paid minutes are running out. </p><h2>  Mobile app </h2><p>  Relatively recently, a project of a mobile application belonging to the operator was launched. It allows not only checking the balance at any time without a request, but also solving such a problem as checking the remaining minutes on MTS.  The application on the first page gives information about the number of available minutes, traffic, SMS and the overall balance of the number.  Also in the application it is easiest to connect and disconnect services and additional packages. </p><h2>  Verification with the operator </h2><p>  If for some reason it is impossible to use an SMS service, a browser or an application, you can use the simplest action - find out such a trifle <span>as how to check the remaining minutes on MTS</span> using a call to the operator.  Number to call: 0890, which is an abridged option.  In the voice menu, you need to select the appropriate section and press the button with the number.  After the manipulations, the operator will be dialed, who, in turn, must ask for the number and other details (for example, the series and passport number), they should also be kept with you. </p><p>  Following all the recommendations, you can easily and quickly get the necessary information, being in any corner of the world, provided that there is access to the phone and it is charged.  Do not be afraid of a conversation with the operator or a request for voicing passport data - this is a necessary procedure.  It is worth noting that the requested passport must belong to the person who is considered to be the document holder of the card. </p>
