On its territory there are over one thousand urban settlements - large and small, prosperous and frankly depressed.  In this article we will list the southernmost cities of Russia.  And briefly tell the reader about them. </p><h2>  The southernmost cities of Russia: list </h2><p>  The total number of cities in the Russian Federation is 1112. They are very different from each other: in area, number of inhabitants, age, and also in geographical location and climate.  So, in some cities of the country, winter lasts up to eight months, and in others - residents enjoy the sun for up to 300 days a year.  The contrasts are striking! </p><p>  Which city is the southernmost in Russia?  What is it called?  You will find the answer to this question below.  Our article presents a list of the ten southernmost cities in Russia (in order of remoteness of settlements from the North Pole).  All of them are located within three regions: Primorsky Territory, Dagestan and the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania. </p><p>  If we talk about the geographical position of the largest megacities of the country, then the most southern millionaire city of Russia is Rostov-on-Don.  Often it is called the "southern capital."  This is a fairly important transport, scientific and cultural center of the country.  In addition, Rostov-on-Don is also often called one of the most well-groomed and most beautiful cities in southern Russia.  He also leads in the number of urban green spaces. </p><p>  Further in our article you will find a list and descriptions of the ten most southern cities of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Vladivostok - a city dissolved in hills </h2><p>  Vladivostok for almost all the inhabitants of Russia is a completely different world.  Many have heard a lot about him, but few have personally visited it.  Vladivostok is a city of dense fogs, gentle hills and beautiful bridges.  It was created by the hands of travelers and the military.  Therefore, in his appearance and character there are features of both officer nobility and a certain adventurism. </p><p>  Geographically, Vladivostok is located in the south of Russia.  However, the climate of this city is incredibly capacious and can be accurately described with the following saying: "the latitude is Crimean, and longitude is Kolyma."  The soft and velvet first half of autumn is replaced by a very cold and chilly November.  Winters in Vladivostok are completely harsh.  In January, the air temperature often drops to –20 degrees. </p><p>  City coordinates: latitude 43 ° 07 ′ 00 ″. </p>

    <h2>  Vladikavkaz - modest and hospitable </h2><p>  The fortified city was founded in 1784 by Prince Potemkin with one goal - “to conquer the Caucasus”.  Hence the name.  Today <span>it is the capital of the</span> Republic of North Ossetia - Alania with a population of 300 thousand people.  By climatic features, Vladikavkaz is truly a “southern” city.  Winters are very mild, and summers are long and sultry.  Vladikavkaz is distinguished by the variegated ethnic composition of its population: Ossetians, Russians, Georgians, Armenians, Ukrainians and representatives of other nationalities live here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The coordinates of the city: 43 ° 01 ′ 00 ″ north latitude. </p>

    <h2>  Fokino - the city of cozy bays </h2><p>  Moving further south.  In the Primorsky Territory, on the shore of Strelok Bay, there is a small town Fokino.  It was founded at the end of the XIX century by immigrants from Ukraine.  Named in honor of Alexei Fokin - the builder of the local naval base.  The climate in Fokino is mild and warm enough, with frequent winds and a clear division into seasons.  Average July temperatures: +19 degrees, January –9 degrees.  Residents from nearby Vladivostok often come here in order to escape from the bustle of the city and relax on the sandy beaches of cozy rocky bays. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  City coordinates: 42 ° 58 ′ 00 ″ north latitude. </p><h2>  Kaspiysk - a city by the sea, but not a resort </h2><p>  Kaspiysk is a satellite city of Makhachkala, located just 15 kilometers from the <span>capital of Dagestan.</span>  It is located on the shores of the eponymous sea-lake.  The city boasts a relatively mild climate.  Winters are warm and summers are sultry.  Already at the end of March, apricots and cherries bloom in full swing in Kaspiysk.

    <h2>  Izberbash - a city of oil and recreation </h2><p>  Izberbash is a young city on the shores of the Caspian Sea (founded in 1932), 65 kilometers south of Makhachkala.  An important center of Dagestan for oil production.  For the first time in the world, the technique of drilling deviated wells from the seashore was tested in this city.  In addition to the booming industry, resort and recreational infrastructure is actively developing in Izberbash.  The main city beach is known for its excellent fine-grained sand and stretches for almost three kilometers along the coast. </p><p>  City coordinates: latitude 42 ° 34 ′ 00 ″. </p><h2>  Dagestan Lights - a city of glass and carpet </h2><p>  A powerful earthquake in 1904 disrupted rock formations, and gas began to ooze through cracks from the bowels of the earth's crust.  Travelers making bonfires were surprised to see how the blue flames soared sharply up to the sky and dispersed along the cracks in the soil.  The unusual name of a small Dagestan city is connected with this. </p><p>  Today in the Dagestan lights no more than 30 thousand people live.  The city still operates a glass factory, which was founded in 1926.  In addition to him, a brick and carpet factory works here. </p><p>  City coordinates: latitude 42 ° 07 ′ 00 ″. </p><h2>  Derbent - ancient, very ancient! </h2><p>  So, which city of Russia is the most southern?

Often, tourists call it the “Russian Bombay”, as well as the oldest settlement in the country.  The first mention of Derbent dates back to the sixth century BC! </p>
