Elegant diverse nature, mild climate, a long season for sea vacations, developed hotel infrastructure, an abundance of attractions, proximity to Russia and the relative cheapness of tours - these are not all the charms of this beautiful country that attract tourists here. </p><h2>  Features of the city of Marmaris </h2><p>  One of the most popular resort cities in Turkey is the picturesque Marmaris.  The city is located directly between the Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea, its name translates as <span>"sea pearl".</span>  On the island of Sedir is one of the most romantic places on the planet - Cleopatra's beach.  The city is surrounded by generous vegetation: needles and an oleander create an indescribable atmosphere of comfort and clean air, to say nothing of a beautiful view!  According to the Turks themselves, this city is the most beautiful on the entire southwestern coast of the country. </p><p>  Around Marmaris there are a lot of attractions: the island of Cleopatra, the ancient <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Ephesus,</span> Prena, Miletus.  If you are ready to go 3 hours, you can see the eighth wonder of the world - Pamukkale - and swim nearby in the thermal springs.  The city is absolutely universal and suits everyone for such reasons: </p><ul><li>  due to geographical features, there is never sweltering heat, in the hottest months the air temperature is lower by an average of 5-6 degrees than in other resorts in Turkey; </li><li>  an ideal place to relax with children - because of the framing in the form of an island and a peninsula, the bay is characterized by a calm sea without waves; </li><li>  party-goers will really like it - an abundance of clubs with interesting programs and a large influx of nightlife lovers. </li></ul><p>  From the very beginning, Marmaris was a favorite resort of Europeans, so the service in hotels is very decent and is designed for demanding tourists from Germany, the UK and other countries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  General hotel experience </h2><p>  A two-hour transfer from the airport to the Luna Beach Deluxe 5 * hotel (Turkey, Marmaris) was practically not a problem for any of the vacationers.  Comfortable modern buses and window views brightened the ride. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to tourists, the quality of Wi-Fi is poor.  The strongest signal is near the reception, along the perimeter of the hotel it is often lost.  The territory is small but cozy thanks to the competent use of space and diverse vegetation.  There are negative reviews about the excessive chlorination of pools, which was accompanied by unpleasant odors.  In general, the opinions of vacationers agree that the hotel area is too small to fit the five-star category, but nevertheless Luna Beach Deluxe 5 * is a worthy place to relax. </p>

    <h2>  Comfort in the rooms </h2><p>  The rooms are medium in size, but at the same time quite spacious, with a facelift that satisfied most vacationers.  But there were complaints about the quality of furniture: not all of it was serviceable and updated.  The views from the balcony evoked different impressions - someone was lucky and they pleased the eye with landscapes, while others had to look at the garden or live above the kitchen and listen to the noise from the work of the night shift cooks.  The rooms should be cleaned daily, but some tourists claim that it was not there, and the maximum that they received was garbage.  There are also reviews that guests asked the staff to clean, but their requests were ignored.  However, there are enough reviews about the pleasant cleanliness of the rooms and the regular change of bed linen and towels, as well as replenishment of cosmetics. </p><p>  The overwhelming majority of tourists settled quickly, without problems and taking into account personal wishes. </p><p>  More negative reviews are about family rooms, primarily related to air conditioning: in some, for some unknown reason, they were not installed in such a way that they blew onto the berth, causing discomfort during sleep.  There were isolated complaints about the insufficient number of towels for all family members. </p>

    <h2>  Food quality </h2><p>  When considering reviews of food at a hotel, one should take into account the likely subjectivity of the opinions of tourists: each has his own idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgood food, based on a familiar lifestyle and experience in other hotels.  Luna Beach Deluxe 5 * offers guests UAI, and most vacationers praised the assortment and taste of dishes.  Some had few fruits and were indignant at the alleged reuse of dishes, as well as the overuse of spices.  Many tourists write that the menu is standard for Turkish hotels, which should be taken as a positive assessment.  There are reviews with claims to the quality of alcoholic beverages: according to hotel guests, there was no fundamental difference in the taste of gin, whiskey and rum.  It should be noted that such a feature of alcohol is inherent in all bars of hotels in Turkey and Egypt, according to observations of travelers.  The quality of tea and coffee is good, powder fruit drinks did not cause joy.  Some lacked fresh ones, but they are rarely offered in an all-inclusive system. </p><p>  Very few tourists with children were unhappy with the lack of a children's menu, but it is quite possible to replace it with dietary dishes: cereals, boiled eggs, vegetables of different cooking methods and fruits.  The range of pastries is wide, it can also be given to children. </p>

    <h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  The hotel's beach is sand and pebble, so it is recommended to bring special shoes with you.  Most of the hotel guests noted such disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Small beach area: according to reviews, its length is not more than 40 meters.  In fairness, it is worth noting that in Marmaris all the beaches are small. </li><li>  The need to occupy deck chairs even before dawn - in conditions of sufficient occupancy of the hotel, they were not enough at all.  Along with this opinion, there are reviews that places have always been. </li><li>  Stones at the bottom of the sea, which could easily be injured at the entrance.  This issue is resolved thanks to slates or crocks brought with them or bought on the spot. </li></ul><p>  A significant number of people liked the beach with all its shortcomings, as well as transparent water of a comfortable temperature. </p><h2>  Animation </h2><p>  After analyzing the reviews of tourists regarding the animation at the Luna Beach Deluxe 5 * hotel (Marmaris), we can conclude that it was of high quality during the high season and became worse with a decrease in the flow of tourists.  But during the day in any months, the guests were offered: </p><ul><li>  daily activities: water aerobics, exercise, water polo, darts; </li><li>  evening: animation, a disco on the territory of the hotel with free entrance until 23:00 and paid alcoholic drinks, children's discos. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Staff work </h2><p>  Most tourists note the well-trained staff, courtesy and willingness to solve any problem on the spot.  The hotel staff will also be happy to tell you where it is most profitable to shop and where to go on an excursion.  You can communicate with staff in Russian (sometimes with difficulty), in English and in German.  Isolated cases when hotel guests were dissatisfied with the indifference of the staff were not backed up by facts.  Tourists also noticed a difference in the quality of work of different staff shifts in the kitchen. </p><p>  Given the fact that the hotel was originally aimed at tourists from Europe, it is more appropriate to believe that their training and quality of work is still at a high level. </p><h2>  Paid Services </h2><p>  A fairly high rating is given by tourists to the SPA-salon on the territory of the hotel and the work of the masseur.  Many tourists liked shopping, especially the seller‚Äôs willingness and willingness to lower the price, sometimes up to 50%.  Paid alcohol at a disco also earned a high praise from vacationers. </p>

    <h2>  Excursion programs offered at the hotel </h2><p>  The city, due to its geographical position, is rich in opportunities to go on excursions.  This was discussed above.  Attractions for every taste and budget are offered to vacationers.  Hotel guides conscientiously advise and help in choosing a tour.  Good reviews are found on boat trips on yachts.  One of them is a VIP tour at a fixed price, for which you can collect partners and share payment with them.  As part of the tour, it is proposed to fish and swim in the open sea, eat delicious meals during the trip, and get professional photos on the disk for an extra fee.  An excursion to the island of Rhodes also received a good mark - a great chance to visit island Greece during a trip to Turkey.  Of course, the island of Cleopatra and Pamukkale is praised.  The guides tell you in an accessible and entertaining way, the buses are comfortable, the water and dry rations are provided by the hotel, the buffet during the excursions is varied. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that the Luna Beach Deluxe 5 * hotel receives both positive and negative reviews.  It is not perfect for everyone, but definitely worthy of praise.  Those who go to Marmaris to enjoy nature, carefree moments and not to find fault with the little things of the service will like it. </p>
