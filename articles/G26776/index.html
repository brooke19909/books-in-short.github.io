How to get to Red Square?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Without a doubt,</span> every foreigner and Russian who ends up in Moscow certainly goes to Red Square.  This is not surprising, because it is here that you can plunge into the culture of Russia, visiting beautiful centuries-old temples and museums or going to the Lenin Mausoleum.  However, it is impossible to get here if you do not know the address of Red Square in Moscow at least approximately. </p><h2>  the Red Square </h2><p>  Historically, it was this place that became central in Russia.  In the XVI century, the bazaar was simply located here, but soon after the construction of the St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral and the Spassky Gate, the square became so beautiful that a decree was adopted to rename it to Red, or in another way, Beautiful. </p><p>  As in former times, to this day, the address of Red Square in Moscow is associated with the country's leadership.  Previously, it was here, on the <span>Forefront, that the</span> decrees of kings and later emperors were read out, in Soviet times, leaders from here addressed speeches to their people, and to this day Victory parades are held here and presidents turn to citizens on New Year's Eve. </p>

    <p>  In fact, oddly enough, the address of Red Square in Moscow is impossible to find, because no matter how significant it is, the attraction remains an area, and only buildings have addresses.  However, do not be upset, because you can always focus on neighboring buildings, for example, the GUM or the St. Basil's Cathedral. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to see on Red Square </h2><p>  If you think that there is nothing special to see on Red Square, then you are deeply mistaken.  In addition to the famous paving stones and the red walls of the Kremlin, there are many more interesting places, including temples, monuments, the Mausoleum and museums. </p><p>  Perhaps the main decoration of Red Square is St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral.  Note that it is completely renovated and interesting both outside and inside.  So, you can look at museum exhibits and icons. </p>

    <p>  The Lenin Mausoleum is another building that attracts tourists.  Although the Soviet Union ceased to exist many years ago, the memory of our past is still preserved.  If you want to look at the leader of socialism, then you should hurry up - there has long been debate about how to bury the body of Vladimir Ilyich. </p><p>  The monument to Minin and Pozharsky stands in a place of honor.  It was established in the 19th century in memory of the heroes who played a decisive role in military operations against the Polish troops.  It is noteworthy that in Soviet times it was moved, since the sculpture interfered with the parades. </p><h2>  How to get to Red Square </h2><p>  Definitely, this is the most important question for tourists.  How to get to Red Square?  Very simple, especially if you are going to take the subway.  To look at the main attraction, you don‚Äôt even have to think about what is the address of Red Square in Moscow - the metro goes directly to it.  In the immediate vicinity there are as many as 3 stations: Okhotny Ryad, <span>Revolution Square</span> and Teatralnaya.  The distance from them is about the same, so the decision on which station to leave depends only on which line you are traveling. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  If you are traveling by car, it will already be a little more difficult, because you will have to understand parking lots and traffic features yourself.  Please note that the address of Red Square in <span>Moscow by car</span> should be searched for nearby buildings.  Another caveat - the attraction is the heart of the capital, so finding free parking nearby is very difficult.  We advise you to find out the location of parking lots in advance so as not to waste time looking for free space. </p><h2>  What souvenirs can be bought on Red Square </h2><p>  In fact, on Red Square, you can not only enjoy the historical heritage of Russia, but also buy yourself a souvenir.  The number of different products and stores is simply impressive.  Add to this street trading - and get the whole picture.  Residents of the city, of course, know the address of Red Square in Moscow and also know that this is a place where everything is sold very expensive.  Here you can buy any souvenirs - from the simplest dolls and earflaps to exquisite jewelry with the symbols of the country. </p><p>  If you prefer expensive and high-quality goods, then you just need to visit the GUM - the most famous store in Moscow. </p>
