Going down the hill is not scary.  Smooth movement like children and adults. </p><div class="photo" data-original="obzor-akvaparkov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="toboggan in a fairy tale" class="if uuid-2936177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2936177.jpg"></div><p>  The longest slide is ‚ÄúToboggan‚Äù: the length of the gutter is 43 meters.  The speed develops up to 5 meters per second.  Here you can test your nerves and get adrenaline.

This attraction is for adults only. </p><ul><li>  "Black Hole" - the length of the mountain is 77 meters with steep winding turns.  The speed develops up to 14 meters per second.  Cowards are not accepted here. </li><li>  "Hydrotube" - extreme and adrenaline are provided here.  Downhill to 10 meters per second.  Extreme darkness and speed will make you hide your heart in your heels.  Feelings - beyond words. </li></ul><p>  The only drawback is that at temperatures below 20 degrees the slides stop working.  This does not prevent visitors from finding other, equally interesting activities.  Pools and indoor slides are always at guests' disposal, warm pools with a geyser will bring a lot of pleasure. </p><p>  You can enjoy a gentle water massage and completely relax in the jacuzzi.  Yes, not simple, but under a mushroom with falling trickles of rain.  Indeed, as in a fabulous country - good. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Children's World Magic </h2><p>  Staying here brings a lot of fun to children.
