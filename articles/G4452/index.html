Halkidiki has a large number of restaurants specializing in cooking fish and other seafood dishes. </p><p>  On the peninsula you can also find a large number of cafes and taverns, where you will be served a real Greek salad and a cup of coffee made according to a special recipe.  All tourists must buy real olive oil, a liter of which costs about ten euros. </p><h2>  It's time to go! </h2><p>  Since reviews of Halkidiki have long spread around the world, it is best to book tickets and hotel rooms in advance.  Experienced tourism managers advise doing this in early March, before the tourist boom begins.  It is at this time of year that you can buy tickets to hotels at relatively cheap prices.  You can also try to wait for the appearance of "burning" offers, but the likelihood of this is rather small, the resort is so popular.  If in May "last minute" vouchers do not appear, most likely they will not be available throughout the season. </p><p>  The Halkidiki Peninsula, which is highly recommended by travelers for travel, is a real Mecca for travelers eager to relax and get a lot of impressions.  The main thing is not to forget to bring along a camera or camcorder, as well as all the necessary accessories.  In the event that you suddenly need to transfer information to any medium, they will gladly come to your aid in the hotel where you are staying.  Have a nice rest! </p>
