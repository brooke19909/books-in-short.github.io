The rates and calculation of such a payment are to be studied further.  The information provided will certainly help car owners.  They will be able to understand how much they will need to pay for a car or other motor vehicle in a given tax period.  And can you not pay the bills?  And if so, under what conditions?  Answers to all these questions and not only will necessarily be presented below.  In fact, everything is simpler than it seems.  It is enough to carefully study the current legislation to get rid of issues related to taxes on cars.  The only exception is verification of the corresponding debt.  It is not spelled out in laws.  Therefore, we will talk about a similar moment in more detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avtozakony.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much do you need to pay the transport tax" class="if uuid-3144880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3144880.jpg"></div><h2>  Payment Details </h2><p>  Interested in transport tax?  Automobile tax rates play an important role in accruing taxes.  But what is it? </p><p>  Vehicle tax is an annual tax payment.  It is charged to all owners of vehicles equipped with motors with rare exceptions.  You have to pay annually. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Transport taxes in Russia fall under the control of regional laws.  That is, rates on it, as well as categories of beneficiaries are set in each city separately. </p><h2>  Money Transfer Terms </h2><p>  Transport tax rates increased in 2019.  Nevertheless, citizens must specify them depending on the place of registration of the car.  For the same transport in different cities you have to pay differently. </p><p>  To date, it is necessary to transfer funds to taxes for vehicles by December 1, 2019.  This principle applies to all cities of Russia.  True, it applies only to individuals. </p><p>  Organizations will also have to pay to locate the motor vehicles they own.  In this case, the funds must be transferred to the state before February 5, 2019.  Advance payments for the corresponding accrual do not have to do. </p><div class="photo" data-original="money101.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transport taxes for large families and not only" class="if uuid-3144886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3144886.jpg"></div><h2>  What are they paying for? </h2><p>  Almost every citizen who owns a vehicle must pay a personal vehicle tax.  But why exactly do you need to transfer funds to the state? </p><p>  Today, citizens pay taxes on cars for any vehicle with a motor.  Namely, for: </p><ul><li>  Cars; </li><li>  Trucks </li><li>  buses (including minibuses); </li><li>  caterpillar transport; </li><li>  boats; </li><li>  court; </li><li>  aircraft; </li><li>  motorcycles; </li><li>  scooters. </li></ul><p>  But you don‚Äôt have to pay for bicycles and gyro scooters.  These vehicles are not taxed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tax exempted vehicles </h2><p>  Who <span>is entitled</span> to transport <span>tax benefits</span> ?  It is problematic to give an unambiguous answer to a similar question.  The thing is that in Russia the payment being studied is regional in nature.  And as already mentioned, the beneficiaries for it are determined by local laws and by-laws.  So, somewhere there are beneficiaries, but somewhere they are not at all. </p><p>  Nevertheless, at the federal level there are categories of vehicles that are exempt from taxation.  These include: </p><p>  TS with engine power up to 100 l.  S., acquired through social services; </p><ul><li>  cars equipped for use by persons with disabilities; </li><li>  boats with a capacity of up to 5 "horses"; </li><li>  passenger and cargo ships, if used for their intended purpose; </li><li>  agricultural vehicles involved in production; </li><li>  cars of the Federal authorities; </li><li>  transport of special services. </li></ul><p>  There is nothing difficult to remember in this.  The main thing is to remember that ordinary citizens rarely fall under such benefits.  And they have to look for legal ways to reduce taxes on cars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zarplata-online.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Calculation of transport tax on the website of the Federal Tax Service" class="if uuid-3144881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3144881.jpg"></div><h2>  What you need to calculate the payment </h2><p>  Calculation of transport tax in the Russian Federation can be done in different ways.  It all depends on the personal preferences of the person. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For example, you can independently carry out the simplest mathematical operations to get the amount of payment for a car or other transport.  But for this, a citizen needs to clarify certain data. </p><p>  These include: </p><ul><li>  vehicle year of manufacture; </li><li>  cost of transport; </li><li>  the number of months of vehicle ownership per year; </li><li>  engine power; </li><li>  tax rate for a particular car in the selected region. </li></ul><p>  That's all.  You can also clarify whether someone is entitled to tax breaks on cars.  If all the data is received, you can proceed with the calculation of the corresponding tax charge. </p><h2>  Calculation Formulas </h2><p>  Calculation of transport tax is not as difficult as it seems at first glance.  It is enough to use the simplest formulas to implement the task. </p><p>  Usually, in order to find out how much to pay for a car, you need to use this calculation method: </p><p>  Vehicle tax = tax rate * number of ‚Äúhorses‚Äù in the engine * (number of months of vehicle ownership in the year / 12). </p><p>  Using this formula, a person will be able to quickly and without significant problems understand how much he will have to pay in a given year for owning a vehicle with a motor.  But that is not all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="banks7.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TC tax formula" class="if uuid-3144885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3144885.jpg"></div><p>  The thing is that transportation can be luxurious.  It is for this that it is necessary to clarify its cost.  For luxury vehicles, an advanced formula for calculating vehicle tax is used.  The bets on them will be exactly the same as for ordinary cars, but the so-called increasing coefficient will appear. </p><p>  So, in order to calculate how much to pay for a luxury vehicle, you just need to multiply the figure obtained by the previous formula by an increase factor. </p><h2>  Automatic calculations </h2><p>  But this is far from the only way out of the situation.  A person wants to know and calculate the tax on transport?  It is not necessary to know the rates and formulas for calculating the corresponding accrual.  There is a special service on the Internet that, according to initial data, helps to calculate taxes.  And not just for cars. </p><p>  It is about using a tax calculator.  It can be found on many information resources, but it is best to use the service from the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation.  It is official, which leads to timely updating of data for further calculations. </p><p>  How to find out the amount of transport tax?  To do this, it is recommended to proceed as follows: </p><ol><li>  Go to the Nalog.ru website, and then switch to the "Individuals" block. </li><li>  Look in the subsection "Services". </li><li>  Click on the button labeled "Tax Calculator". </li><li>  Specify parameters for calculations.  Usually for this it is necessary to indicate the power of the vehicle engine, its luxury (if any), as well as the place of registration of movable property. </li><li>  Click on the "Calculate" button. </li></ol><p>  After the actions taken, a message appears with the size of the tax payment for a given period.  It is very convenient, especially considering that the online calculator works around the clock. </p><h2>  About bids </h2><p>  What you need to know to calculate transport tax?  Betting on it.  Without this information, it will be impossible to cope with the task.  And the tax rate for vehicles depends on engine power. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rnk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Auto tax rates in 2019" class="if uuid-3144882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3144882.jpg"></div><p>  Regions can set this indicator in the value of 1 ruble more by one horsepower.  For example, in Moscow at the moment, a minimum rate of 12 rubles is applied to passenger transport, and a maximum of 150 rubles. </p><p>  More accurate data, as already mentioned, must be clarified in a particular city.  Vehicle tax rates will vary depending on the place of registration of the motor vehicle. </p><p>  Important: you can not register a vehicle at the registration of the owner.  Sometimes this technique is very beneficial. </p><h2>  How to find out debt </h2><p>  How much tax should be paid by modern car owners, they found out.  And how can you find out the amount of the corresponding charges, excluding the independent calculations, as well as tax calculators? </p><p>  The amount of tax for transport can be clarified: </p><ul><li>  through the tax office; </li><li>  in a multifunctional center; </li><li>  on "State services"; </li><li>  through electronic wallets; </li><li>  on the portal "Payment of public services"; </li><li>  through third-party websites. </li></ul><p>  The last trick is not popular.  Typically, third-party web inspection resources resemble the service "Payment of public services" in their work.  Only they are unreliable sources.  Among these, fraudsters are increasingly found. </p><p>  Important: a citizen can find out the exact amount of tax on a car from a tax notice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ipipip.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to calculate auto tax" class="if uuid-3144887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3144887.jpg"></div><h2>  About discounts and benefits </h2><p>  Who is entitled to transport tax benefits?  To give an exact answer to this kind of question will not work.  The thing is that discounts and benefits are determined by regional legislation. </p><p>  For example, in Moscow and the Moscow Region, pensioners do not have any tax benefits on cars.  They will be exempted from this payment on a common basis. </p><p>  Typically, the number of beneficiaries include: </p><ul><li>  seniors; </li><li>  large families; </li><li>  veterans; </li><li>  Heroes of the USSR or the Russian Federation; </li><li>  Cavalry of the Order of Glory; </li><li>  the poor; </li><li>  disabled people; </li><li>  retired military personnel. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, benefits can be expressed either as a complete exemption from taxation of one transport of a particular category, or a discount of 20 to 50 percent. </p><p>  More accurate data on tax credits for finding a vehicle in the property must be specified in a particular city.  Transport tax for large families, as a rule, no one cancels.  But they can count on a small discount, although not everywhere. </p><h2>  About providing benefits </h2><p>  Suppose a person is entitled to a car tax exemption.  What does he need to do to implement it?  Usually you need to contact the authorized body with an application for the provision of benefits.  Otherwise, the corresponding right will be lost.  Discounts and tax exemption for vehicles are indicative.  And until a person announces their intention to take advantage of the proposed state bonuses, no one will provide them. </p><p>  Typically, to obtain a discount or complete exemption from tax on vehicles, a citizen will need: </p><ol><li>  Prepare documents (passport, TIN, application, STS) for further operation. </li><li>  Contact your local tax office or multifunctional center with a request for benefits. </li><li>  Wait a while. </li></ol><p>  There is nothing incomprehensible or difficult in this.  If a person has questions about the provision of tax benefits, it is best to seek clarification from the Federal Tax Service in a particular region. </p><h2>  Issues with receipts </h2><p>  Taxes on the transport of individuals we have studied.  And what else must each citizen remember?  For example, that the absence of a payment notice does not exempt from tax liability.  So, you still have to pay. </p><p>  Usually, notifications of the need to pay transport tax in Russia are sent out one month before the end of the date of transfer of money.  In our case, until November 1.  If after this date the payment did not arrive in the mail, you need to check the tax debt yourself.  For example, on the website of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation or on "State Services". </p><p>  It is worth noting that for some time now, users who have registered at the State Services have not received paper tax notifications.  By law, such persons will be notified directly through the e-government website. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cars.usnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much to pay for a car owned" class="if uuid-3144883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3144883.jpg"></div><h2>  Payment Methods </h2><p>  How to find out how much to pay transport tax?  You can make calculations, or you can "punch" a person by TIN on "State Services" or other web services.  In the "Taxpayer Personal Account" tax charges will be displayed in the "Accrued" section. </p><p>  How can I contribute cash to my vehicle tax?  Rates and rules for calculating thereof have already been studied.  You can pay a receipt: </p><p>  through cash desks of various financial organizations; </p><ul><li>  using payment terminals; </li><li>  at ATMs; </li><li>  using the service "Payment of public services"; </li><li>  through electronic payment systems; </li><li>  on third-party web resources; </li><li>  through the e-government website. </li></ul><p>  Typically, the transfer of funds to the state treasury takes several days after the relevant operation.  Therefore, it is recommended to check the fact of tax payment 3-5 days after the transaction. </p>
