Catherine spent a lot of time studying books on economics, jurisprudence, and history, which influenced her worldview.  When Peter III ascended the throne, his relationship with his wife grew into mutual hostility.  At this time, Catherine began to prepare a conspiracy.  On her side were the Orlovs, K.G.  Razumovsky.  N.I.  Panin and others.  In June 1762, when the emperor was not in St. Petersburg, Catherine penetrated the barracks of the Izmailovsky regiment and was declared an autocratic ruler.  After long requests for negotiations, her husband abdicated in writing.  Domestic, foreign policy of Catherine II began its development.

    <h2>  Board Features </h2><p>  Catherine II was able to surround herself with talented and outstanding personalities.  She strongly supported interesting ideas that could be advantageously used for her own purposes.  The Empress behaved tactfully and restrained with her subjects, had the gift to listen to her interlocutor.  But Catherine II loved power and could go to any extremes, just to keep it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The empress supported the Orthodox Church, but did not refuse to use religion in politics.  She allowed to build Protestant and Catholic churches, and even mosques.  But the transition from Orthodoxy to another religion was still punished. </p><h2>  <span>Domestic policy of</span> Catherine 2 (briefly) </h2><p>  The empress chose three postulates on which her activities were based: consistency, gradualism and taking into account public moods.  Catherine verbally was a supporter of the abolition of serfdom, but pursued a policy of supporting the nobles.  She established the number of people in each province (there should not be more than 400 thousand inhabitants), and in the county (up to 30 thousand).  In connection with this division, many cities were built. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Catherine's domestic policy 2 briefly" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20789/561815.jpg" width="434"></div>  In each provincial center, a number of government agencies were organized.  These are such as the main provincial institution - the Office - with the governor at the head, the Criminal and Civil Chambers, the financial management body (state chamber).  The following were also established: the Upper Zemsky Court, the Provincial Magistrate and the Upper Reprisal.  They played the role of the court for different classes and consisted of chairmen and assessors.  An authority for the peaceful resolution of conflicts was created, which was called the <span>Joint Court.</span>  The cases of insane criminals were also investigated here.  The problems of the arrangement of schools, shelters and almshouses were dealt with by the Order of Public Charity.

A number of boards also appeared here.  So, the Lower Zemstvo court was responsible for the activities of the police and administration.  <span>The county court</span> was subordinate to the Upper Zemsky Court and considered the cases of the nobles.  The place where the citizens were suing was the City Magistrate.  To solve the problems of the peasants created the Lower Reprisal. </p><p>  Control over the correct implementation of the law was entrusted to the provincial prosecutor and two solicitors.  The Governor-General monitored the activities of several provinces and could directly contact the empress.  The domestic policy of Catherine 2, a table of estates described in many historical books. </p><h2>  Judicial reform </h2><p>  In 1775, a new dispute resolution system was established.  In each estate, a judicial authority decided its own.  All courts, except the Lower Reprisal, were elected.  Upper Zemsky examined the affairs of the landlords, and the Upper and Lower massacres were engaged in peasant disputes (if the peasant was state).  Disputes of the serfs sorted out by the landowner.  As for the clergy, only bishops in the provincial consistories could judge them.  The Senate became the Supreme Judiciary. </p><h2>  Municipal reform </h2><p>  The empress sought to create local organizations for each estate with the provision of the right to self-government.  In 1766, Catherine II introduced the Manifesto on the formation of a commission to address local issues.  Under the leadership of the chairman of the society of nobles and an elected head for the city, deputies were elected, as well as the transfer of orders to them.  As a result, a number of legislative acts appeared that enshrined certain rules of local self-government.  The nobility was empowered to elect the county and provincial chairmen, secretary, county judge and assessors and other managers.  Two municipalities were involved in urban management: General and Six-Glass.  The first one had the right to make orders in this area.  The chairman was the mayor.  The general thought was convened as necessary.  Six-digit was going every day.  It was an executive body and consisted of six representatives of each estate and mayor.  There was also the City Duma, which met once every three years.  This body had the right to elect the Six-digit Duma. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The domestic policy of Catherine 2 did not ignore the police.  In 1782, she created a decree that regulated the structure of law enforcement agencies, their activities, as well as the punishment system. </p><h2>  The life of the nobility </h2>

    <p>  The domestic policy of Catherine 2 by a number of documents legally confirmed the advantageous position of this estate.  The nobleman could be executed or his property taken away only after a serious crime had been committed by him.  The court sentence was necessarily agreed with the empress.  The nobleman could not be subjected to physical punishment.  In addition to disposing of the fate of the peasants and the affairs of the estate, the representative of the estate was free to travel abroad and send his complaints immediately to the Governor General.  Foreign and domestic policies of Catherine 2 were based on the interests of the estate. </p><p>  The rights of poor representatives were slightly infringed.  So, an individual with a certain property qualification could take part in provincial noble meetings.  This also applied to the position, in this case the additional income should be at least 100 rubles per year. </p><h2>  Economic reform </h2>

An exception was the mining business, which existed in the form of state business until 1861, as well as enterprises serving the army.  The measures taken contributed to the growth of the economy of the merchants.  This estate took an active part in the formation of new production and enterprises.  Thanks to the action of the merchants, the linen industry began to develop, which later turned into a textile section.  Catherine II in 1775 established three merchant guilds, which were divided among themselves by available capital.  For each association, a fee of 1% was removed from the capital, which was declared and not verified.  In 1785, a letter was read out, which indicated that merchants had the right to participate in local government and the court, they were exempted from corporal punishment.  Privileges applied only to the first and second guilds, and in exchange an increase in the amount of declared capital was required.

    <p>  The domestic policy of Catherine II also concerned rural residents.  They were allowed to engage in their craft and sell their products.  Peasants traded on graveyards, but were limited in many trading operations.  The nobles could organize fairs and sell goods at them, but they did not have the right to build factories in cities.  This estate sought in every way to push out the merchants and seize the textile and distillery industries.  And they gradually succeeded, since by the beginning of the 19th century, 74 nobles had factories at their disposal, and there were only twelve merchants at the head of the enterprises. </p><p>  Catherine II opened the Assignment Bank, which was created for the successful activities of the upper classes.  A financial institution accepted deposits, conducted emissions, and kept records of bills.  The result of active actions was the merger of the silver ruble and the banknote. </p><h2>  Education, Culture and Science Reforms </h2>

    <ol><li>  On behalf of the Empress, teacher I.I.  Betskoy developed the General Institution for the Education of Both Sexes of Youth.  On its basis, the Society of Noble Maidens <span>(Smolny Institute), a</span> commercial school and an educational institution at the Academy of Arts were opened.  In 1782, a commission was formed to establish schools for school reform.  Her plan was developed by an Austrian teacher F.I.  Yankovichem.  During the reform in the cities, public schools were opened for all comers - major and minor.  Institutions were maintained by the state.  Under Catherine II, the Medical College, the Mining School and other educational institutions were opened. </li><li>  The successful domestic policy of Catherine 2 1762-1796 gave an impetus to the development of science.  In 1765, the <span>Free Economic Society</span> organization appeared <span>,</span> which was designed to expand knowledge in the geography of the country.  In the period from 1768 to 1774, scientists of the Academy of Sciences participated in five expeditions.  Thanks to such trips, knowledge was expanded not only in the field of geography, but also in biology, and in other natural sciences.  In the 80s, the Russian Academy was built to study language and literature.  During the reign of Catherine II, more books were printed than in the entire XVIII century.  The first public library in the state has opened in St. Petersburg.  Reading books was carried away in almost every class.  At this time, education began to be appreciated. </li><li>  The domestic policy of Catherine 2 did not bypass the appearance of high society.  Active social life in higher circles obliged ladies and gentlemen to follow fashion.  In 1779, the magazine Fashionable Monthly Writing, or the Library for the Ladies' Toilet began to publish examples of new clothes.  The decree of 1782 obliged the nobles to wear costumes in accordance with the colors of the coat of arms of their province.  Two years later, a requirement was added to this order - a certain cut in the uniform. </li></ol><h2>  Foreign policy </h2>
