More recently, it was a small village formed in the 19th century on the site of the ancient Turkish fortress Akhtar-Bakhtar.  This settlement received the status of a city only in 1949.  The basis of its economy, as now, was fishing, breeding and processing of fish.  But recently, the city authorities have begun to pay great attention to the development of the tourism business. </p><p>  Today it is a resort that annually meets hundreds of tourists with its spacious beaches, as well as the gentle sea.  It is an ideal place for lovers of fishing and windsurfing.  In addition, many people come here who wish to improve their health with the help of local therapeutic mud and hydrogen sulfide sources.  All of them are warmly welcomed by the hotels of Primorsko-Akhtarsk, which are more than enough built in the city. </p><h2>  Where to live? </h2><p>  The Krasnodar Territory is visited by hundreds of thousands of tourists every year.  Some of them choose the city of Primorsko-Akhtarsk as the place for their vacation.  It attracts those who love comfort and a relaxing holiday on the shores of the warm sea.  Visitors are always ready to meet first-class hotels of Primorsko-Akhtarsk and comfortable hotels.  And for those who prefer to live in the private sector, there are cozy houses and campsites.  Almost all Primorsko-Akhtarsk hotels do not have a star rating.  Only one Marisol hotel differs from them.  According to generally accepted standards, it corresponds to the category of ‚Äú2 stars‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Among the other institutions that you can advise to visit, it is worth highlighting: </p><ul><li>  Sarial, Tropicana, Brigantine and Volna hotels; </li><li>  guest houses ‚ÄúBabylon‚Äù, ‚ÄúVenice‚Äù, ‚ÄúEnglish Channel‚Äù, ‚ÄúRomance‚Äù and ‚ÄúLukomorye‚Äù; </li><li>  rest house "50 years of October"; </li><li>  Apartment "Victoria". </li></ul><p>  Almost all hotels of Primorsko-Akhtarsk are located in the central part of the city or near the coastal territory.  This is very convenient, although the settlement itself is relatively small.  It does not take much time to cross it from one end to the other. </p><h2>  Hotel Tropicana </h2><p>  There are always many who wish to settle in the Tropicana hotel.  It attracts tourists, first of all, with its original architecture.  The spectacular three-story building is located right on the coast. </p>

In addition, there is a bar where you can always spend your free time in the company of friends with pleasure.  The beach is 50 meters from the main building.

    <p>  However, they have everything you need to relax.  And guests who arrived in their car can park it and not be afraid for the safety of their cars.  To control the health and condition of visitors, a medical center operates in this hotel complex, where doctors of different directions conduct daily visits: a gynecologist, therapist, neuropathologist, cardiologist and endocrinologist.  The hotel also has a cafe where you can eat or just sit with friends with an appetite.  Given the unique surrounding nature, this place can be considered a climatic resort.  Fresh air, sea and doctor's consultations help many guests to solve their health problems. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  How much does it cost guests to visit the hotel or the hotel of Primorsko-Akhtarsk?  Prices for holidays in this resort town are quite acceptable.  Depending on the category of institution, a visitor will have to pay from 70 to 3000 rubles per day.  Here, everyone will decide based on their own financial situation.  For example, in Tropican a double room for one night will cost at least 1,500 rubles.  And this is not the ultimate price.  So, a luxury room in such an institution will cost much more.  Almost 3,000 rubles will have to be paid for it.  Anyone who is used to save money and does not seek luxury can go to the Holiday House, located on the street 50 years of October.  Here the decor and service are much simpler.  But the prices are much lower. </p>

    <p>  This summer, a double room here could be borrowed for 30 rubles per day.  Such a run in price is quite palpable.  And today, when most Russians can not afford a vacation abroad, hotels in the Krasnodar Territory invite everyone to have a good time on the coast of the warm and gentle Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov. </p>
