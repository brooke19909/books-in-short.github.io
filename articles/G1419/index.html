There are a lot of options for the development of events.  In any case, one thing is clear: you will make rather big problems for yourself.  Now banks do not give loans to everyone.  Why is this happening?  That in the future it was not necessary to beat out <span>debts</span> from <span>citizens.</span>  However, this is not a prohibition for a loan.  The population still takes loans, and then either does not pay at all, and even does not worry about paying, or, by all means, tries to cover the debt, fearing problems.  This moment actually requires special attention.  Maybe there really are secrets here? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what will happen if the loan is not paid at all" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1207952.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Does it always pay </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not just that citizens are interested in what will happen if the loan is not paid at all.  Someone simply loses the ability to make payments over time, someone does not want to repay debts.  It does not matter for what reason there is interest in this topic, the fact remains. </p><p>  Honestly, the Russians came up with a way not to pay a loan.  And far from alone.  Citizens are trying to realize a lot of different tricks and techniques.  Everything to only free yourself from obligations.  How can one evade paying?  What will happen if you fail to do this? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Card and benefits </h2><p>  The first and most accurate, as well as safe, method is the use of special credit cards with so-called soft loans.  In such a situation, a certain delay will be given for debt repayment.  On average, it is 35-55 days.  If the citizen does not close the debt, interest will begin to accrue. </p><p>  In principle, this technique can be called "took a loan and do not pay."  After all, until some point, until your debt becomes huge, no consequences will have to wait.  Just then pay what you have to and that's it.  Or there will come some not quite pleasant consequences.  About them - a little later. </p><h2>  Appeal </h2><p>  More recently, Russians have come up with a way to not pay a loan.  True, like any other method, it has its limits.  If you have a small debt, and the bank has not yet begun to bother you, you can simply contact its branch with an appropriate application for a delay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russians came up with a way not to pay a loan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1207953.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At the same time, any money will still have to be paid to the bank every month.  And some citizens are not happy with this.  They need to figure out what to do so that they do not have to pay the bank a loan and interest on it at all.  Such techniques are available.  But they, firstly, do not give a 100% guarantee, and secondly, they are not always legal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Limitation period </h2><p>  Some debtors say: <span>"I do not pay a</span> loan and I live in peace."  And unaware citizens are interested in how this result was achieved.  The thing is that there is one very interesting trick.  Most likely, it will be possible to bring it to life without any problems.  But you have to try. </p><p>  Loan debtors often use the so-called limitation period.  With regard to loans and debts, it lasts 3 years.  What does it mean?  During this period of time, there should not be any contact between you and the borrowing bank.  That is, you need to literally evaporate for 36 months from the moment the first delay occurs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loan debtors" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1207954.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As soon as 3 years pass, the debt ‚Äúburns out‚Äù.  And you can live in peace again.  There will be nothing dangerous.  Unless this process will affect your credit history.  And hardly anyone wants to contact you again.  It is difficult, but it is a very effective measure that loan debtors love.  Ignoring the bank and not messing with it is not so simple, but doable.  Everything remains only on your conscience. </p><h2>  Collectors </h2><p>  What happens if the loan is not paid at all?  Practice shows that sooner or later, collectors will begin to visit you.  These are special services that literally knock debts out of debtors.  Their actions are not always legal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In order not to pay, you can contact the special anti-collection services and organizations.  There, for a fee, they will help you to escape from the persecution, as well as suggest ways not to pay a loan.  In addition, such associations will be on your side, they will begin to struggle with collectors with all their might.  Sometimes you can even sue the ‚Äúknockers out‚Äù for illegal actions that are so common. </p><p>  Honestly, anti-collection firms are not such a bad decision.  In some cases, they will not only discourage knockers from you, but they will also help you hide from the bank for 3 years.  To make the loan burn out. </p><h2>  Courts </h2><p>  What happens if the loan is not paid at all?  Here the answer is obvious: sooner or later, problems with the law will begin.  Which ones?  In modern Russia, a credit court is relevant.  Although this is not the best idea for banks.  But it is legal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="credit court" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1207951.jpg"></div>

    <p>  That is, they can simply sue you and bring them to trial.  The phenomenon is not too frequent.  In practice, litigation leads you to pay off your debt.  And let go. </p><p>  Here again the <span>limitation period</span> comes to the rescue <span>.</span>  Credit trial held?  Wonderful!  Was the decision made?  Now you can hide for several years (how you do it, your business), wait until the statute of limitations expires.  And then you can appear again.  It turns out that the loan you will not be paid. </p><h2>  Collectors </h2><p>  "I do not pay a loan to the bank - what threatens me for this?"  - such a question arises among many debtors.  Especially for those who simply lost the ability to make payments.  That is, not out of cunning, does not fulfill his duties, but because of life circumstances.  Judgment is, of course, a legal measure.  But banks do not respect her too much.  Instead, as already mentioned, collection services are selected.  These organizations by all means knock debts out of debtors. </p><p>  And if you do not pay the loan, get ready.  What will be undertaken by the collectors is unknown.  Someone just starts constantly calling and reminding about payments.  This rarely happens.  Most often, collection companies simply violate all borders and act illegally: they threaten, put glue in door locks, spoil property, use physical force and so on.  In general, they are trying with all their might to intimidate and really knock out debt at any cost.  You need to be prepared for this, if you can‚Äôt hide from responsibility. </p><h2>  Within the country </h2><p>  Well, you should not always be afraid of debt.  In some cases (albeit very rare), banks simply act according to the law - they go to court, you are assigned a certain period for debt repayment, everyone is waiting for execution.  However, you will be subject to certain restrictions during this period. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ways not to pay a loan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1207955.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For example, citizens are interested in: "I do not pay a loan for a year - what will happen?"  If you contacted a more or less humane bank, which operates only within the framework of the law, then there is no need to be afraid of collectors.  Instead, you will simply be barred from leaving the country.  That is, going abroad will be impossible.  Until you do away with the debt.  Or for 3 years, until the statute of limitations expires. </p><h2>  Rights </h2><p>  At the moment, another measure has been invented in Russia that applies to many debtors.  For example, alimony or borrowers.  As a punishment for late payment and non-payment of funds on time, you may legally be taken away your driver‚Äôs license.  And, as a result, to deprive of the possibility of driving.  Until you correct the situation. </p><p>  Recently, this punishment has become very common.  After all, catching a debtor on the road when he drives a car is not so difficult.  Perhaps if the amount of debt is small, and you also have the opportunity to pay it, it is better to do so.  And calmly drive on. </p><h2>  Not on myself </h2><p>  There are different ways to not pay a loan.  Another approach to solving the problem is more suitable for people who are ready to set up their loved ones.  To relieve yourself of all responsibility for lending, you can simply arrange it not for yourself.  And to some close relative or comrade who will be ready to help you in difficult times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="I do not pay a loan to the bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1207956.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Yes, this approach is sneaky.  But if someone takes a loan for you, then they will demand money from this person.  All problems, courts, hardships and restrictions pass you by.  Most often, this kind of technique is used for older people who are so gullible.  First you need to convince the victim that you for one reason or another were denied a loan to the bank, then you need to manage to prove to the interlocutor that you will regularly pay the prescribed payments for the citizen.  This deception will ultimately remain on your conscience.  Nevertheless, you will remove all responsibility from yourself. </p><p>  Also a popular method, also not entirely honest and humane, is a loan taken in a marriage.  If the spouse is hiding from banks, then the second half will be required to deal with repayment.  And debt, and the loan itself.  Such a scheme is used more and more often.  But she will no longer touch the immediate debtor.  Until he shows himself again. </p><h2>  Bankruptcy </h2><p>  In Russia, the newest, but already very popular trick is the method of tax evasion through ... bankruptcy.  Individuals have the full right, according to new laws, to declare themselves bankrupt.  At the same time, no one will collect debts from them.  So, you can use this technique to free yourself from obligations. </p><p>  In principle, recognition of bankruptcy by an individual is an analogue of recognition of its insolvency.  Practice shows that many people use this feature.  Moreover, with success.  You can, for example, declare yourself bankrupt.  If you are not <span>forgiven for debt,</span> just hide in some way from banks for 3 years.  And wait until the limitation period for the loan passes.  This idea only seems to be impenetrable.  If you try, you can really succeed. </p><h2>  I will not give, and do not ask </h2><p>  What happens if the loan is not paid at all?  In addition to the consequences already listed, do not forget that debt will affect your credit history.  So, until you pay off your past debt, no one will give you a new loan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="I don‚Äôt pay a loan and live calmly" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1207957.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Unless in illegal companies such as "Microloans", "Excellent cash" and so on.  In no case do not contact such organizations for loans.  And other cash payments, too.  After all, the actions of such companies cannot be predicted.  Most likely, in the absence of timely payments, you will immediately have to face collectors. </p><p>  But in normal banks, loans and borrowings will also become inaccessible.  But all your attempts to take them will be recorded.  And, of course, this will be reported to the current borrower of funds.  As a result, they will try to track you down and hold you accountable. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the most logical way out of the situation is to make a payment on debt.  If this is not possible, try to somehow agree with the bank.  Nothing worked?  Then be patient for 3 years, try your best to avoid the bank in which you took a loan.  This will definitely help you.  If you really have good reason for non-payment, immediately declare yourself insolvent, bankrupt.  This will somehow delay the negative consequences. </p>
