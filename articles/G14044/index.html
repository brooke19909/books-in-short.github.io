The road separates it from the sea, as elsewhere in this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãTurkey.  Two years ago, it was called "Angelique Resort", but now its concept has changed.  The hotel has become a club, which means that the hotel is not just a tourist complex, but a real city for relaxation, where there is all the necessary infrastructure.  Residents, as a rule, do not imply remoteness from civilization, because everything that the soul desires, they can find on the spot.  Last year, the hotel went through a complete renovation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Hotel Anjeliq 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1574172.jpg" width="600"></div>
