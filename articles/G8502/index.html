Moreover, at the moment, the photo business is strictly divided into photos and photographs.  But still there are people who strive for the great.  Each of these people asks one question: "What kind of camera should a beginner buy?"  One of the famous photographers said a very interesting phrase: "The most important detail of a good picture is behind the camera."  Naturally, he was referring to the photographer.  Many novice photographers "lower" the cameras for $ 80, for 100, for 200, and so on. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which SLR camera is better to buy" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13618/124047.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  There is a preconceived notion in the world that money predominates in the question of which camera to buy for a novice photographer, and this is a high-quality and expensive equipment.  But it is worth removing pink filters from the eyes.  The key to any high-quality photograph is not a car, but a person.  In life, there are a thousand confirmations of this statement.  It is enough to take any average owner of a professional camera for 2000 - 4000 thousand dollars.  So, 90% of such people never translate the shooting mode of their camera beyond the machine and video.  And imagine what miracles such a camera could do in the hands of a master. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Expensive doesn't mean good </p><p>  In response to a question about which camera to buy for a novice photographer, many expensive shoppers or half-educators with a 20-megapixel matrix and 12,500 ISO are trying to buy many customers in stores.  After all, the buyer does not know that the larger the physical <span>size of the matrix,</span> the more noise it emits and the more disgusting the pictures are.  There was a case when a buyer asked a consultant a question about which camera to buy for a beginner photographer, and the consultant offered him a model for $ 2,500.  The model had both video and a 21 megapixel sensor, etc., etc. At the same time, the buyer asked for a simple model for $ 800 and began to take a series of pictures from both cameras with a sensitivity of 400 ISO.  And in the end it turned out that a cheap camera 2 times surpassed an expensive one.  And that is a fact.  This phenomenon is very common. </p>

    <p>  What to look at? </p><p>  But this does not mean that when deciding which one is better to buy a camera, it is worth taking the most backward models.  It‚Äôs just worth approaching everything wisely, knowing what to look at.  If the buyer is limited in budget, then you should look at models with a good native lens.  As many know, for many years there has been a war between Nikon and Canon.  And if you ask the question: "What kind of camera should a beginner buy?"  - then everyone will call their brands.  But through years of experience, it was concluded that the highest-quality entry-level optics, in particular the one that comes with the camera, is a Nikon privilege, that is, if you have limited resources or do not plan to buy interchangeable lenses, then Nikon will help you.  But still not the stamps matter.  If you ask a connoisseur which SLR <span>camera is better</span> to buy, he will not name you specific brands on the fly.  He will take an interest in why you are purchasing the device, in what conditions and on what settings you will shoot and, based on this, he will give advice. </p>

    <p>  You can and even need to get a budget, but high-quality camera, just remember some things. </p><p>  1. You need to pay attention to the minimum ISO value, the best value will be less than 100, the maximum is a threshold of 200. </p><p>  2. It is necessary to pay attention to optics and choose devices marked VR, this will reduce the percentage of blurred images by about half. </p><p>  3. The density of pixels on the matrix.  The larger the actual pixel size and the larger the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe matrix surface, the more high-quality picture can be obtained even at 6 megapixels. </p>
