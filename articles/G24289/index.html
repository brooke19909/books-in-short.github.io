  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The reproductive system of men and women</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are a lot of signs that distinguish a man and a woman.  These are life attitudes, and character traits, and physiological differences, and anatomical physique.  Both external and internal sexual characteristics are dissimilar in male and female. </p><p>  The reproductive system is a whole set of organs responsible for the process of reproduction.  In men and women, they are not the same.  In this regard, there are two groups of signs: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ primary.  These include organs directly responsible for fertilization, <span>fetal development,</span> and gamete formation.  Thus, in men, the prostate, ovaries and penis can be attributed to such signs, and in women, the uterus, vagina, etc.  These organs perform different functions and have a different structure; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ secondary signs are present in both those and other representatives of the human race, but they look different.  These include the mammary glands, muscles and skeleton, body hair, <span>timbre,</span> subcutaneous tissue, etc. </p><p>  <strong>The reproductive system of women</strong> </p><p>  Its main function is the formation of eggs, due to which fertilization, formation and development of a new organism takes place. </p><p>  Gametes (germ cells) mature in two ovaries located in the depths of the pelvis.  This process is possible due to the action of <span>follicle-stimulating hormone,</span> which is produced by the pituitary gland.  A bubble (follicle) forms around the ovum on the surface of the ovary, which bursts after about fourteen days.  This allows the gamete to get into the <span>fallopian tubes,</span> where, under the influence of fluid flow, it moves towards the uterus.  The ovaries expel a mature egg every four weeks.  This is how a woman‚Äôs reproductive system prepares for fertilization. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The uterine mucosa becomes thicker, the number of blood vessels and nutrients in it increases significantly.  If, being in the fallopian tubes, as a result of sexual intercourse, the gamete is fertilized by a sperm, a new embryonic cell will appear.  It attaches to the uterine mucosa, where it then begins to develop further, turning over time into an embryo.  The period of pregnancy ends with childbirth.  The fetus comes into the light through the vagina. </p><p>  In the event that the combination of gametes (male to female) does not occur, the egg with blood and thickened mucosa will be rejected by the uterus.  This period, which lasts several days, is called ‚Äúmenstruation‚Äù.  At this time, the reproductive system experiences slight hormonal fluctuations, as a result of which a woman can feel pain in the lower abdomen and feel some malaise.  After a certain time, the follicle with the gamete again begins to appear in the ovary. </p><p>  <strong>Male reproductive system</strong> </p><p>  The male reproductive system consists of the external <span>(scrotum, testicles</span> and penis) and internal organs <span>(prostate gland</span> and seminal vesicles). </p><p>  The testicles are the gonads of a man, which are two small organs.  They are placed in the scrotum.  Every day, the testes produce a huge number of new germ cells - sperm, consisting of a tail and a head.  In addition, this body is responsible for the production of androgens, thereby performing the functions of the endocrine gland. </p><p>  During intercourse, sperm move through the <span>vas deferens</span> and combine with the secrets secreted by the adnexa.  Thus, the seminal fluid of a man is obtained - sperm. </p><p>  The duct through which the sperm move from the scrotum to the abdominal cavity and exits into the urethra - the urethra.  This is a thin tube that is located inside the penis and leads out of the bladder. </p><p>  Sperm cells carry the most important hereditary material - chromosomes. </p><p>  The human reproductive system is designed to perform the most important function - reproductive. </p>
