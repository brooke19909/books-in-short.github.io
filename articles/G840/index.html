After all, if you came to Latvia to visit or sightsee, then most likely, stop in the capital of this country. </p><p>  But now all the iconic places have already been visited, it remains to get acquainted with the surroundings.  How about one of the most ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù resorts of the Baltic Sea - Jurmala? </p><p>  In principle, this is not too far.  Only 25 kilometers need to be overcome to cover the distance Riga - Jurmala.  How to get there  Different ways.  You can even rent a bike.  But if you are with luggage, burdened with family, or are in other circumstances when it is difficult to travel light, we will offer you other options. </p><p>  It takes a little time - from 20 to 40 minutes.  And on average - about half an hour. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.947079" data-lng="23.61684850000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/2/6/1/8261.png"></div><h2>  What is better not to go to the resort </h2><p>  When you are wondering how to get from Riga to Jurmala on your own, you should remember that you are dealing with the traditional name of several Latvian villages located on the seashore.  All of them are famous for their chic quartz sand beaches.  No wonder the translation of the name of this place means "edge of the water." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is not worth going on?  Probably by car or taxi.  The latter method is quite expensive - it costs about 30 euros (2346 rubles).  But if you choose public transport, you will get in about the same half hour, only pay immeasurably less. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinsdaddy.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.pinsdaddy.com/riga-urma-la_cvxIyUD364DDoaAIs*dRNxW2al*AKQGLkJO7fLMarXc/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riga-Jurmala: how to get there?" class="if uuid-2773645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2773645.jpg"></div><p>  You can rent a car if you want to see the surroundings of Latvia.  But does it make sense to do this only for the sake of Jurmala?  Most travelers agree not.  Yes, and you spend more on gas on the road than on a train ticket. </p><h2>  Buses and minibuses </h2><p>  From the capital of Latvia, various types of public transport depart through Jurmala.  These are mainly buses or minibuses.  As a starting point, it is best to choose Rigas SAO. </p><p>  This is the main bus station of the capital.  If you prefer traveling from the train station, you can depart from the Rigas MTS.  In Jurmala, buses arrive at Lielupe or Dubulti. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lv.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Marcin Szala, "><img itemprop="image" alt="From Riga to Jurmala by minibus" class="if uuid-2773727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2773727.jpg"></div><p>  It costs public transport from 1.5 euros (117 rubles).  How to get from Jurmala to Riga by minibus?  They walk from the railway station of the capital of Latvia, not far from the Origo shopping center. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the summer season, minibuses depart quite often - every quarter of an hour.  In winter, this type of transport is less in demand.  Therefore, minibuses run approximately once an hour. </p><p>  From Jurmala bus station, you can also leave in this way.  You need to pay at the driver when you leave the car. </p><h2>  Riga - Jurmala: how to get there by train </h2><p>  Tourists write that this is the easiest way to get from the capital of Latvia to the Baltic resort, and also the cheapest one.  Tickets can be bought at the box office of the train station. </p><p>  It is large, comfortable and is within walking distance of the Old Town of Riga.  This railway station is interesting because not only various cafes and shops work here, but even a museum is open. </p><p>  If you come from Moscow, St. Petersburg or Minsk and plan to immediately go to Jurmala, then take a little look around and quickly find the platform where the trains come from.  But here when buying tickets, keep in mind one feature.  You must tell the teller the final station where you are leaving. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.concordia.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Riga train station" class="if uuid-2773681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2773681.jpg"></div><p>  The fact is that Jurmala is a rather large resort.  He stretched along the seashore.  Therefore, a station like Jurmala simply does not exist.  This is nothing more than a direction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is not enough just to say that you want a Riga - Jurmala ticket.  How to get to a specific station?  You must understand for yourself which resort area you need. </p><p>  By the way, the names of the stations are announced only in Latvian.  But this is understandable, and besides, they are displayed on the electronic scoreboard.  Tickets cost from 1.4 euros (109 rubles). </p><h2>  Train rules </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not enough to know how to get from Jurmala from Riga.  It is still necessary to follow the rules of travel by rail in Latvia.  For example, as in many European countries, you must not only buy a ticket, but also compost it at the station or on the platform. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.concordia.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Riga-Jurmala: how to get by train" class="if uuid-2773661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2773661.jpg"></div><p>  Conductors in the wagons of Latvian trains are simultaneously controllers.  Some of them will definitely come up to you to put a stamp on the ticket. </p><p>  But if you were not able to buy a travel document - for example, there was a long queue, and you did not want to miss this train, then you can buy a ticket from the controller.  Only it will be more expensive than at the box office. </p><p>  By the way, if something is not clear to you, you can ask the guides.  They are polite, and most know Russian. </p><h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  So how to get from Riga to Jurmala by rail?  You must know the area where you are leaving.  So, the Lielupe station is the first along the train. </p><p>  It is quiet, calm and you can get around the beach almost all of Jurmala.  In order to swim in the sea, the very thing. </p><p>  Then comes the Bulduri.  This inconspicuous station is closest to the sea.  From it you can already see the Dzintari, where the famous concert hall is located and various famous events are held. </p><p>  The central station of Jurmala is called "Maiori", where all the main attractions of the resort are located.  Here, mainly tourists walk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="africanahgirl.com" data-author=": AFRICANAGIRL, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go in Jurmala" class="if uuid-2773693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2773693.jpg"></div><p>  The last station that interests travelers is called Dubulti.  It is also located very close to the sea. </p><p>  Round-trip tickets are best bought at the box office.  Then it will be cheaper.  Valid travel documents until the end of the day for any train in this direction. </p><p>  To Jurmala there are all electric trains with terminal stations ‚ÄúDubulti‚Äù, ‚ÄúSloka‚Äù or ‚ÄúTukums‚Äù.  If in doubt where exactly you should go, feel free to take a ticket to Maiori. </p><p>  To orient yourself on which of the trains it takes, use the board at the Riga railway station.  In addition, there is a large information stand with different routes. </p><h2>  How to get from Riga Airport to Jurmala </h2><p>  Those who fly to the capital of Latvia by plane may have problems getting to the resort.  The fact is that the airport is located somewhere in the middle between Riga and Jurmala. </p><p>  And if there used to be a bus, now the hub and the resort are not directly connected by any public transport.  Can be reached by taxi.  But if you are a budget tourist, it is better to take a bus to the center of the capital, and then change trains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get from Riga Airport to Jurmala" class="if uuid-2773704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2773704.jpg"></div><p>  If you know how to get from Jurmala from Riga, you just need to understand how to get to the center from the airport.  Locals advise bus route 22. They run often, and luggage can be taken for free.  Tickets are bought from the driver. </p><p>  However, if you take the 22nd bus to the center of Riga, and then change trains, for example, by train, it will take you 2 hours to travel to Jurmala.  But you can do trickier.  You do not take the city bus, but take the minibus 241. The airport is the last stop.  Therefore, minibuses are usually empty.  Get out of it at the Imanta railway station (ask the driver in advance).  There you can transfer to Jurmala by train and in 10 minutes you will be there. </p><h2>  On the ship </h2><p>  How to get from Riga to Jurmala by water?  By boat.  Although, in truth, it is believed that this is more of a tourist attraction than public transport.  Instead of 30 minutes, you will spend several hours on the road, and even pay from 20 to 40 euros (1564-3128 rubles).  The boat does not go all year round, but only in the tourist season, from May 1 to September 30. </p><p>  A boat departs from the pier opposite the Riga Castle.  And in Jurmala he arrives in the Majori region.  There is a marina.  Locals call this ship "sea tram."  Although the prices there, of course, are not like public transport. </p><p>  But if you want to combine a trip to Jurmala with entertainment for children, with an exciting excursion or a romantic pastime, then a boat is the best choice. </p><h2>  Bike </h2><p>  We have already said that you can get to the Baltic resort without any transport.  So, if you still decide to go light and practice a healthy lifestyle, here is another way to get from Riga to Jurmala. </p><p>  In the capital of Latvia, an ‚Äúiron horse‚Äù is easy to rent.  It takes about an hour to drive, maybe a little longer.  The road is convenient, comfortable.  A safe bike path runs through the city.  In fine weather, you can move along the beach between different areas of the resort.  No wonder the inhabitants of Riga themselves go to Jurmala in this way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rigabiketours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="From Riga to Jurmala by bike" class="if uuid-2773779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2773779.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  So, now you know how to get from Jurmala to Riga and back.  Now let‚Äôs listen to what the tourists say. </p><p>  Travelers advise: if you decide to take a train to the Baltic resort, you need to sit on the right side in the direction of the train if you are heading to Jurmala, and on the left if back.  Then the view from the window will be more picturesque. </p><p>  If you suddenly drove the desired station, do not worry.  In time, they are only a few minutes apart.  Therefore, it will not be difficult to return on foot.  Take a walk along the coast, breathe in the sea air, see Jurmala.  In addition, free Wi-Fi is available on the promenade between the train stations. </p><p>  Many called the bus not too convenient transportation.  He rides the longest - 40 minutes.  Moreover, not all passengers can fit in it, especially during the high tourist season. </p><p>  But the train is a guarantee!  Cheap, convenient, and all fit.  Of course, some remember that in Soviet times, these trains were jam-packed.  But since Latvia joined the European Union, this has not happened. </p>
