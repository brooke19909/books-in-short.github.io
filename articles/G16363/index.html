Knitting a washcloth with knitting needles or crochet is an opportunity not only to pass the evening for a pleasant pastime, but also to make a convenient, practical, exclusive accessory.  In addition, such an item will be a real gift for those who can not live without a bath or sauna. </p><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  The main thing in knitting a washcloth with knitting needles is the choice of materials.  Each person has their own skin sensitivity and preferences.  Some love hard washcloths, while others choose foam sponges.  This must be taken into account when selecting yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting washcloths" class="if uuid-3009824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/3009824.jpg"></div><p>  For knitting a washcloth with knitting needles, you can use the following types of yarn: </p><ul><li>  Jute is a textile fiber that can be bought at a hardware store.  A tough material that cleans dirt and has a massage effect. </li><li>  Bast is a natural material.  Washcloths from it are good for health, have a beneficial effect on the skin, do not cause allergies.  But they have a short service life. </li><li>  Sisal is a natural fiber often used to make washcloths. </li><li>  Flax is a natural fiber with medium stiffness.  It is well washed, washed and dries.  Hypoallergenic. </li><li>  Cotton is an affordable and inexpensive material.  Used for soft washcloths for delicate and sensitive skin.  You can replace the jersey cut from thin strips, for example, from old t-shirts. </li><li>  Wool is a natural material from which bright washcloths of medium hardness are obtained.  Yarn is convenient to use. </li><li>  Acrylic is a synthetic fiber from which you can make fun baby bath accessories. </li><li>  Kapron and nylon is a synthetic fiber for soft washcloths used for face and sensitive skin or for dishes.  To reduce costs, you can cut nylon tights that have served their time into strips.  They must first be washed. </li><li>  Polypropylene yarn is the most common material for knitted washcloths with knitting needles and crochet.  It is wear-resistant, holds its shape well, has a massage effect.  On sale you can find many color options.  You can buy it in the economic departments.  You need to choose a thread, and not twine twisted into several layers. </li></ul><h2>  Knitting needles.  Shape and size </h2><p>  For washcloths, thin yarn is not used.  Therefore, knitting needles must be chosen accordingly - No. 5-8.  The denser the pattern, the stiffer the whirlwind. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before you start knitting a washcloth with knitting needles, you need to determine the size and shape of the future product.  In this case, there are no strict restrictions.  For children, you can knit a whirlwind in the form of a funny toy.  The shape of the washcloth depends on your preference: you can make a round, rectangular or in the form of a pipe.  You can tie a mitten or mitt.  It all depends on the wishes of the craftswoman or customer. </p><h2>  Garter stitch </h2><p>  The easiest and fastest way - garter stitch.  The entire canvas is typed with facial loops on each side of the work.  The result is textured strips with a gentle massage effect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sizzlestitch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting washcloths" class="if uuid-3009678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/3009678.jpg"></div><h2>  Putanka </h2><p>  For beginners, knitting a washcloth with knitting needles is best to start with a simple "mess" pattern.  On the knitting needles, dial the number of loops corresponding to the width of the product.  The first row: remove the edge loop, knit, alternating the front and back loops, the last is the wrong one.  Turn the work, remove the hem, then knit according to the pattern: knit the wrong one over the front one, the front one over the wrong one. </p><p>  In the following rows repeat this sequence.  Continue to the desired length.  As a result, small ‚Äúknots‚Äù are obtained on the canvas, which have a good massage effect.  At the end, make a loop for hanging. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Chess player </h2><p>  Another pattern that is often used for knitting washcloths is a checkerboard.  The number of loops is a multiple of 5, plus 2 edge.  Knit 5 facial, 5 wrong.  So knit 5 rows.  Starting from the 6th row, change the "squares": 5 wrong, 5 front.  And tie another 5 rows.  Continue to the desired length.  Close the loop, snap the loop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingmatters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting sponges for beginners" class="if uuid-3009682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/3009682.jpg"></div><h2>  Elongated hinges </h2><p>  Knitting washcloths with knitting needles with elongated loops is a popular option.  You can even master it for a beginner.  It is important to note that with this method, the yarn consumption is significantly increased.  For such a pattern, the ‚Äúpipe‚Äù washcloth model is preferable when the fabric is knitted in a circle.  Dial 30 loops on circular knitting needles, close in a circle.  Knit 4-5 rows with facial loops. </p><p>  From the next row, start knitting long loops.  Knit 1 front, then put the thread on the thumb of the left hand, which is before work and, without removing the yarn, knit the front loop.  Repeat until the end of the row the alternation of long and facial loops.  The next row is knitted face to fasten the elongated loops.  So repeat to the desired length.  The last 4-5 rows to knit facial.  Attach the ribbons for hanging, and the washcloth is ready. </p><p>  How to get a shaggy washcloth?  Simply.  Knitting a washcloth with knitting needles is carried out by stretching the loops, as mentioned above. </p><p>  When knitting, you can alternate colors, making bright stripes, or perform a simple pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting a washcloth with knitting shaggy washcloths" class="if uuid-3009799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/3009799.jpg"></div><h2>  Washcloth pocket </h2><p>  For a comfortable shower, you can make a pocket-washcloth, inside which a piece of soap is placed.  It is convenient to take on the road or in the bath.  The bar will not slip out of the hands. </p><p>  Knitting a washcloth with knitting needles for beginners is described step by step below. </p><ul><li>  Choose your favorite yarn. </li><li>  To tie a rectangle 10 √ó 20 cm with a gingham pattern. </li><li>  Close the loop. </li><li>  Fold the rectangle so that you get a pocket with a flap, like a pillowcase.  The valve should close 1/3. </li><li>  Stitch the edges using a needle or hook. </li><li>  In the upper corner, make a chain of air loops and close it into a loop. </li><li>  Trim the threads. </li><li>  Insert a bar of soap inside. </li></ul><p>  You can fold the rectangle in half and sew the sides, making a pocket.  Insert soap and sew up the top edge.  This method is simpler, but when the bar ends, you will need to open the seam, put in a new soap and sew up again. </p><p>  In order for the washcloth to foam well, you can put a piece of foam in it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting sponges with elongated loops" class="if uuid-3009714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/3009714.jpg"></div><h2>  Round washcloth </h2><p>  Another simple option is a round washcloth, which looks original.  If you knit with colored stripes, you get a flower-like accessory.  In this case, it is better to choose a simple pattern, for example, garter stitch. </p><p>  Collect 20 loops and perform a series of facial loops.  In each second row, knit the first two loops together, and before knitting the last, make a crochet.  So the number of loops will be the same in each row, but the canvas will turn out a little beveled.  The length of the product should be 2-3 times longer than the width to get a voluminous accessory.  Close the loop.  Fold the resulting rectangle in half, combine the first and last rows and sew them.  It turns out the pipe.  Pass the thread through the edge of the upper row and tighten the ends, tie a knot.  Repeat the same with the bottom edge.  Combine the centers and fix.  It turns out a round, voluminous, flattened ball at both ends. </p><p>  Crochet a chain 15 cm long and hook it in the middle.  A bright whirlwind, like a flower, is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting washcloths" class="if uuid-3009888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/3009888.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting a washcloth with knitting needles is a fascinating activity that is easy to learn.
