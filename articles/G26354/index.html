The main attractions of Moscow in one day: route and excursions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The capital of the Russian Federation, Moscow, is one of the largest and most beautiful cities in the world.  Thousands of tourists come to the Mother See annually to get acquainted with the national culture, architecture and art monuments.  It takes more than one week to get to know the city better, but not all travelers have such a time limit.  What to see in Moscow in 1 day, which sightseeing route is the most interesting? </p><h2>  We travel around the city on the river </h2><p>  Almost in its full splendor, Moscow will appear before its guests in one day, if you dedicate it to a trip on a ship.  The main waterway with the same name crosses the city and divides it into two parts.  There are several interesting routes that can demonstrate the capital from different angles.  The most noteworthy is a water tour of the central part of Moscow.  Tourists will be able to see such iconic cultural monuments as the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, the Moscow Kremlin, St. Basil's Cathedral.  Picturesque views of the embankment, the calm flow of the <span>Moscow River, the colors of the</span> summer city - all this creates a feeling of incredible romance. </p><p>  Classic excursion routes often start from the Sparrow Hills, and end in the Taganka area, near the Novospassky Monastery.  True, such excursions have a number of ‚Äúbuts‚Äù: motor ships operate only in the warm season, sightseeing is only a sightseeing trip, etc. However, for many, this solution is quite convenient - you do not need to go anywhere, you can enjoy beautiful views, guided tours, and sometimes delicious food. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Classic city center tour </h2><p>  If you have limited time, and you are wondering what to see in Moscow in 1 day, then choose the classic option for yourself - an examination of the Kremlin.  The first residential settlement in these places was organized more than 4000 years ago.  The walls of the fortification arose in 1156, this fact has been authentically confirmed in numerous chronicles.  The first major restoration of the Kremlin walls was carried out under Ivan Kalit.  It was then that they became oak, under Dmitry Donskoy the walls became stone, and under Ivan the Third - brick.  The modern Kremlin is the hallmark of the city, its territory includes not only the external wall with towers, but also all the buildings located inside. </p>

    <h2>  Objects in the Kremlin </h2><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ancient fortification today is 27 hectares.  The following open-air buildings are included in the national open-air museum complex, which is exactly what the Kremlin can be called: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  20 towers (the most famous is the Spasskaya Tower and its chimes); </li><li>  6 palaces; </li><li>  6 squares (including Red Square); </li><li>  Mausoleum; </li><li>  7 cathedrals; </li><li>  museum complexes; </li><li>  the shops; </li><li>  monuments. </li></ul><p>  A detailed inspection of one day may not be enough, but a quick tour will help you appreciate all the local beauty.  The history of the Moscow Kremlin is associated with many interesting facts and even secrets.  Rumor has it that earlier in these places there was a real cemetery, and ghosts often return to wander along the walls.  In general, there is a lot of interesting here. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden - Green lungs of the city </h2><p>  If you want to get acquainted with a more modern city and spend time in nature, then Moscow will open in front of you at VDNH in 1 day.  Here you can not only see the <span>exhibition of the achievements of the national economy,</span> but also, having a little walk along the cobbled alleys, get into a surprisingly quiet place.  The Moscow Botanical Garden was founded in 1945 on the territory of the <span>Ostankino Park,</span> today it is one of the largest in all of Europe.  The park‚Äôs living fund includes more than 2 thousand species of flora representatives from various parts of the globe.  These places are truly protected, trees, flowers and shrubs grow here in the same way as in the wild, in their natural habitat.  Some representatives of the flora are marked with special plates that contain basic information about them.  Exploring the surrounding nature is available both on foot and by bicycle.  The latter method is preferable if you want to enjoy the exposure of the All-Russian Exhibition Center. </p>

    <h2>  Heritage of the USSR - VDNH </h2><p>  Walking around the Botanical Garden, you can head to the Soviet exposition.  So, the <span>All-Russian Exhibition Center, VDNH</span> and a lesser-known variant of the All-Union Exhibition of Artists is a large park and exhibition complex in the northeast of the capital, created in the Soviet years.  One-day excursions around Moscow have been successfully conducted on its territory for more than a dozen years.  It was first opened in 1939, its main entrance, a monumental arch in the classical style for those times, became the hallmark of VDNH.  The main objects of the complex, which are recommended to be visited, include the Central Pavilion, the Friendship of the Peoples fountain (each of its statues symbolizes one of the Soviet republics).  Each pavilion (many are called former republics, now independent states) is a real architectural monument, unfortunately, today there are only shopping arcades inside which do not represent any cultural interest.  At the end of the main pedestrian zone, a rocket and an airplane are installed.  An intensive reconstruction of the park is currently underway. </p>

    <h2>  Poklonnaya Gora </h2><p>  What to see in Moscow in 1 day, are there any other options?  An excellent route of military glory can be laid between Poklonnaya Gora, the Arc de Triomphe and the Borodino Panorama Museum.  It is recommended to start the tour from Poklonnaya Gora, on which Victory Park is located, next to the memorial complex is the metro station of the same name.  A huge memorial dedicated to the Great Patriotic War is dedicated.  The complex was built at the end of the 20th century, in 1983-1985.  It consists of the Central Museum, the pedestrian zone, Victors Square and the main monument depicting the Greek <span>goddess Nika.</span>  According to ancient mythology, she was the patroness of victors in wars. </p>

    <h2>  Third Life of Arc de Triomphe </h2><p>  If you move towards Kutuzovsky Prospekt, the Arc de Triomphe will appear before your eyes.  In 1814, in honor of the victory of the Russian people in the war of 1812, the first commemorative arch made of wood was installed.  This was done in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <span>Tverskaya Zastava.</span>  Unfortunately, it did not last long, only 12 years.  According to the project of the great Beauvais, its second version was completed, this time from a stronger stone. </p><p>  The second life of the Arc de Triomphe lasted 102 years, in Soviet times it was dismantled for construction work in its immediate vicinity.  For the third time, it was decided to erect the arch in a completely new place.  In 1968, a new life began for the great military monument.  During its construction, initial designs and partially old materials were used.  In its appearance, the arch is fully consistent with its second option. </p>

    <h2>  Museum of the Borodino Panorama </h2><p>  The study of monuments of military history is very exciting, especially in such a historic city as Moscow.  In one day, the route brings together the most important and interesting objects.  About 300 meters from the arch, the Borodino Museum Complex begins.  Located in the back of a small park, it is as if a natural extension of the Arc de Triomphe.  The construction of the museum was dedicated to the 150th anniversary of the victory in the war with the French.  Of course, the panorama of the battle itself, written by the artist Franz Roubault, belongs to the main exhibits, it was thanks to her that the museum got its name.  Coming from enemy France, the artist Roubaud considered himself Russian in spirit and sought to support our country in every possible way during the difficult war years, in his paintings he glorified Russian soldiers and Russian weapons.  The length of the painting reaches 115 meters; the canvas is 15 meters high.  In addition to the panorama, the museum has a rather rich exposition dedicated to the war and its main historical figures, including the talented commander Kutuzov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow in one day itinerary" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12440/471956.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  So different Moscow </h2><p>  Now you know what to see in Moscow in 1 day.  Do not think that city sights end on these popular routes.  There are many parks in the capital of Russia, you can combine a walk in nature with an examination of palaces and chambers, for this it is enough to come to Tsaritsyno, Kolomenskoye, Arkhangelskoye and other numerous estates.  <span>"What to visit in Moscow</span> in 1 day?"  - a rhetorical question, and there are reasons for this. </p><p>  Too many-sided is this city.  All the sights of Moscow in 1 day is impossible to see.  It features quiet parks, centuries-old churches and monasteries, strong <span>Kremlin walls,</span> and next to them are urban landscapes of huge new buildings, business centers, outlandish bridges. </p><p>  This city can not help but love, it is different and for each his own.  This is probably why Moscow has become the capital of Russia, because what is united here at first glance could not be unified. </p>
