    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As for the work of the restaurants of the Max Royal Hotel (Kemer), here the opinions of tourists are somewhat different.  So, the fact is that food in this hotel complex is organized in a special way: a buffet is present only at breakfast time, for lunch and dinner, visitors make an order from the menu.  In general, for most hotel guests this was not a problem.  Some discontent was expressed only by tourists with young children.  According to them, sometimes it is not very convenient to wait for an order with a naughty child in her arms for 15-25 minutes.  In this regard, it would be more convenient for them to quickly take the dishes they liked from the buffet, thereby reducing the time for lunch or dinner.  Therefore, family tourists hope that the hotel management will heed their comments and organize a buffet throughout the day in at least one of the restaurants. </p><p>  Otherwise, travelers were very pleased with the quality of food here.  According to them, there is always something to choose from, starting with dishes of meat, fish, poultry and ending with a variety of snacks, salads, caviar.  In addition, guests always have the opportunity to enjoy delicious pastries, sweets, handmade chocolate, ice cream and fresh fruits.  The restaurants have a separate children's table with cereals, soups and other dishes for the youngest guests.  The hotel guests have the opportunity to enjoy dishes of different cuisines - Turkish, Japanese, Italian, international, etc. According to them, it is very convenient that all restaurants are located in one place, forming a kind of small street.  In addition, there is a restaurant offering fast food by the pools.  Many enjoyed eating french fries, pizza, hamburgers, etc. here.  In general, as guests note, at any point in the hotel there is an opportunity to suspect a waiter and ask him to bring some kind of dish, snack or drink directly to where you are currently located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maxx royal kemer reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1030250.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, this point also left a rather overwhelming number of tourists staying at the Maxx Royal Kemer Resort &amp; Spa 5 * (Turkey).  So, according to them, on the territory of the hotel complex there are several beaches located in cozy bays.  Some of them are sandy, and some pebble.  In the first case, tourists really liked the white clean sand.  Families with children enjoyed their holidays here.  As for entering the water, the bottom on all beaches is pebble.  However, there are no sharp stones here, so you can do without special shoes without any problems.  By the way, thanks to pebbles, the water in the sea is very clean and transparent. </p><p>  According to the guests, the beach is equipped with comfortable sun loungers with umbrellas.  A large tent can be rented for an extra fee.  The beach itself is located very close to residential buildings.  So, to the coast you have to go no more than 200 meters through the territory of the hotel complex. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  In addition to the beach, you can have a great time in the hotel complex.  So, there are several pools of different depths.  One of them has water slides.  There is also a salt water pool.  Sun terraces are nearby.  According to our compatriots, sun loungers are always abundant both at the pools and on the beach.  So there is no need to occupy a deck chair early in the morning at this hotel. </p><p>  An animation is held at the central pool throughout the day.  Here she, according to most tourists, is very unobtrusive.  So, since ‚ÄúMax Royal‚Äù (Kemer) is designed more for a calm and relaxed vacation, loud music and the constant cries of animators will not confuse the guests here.  But hotel guests always have the opportunity to do yoga, water aerobics, gymnastics, play tennis, volleyball, basketball, and visit the gym. </p>
