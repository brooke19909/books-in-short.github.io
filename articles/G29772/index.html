    <h2>  About the lake </h2><p>  This pond is unique because it is called the Siberian Dead Sea, a place of power, a source of vital energy.  The concentration of salt in water is so great that a person is able to stay on the surface even in a state of complete rest. </p><p>  By the way, locals call the lake not Gorky, but Novoklyuchevsky. </p><p>  The main treasures of the reservoir are salt and healing mud.  The bottom of the lake is sandy, covered with sulphide mud of saturated black color with the smell of hydrogen sulfide.  Its northern coast is gentle, and the southern one is steep.  Water is clear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What can be cured here? </h2><p>  Healing mud, water and air contribute to the cure of diseases of the musculoskeletal system, nervous system, respiratory system, skin, as well as urological and gynecological problems.  And rest on the lake takes off usual stress and fatigue instantly. </p><p>  A lot of reviews come from women who have not been able to get pregnant for a long time, and after recovery on Gorky Lake in the Novosibirsk Region, the long-awaited replenishment in the family appeared. </p><p>  Just amazing!  It turns out that in order to improve your health, to rejuvenate and be saturated with energy, you do not even need to issue an international passport! </p><h2>  Gorky Lake in the Novosibirsk Region: how to get there? </h2><p>  The reservoir is located 500 km from the Siberian capital near the village of Novoklyuchi, which is 47 km from Kupino. </p><p>  You can get from Novosibirsk by train, bus, car. </p><p>  The Novosibirsk-Kulunda train leaves daily from the Novosibirsk-Glavny railway <span>station.</span>  He leaves in the evening, and arrives at Kupino in the morning.  It will take about 10 hours to get there. </p><p>  To use the bus, you need to get to the Novosibirsk bus station and buy a ticket to Kupino.  The road will take 9 hours. </p><p>  Next you need to get to the village of Novoklyuchi.  Near the train station in Kupino there is a bus station.  Transport to Novoklyuchi runs only twice a day, except Sunday.  There is only one bus on this day.  You can also call a taxi.  The distance from the village to the lake is 500 meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After all of the above, it becomes obvious that it will be more comfortable to get by car.  You can see the map in the photo below.  First you need to get to Karasuk, then, without reaching Kupino, turn to Novoklyuchi.  There will be 30 km of dirt road in front of the village.  Before entering Novoklyuchi, you need to make a right turn to drive to the lake. </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  Choose from three options for vacationers: </p><ul><li>  accommodation at the base; </li><li>  rental housing with the local population; </li><li>  tent. </li></ul><p>  Catering will have to be done independently.  Tourists can also visit the cafe at the base. </p><h2>  Recreation center </h2><p>  The recreation center "Lake Gorkoye" (Novosibirsk region) is located directly on the shore of the reservoir.  These are 60 wooden houses, which are arranged in two lines.  Each is designed to accommodate four people. </p>

    <p>  The house has beds, a table with chairs, a bedside table, electricity is supplied, there are sockets.  Guests are offered fresh water from the wells, two baths, showers, wash basins.  The territory of the health complex is fenced and is under protection.  It also allocated places for camping.  There are conditions for fishing and other active sports. </p><p>  Burning bonfires in the base is prohibited.  There is a separate area for cooking.  Kettle and gas burner (stove) should be taken with you.  If you forget, it can be rented for a fee, only the brazier is included in the price.  There are several shops in the village where you can buy everything you need. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt want to cook, you can eat in a cafe. </p><p>  The cost of living can hardly be called democratic - from 1700 to 2200 rubles per day, depending on the date of arrival. </p><h2>  Reviews of Gorky Lake in the Novosibirsk Region </h2><p>  Feedback from visitors to this place is predictably contradictory.  People are delighted with the lake itself: water, air, its healing effects, but are endlessly disappointed with the level of service, given its high cost. </p><p>  Tourists warn that the rest will be wellness, not entertaining.  There are a minimum number of entertainment events: swimming, sunbathing, sleeping, walking in the village, smearing with mud and taking pictures.  If you are traveling with a child, then pay attention to the fact that water, due to the concentration of salt, very pinch your eyes.  There are no shady areas on the shore, as the lake is located in the steppe. </p><p>  But the water there is really healing and heals perfectly!  Arthrosis and arthritis pass, the skin improves, the work of the nervous system normalizes.  It is a pity that the service is limping on both legs, its lake cannot be healed.  Minimum services are provided, the condition of the houses is average, as people who have been here write. </p><p>  Experienced vacationers are strongly advised not to overpay for accommodation at the base, but to rent housing with locals who want comfort.  If you are an unpretentious tourist, then a tent will be an excellent and cheap option. </p>
