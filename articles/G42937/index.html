    <p>  It is here, on the first coastline, at the very foot of the Oman Mountains, that a luxury hotel in a traditional Arabic style is located - Miramar Al Aqah Beach Resort (Fujairah) 5 *.  Everything here seems to be saturated with oriental flavor - arches and patterned arches, colorful mosaics of the finest work, skillfully made lanterns, sun-drenched rooms and balconies, and, surprisingly, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãgreenery near a lifeless desert.  It advantageously combines modern comfort with a traditional Arabian atmosphere of well-being and wealth. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  An exclusive and presentable complex is located just 45 km from the capital of the emirate - the city of Fujairah and 150 km from <span>Dubai</span> International <span>Airport, a</span> trip to which takes about an hour and a half.  From a geographic point of view, the position of the hotel is also very attractive.  On the one hand, it is surrounded by the beautiful Hayar Mountains, and on the other, a secluded sandy beach and a clean warm sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the main advantages of relaxing in the UAE is the hot and dry weather.  Fujairah favors tourists at any time of the year.  In the winter months, it is relatively cool - on average + 25 ¬∞ C during the day and + 19 ¬∞ C at night.  Starting in April, the air temperature rises to + 30-37 ¬∞  and + 25-30 ¬∞  (day and night) and remains at this level until November. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2>
