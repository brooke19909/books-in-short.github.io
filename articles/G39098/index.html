How to do it better?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, collecting has become a profitable business, which allows not only collecting stamps, but also deriving financial benefits from it.  The fashion for philately has passed, but this does not mean that there are fewer collectors.  Many have rare specimens that philatelists want to realize.  The question is where to sell brands with the greatest benefit? </p><h2>  Stamp collecting rules </h2><p>  Collecting stamps is a fascinating activity that can interest not only children, but also adults.  Philately has always been considered a common hobby, especially popular in the Soviet period.  This was also justified by the fact that, unlike any other type of collecting, collecting stamps is an affordable and very profitable occupation. </p><h2>  How to start collecting </h2><div class="photo" data-original="marka-pochtoi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to sell brands" class="if uuid-3096874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47497/3096874.jpg"></div><p>  It is not difficult to become a philatelist, it is much more problematic to understand where to sell stamps, which are usually going to a lot.  The acquisition of the first copies is an important step.  You can buy them or exchange them with fellow philatelists.  It is desirable that the collection has more than one kind of stamps - variability will add value to the set. </p><p>  Often brands are bought in whole lots, because this option is financially more profitable.  Buying or selling them individually is usually more expensive.  An experienced philatelist must have tongs that are very similar to tweezers, but they are completely different devices.  Nippers for stamps are necessary in order to take and examine specimens.  The philatelist's tweezers do not damage the paper, they can easily take any brand, even from a flat surface. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mandatory sorting of marks by any criterion.  This may be the year of creation or the country in which the collector's item was made.  You can sort the stamps by topic, depending on what is shown on them.  There were times when philatelists collected stamps in groups by size, color, and sometimes even by shape. </p><p>  It is worth taking care of the orderliness of the collection.  Incorrect storage often leads to the loss of the initial appearance of the brands, which means that it will be more difficult to realize them, and the price of the item will become much lower.  Accordingly, the question will inevitably arise where to sell stamps, the appearance of which is not very good, is most profitable. </p><p>  At first, stamps can be neatly folded into envelopes, but later it is wiser to purchase special albums.  Experienced philatelists also acquire a magnifying glass to examine the stamps carefully, admiring what is depicted on them. </p><h2>  How to determine brand value </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to sell stamps" class="if uuid-3096879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47497/3096879.jpg"></div><p>  Before you sell collection items, you need to not only know where you can sell stamps, but also determine what their value is, so that the transaction is profitable.  First of all, you should pay attention to the year of issue of the brand.  But this is not an easy task, because on some copies such information is not indicated.  Then it‚Äôs worth determining the year of issue of the brand from the image, paying attention to what date or event it is dedicated to. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is known that stamps that were made several decades ago were made of rough and thick paper.  To determine the country or at least the city in which this instance was released, it is worth considering carefully the signatures covering the image.  If the brand is of high quality, then the image on it is placed symmetrically, but this fact can be determined only using a magnifying glass. </p><p>  Values ‚Äã‚Äãare considered stamps on which stickers have been preserved, and if the paper has the taste of peppermint, then the copy can be safely attributed to expensive ones.  The value of a collection unit can also be estimated by perforation, which makes it easy to separate each brand.  It is believed that the brand, which has a rounded and medium-sized perforation, belongs to the old ones, therefore it is more valuable.  Sometimes a percussion meter is used to measure perforation. </p><p>  If marking is applied on the brand, then the cost of the copy will be reduced.  But without a stamp, it is considered very valuable.  Stamps are expensive if they are collected by topic and sold as a collection, the price of individual copies will be lower than the cost of a full collection.  Preferred for sale are unique brands that were released more than 60 years ago. </p><p>  Those copies that were once defective are also valued: the date is incorrectly written on them or the image is poorly applied.  After all, such branded copies are very few, which ensures their uniqueness.  But for punctured, torn and dirty stamps, a decent price cannot be obtained - they either have to be stored or discarded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sales Nuances </h2><p>  Some philatelists are faced with the problem of where to sell <span>stamps of the USSR.</span>  But there are no particular difficulties.  First of all, you need to find a buyer.  He will carefully examine the stamps, but offer a small price - these are the unwritten rules.  If copies of Polish or Hungarian origin, issued in the sixties and eighties, you can safely sell them for a small amount.  But if the collection has a large number of postage signs, then you should not rush. </p><h2>  Implementation of the collection in parts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="forum.ngs23.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to sell stamps in Moscow" class="if uuid-3096880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47497/3096880.jpg"></div><p>  It is believed that the most difficult question is not where to sell the USSR stamps, but how to do it right.  There are several ways to deal.  One of the methods is to sell the collection in parts, but this should be resorted to in extreme cases. </p><p>  First of all, it is necessary to really appreciate the value of a unique collection.  Today, all brands in terms of value and importance are divided into several categories: unique, sought after, medium sought after and waste paper.  Unique branded items are highly valued, their price reaches 50 dollars (3 359 rubles) apiece.  Therefore, it is better to sell them separately.  It all depends on the appearance of the brand and its degree of preservation. </p><p>  Demanded brands are usually priced from 10 to 50 dollars (671-3 359 rubles).  They are also desirable to be implemented separately.  Where to sell stamps in Moscow?  There are no problems with such instances: the better the brand is preserved, the more buyers it will interest and the more profitable its price.  The methods and places of sales in the Russian capital are the same as in other regions - philatelist clubs, ad sales, online auctions, etc. </p><p>  The average sought-after vintage copies cost no more than $ 10 (671 rubles), but they are sold at such a price quite rarely.  They can be implemented separately and in whole collections.  Particular attention is paid to how the brand was externally preserved, and the completeness of the collection is also taken into account. </p><p>  It is more convenient to sell waste paper in whole series.  Separately, no one will pay for it, so you need to get rid of such brands as part of the collection. </p><h2>  Acquaintance with catalogs of philatelists </h2><div class="photo" data-original="best.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where can I sell stamps" class="if uuid-3096893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47497/3096893.jpg"></div><p>  Another way, how and where to sell stamps, is to use special catalogs of philatelists.  Expert information is published in many special editions of Switzerland, France, Germany and other countries.  Most often, Russian philatelists draw the knowledge necessary for the sale of stamps in special German and American magazines.  They not only publish the branded assortment, but also indicate the approximate cost per unit. </p><p>  It should be remembered that the maximum price per brand is usually indicated.  And it fluctuates, as already mentioned, from 10 to 50 dollars (up to 3,559 rubles) for one copy.  To control the state of his own collection, the philatelist needs to create a special notebook where to make an inventory, indicating the number of each brand and its approximate price. </p><h2>  Communication with the buyer </h2><p>  When the philatelist thinks over where to sell stamps from his collection, you need to remember that you must try to find a common language with the buyer.  If the philatelist has a long history in collecting, then such a person is difficult to impress.  To do this, you must first of all perfectly know your collection and navigate in terminology. </p><p>  If you agree with such a buyer, you can conclude a profitable and profitable transaction.  Subsequently, this person can introduce you to other philatelists. </p><h2>  Selling at Online Auctions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ukrmarki.io.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to sell stamps of the USSR" class="if uuid-3096950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47497/3096950.jpg"></div><p>  Many philatelists do not know, having in their collection Soviet stamps, where to sell them profitably and quickly.  Therefore, it is better to sell your brands at auctions.  Foreign bidding is considered the most profitable, but this requires knowledge of foreign languages. </p><p>  At modern online auctions, you must first go through the registration procedure, and then carefully study the instructions indicated on the site.  But still there are general tips when trading brands at such auctions.  First of all, putting up brands for sale, you need to set the longest time.  This will attract more buyers.  The description for each brand is extended and it is desirable that it captivates the buyer. </p><p>  To put up a brand for sale, you need to scan a copy, but the quality of the photo should be at the highest level.  If the brand is unique, then you can scan it on both sides. </p><h2>  How to sell brands faster </h2><div class="photo" data-original="auction.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where can I sell stamps of the USSR" class="if uuid-3096978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47497/3096978.jpg"></div><p>  In order not to know from friends where to sell brands in Moscow or another city, you must carefully read the article - this will help to profitably realize your collection.  One of the rules that allows you to quickly sell stamps in whatever location you are located is setting the real price of a collection item.  It is difficult to get rich on the sale of brands, so you do not need to put the same price as in the catalog - it should be much less. </p><h2>  We summarize what was said </h2><div class="photo" data-original="philatelist.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to sell stamps in Moscow" class="if uuid-3096987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47497/3096987.jpg"></div><p>  In almost every city, a philatelist club is organized.  Having found it, it is worth consulting with several experts about the value of brands.  For example, copies of the Soviet period cost no more than 50 kopecks. </p><p>  You can advertise the sale of stamps in a local newspaper, as mature people rarely use the Internet.  Some may be interested in advertising about the sale of your collection on a special bulletin board.  You can use groups in social networks, of which there are currently a large number.  They will help to publicize your offer or provide an opportunity to meet other collectors. </p>
