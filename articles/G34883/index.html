A few decades ago, there was nothing remarkable in its place, and today in the middle of the desert, in the literal sense of the word, the magnificent beauty of the city - the emirates, rise.  Tourists come here to see the wonders of technology and modern architecture.  In this country, where citizens themselves wear traditional Arabic clothing, a tourist can feel free.  There is a lot of entertainment for children, and for youth, and for adults.  There are such emirates in which life is very expensive, and there are cities where you can meet quite affordable prices.  In some of the Arab Emirates, morals are more than strict, and in others - although there is no debauchery, it is quite possible to feel free and relaxed.  In a word, a vacation in the UAE will give you a lot of positive emotions and as many vivid impressions that you will remember for many long and many years to come. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bin majid beach hotel" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/725377.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of rest in the UAE </h2><p>  Surely everyone knows what an oasis is.  It is a green and blooming paradise in the middle of the endless sands of the sultry desert.  Naturally, this place was chosen for the construction of cities.  In addition, most emirates are washed by the waters of either the Persian Gulf, or the Red Sea, or the Atlantic Ocean.  Naturally, tourists come here not only to look at the beauty and originality of these young giant cities, but also to relax in the gentle sun, swim in warm water, when there, far away in their homeland, a blizzard rages in full, and lowers the thermometer column almost to the limit.  In a word, many of our tourists choose holidays in the UAE for winter holidays.  Tours during this period, of course, are relatively inexpensive.  Of course, we are not talking about the period between Catholic and Orthodox Christmas.  At this time, there is nowhere for the apple to fall, and prices are inflated to incredible heights.  But the rest of the time you can visit this amazing country without ruin for your own <span>bank account.</span>  And if you choose a hotel not of a luxury class, but an economy, for example, the Bin Majid Beach Hotel, then you can save a lot of money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays in the UAE [" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/725378.jpg" width="600"></div>

If they are not there, then there will certainly be charter.  From both Russian capitals, Moscow and St. Petersburg, to Dubai - the country's business center - daily regular flights of Emirates Airlines fly.  But the more affordable Emirate airline ‚ÄúFly Dubai‚Äù provides air transportation of passengers from such Russian cities as Yekaterinburg, Ufa, Samara, Volgograd, Kazan, <span>Mineralnye Vody, Rostov-on-Don,</span> Krasnodar and others.  In addition to Arab air carriers, flights to the UAE are carried out by Russian airline companies: Aeroflot, S7 and Ural Airlines.  But the Etihad Airways Arab Airlines operates regular flights to the UAE capital - Abu Dhabi.  Flight time from Moscow is 5 hours.  Residents of Siberia and other northern regions come here for shopping, as well as for a comfortable <span>beach holiday</span> at any time of the year.  Depending on the season, Russian tourists choose hotels of various categories.  If in the high season and on holidays it is convenient to reserve <span>4-star hotels,</span> then in the low you can quite afford to relax in premium complexes.  However, for some tourists, it is not the hyper-high level of service and chic interiors that are important, but the possibility of shopping and the proximity of the beach.  It is in these cases, tourists choose the Bin Majid Beach Hotel (UAE). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach hotel by bin majid" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/725382.jpg" width="475"></div>

Each of them is a tourist center.  Some more than others, some - a little less.  The aforementioned <span>Beach Hotel</span> By Bin Majid, which we will discuss in more detail in this article, is located in Ras Al Khaimah.  It is the northernmost of the emirates, located about one hour from magnificent Dubai.  It is very picturesque here: in a bizarre form of mountains in places they almost approach the azure sea with snow-white beaches.  The capital of this emirate, which is part of the UAE, is Ras al-Khaimah (the city of the same name).  It is divided by a bay into two parts, which are connected to each other by a bridge.  The eastern part, where the international airport is located, is called Al-Hamranya.  The western part - the so-called Old Ras al-Khaimah - is rich in <span>historical monuments.</span>  In this emirate, the dry law is completely absent, therefore it should attract our tourists more than the rest - lovers of relaxation with a glass of drinks of various strengths.  However, it, unlike other resorts, is less appreciated by tour operators.  Nevertheless, there is everything conducive to a wonderful holiday.  Wonderful nature, mild climate, magnificent beaches.  Some perceive it as a gate to enter Oman.  However, there is a category of tourists who come here specifically to relax.  On the coast of the Persian Gulf there are pretty decent hotels.  Ras al-Khaimah is also famous for the relatively low prices for all services and accommodation.  The only minus, perhaps, is that there is no bus service from this emirate to others, however, taxi services can be used.  The way to Dubai, for example, will cost 25 dirhams, and inside the city - very inexpensively, about 10. To the delight of holidaymakers, at the Beach Hotel By Bin Majid, directly opposite the entrance, there is a taxi rank.  Another advantage of Ras al-Khaimah is the abundance of shopping centers in which you can find all kinds of goods at fairly low prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel bin majid beach hotel" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/725381.jpg" width="600"></div>

You can only buy a two-way ticket for a plane that will take you to one of the emirates cities, where there is an international airport that accepts flights from Russian cities, as well as book a hotel.  In principle, this can also be arranged on the spot, but it‚Äôs better not to risk it so you don‚Äôt spend the night under the starry sky of Arabia.  Those who are going on vacation in the UAE - one of the most expensive countries in the world, but at the same time do not have much money, it is best to opt for four-star hotels.  They will provide vacationers with good quality service and at the same time will save on money.  In addition, tourists who have every penny counts can go not to Dubai or Abu Dhabi, but to Ras al-Khaimah and stay at the excellent Bin Majid Beach Hotel.  It is located near the coast and is perfect for all lovers of beach holidays.  However, it is better not to come here with children, because this hotel will seem to them a little boring. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in the UAE" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/725380.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  General Description of Bin Majid Beach Hotel and Location </h2><p>  The hotel is located in close proximity to the center of the emirate of Ras al-Khaimah, that is, in the southeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, washed by the waters of the Persian Gulf.  In order to get to this hotel, tourists have to fly to <span>Dubai airport,</span> and then from there go by taxi to the hotel.  As you remember, there is simply no other transport connection with this emirate.  There are two more options: car rental in advance or transfer included in the price of the ticket. </p><p>  This hotel was built in 1987.  That is why many of the tourists staying in it, later write in reviews of decay and shabby.  However, this, of course, is said too loudly, just a lot has not changed here for several decades.  And the hotel was renovated in 2005.  ‚ÄúBin Majit Beach‚Äù is part of the Bin Majid network.  The hotel building is a five-story building, which is surrounded on all sides by a lush garden.

Bin Majid Beach Hotel is a good complex.  Here you can relax.  Just do not come here with the children, because they will be bored here.  Of course, there is a playground here, but there is no entertainment program.  This is exactly how some tourists who come to rest and shopping in Ras al-Khaimah respond.  Someone complains that all local dishes are cooked with a large amount of seasoning.  There are also reviews that the furniture in the rooms is not very fresh.  Well, the rest of the hotel is quite acceptable for receiving guests, especially lovers of lazy beach holidays. </p>
