    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Mosrentgen is a village with a long history.  Although a settlement with this name was formed during the period of industrialization as a residential zone of the plant of the same name, people have been living here for a long time.  It is known that back in 1627 the village of Govorovo, which belonged to a certain Philip Bashmakov, was located here.  Over the next 60 years, the settlement changed owners many times, which, however, contributed little to the development of the area. </p><p>  In 1696, the next owner of Govorov, clerk Avtonom Ivanov, built the beautiful Trinity Church, which is still the cultural treasury of Mosrentgen.  Autonomus was a prominent figure of his era: he exposed the conspiracy against Peter I, created the Azov Regiment, which distinguished itself in battles.  Thanks to his efforts, the once unattractive Govorovo wasteland began to be actively populated, thanks to the stone church, Govorovo was renamed Trinity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From the middle of the 18th century the landowner Saltychikha (Saltykova) owned the lands.  She became infamous throughout Russia because of her sadistic inclinations.  In the period from 1755 to 1762, the mistress brutally tortured about 130 peasants, for which she was sentenced by Empress Catherine II to life imprisonment in a monastery. </p>

    <h2>  Communication with Tyutchev </h2><p>  An important historical heritage is not only Old Moscow.  The village of Mosrentgen as the heir to the village of Troitskoye can also be proud of outstanding personalities who lived on this earth at different times.  By coincidence, one of the guardians of the children of Saltychikha was Ivan Tyutchev.  Subsequently, the estate was bought by the grandfather of the great poet - Nikolai Andreevich.  There is little information about that period, however, historians are sure that it was he who equipped the beautiful park with a cascade of ponds in Troitsky, traces of its former splendor have survived to this day. </p><p>  The youngest daughter of Nikolai Andreyevich, Nadezhda, was friendly with Gogol.  And Ivan, the eldest son, raised the great poet Fyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev.  It was in the Troitskoye estate, according to the poet, that his creative formation took place, his love for literature was revealed.  Nine years (until his departure in 1821 to the diplomatic service) every spring and summer Fedor Ivanovich spent on the estate.  By the way, later the lands passed to the niece of Griboedov - in the girlhood of Anastasia Rimsky-Korsakova.  She was often visited by composer <span>Alexander Alyabyev.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Russia, <span>Moscow:</span> Mosrentgen <span>village</span> in the Soviet period </h2><p>  In the Soviet period, workshops for the production of X-ray equipment were placed in the settlement, which at that time was named Teply Stan.  The Great Patriotic Enterprise was evacuated, and after its completion they brought the latest production line from Germany.  Given the importance of the enterprise, a German specialist was invited to establish an updated production.  Since 1944, Teply Stan was renamed the village of Mosrentgen. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The village of the Mosrentgen plant is actually a single-industry town.  Its landscape is a dense urbanized area with a developed street-road network, gardening partnerships, industrial zones, the Khovansky cemetery, the "open" military town "Vidnoe-4" and forests. </p><p>  Significant objects of the settlement include a wholesale vegetable base, a construction market and a fair, a training center for the Ministry of Emergencies, and residential neighborhoods.  Among the historical sites is Troitskoye Manor Park of the mid-18th century with three ponds located in cascade.  To the south is the Church of the Life-Giving Trinity (1696), to the north is a private sports complex. </p><p>  As one of the journalists aptly put it, Mosrentgen is a village similar to the island of Soviet life outside Moscow, sunken in the commercial and industrial periphery of Moscow, generated by capitalism. </p><p>  The axis of communication of this territory is Admiral Kornilov Street and Projected Driveway 135, which continues. The auto parts market, the village of Salaryevo, warehouses, cemeteries, the Indigo Industrial Park, and the wholesale and retail center Lotos adjoin it. </p><h2>  Mosrentgen village on the map </h2><p>  The settlement is actually located at the borders of the Moscow Ring Road, southwest of Old Moscow, and since 2012 it has been part of the capital.  The developed road network and proximity to the metropolis contribute to the growth of the village: if in 2002 10,336 people lived here, then in 2010 - 16,462 (according to censuses). </p><p>  If you look from a height, you can see that Mosrentgen has a linear structure: commercial buildings (business parks, trade, logistics) are growing along highways, and housing is also developing.  New construction is taking place along major roads, as well as chord ties, including promising ones.  The village has clear boundaries that run along the Moscow Ring Road, Kaluga and Kiev Highways, <span>Admiral Kornilov</span> Street and Projected Driveway No. 135. </p>

    <h2>  New Moscow </h2><p>  From 01.07.2012, the village of Mosrentgen became part of the newly formed territorial unit of New Moscow, which is an extension of the borders of Old Moscow in the Kaluga direction.  Here, the authorities want to implement a number of ambitious projects designed to remove the burden from the old <span>Moscow regions.</span>  So, it is planned: </p><ul><li>  build a giant government complex; </li><li>  create clusters - ‚Äúgrowth points‚Äù of new scientific and technical projects; </li><li>  organize new production, logistics centers, agricultural enterprises; </li><li>  to develop recreational tourism; </li><li>  build new neighborhoods with modern urban development. </li></ul><p>  According to Moscow Mayor <span>Sergei Sobyanin, the</span> government and administration will try to develop the territory in such a way that it does not constrain Moscow, but, on the contrary, unloads the metropolitan area.  An ambitious plan is being hatched - to create a million jobs. </p><p>  Mosrentgen is a village destined to become one of the "points of growth".  Here will be built the Social and Business Center, NAO, an area of ‚Äã‚Äã190 hectares with the creation of about 150,000 jobs.  Its formation was predetermined by the emergence of a large business park "Rumyantsevo" and the development of the territory around the chord between the Kaluga and Kiev highway, where the number of business objects is actively increasing.  The main element at the first stage should be the construction of the Komsiti business center, the first phase of which was commissioned in the 3rd quarter of 2014. </p>
