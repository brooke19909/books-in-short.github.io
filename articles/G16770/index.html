  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gorenje equipment, reviews and specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If Atlant is primarily known for its refrigerators, Bosch for washing machines, then <strong> </strong>  Gorenje Group is famous for its stoves.  The company produces plates in two versions: under the brand name Mora and Gorenje.  Customer reviews on these brands are the most positive.  Why is the company's technology divided into Mora and Gorenje?  Everything is very simple - <span>Mora</span> gas <span>stoves</span> have a simplified design and equipment, for the most part they are equipped with only basic functions.  In fact, this is a budget option, affordable for most buyers, while the Gorenie gas stove is distinguished by its exquisite design and maximum configuration.  Accordingly, the price of it is slightly higher. </p><p>  For comparison, consider two popular models Mora and Gorenje.  Reviews of some sellers indicate that it is precisely on them that potential buyers most often pay attention.  Mora MGN 51123 FW has the standard dimensions for slabs: 50 * 60 * 85.  A stove with a gas oven and 4 gas burners of 3 different diameters.  At the bottom of the door is a temperature gauge.  A distinctive feature of the model is the piezo ignition of the gas surface from a finger-type battery installed under a metal drawer.  Unlike many others, this stove does not require an electrical connection.  The kit also includes a metal cover that can be removed and washed in one motion, a grill and a metal sheet. </p><p>  Gorenje G 470 W is generally similar in technical specifications: the same dimensions, number and size of burners and equipment.  The differences begin already in the oven - instead of the usual enamel, enamel of easy cleaning is applied inside, which facilitates the care of the stove.  Also, it does not have a temperature indicator that indicates the temperature.  But there is a built-in thermostat - just turn the oven knob to the desired value, and the stove will heat itself and hold the desired temperature.  Another advantage is one-handed electric ignition.  It is enough to turn the switch, and a flame will appear on the burner.  There is a difference in the design: smoother lines, bends, rounded handles on the Gorenje plate.  Customer reviews suggest that the appearance of this model attracts them more than the rude and rustic design of Mora models. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, gas stoves are far from the only thing Gorenje can boast of.  The company produces dryers and washing machines, built-in appliances, <span>wine racks, refrigerators</span> and much more.  Any <span>Gorenie refrigerator,</span> customer <span>reviews</span> confirm this, it is distinguished by grace and stylish design.  For example, Gorenje RK 41200 W - affordable, high (180 cm), with a spacious freezer and a refrigerator.  The model is equipped with four <span>glass shelves,</span> one of which is decomposed into two narrow, three different-sized drawers in the freezer, a capacious shelf for bottles. </p><p>  There are more expensive models, for example, Gorenje NRK 6P2X.  This is a tall, two-meter unit with two compresses and the No Frost system, which allows you to operate the refrigerator without defrosting it.  The coating material is stainless steel, so the Gorenje NRK 6P2X fits perfectly into a modern, stylish kitchen.  The multi-function display allows you to adjust the temperature in the refrigerator and freezer compartments and even turn them off in turn for a vacation or cleaning.  The antibacterial coating inside the chambers is another distinguishing feature of the Gorenje refrigerator.  Customer reviews indicate that it prevents the growth of bacteria on the walls of the chambers and prevents the appearance of yellow plaque. </p><p>  In general, the equipment of this company is designed for a wide range of consumers.  Among the proposed models you can find both expensive refrigerators and dishwashers, as well as budget options for Gorenje stoves.  Customer reviews indicate that, regardless of price, the equipment is of high quality. </p>
