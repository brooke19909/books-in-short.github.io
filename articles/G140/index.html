Prices for accommodation in the Serebryansky Kamen camp site are low, an overnight stay will cost you no more than 5 thousand rubles in a superior room. </li><li>  An interesting list of excursions.

The cleanliness and freshness of the air in the Northern Urals deserves special attention.  Due to the remoteness of the base from large cities, tourists can enjoy the freshness of the mountain air and the cleanliness of the territory. </li><li>  Convenient location.  Despite the remoteness of the Serebryansky Kamen base from large cities or villages, it is very easy to reach the final point.  The nearby town of Karpinsk is 44 km from the camp site. </li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><ul><li>  Expensive additional services.  The cost of the necessary services is quite high - this extends even to the organization of showers and meals, which is a huge minus of the camp site. </li><li>  Bad connection.  You will not be able to call relatives and friends while in the Serebryansky Kamen base.  The camp site offers the ability to make calls in a specially designated place, but the network does not catch the whole territory.  The same goes for Wi-Fi. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews left between 2014 and 2016, the Serebryansky Kamen camp site, a photo of which many tourists admire, is one of the best places to stay.  Despite its shortcomings (expensive services, excursions), rest in a camp site brings only the best impressions.  This is not surprising, because high-quality, good housing, amazing, colorful nature, delight anyone. </p><p>  In addition, discounts and special offers are available on the camp site, which fully compensates for dissatisfaction with paid services.  So, employees give a discount to those who are birthday and those tourists who book rooms for a period of more than 2 days.  With an increase in the length of stay, the cost gradually decreases.  In addition, the birthday presents a gift: an hour of bathing in a traditional Russian hut. </p>
