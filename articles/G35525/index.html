    <h2>  Some statistics </h2><p>  The fact that budget devices are sold much more intensively than representatives of the middle and elite categories, says dry statistics.  According to one of the mobile leaders of the Russian market - Megafon, the tablet sector has noticeably sagged due to the crisis in late 2014.  In the whole country, sales in this segment over the past year decreased by 5%, although in Eastern Europe this dynamics was positive: + 4.4%. </p><p>  Sales of more expensive products (over 10,000 rubles) fell by 20%.  But cheap ‚Äútablets‚Äù (Tablet PC) worth up to 5000 rubles won 50% of the market and even increase sales (+ 21% by 2014), which, however, is not surprising, because these are inexpensive, but good tablets.  Devices whose price ranges from 5000-10000 rubles., Occupy a share of 37%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to MTS, January statistics are depressing.  For the first time in history, there has been a rapid decline in demand for these cutting-edge devices.  520,000 tablets were sold per month, which is 17% less than in January 2014.  In monetary terms, the losses are even more significant: - 29%.  Apple and Samsung lost the most - their prestigious models (more expensive than 15-20 thousand rubles) were 40% worse sold. </p><h2>  Which brands are the most popular </h2><p>  According to IDC analysts, in Russia Samsung holds the lead among tablets of all categories.  Even <span>the depreciation of the ruble</span> and the decline in income of Russians did not prevent the Korean corporation from losing ground to more affordable Chinese brands.  Among the inexpensive, seven-inch tablets are most in demand.  The prices and specifications of models such as the Galaxy Tab 2 and Galaxy Tab 3 allow them to dominate the ‚Äúpublic sector‚Äù market. </p><p>  The five best-selling brands before the New Year looked like this: </p><ol><li>  Samsung (Korea) - 15%. </li><li>  Lenovo (China) - 14.8%. </li><li>  Apple (USA) - 14.3%. </li><li>  Digma (Hong Kong) - 11.6%. </li><li>  ASUS (Taiwan) - 7.5%. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Which inexpensive tablet is better to buy </h2><p>  Reviews of many people say that choosing an inexpensive device is not so simple.  And the reason for the "torment of choice" lies in a wide variety of models.  Various authoritative specialized publications compile lists of the best ‚Äúpills‚Äù.  Based on them, we will consider popular tablets that are relevant in 2015. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What to look for when comparing tablets?  Prices and specifications are, of course, the most important landmarks, but keep in mind that sophisticated electronics can fail.  Therefore, the presence of service centers in your region that provide repair of specific devices, including warranty, should also be considered.  For example, thousands of people order cheap Chinese noname devices through online stores directly from the Middle Kingdom, but with technical problems fixing such a gadget is problematic. </p><h2>  Oysters T72M 3G </h2><p>  One of the most affordable Tablet PC in the vastness of Russia.  You can buy it for less than 2000 rubles.  In Megafon, the model is offered for 2,990 rubles.  with warranty service.  This is a great tablet for children - as they say, it‚Äôs not a pity.  Despite the extreme cheapness of the Chinese product, the characteristics of the gadget are comparable to the middle peasants of past years. </p><p>  Seven-inch TFT-screen stands out for a good resolution (1024 x 600 pixels), supports cellular communications, including 3G.  The RAM of the tablet is 1 GB - this allows the Oysters T72M 3G not to slow down when visiting web pages, when watching videos, in light games.  Installed relatively fresh operating system Android 4.4. </p><p>  When considering the issue of ‚Äúwhich inexpensive tablet is better to buy,‚Äù reviews from Oysters owners will not particularly help.  Some users of the crane speak negatively about the model, while others consider it ideal among cheap gadgets.  The main complaints are the quality of the case and the TFT screen.  At the same time, the T72M 3G copes with everyday tasks: the Internet, reading e-books, videos, casual games. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  iconBIT NetTAB SKAT </h2><p>  Another "tablet for children", but a class higher than the previous representative.  It has good ergonomics and ideal sizes typical for gadgets with a 7.85 "screen. Its cost - up to 5000 rubles - attracts potential buyers. An IPS screen with a decent resolution (1024 x 768) is optimized for surfing the Internet and watching videos. Cameras - the main one (5 megapixels) and for selfies (2 megapixels) - they allow you to take good pictures in sufficient light. The device supports 3G. Most users rate SKAT at 4 and 5 points (out of five). </p><p>  The iconBIT NetTAB brand from Hong Kong is quite popular in Russia.  About 500 of its representatives operate in the country, which provides a wide network of sales and repair services.  In addition to SKAT, a wide selection of models is offered - both more affordable and more technologically advanced. </p>

    <h2>  Galaxy Tab 4 </h2><p>  A worthy continuation of the lines of the Galaxy Tab 2 and 3 from Samsung.  The family is represented by six modifications, prices start at 8,000 rubles.  As you can see from the specifications, the most clear image offers a 7-inch tablet, otherwise the internal filling (RAM, processors, camera) is the same for everyone.  All these parameters are clearly shown in the table below. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="102"></td><td valign="top" width="57"><p>  price, rub. </p></td><td valign="top" width="113"><p>  Screen </p></td><td valign="top" width="151"><p>  Memory, GB (random access memory / flash) </p></td><td valign="top" width="198"><p>  Camera, MP (main / additional) </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="102"><p>  7.0 SM-T230 </p></td><td valign="top" width="57"><p>  7990 </p></td><td valign="top" width="113"><p>  7.0 "(1280x800) </p></td><td valign="top" width="151"><p>  1.5 / 8 </p></td><td valign="top" width="198"><p>  3 / 1.3 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="102"><p>  7.0 SM-T231 </p></td><td valign="top" width="57"><p>  11990 </p></td><td colspan="3" valign="top" width="463"><p>  Features 3G </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="102"><p>  8.0 SM-T330 </p></td><td valign="top" width="57"><p>  11990 </p></td><td valign="top" width="113"><p>  8.0 "(1280x800) </p></td><td valign="top" width="151"><p>  1.5 / 16 </p></td><td valign="top" width="198"><p>  3 / 1.3 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="102"><p>  8.0 SM-T331 </p></td><td valign="top" width="57"><p>  15990 </p></td><td colspan="3" valign="top" width="463"><p>  + 3G </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="102"><p>  10.1 SM-T530 </p></td><td valign="top" width="57"><p>  14990 </p></td><td valign="top" width="113"><p>  10 "(1280x800) </p></td><td valign="top" width="151"><p>  1.5 / 16 </p></td><td valign="top" width="198"><p>  3 / 1.3 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="102"><p>  10.1 SM-T531 </p></td><td valign="top" width="57"><p>  18990 </p></td><td colspan="3" valign="top" width="463"><p>  Built-in 3G module </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  In general, Galaxy Tab 4 users rate tablets as inexpensive, but good - by 4 points out of five.  Among the minuses are called such moments: the battery is quickly discharged, a short recharge wire, a mediocre camera.  Pleased with quality and performance. </p><h2>  Lenovo IdeaTab A5500 </h2><p>  One of the best-selling models of the largest Chinese brand, whose cost does not exceed 11,000 rubles.  These inexpensive tablets in Moscow and other cities can be purchased from authorized dealers.  The quad-core MediaTek processor MT8382 is very smart, it will not allow applications to ‚Äújerk‚Äù.  Separate mention deserves the bright multi-touch IPS matrix at 8 inches (1280 x 800).  However, the lack of oleophobic coating prompts the screen to quickly become covered by fingerprints. </p><p>  Perhaps a small drawback is the currently small ‚Äú1 GB‚Äù RAM, but, according to the owners, the device works confidently even with the resource-intensive ‚ÄúAndroid 4.4.2‚Äù.  Also, users praise the excellent sound quality for inexpensive gadgets.  The <span>Lenovo A5500 runs</span> on a single charge for a long enough time: 5-8 hours.  A wonderful mini-tablet is worthy of competition for the more hyped brands ASUS and Samsung. </p>

    <h2>  ASUS MeMO Pad 7 </h2><p>  The Taiwanese brand has always been distinguished by the excellent quality of its products.  We continue the review of the tablets with the seven-inch ASUS MeMO model.  The device leaves the impression of a monolith - nothing creaks, does not ring, does not hang out.  Designers made the original, providing the case deliberately with ‚Äúsharp‚Äù rectangular faces.  The device looks solid in both a female and a male hand.  You can‚Äôt even say that this is an inexpensive device - its price is about 13,000 rubles. </p><p>  <span>The 7-inch tablet is</span> equipped with an IPS Full-HD matrix of excellent quality with an excellent density of dots per inch: 323 ppi.  The processor did not fail either - the quad-core Intel Atom Z3560 series shows the wonders of speed.  More expensive MeMO modifications are equipped with fourth-generation LTE communications.  2 GB of "RAM", coupled with 16 GB of main memory correspond to the top characteristics of the same Apple.  ASUS MeMO, according to reviews, is equipped with good cameras (5 + 2 megapixels), but mediocre speakers: the sound is loud, but "dull."  Due to the energy-saturated screen, the autonomy of work suffers. </p>

    <h2>  Explay Tablet Mini </h2><p>  The Explay mini-tablet is equipped with a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù display of 6 inches, but at the same time has an ‚Äúadult‚Äù filling.  Such a combination would seem ideal to someone.  The device is very compact, you can even put it in a wide pocket.  Thanks to the small screen, the battery life is increased.  At the same time, six inches is more than enough for reading electronic books, web surfing, listening to music.  However, you can watch videos without straining. </p><p>  Explay Tablet Mini supports 3G, and on board there are two slots for SIM cards, which is important.  In fact, this is a large smartphone, but the manufacturer is positioning it as a Tablet mini.  The device has a high-quality matrix of IPS technology, a non-standard resolution of 960 x 540. A dual-core processor (1.3 GHz) is enough for most tasks.  The manufacturer's recommended cost is 4990 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Chinese brands </h2><p>  Among the large number of large, small and "semi-underground" electronics manufacturers in the Middle Kingdom, a number of brands that produce devices that are not inferior in quality to Korean, American, Japanese, and Taiwan stand out.  And the characteristics are much superior, which allows us to draw certain conclusions in the question: "Which inexpensive tablet is better to buy?"  The reviews of thousands of people who purchased gadgets of large Chinese companies through online stores indicate the optimal ratio of price and quality. </p><p>  First of all, the company Xiaomi has shown rapid growth.  Innovative devices Mi1, and then Mi2 ‚Äúblew up‚Äù the market, crowding out the giants.  In 2013, the Chinese sold 10 million Mi2 devices.  The main secret of success is MIUI's own proprietary software shell, an ultra-thin case and the most modern filling.  Although the brand specializes in smartphones, MiPad tablets are also in high demand and cause rave reviews from owners. </p><p>  Among the 200 Chinese brands producing ‚Äúpills,‚Äù the following companies stand out: </p><ul><li>  ZTE; </li><li>  Huawei </li><li>  Ainol; </li><li>  Cube </li><li>  Onda; </li><li>  PiPO; </li><li>  Freelander </li><li>  Chuwi; </li><li>  Ampe </li><li>  Ramos; </li><li>  Teclast and several others. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The tablet review can be continued with dozens of other inexpensive but noteworthy models.  However, not all of them are available in each specific region.  When choosing a portable gadget, it is necessary to take into account the cost of the product, quality and convenience, technical specifications, terms of warranty and post-warranty repair.  For many, the possibility of acquiring a loan or by installments is relevant, which narrows the available lineup. </p><p>  However, even inexpensive modern ‚Äútablets‚Äù, according to reviews, are able to satisfy most of the needs of an ordinary person, be it web surfing, social networks, watching movies, reading literature, listening to music and audio books, composing text notes, GPS navigation, numerous games and useful programs.  It is much more important to purchase goods in trusted locations, and not from random sellers.  It is also necessary to carefully approach the bold decision to order an expensive product through online stores, especially those that do not have the appropriate details. </p>
