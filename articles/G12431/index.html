Especially for the gathered audience, the trainer will ask the dolphin to draw a picture, which can then be acquired during the auction.  The real highlight of the performance is the diving of specially trained actresses into an aquarium with real sharks.  A variety of surprises await the guests of the dolphinarium, come and you will see everything with your own eyes!  The duration of the presentation is 45 minutes, which means that even the smallest viewers will be able to watch the show until the very end. </p><h2>  Cost of attendance and presentation schedule </h2><p>  On weekdays, the dolphinarium at VDNH holds one performance, and on weekends two or three.  And every time this is a real full house.  Tickets can be purchased right before the start of the show at the box office located in front of the dolphinarium.  The cost depends on the selected row.  The most expensive ticket costs 1200 rubles, and the cheapest - only 400 rubles.
