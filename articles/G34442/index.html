You can use this system only in a limited number of regions where local authorities allow the use of the regime.  Additionally, it applies only to certain areas of work.  Calculation of UTII has certain nuances, since the size of the tax depends on the physical indicator of the business, and different coefficients and basic profitability are also taken into account.  Most of the values ‚Äã‚Äãused are set by the authorities, so entrepreneurs cannot influence them. </p><h2>  In what area is it applied? </h2><p>  In Art.  346.26 of the Tax Code lists all types of activities for which imputed income may be applied.  Standardly, this includes cargo transportation, passenger transportation, the opening of public catering establishments, as well as the provision of household, hairdressing and many other services. </p><p>  Before filing a notice of the transition to this mode, you must contact the Department of the Federal Tax Service to clarify the possibility of its application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nalog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax Code" class="if uuid-2482870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2482870.jpg"></div><h2>  What indicators are used for calculation? </h2><p>  In order to correctly determine the amount of tax that should be transferred to the budget on a quarterly basis, you should well understand what indicators should be used for this.  The calculation of UTII in 2018 involves the use of different values: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  the basic profitability is represented by the potential income from activities during the month calculated by the authorities, therefore it is significantly different for freight or retail; </li><li>  the physical indicator is represented by various business parameters, which include the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe trading or showroom, the number of seats for passengers in transport, or other parameters; </li><li>  imputed income is represented by multiplying a physical indicator by a base return; </li><li>  K1 - coefficient-deflator installed at the state level, and it changes annually; </li><li>  K2 - correction factor calculated by the local authorities of each region, which takes into account the economic situation of the region, especially small businesses and other significant criteria; </li><li>  tax rate of 15%. </li></ul><p>  It is the above indicators that make it possible to correctly calculate the tax.  You can find out most of the values ‚Äã‚Äãonly at the Federal Tax Service, and the necessary numbers can be found on the official website of the inspection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="god2018.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="calculation of UTII for individual entrepreneurs in 2018" class="if uuid-2482867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2482867.jpg"></div><h2>  Who is the payer? </h2><p>  Calculation of UTII should be performed by all entrepreneurs who have voluntarily chosen this tax regime to conduct business. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Before switching to a system, it is important to make sure that it operates on the territory of a particular region.  Additionally, it should be checked that the selected field of work is suitable for this system.  The number of employed employees by an entrepreneur shall not exceed 100 people. </p><h2>  What is the object of taxation? </h2><p>  The object of taxation is the direct <span>imputed income</span> , calculated separately for each activity.  It additionally depends on the physical indicator of work. </p><p>  The physical indicator is usually the size of the retail space, the number of employees in the company, the number of seats for passengers in transport, or the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe showroom in a catering establishment. </p><p>  The tax base is the size of the imputed income, for which the basic profitability is multiplied by the physical indicator of activity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rcbadvisors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="UTII calculation 2018" class="if uuid-2481534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2481534.jpg"></div><h2>  Rules for the preparation and submission of reports </h2><p>  Each entrepreneur should not only deal with calculating UTII, but also quarterly submit a declaration to the Federal Tax Service. </p><p>  The documentation must be generated every three months, after which it is submitted to the inspection before the 20th day of the month following the end of the quarter. </p><h2>  What taxes are being replaced? </h2><p>  When using imputed tax, entrepreneurs may not pay many other taxes: </p><ul><li>  Individual entrepreneurs do not pay personal income tax and property tax; </li><li>  companies are exempted from having to transfer VAT, property tax and income tax. </li></ul><p>  Such UTII parameters are considered to be its indisputable advantage, since the tax burden on taxpayers is significantly reduced.  The quarter is the tax period for UTII; therefore, the tax should be paid once every three months. </p><h2>  Tax Payment Rules </h2><p>  Calculation of UTII and payment of tax is carried out quarterly until the 25th day of the month following the end of the tax period.  The provisions of Art.  346.32 Tax Code. </p><p>  Taxpayers have the right to reduce the calculated amount for insurance payments transferred to different funds, which include the PF, FSS and MHIF.  If the entrepreneur does not have officially employed workers, then he can reduce the fee by the entire amount transferred for himself. </p><p>  If an individual employed by hired specialists, he can reduce the tax only by 50% of the total amount transferred to the funds.  Therefore, it is required to correctly calculate the UTII insurance premiums in order to be able to reduce the tax burden on the entrepreneur. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skmbg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="UTII calculation in 2018" class="if uuid-2481536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2481536.jpg"></div><h2>  What changes were made in 2018? </h2><p>  Various changes are regularly introduced into the tax legislation, so all businessmen should regularly monitor various innovations, which will allow them to avoid violating the law and charging significant fines.  The changes concern even the calculation of UTII.  2018 brought some changes for this tax regime. </p><p>  Since the beginning of 2018, a new K1 indicator of 1.868 has now been used.  It is <span>this coefficient-deflator that</span> needs to be multiplied by the basic profitability in order to ultimately receive the amount payable. </p><h2>  Where are the funds transferred? </h2><p>  It is important not only to understand how the calculation of UTII for IP is implemented in 2018, but also to determine where the correctly determined amount is transferred. </p><p>  Entrepreneurs working using different stationary premises transfer funds at the location of their store, trading floor or catering establishment. </p><p>  If an individual entrepreneur is engaged in distribution or distribution trade, specializes in advertising at various facilities or offers freight or passenger transportation, then registration is made in the region where the citizen resides.  Additionally, the city where the main office is located can be used for this. </p><h2>  Responsibility for Violations </h2><p>  If there are no transfers to the budget on time, then the entrepreneur will certainly be brought to administrative responsibility. </p><p>  Based on Art.  45 NK he will have to pay a fine equal to 20% of the tax amount.  If the tax authorities have evidence that the taxpayer deliberately refuses to transfer funds, then the fine will increase to 40% of the amount of the fee. </p><p>  Additionally, a penalty is charged for each day of delay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.accountant.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="calculation UTII trucking" class="if uuid-2481553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2481553.jpg"></div><h2>  Calculation Rules </h2><p>  Calculation of UTII is considered quite simple, therefore, usually entrepreneurs are engaged in this process on their own.  This allows you to save on the wages of a qualified accountant. </p><p>  The UTII calculation formula is presented as follows: </p><p>  The amount of the fee = tax base (physical indicator * basic rate of return * K1 * K2) * tax rate. </p><p>  If you want to make a calculation not for the whole quarter, but for a month or even several days, then you should determine the exact number of days when the entrepreneur carried out activities under this regime.  This indicator is multiplied by the tax base, after which the resulting value is divided by all days in the quarter. </p><p>  The calculation of UTII in 2018 requires the determination of the basic profitability, and you can see the latest information in Art.  346.29 Tax Code.  For each type of activity, this value has a unique size.  Only when using relevant information is the correct calculation of UTII made.  Cargo transportation is considered a popular area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork.  In the calculation, it is required to take a basic yield of 6 thousand rubles. </p><p>  If an entrepreneur specializes in portable trading, then the basic monthly profitability is 4.5 thousand rubles. </p><p>  To find out the K2 coefficient, it is recommended to contact the local branch of the Federal Tax Service, since for each region this indicator is significantly different.  It can vary from 0.005 to 1. Based on this indicator, the amount of basic profit decreases, therefore, it reduces the amount payable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="assignmentshelp.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="UTII calculation for retail" class="if uuid-2481547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2481547.jpg"></div><h2>  Calculation Example </h2><p>  In each region, unique types of activities can be established for which entrepreneurs can work under the UTII regime.  Most cities allow the retail sale of goods. </p><p>  The calculation of UTII for retail is considered quite simple.  For example, an entrepreneur sells goods for animals in a stationary store, whose area is 20 square meters.  m </p><p>  To calculate the fee, the following indicators are used: </p><ul><li>  the basic return for this type of activity is 1800 rubles.  per month; </li><li>  physical indicator is 20 square meters.  m .; </li><li>  K1 is set at 1.868 for 2018; </li><li>  K2 in the region is 0.4. </li></ul><p>  All values ‚Äã‚Äãare substituted in the formula: 20 x 1800 x 1.868 x 04 = 26899.2 rubles.  For the quarter, the tax base will be: 26899.2 x 3 = 80697.6 rubles.  It is charged 15%, so for the quarter, the entrepreneur is obliged to pay the state 80,697.6 x 15% = 12,104.64 rubles. </p><p>  If you use this example, it will not be difficult to calculate UTII for individual entrepreneurs.  Retail trade can be replaced by distribution or distribution of various goods, household services or other works.  In this case, only the basic profitability and physical indicator will change. </p><p>  Additionally, this payment for insurance premiums may be reduced.  If an individual entrepreneur works independently, and therefore does not attract employees, then he can deduct from the calculated amount all funds paid to various state funds for himself.  This significantly reduces the tax burden. </p><h2>  How to calculate for an incomplete quarter? </h2><p>  If the entrepreneur has worked in an incomplete quarter, then the days that actually led the activities of the individual entrepreneur are taken into account.  For example, a businessman worked only two months on UTII, so 60 days are included in the calculation, and the resulting value is divided by the total number of days in the quarter, which is conditionally 90 days. </p><p>  Tax base = 20 x 60 x 1800 x 1.868 x 04/90 = 17932.8 rubles.  Already from this value 15% is then charged, therefore the budget is transferred: 17932.8 x 0.15 = 2689.92 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.azernews.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="UTII calculation formula" class="if uuid-2481550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2481550.jpg"></div><h2>  Using special calculators </h2><p>  To simplify the calculations, entrepreneurs can use a special program created directly by the Federal Tax Service.  It is called the ‚ÄúYL Taxpayer.‚Äù  With its help, you can make different declarations or other reports, and also in the automatic mode, the tax is calculated. </p><p>  To use such a program, you just need to enter in its form the necessary information about the physical indicator, profitability and other values.  It indicates how many days the entrepreneur actually worked on UTII during the quarter.  Next, an automatic and correct calculation is made. </p><p>  The network has numerous online calculators that also allow you to quickly and correctly calculate the tax. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  UTII is a simplified mode that IPs can choose only in some regions.  It is suitable for certain areas of activity, and is also chosen voluntarily by entrepreneurs.  It is considered easy to use, since calculating the tax correctly is not difficult. </p><p>  Entrepreneurs must correctly calculate and timely pay the fee so as not to violate the law and not be held administratively liable.  Additionally, they need to submit declarations on UTII on a quarterly basis to the Federal Tax Service. </p>
