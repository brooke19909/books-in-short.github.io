Laser Level Overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Regardless of whether there is a line on the wall for mounting a curb rail or for laying tiles in the bathroom, a laser level is required.  With clear, sharp markings that extend 10 meters or more, the work will go much faster, easier and potentially more accurate than using a traditional tool. </p><p>  For different tasks, different versions of laser levels have been developed, from simple point to three-dimensional projectors.  But which of them are most suitable for the performance of certain works?  It depends on the requirements.  This overview of laser levels is designed to help you make the right decision. </p><h2>  Technology basics </h2><p>  Lasers have evolved from super-rays from science fiction to the organic part of everyday life.  They provide greater accuracy, and in the case of eye surgery - and tremendous delicacy.  What are they? </p><p>  The word "laser" is an acronym for the expression "amplification of light through stimulated emission" in English.  In consumer products, the laser light source is a regular LED.  Light is "stimulated" by electric current, which increases its intensity.  Then it concentrates into a point or line and is projected by prisms or mirrors. </p><p>  <span>The laser beam</span> always propagates in a straight line, but this cannot be called a level.  To make it useful, some low-cost devices use an air bubble, as in a traditional measuring tool.  More advanced models are equipped with an internal plummet with sensors and are self-leveling.  If installed incorrectly, they may give an audible or visual warning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You might think that the laser level was invented by a builder or engineer, but in fact it was patented in 1996 by Stephen J. Orosh, Jr., who developed it for use in heart monitoring systems. </p><p>  Before choosing a laser level for a specific task, it is necessary to consider 4 parameters by which these tools differ: </p><ul><li>  a type; </li><li>  mode of operation; </li><li>  accuracy and range; </li><li>  additional features. <div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Qooltek Multipurpose" class="if uuid-2298804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2298804.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Level types </h2><p>  Although all linear lasers generate a beam in the same way, they are divided into several different types.  The main difference is the number of projected beams of light, but there are others, we should dwell on this in more detail. </p><p>  Basic level laser levels project a single beam that displays a point on the working surface.  Therefore, some call them point.  The initial alignment is often performed using an air bubble, as in a conventional instrument.  Such laser levels are usually cheap, and if you just need to align objects along the wall (fix hooks for outerwear or, for example, railing), then they are quite adequate.  Devices of this type are often small, very portable, but low power significantly limits their operating range. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cross levels </h2><p>  This is the most popular type of linear laser because they offer excellent flexibility at a reasonable price.  They are divided into 2 subtypes: with 2 and 3 bundles. </p><p>  In the first case, one horizontal and one vertical mark are displayed, intersecting at an angle of 90 ¬∞ on the selected surface.  If there is nothing in their path, then these rays will give one line of the laser level 360 degrees horizontally, and the other through the wall, ceiling and opposite wall.  In practice, however, actual coverage is limited to a smaller operating range. </p><p>  Three-beam instruments produce a second vertical beam of light perpendicular to the first.  This gives lines to the front, back and side on the walls, which allows the laser level to work 360 degrees in 3 dimensions, i.e. on all walls at the same time. </p><p>  Tools of this type are used for everything from installing drywall to wall and floor cladding, wiring and lighting or installing suspended ceilings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bosch GLL 3-80 3 Plane" class="if uuid-2298834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2298834.jpg"></div><h2>  Rotational levels </h2><p>  Cross-line lasers are especially good at home.  However, for really large rooms, you need a larger range, which provide rotational levels.  As the name implies, these lasers do not produce a fixed beam, but rather rotate 360 ‚Äã‚Äã¬∞.  This happens fast enough, so the point that the tool projects seems to be a solid flat line.  Many rotary lasers produce only one beam, although some models also generate a vertical vertical mark. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Although rotational levels can be used when installing curb rails or to ensure the same height of the doors throughout the room, the high cost implies their use in commercial construction projects.  They can be very large and used for tasks such as building warehouses and creating parking spaces where their working range can be used in the best way. </p><h2>  Operating modes </h2><p>  This functionality can be misleading, as they often sound the same as the number of light beams to which they have nothing to do.  Therefore, before choosing a laser level, you should check the number of independent radiation sources. </p><p>  For example, there are tools with 3 modes: horizontal, vertical and vertical.  This is very similar to 3 rays.  But actually it is not.  In this case, a single-line laser is designed in different modes.  It is easier to use such an instrument than one whose position must be changed to achieve the desired result, but it is not a three-beam one. </p><p>  Another example is a model with level, plumb and cross modes.  Neither three, nor four beams are here.  This is actually a description of the two-beam level, a really good and inexpensive device, but its description is confusing. </p><h2>  Accuracy </h2><p>  How to choose a laser level by measurement error?  In general, the more expensive the tool, the more accurate it is.  The accuracy of the laser level for a home is usually ¬± 6 mm per 10 meters. This is very good accuracy.  If you hang half a dozen paintings at a distance of one and a half meters from each other, then it will be difficult to notice such a difference. </p><p>  But if the level is used in order to lay the tile on the floor or wall, then such an error will not be sufficient.  The standard for mid-range linear lasers is an accuracy of ¬± 3 mm per 10 meters, which for most people is more than enough for all occasions. </p><p>  This does not mean that measurement accuracy cannot be improved.  Some construction laser levels are able to provide much more accurate readings, reaching values ‚Äã‚Äãof ¬± 2 mm at a distance of more than 30 m. Only rotary instruments have such characteristics, but their cost is equally high. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hammerhead Compact" class="if uuid-2298813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2298813.jpg"></div><h2>  Working range </h2><p>  By this is meant not just the distance at which the beam is visible to the human eye.  There are devices called receivers that can significantly increase the working distance, although they are not always compatible.  How to choose a laser level for this indicator? </p><p>  Cheap tools are often powered by standard AA batteries, so after 5-10 meters the light line will disappear, especially in a bright room.  According to <span>reviews, laser levels of</span> this category in the open air are almost useless. </p><p>  Depending on the model, medium-range instruments provide a range of 20 to 30 m, but only those that have a pulsed mode are compatible with receivers, which allows working at a distance of 75 m or more. </p><p>  But the best laser levels are rotational.  Available models, long-range which is 800 m. </p><p>  The brightness and color of light have a direct effect on the working range of laser levels.  Typically, these instruments use a red or green beam.  The latter option is considered more convenient for perception, especially in bright light, which allows you to use the laser level both indoors and outdoors.  Unfortunately, such LEDs are more expensive and require more energy for the equivalent range.  Therefore, red lasers are most common. </p><p>  Special glasses can improve the visibility of the beam.  They are inexpensive, so you should pay attention to them. </p><h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  Those who have ever worked with a traditional tool and tried to determine if the air bubble is exactly in the middle will appreciate the self-alignment option offered by some models. </p><p>  <span>How to use the laser level</span> in this case?  It is enough to manually set the instrument within 3-4 ¬∞, and he will do the rest.  This greatly simplifies setup.  If desired, this function can be disabled so that you can position the level at an angle (for example, when marking the stairs).  The device must be locked so that it is not damaged during transport. </p><p>  Many laser levels come with a tripod mount.  This is a much more convenient and standard installation method, unlike placing the tool on the steps of the stairs or boxes.  Tripods for the laser level themselves are usually not included, they have to be bought separately.  The mount is usually standard, so any tripod purchased before should work, but compatibility is best checked. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DEWALT DW088LG" class="if uuid-2298799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2298799.jpg"></div><p>  Another good idea is the presence of clamps or magnets that allow you to fix this tool on ceiling rails, shelves or in any other convenient place.  Like a tripod, the presence of a stable <span>reference point</span> guarantees the accuracy of measurements. </p><p>  The nutrition of laser levels is different and is important.  Typically, budget models receive energy from rechargeable AA or AAA batteries, and in some - a tablet type.  At large laser levels, the same 12 volt type of battery that is installed in electric drills or other cordless power tools can be used.  More power almost always means a greater operating range. </p><p>  If the user already has the power tools of a particular manufacturer, then battery compatibility will save money on the purchase of a spare.  But to check the interchangeability of power supplies is still necessary.  Sometimes different batteries look similar. </p><p>  The protective case will never be superfluous.  Building laser levels are usually pretty reliable, but it's nice to have extra protection. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  For users who need to align several photos or make sure that the shelf is installed evenly, a simple laser with one line worth up to 1 thousand rubles will be enough.  They are adjusted manually using the spirit level, and then the beam is launched from one or both sides.  Such a device is simple and effective, and should be in every set of tools. </p><p>  A cheap two-line cross laser level will cost 3 thousand rubles.  It is good enough for small tile work, cabinet alignment and similar tasks.  But professionals will need more accuracy and range.  The best laser levels of this type will cost 17 thousand rubles.  If alignment is required on all sides, which the three-beam system can provide, another 5 thousand will have to be paid. </p><p>  For rotational lasers of a higher class, you need to pay 20-100 thousand rubles or more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Laser level - photo" class="if uuid-2298846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2298846.jpg"></div><h2>  Professional Tips </h2><p>  The laser level is an indispensable tool that projects a precise guide line onto the work surface.  A good idea, if possible, is to physically mark the surface in case the level is knocked down.  The tool is easy to install for the first time, but re-tuning in the same position is difficult to achieve.  The greater the working distance, the greater the difference. </p><p>  When performing work that requires a right angle (for example, when installing garden flooring or laying tiles on the floor or on walls), a cross laser level is very useful, especially since it is inexpensive.  You might also consider purchasing a professional tile tool designed specifically for this task. </p><p>  You should always have a spare set of batteries at hand, because the charge can end at the most inopportune moment. </p><p>  Line lasers are great for aligning over distances of several meters.  If you just need to align the cabinet or the picture hanging on the wall, then the traditional level will be more than enough - it is equally accurate and most likely will make the measurement much faster. </p><h2>  FAQ </h2><p>  Is the beam dangerous in the laser level?  Most measuring instruments use class 2 or 3 lasers. Class 2 is considered low in risk and can be harmful if viewed through a lens.  Class 3 is medium risk and can cause eye damage if you direct a beam of light directly into the eyes.  The projected line of harm will not bring harm, but you cannot look directly at the source of the beam, especially with glasses that correct vision. </p><p>  Short-term accidental exposure is unlikely to cause permanent damage, but can cause short-term "blindness", similar to that experienced by photographed with a flash.  This can be dangerous when the user is at a height or working with a power tool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="AdirPro Cube 360" class="if uuid-2298825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2298825.jpg"></div><p>  What is IP?  Laser levels often have a protection class set according to a standard developed by the International Electrotechnical Commission. </p><p>  Initially, he determined how well industrial facilities cope with dust and moisture.  Today, many consumer devices are also classified in this way. </p><p>  The IP designation is followed by two digits.  The first of them denotes a dust protection class, and the second - from liquids.  For example, the IP54 designation indicates that the enclosure is dusty, but not enough to stop the device from working.  The device will withstand splashes of water - 5 minutes under the garden sprinkler.  The IP65 enclosure is fully dustproof and can withstand hose watering, but not complete immersion. </p><p>  If the rotary laser has the largest operating range, is it not the best choice?  Levels of this type are very powerful and have good visibility in the open air, but in other cases they are likely to be unnecessary.  For the vast majority of users, it is enough to have cross laser levels.  Even the best of them are much cheaper than rotational ones. </p><p>  Below is an overview of the best models of laser levels of various types. </p><h2>  DeWalt DW088LG </h2><p>  This is a cross-type self-leveling laser level that projects bright horizontal and vertical lines.  <span>Magnetic mounts</span> allow quick installation on steel rails.  The device can be mounted on a suspended ceiling. </p><p>  DeWalt manufactures a laser level strong enough to withstand the shock that is inevitable in the demanding work environment in which it is used.  Enclosure with IP65 protection does not allow dust and water to pass through.  The level will withstand if it accidentally falls or is thrown into the tool box, while maintaining a class-leading error of 3 mm at a distance of 10 m. </p><p>  DeWalt DW088LG features a green beam technology that is 4 times brighter than red. </p><p>  The laser level is powered by a 12 V lithium-ion battery. When the charge is insufficient, the instrument does not work properly (the beam starts to flash). </p><p>  The device is voluminous, but light.  The level is set automatically within 4 ¬∞.  The maximum range is from 30 to 50 m, depending on the operating mode and receiver.  The disadvantages of the model users include the high cost and the inability to use outdoors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Automatic laser level" class="if uuid-2298817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2298817.jpg"></div><h2>  Hammerhead Compact HLCL01 </h2><p>  This is a fairly simple laser level, but it can level out automatically.  If you set it horizontally within 4 ¬∞, then the tool will make the rest of the adjustment on its own.  If the required slope is not reached, then a <span>red LED</span> will signal this <span>.</span>  If you need to use the level in a different position, a manual mode is provided that disables this function. </p><p>  The tool projects bright lines with an accuracy of 6 mm / 10 m. It has 3 operating modes - horizontal level, vertical plummet and cross.  Equipped with a clamp to facilitate its installation. </p><h2>  Bosch 3 Plane </h2><p> It is a high-end professional tool, too expensive for home use.  The benefits of <span>the Bosch</span> 3 Plane <span>laser level</span> are an advanced class 2a projection system that creates 3 beams - one in the horizontal plane and two in the vertical.  In pulse mode, the operating range is 80 m (with the appropriate receiver), but the accuracy at this distance is not high enough. </p><p>  The model is characterized by a smart plumb system with a self-leveling laser level and an alarm about its violation, which can be disabled in manual mode.  Allows installation of lines at any angle. </p><p>  <span>The Bosch</span> 3 plane <span>laser level is</span> powered by 4 AAA batteries.  There is a case for transportation and storage. </p><h2>  Qooltel Multipurpose </h2><p>  This is an inexpensive 1-beam roulette laser.  Provides a consistent straight line, but requires user calibration.  The disadvantage is the lack of attachment to a tripod.  The laser level is combined with a 2.5 m tape measure and three alcohol indicators in different orientations.  The error is ¬± 2 mm at a distance of 10 m. The cheapest laser level of this review comes with 3 tablet-type AG13 batteries. </p><h2>  Adirpro cube </h2><p>  This affordable tool is found to be useful by both amateurs and professionals.  The kit includes a tripod for the laser level, 3 AAA batteries, special glasses, wall mount and a sturdy case with soft upholstery.  There is a sound alarm for accuracy, which can be annoying for some.  The working range is 70 m with a receiver, and the measurement accuracy is ¬± 3 mm at a distance of 10 m. </p><p>  The tool produces 2 separate laser beams and supports 3 operating modes: automatic, manual and with leveling off.  The class of protection against dust and moisture is IP54.  For greater stability and stability, the body is covered with rubber. </p>
