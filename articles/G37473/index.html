    <h2>  We call in Russia </h2><p>  The first point, which only implies the conditions of the tariff "Switch to 0" ("Megaphone"), is, of course, the cost of outgoing calls in Russia and within your home region.  After all, this is what customers pay attention to. </p><p>  The fact is that our today's tariff plan gives its users 20 minutes a day of free conversation within the home region when calling to "Megaphone".  This is enough for family matters, and for business calls.  Next minute will cost 60 cents. </p><p>  If you have the ‚ÄúAll Calls‚Äù service package activated, then communication with other mobile operators will also cost 60 kopecks.  In the absence of such - 2 times more expensive.  And you will have to give exactly the same amount if you decide to call the landline number from your mobile phone.  As you can see, the terms of the "Switch to 0" ("Megaphone") tariff are quite favorable. </p><p>  In Russia, calls to Megafon will cost 3 rubles.  And all other outgoing calls - at 12.5 rubles.  Compared to the same Beeline, you will get huge benefits.  Indeed, in most cases they will ask you from 15 rubles per minute. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff go to 0 megaphone conditions" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873398.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Calling around the world </h2><p>  The second point that cannot be ignored is conversations outside of Russia.  The fact is that the conditions of the tariff "Switch to 0" ("Megaphone") allow us to talk with everyone, even the most remote corners of the Earth.  Let's analyze the question in more detail .. </p><p>  In South Ossetia, Georgia, Ukraine, the <span>Baltic countries</span> and the CIS, you can call for only 35 rubles per minute.  In Europe, calls will cost 55 rubles.  Compared to other operators, these rates are quite sparing.  In other countries, of course, the cost of calls will be 97 rubles.  In fact, this is a very profitable amount.  The tariff "Go to 0" ("Megfon") conditions offer such that you simply can not refuse them. </p><p>  And this is true.  After all, the same Beeline for any conversation outside of Russia asks from 100 rubles per minute.  If you count the cost savings, you can understand why our current plan is called anti-crisis.  But there are some more rather important points to which it is necessary to pay attention.  What else is it about?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><h2>  Messages </h2><p>  The tariff "Go to 0" ("Megaphone") conditions provides quite favorable for messages.  True, there is one important point that should be taken into account. </p><p>  The fact is that with the connected package of additional services "SMS XXS" you will send absolutely all messages for free.  Otherwise, messages will cost you 1 ruble 60 kopecks.  Not so much when compared with other mobile operators.  True, this cost applies only to the home region.  Outside of it (in Russia) you will send SMS for 3 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff go to zero operator megaphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873400.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But "Megaphone" improved the tariff "Go to zero" relative to MMS messages.  Indeed, for one such message you will have to pay only 7 rubles.  The remaining operators require 10-15 rubles.  So the benefits are visible to the naked eye.  But this is not all that is worth paying attention to.  The fact is that we still have one rather important point for a modern client.  What is it about? </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  The tariff "Go to zero" (operator "Megaphone") also offers us rather sparing conditions for accessing the Internet from your mobile device.  Indeed, it is now very difficult to imagine a modern user without access to the World Wide Web. </p><p>  True, here, as in many other cases, there are two options for the development of events.  The first is a connection with an additional service package.  It is called "Internet XS."  If you have one, then access to the network from a mobile phone will cost you nothing.  You already pay for it (for a connected service package).  Its cost, by the way, ranges from 150 to 250 rubles. </p><p>  The second option is the lack of this package.  The tariff conditions ‚ÄúSwitch to 0‚Äù (‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù) offer to give 9 rubles 90 kopecks for 1 megabyte of data.  In fact, this is not as much as it might seem at first glance.  Indeed, MTS, for example, asks for 12 rubles for a similar service.  It seems to be not such a big difference, but the benefits are huge.  And precisely for all of the above items, our current cellular plan is called anti-crisis. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff go to zero from the megaphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873401.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Pleasant surprises </h2><p>  There are several more important, interesting and profitable surprises regarding the tariff plan under consideration.  The thing is that there is no <span>monthly fee in it.</span>  That is, it is enough just to maintain the balance of the mobile phone in the ‚Äúplus‚Äù to stay in touch.  Of course, this is all under the condition that you will have enough 20 minutes a day of free conversations with other Megafon subscribers. </p><p>  In addition, the cost of switching to the tariff "Switch to zero" from "Megaphone" is 0 rubles.  In other words, the service is free.  But there is one small condition: your account must have at least 200 rubles.  They will not go anywhere - you can use them in the future. </p><p>  As you can see, everything is pretty profitable.  However, if some other mobile operator dominates in your environment, it would be better to look for an alternative from him.  Usually everyone has an analogue of the tariff plan considered today. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  Well, now it's time to talk a little bit about how you can get the ‚ÄúGo to Zero‚Äù tariff on your mobile phone.  The idea can be implemented in several fairly simple steps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone improved tariff go to zero" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873402.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The first option is a visit to the nearest office of a mobile operator with a request to change your tariff.  Or even purchase a new number from Megafon.  This is far from the most suitable and popular method. </p><p>  The second way is to connect using SMS messages.  On your mobile phone, type ‚Äú2‚Äù in the text of the message, and then simply send it to 000146. Now you can wait for the notification response.  If all conditions are met (namely, a positive balance of more than 200 rubles), you will be informed that you have successfully changed the tariff plan. </p><p>  In addition, you can use the official page "Megaphone" and the so-called personal account.  Log in to the site, go to the "Rates" section and select "Go to zero" there.  Now click on this line - you will see a list of possible actions.  Select "Connect" there and wait a while.  Then it remains to confirm the actions and, of course, wait for the notification.  That's all.  As you can see, dealing with the connection is pretty easy.  And the tariff "Go to 0" ("Megaphone"), the conditions of which we reviewed today, will help you to always be in touch. </p>
