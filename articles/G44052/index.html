  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Two-burner electric stove is the dream of a small kitchen</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Beautiful and practical, the electric induction cooker has a whole range of functions.  For all its merits, it has also significantly fallen in price over the time elapsed since its appearance on the market.  Today it is not much more expensive than its friends, glass-ceramic plates. </p><p>  The newly acquired <span>electric</span> induction <span>cooker</span> , one way or another, takes some time to get used to, you have to adapt to each new product.  Find out how it can bake and bake, how to bake the top of the stove, how much more convenient it is to put a baking sheet and so on. </p><p>  The design and size of my home appliance called a two-burner electric stove is so convenient that it is pleasant to everyone and takes up very little space.  Over the long years of coexistence, we became friends.  The bake is excellent, compact, it takes up very little space in a small miniature kitchen, you can put it anywhere, almost on the windowsill. </p><p>  <strong>The principle of operation of the induction cooker and the choice of dishes</strong> </p><p>  There is a two-burner induction-type electric stove, creating an electromagnetic field.  Hot plates do not heat up.  This property of induction cookers is used by sellers in stores when they put paper between the dishes and the burner and turn on the stove.  It is impossible to burn such a burner, because the bottom and contents of the pan are heated.  Such a two-burner electric stove is very convenient if elderly people live with you and have small children, since the stoves are completely safe.  A high-frequency current is passed through a copper coil, which heats the bottom of the pan. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Plates on the foreign market appeared more than thirty years ago, but the first buyers were surprised at the high price and an incomprehensible principle of action.  Now that everyone has appreciated its merits, and prices have decreased significantly, <strong> </strong>  stove <strong> </strong>  You can choose at a very reasonable price.  It is quite possible to get used to the fact that aluminum and <span>non-metal</span> pans are unsuitable on it, especially since beautiful metal dishes are on sale. </p><p>  <strong>Induction cooker features</strong> </p><p>  The conversion of electricity to heat takes place very quickly, which saves electricity, this two-burner stove compares favorably with its friends, electric stoves.  Most induction cookers have a ‚Äúpower transfer‚Äù function (Booster), when for ten minutes you can transfer power from one burner to another adjacent one.  The cooking zones on the stoves are grouped in pairs, where there is a leader - the main burner and the dependent one. </p><p>  Such a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù two-burner electric stove will not only save electricity, but also keep your home safe.  She simply will not be able to turn on if she does not put metal dishes.  The two-burner induction hob is automatically switched off if less than 70% of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãits burner is covered with the bottom of the pan, and these percentages do not refer to the burner itself, but to the surface of the material under it. </p><p>  The modern market is filled with models from various well-known companies such as Kromax Endever IP-23 and De Dietrich, DTIM1000C and Ardo, BEKO and De Luxe, Siemens ET 375 MF 11E and Electrolux, Hotpoint-Ariston and Gorenje, Kaiser and NORD.  The Russian market is represented by the brands of plates Hephaestus and Darina. </p><p>  <strong>We consider the advantages</strong> </p><p>  The main advantages of induction cookers </p><ul><li>  A surface that does not burn. </li><li>  Minimum temperature deviations during operation. </li><li>  Heating power with an accuracy of 20 degrees. </li><li>  Conservation of electricity. </li><li>  Fire safety at an unattainable height. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Installation of induction cookers</strong> </p><p>  The plate can be connected in any version: one, two or three phases.  If your stove is single-phase, the installation of the electric stove is as follows: it is connected to a power outlet in three contacts with a three-wire wire (cross section 4 mm).  A circuit breaker is installed on the electrical panel.  Connection of two and three-phase options differ only in the type and cross-section of the wire. </p>
