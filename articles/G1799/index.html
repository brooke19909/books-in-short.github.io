Resorts such as Sousse, Hammamet, Mahdia, literally transformed.  An attractive feature of Tunisia as a tourist destination is that in this country the European way of life is very organically combined with Moorish exoticism.  In this article we will talk about the hotel Neptunia Beach 3 *.  It is located near the city of Monastir, in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSkanes.  Despite its modest three stars, this hotel is on the first line.  What other advantages (and maybe even disadvantages) does the Neptune Beach Hotel have?  Feedback from tourists helped us analyze and compile a brief overview.  We hope you find the information below helpful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neptunia Beach 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1516131.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel Neptunia Beach 3 * </h2><p>  Tunisia, Monastir, Skanes - such a simple address at this hotel.  Only five kilometers separate the hotel from Habib Bourguiba International Airport.  The city of Monastir very wisely solved the problem of the influx of tourists and the preservation of Moorish authenticity.  For vacationers have allocated one of the sand spit.  She bears the name Skanes.  The long and narrow space is filled with hotels lined up orderly along the sea.  Finding housing in Skanes is not a problem.  There are hotels from the most modest to the most prestigious.  Hotel Neptunia Skanes Beach 3 * is located in the heart of the resort area.  Nearby are shops, cafes, restaurants, night clubs.  And for exotic you can go to the old Monastir - there goes a city bus (number 52).  If you want to drive around Tunisia in order to get to know this colorful country with a special flavor and great past, then there is the Les Hotels station (Hotels) three kilometers from the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neptunia Beach 3 (Tunisia)" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1516118.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, budget hotels cannot afford to have large territories.  But the Neptunia Beach 3 * hotel has a special feature.  It is connected to the sister hotel, Ramada Liberty Resort.  It is on the second line, across the road.  Thus, in the territory of two hotels there is already where to roam.  Guests of both hotels can use the general infrastructure of the complex.  The area at the Neptunia Beach Hotel is very well-groomed, green.  Guests are accommodated in a snow-white three-story building.  Its architecture combines modern European and <span>Moorish styles.</span>  All rooms on the upper floors have balconies, and those located in the basement of the building have a terrace.  Between the hull and the sea are swimming pools, tennis courts, an aqua park.  Quite a vast space is allocated under the sun terrace.  The hotel grounds open directly to the sandy beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neptunia Beach 3 Monastir" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1516113.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where guests are accommodated </h2><p>  In the Neptunia Beach 3 * hotel (Monastir) there are only one hundred and two rooms.  A single glance at the imposing length of the three-story building will be enough to determine that the guest rooms are very spacious.  The rooms are divided into two categories - double standard and "family room".  The latter are designed to accommodate four to six people.  The standards can be ordered either two twin beds, or one matrimonial.  Almost all rooms have their own private balcony with two armchairs.  The rooms are very stylishly decorated, everything sets them up for a comfortable stay.  The facilities for tourists also liked.  Each room category has a flat-screen cable TV.  It is on the wall and does not take up space in the bedroom.  More reviews mention a large mirror with a ottoman and a table in front of it.  The air conditioner is controlled by an individual remote control, you can adjust the temperature to your liking.  In the corner is a small refrigerator.  The bathroom has either a bathtub or a shower, but there is always a hairdryer, a set of towels and hygiene items.  The only drawback of the tourists called a small number of outlets.  There are only two of them - in the bathroom and in the bedroom.  Therefore, you need to take a tee with you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neptunia Beach 3 Tunisia Monastir" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1516109.jpg" width="600"></div>

Sometimes violent companies and drunken shelter under the windows can poison the whole vacation even in the most beautiful hotel.  But, according to reviews, the hotel Neptunia Beach 3 * rest mainly the French (quiet couples with children), Germans (mostly pensioners), Poles, Czechs, Ukrainians.  For weekends, a group of Tunisians can call at the hotel on a weekend program.  But even then, except for the kids frolicing on the water slides of the water park, nothing spoils the bucolic mood and quiet, relaxing holiday.  If you are young and thirsty for adventure, tourists recommend going to Sousse.  This Tunisian resort is known for its vibrant evening life.  On the sandy spit Skanes, you can also find entertainment.  And in the hotel the animation team will try to diversify your leisure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neptunia Skanes Beach 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1516114.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to feed at the hotel </h2><p>  For a long time, the European food system dominated in hotels in Tunisia: breakfast, maximum - half board.  But the desire to attract mass tourists prevailed.  And now, in many hotels in Tunisia, including Neptunia Beach 3 *, a parallel all inclusive program has been introduced.  Therefore, hotel guests go in different color bracelets.  For those who paid half-board, drinks at dinner are paid, and in the bars they also, of course, are not served like that.  It should be said that the Tunisian all-inclusive system has its own nuances.  Food is served at the restaurant on schedule.  We slept in breakfast (from half past six to ten) - your problems.  But you will not stay hungry.  From ten o'clock a brunch is available, but in a truncated form: only drinks and pastries.  Lunch is held from half past twelve to 2.30 p.m., and dinner from 6.30 p.m. to 9 p.m.  In addition to the main restaurant, the hotel has a pizzeria.  There you can eat from three to five hours.  You can have a drink in three bars to choose from: in the lobby, by the pool or right on the beach.  There is also an a la carte restaurant at the Neptunia Beach Hotel (which is unusual for three stars).  In it, hotel guests can dine once for free from seven to nine when booking a table in advance at the reception.  This restaurant specializes in grills and barbecue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Neptunia Beach 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1516111.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach, pools, water park </h2><p>  Hotel Neptunia Beach 3 * stands right on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  The beach at the hotel is not fenced, but still guarded.  Sunbeds and umbrellas are free and always available, despite the fact that guests of the Ramada Liberty Resort Hotel are also entitled to use this zone of the coast.  The natural beach is covered with sand, there are no stones, and the depth grows gradually, which is good for bathing kids.  True, sometimes the north wind drives algae into the lagoon, but the beach is regularly cleaned.  Camels walk along the coast, there is an opportunity to ride them for one and a half dollars.  And, of course, the typical entertainment for sea resorts is also present: catamarans, skis, kites, ‚Äúbananas‚Äù, etc. If you want adrenaline, welcome to the water park.  Water slides for hotel guests are absolutely free.  The hotel also has a spacious swimming pool with a children's section.  It is surrounded by a spacious sun terrace, where there are also enough sun loungers under umbrellas. </p><h2>  Hotel services </h2><p>  Neptunia Beach 3 * reviews are often referred to as spa hotels.  It features a sauna and <span>a hammam steam bath</span> .  A lot of attention is paid to entertaining guests.  There is a mini-club for children, where you can bring your child absolutely free.  And adults from morning until late evening are entertained by a separate team of animators.  They charge, organize team games, and then show all kinds of shows.  Sometimes evening groups are attracted to professional groups of songs and dances.  And in the adjacent hotel "Ramada Liberty Resort" there is a night club "Cosmos".  The hotel has free parking and a soft-covered children's playground.  In the storage room you can leave your luggage at the late check-out or if the room is not yet ready to accept you.  At the reception, which, by the way, works around the clock, you can take everything you need to play table tennis.  The hotel has a travel agency. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Tourists urge not to sit all day long in the walls of the Neptunia Beach 3 * hotel.  Tunisia is too beautiful and picturesque country to devote the whole vacation to a beach holiday.  To comprehend the mysterious soul of the East, go to the nearby city of Monastir.  You should see the medieval Ribat fortress and reservoirs for salt evaporation, where flocks of pink flamingos can often be found.  Through Skanes passes the road connecting Monastir and Sousse.  Not only bus lounges scurry along it, but also tuk-tuks and horse-drawn carts.  In addition to the real railway that connects Monastir with the big <span>cities of Tunisia,</span> there is also a separate branch called the ‚Äúmetro du Sahel‚Äù.  It runs electric trains between Sousse and Mahdia, making stops in countless villages on the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neptunia Beach 3 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1516117.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Neptunia Beach 3 * (Tunisia): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists liked the location of the hotel in the heart of Skanes and its common area with another hotel.  Spacious rooms with high ceilings and comfortable furniture did not cause any complaints.  Nutrition reviews described as very good, varied and high quality.  Guests liked the pools, water park and beach, especially the fact that there are many free sunbeds everywhere.  Animators do not speak Russian.  But for aerobics or for playing basketball, this is not very important.  And children easily overcome the language barrier by playing with peers from other countries.  The only drawback of the hotel tourists called a small number of outlets in the rooms. </p>
