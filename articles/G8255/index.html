Her wedding with Emperor Mohammed Reza Pahlavi on the eve of 1960 was perhaps the most famous event of the year for the world press.  Her reign lasted exactly 20 years and was interrupted by the Islamic Revolution.  After that, the entire royal family was forced to wander around the world until President Ronald Reagan invited the family of Mohammed Pahlavi to the States where they still live. </p>

    <h2>  Farah Pahlavi: biography.  early years </h2><p>  The future Empress of Iran was born in 1938 in the north-west of Iran, in the city of Tabriz.  Her father, Sohrab Diba, belonged to a noble aristocratic family.  His father at the end of the nineteenth century was the ambassador of Iran to the Russian Empire.  He received a brilliant education at the famous <span>Paris University of the Sorbonne.</span>  In addition, Sohrab Diba graduated from the prestigious Saint-Cyr Military Academy and served as a senior officer of the Iranian army.  His wife, Faride Khutbi, was also from a noble family.  She was born on the shores of the Caspian Sea, in the province of Gilan.  After marriage, she and her husband settled in a luxurious villa on the server of Tehran.  There Farah Pahlavi was born - the last empress of Iran.  The first 9 years in the life of the girl were simply idyllic.  Parents loved each other and <span>did not cherish souls</span> in their baby.  In 1948, when Pahlavi Farah (Diba) was not yet 10 years old, her father died. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Youth </h2><p>  Soon after the death of the breadwinner, the seed began to experience financial difficulties, they had to leave the luxurious villa and settle with relatives.  Nevertheless, Faride tried to give her daughter a truly aristocratic upbringing and education.  The future empress Pahlavi Farah attended an Italian school in Tehran, then she continued her studies at the French school named after Joan of Arc, and then entered the Lyceum of Razi.  In all schools, the girl studied simply superbly, and also engaged in active social activities.  Farriha was also fond of sports and was even the captain of the basketball school team.  However, in high school, the girl just decided for herself that she wants to become an architect.  In order to obtain higher education, the young Iranian went to Paris, to the Higher School of Architecture.  The girl was fluent in her native Farsi, as well as two international languages ‚Äã‚Äã- English and French. </p><h2>  Meeting with Emperor Mohammed Pahlavi </h2><p>  In 1959, the young Shah of Iran paid an official visit to France, and a reception was organized at the embassy of the country on this occasion.  Farah Pahlavi (a photo of her from this reception was later published in the ‚Äúsecular chronicle‚Äù column) was invited to the event, and here she, as a noble Iranian and a student at a prestigious university, was introduced to the shah himself.  From Paris, Mohammed returned to Tehran not alone, but with the beautiful Farah.  Soon after, their engagement was announced, and a wedding day was scheduled.  Since then, Farah Pahlavi has come to the attention of the press around the world.  By the way, some publications of that time described another version of the emperor‚Äôs acquaintance with his future wife.  According to these publications, when the shah was 39 years old and he had no heir, Mohammed ordered a physical culture parade with hundreds of young and beautiful girls to be organized in order to find a bride.  In the first year, he could not make a choice.  The next time the procession was organized again, and then among the crowd he saw a beautiful girl and immediately realized that she was the future Empress of Iran.  Farah Pahlavi was happy that the choice fell on her. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Farah Pahlavi" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/1257378.jpg" width="577"></div>

For a long time the whole world spoke about this wedding.  Before marrying Farah, Mohammed had already been married twice, but, since he had no heir, he decided to try his luck again.  As time has shown, the third attempt was the most successful: the couple had four children - two princesses and two princes.  Pahlavi Farah, nee Diba, in 1967, that is, 8 years after marriage, was crowned as the shahban (empress) of Iran.  The first two spouses of Mohammed did not receive this title.  Farah was also titled as regent.  This was nonsense, since before her, no oriental woman was awarded such a title. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Farah Pahlavi Biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/1257377.jpg" width="276"></div>

    <h2>  Farah Pahlavi - the last empress of Iran (1967-1979) </h2><p>  Soon after his marriage in 1960, Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlavi and Farah gave birth to an heir - Reza Cyrus.  The people of Iran rejoiced.  Three years later, they had a beautiful daughter Farangiz, another three years later - the son of Ali Riza, and the last, fourth, was a charming princess Leila.  She was born in 1970.  Thus, the first ten years of marriage, Empress Pahlavi Farah was engaged in purely family affairs: she gave birth, raised and raised children.  However, after the birth of her last fourth daughter, she gradually began to delve into the social life of her country.  Her husband was a very advanced ruler oriented towards Europe and the West, and he was rapidly engaged in the modernization of Iran.  A lot of effort was put into developing the oil industry.  His wife, in turn, became a trendsetter and patron of cultural life. </p>

    <h2>  Rebirth </h2><p>  <span>Iranian women,</span> following their empress, gradually became involved in social life.  Art forms such as ballet and dancing began to flourish in the country.  It has become fashionable to send not only boys, but also girls to study abroad.  The schools introduced an in-depth study of foreign languages.  The young empress was not limited to reforms only in the capital and other major cities of the country.  She constantly visited the provinces, tried to identify the problems of the rural population and give them a solution.  Across the country, the quality of medical and educational services has improved. </p><p>  Her greatest merit was the cultural development of the country.  She contributed to the return to Iran of almost all historical values ‚Äã‚Äãand shah relics that were stored in museums in other countries.  After that, Farah founded the largest historical museum not only in Iran, but throughout Asia.  She was also a women's rights activist.  She dreamed of seeing them more educated and liberated.  Iranians began to drive cars, dress beautifully and fashionably, do science.  In addition, thanks to the Iranian empress, the custom of polygamy was abolished in the country.  Women received the same rights as men.  And this was a great progress for a strict Muslim country, which was Iran.  Every year, thanks to her activities, the empress won the sympathy of an increasing number of citizens of her country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Farah Pahlavi the last empress of Iran 1967 1979" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/1257380.jpg" width="577"></div>

    <h2>  World recognition </h2><p>  In the West, the Pahlavi couple was also very popular.  They were recognized as one of the most beautiful couples in the Middle East.  Increasingly, European monarchs and rulers made official visits to Iran.  A significant event for the country was the visit of the Princess and Prince of Monaco - Grace and Rainier Grimaldi.  Former Hollywood film actress beauty Grace came to the reception in a dress from Christian Dior and a diamond diadem, but Farah Pahlavi was not inferior to her in her elegance and regality.  The whole world press wrote about this.  The famous Soviet opera singer Muslim Magomayev, when meeting with Farah, was simply struck by her beauty and wrote that she was dazzling, that she had the velvet eyes of a Persian and a pearl smile! </p><h2>  The collapse of the empire </h2><p>  In 1979, an Islamic revolution took place in Iran, the khan was overthrown from his throne, and the empire came to an end.  Mohammed Riza Pahlavi with his wife and four children were forced to flee the country and found refuge in Egypt.  Later, King Marroco Hassan II invited them to his palace.  A few months later, unable to withstand the collapse of his empire, Shah Mohammed Riesa died, and 2 years after that, the Empress Dowager, with the children at the invitation of US President Reagan, went to the States, where she still lives. </p><h2>  In the States </h2><p>  Once in the American capital, all the children of the royal family received a brilliant education at the best universities in the country.  Leila Pahlavi became interested in sculpture and sculpted a bust of her crowned father.  Being similar to her mother, the beautiful Leila became the favorite model of Italian couturier Valentino.  However, this cooperation and involvement in show business led to the fact that the girl fell ill with anorexia and depression, was treated for a long time in various clinics, but soon died of an overdose of drugs.  <span>Iranian princess</span> Leila was buried in 2001 at the Passy Paris cemetery, next to her maternal grandmother.  The eldest son of Reza Cyrus, whom Iranian immigrants continue to call the Shah, today lives in Washington.  The youngest son, unfortunately, committed suicide.  This happened in 2013.  The reasons for this act are still not fully understood. </p>
