At this time, the choice of tourist destinations increases markedly, but at the same time, the cost of trips, flights is still low.  The resorts of Turkey, Thailand, Vietnam, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Israel, Greece and many other countries are ready to meet tourists with warm sun and beautiful weather.  Where to relax in May, which direction is better to choose, we will consider in this article. </p><h2>  Thailand </h2><p>  In late April, the main resorts in Thailand (Phuket and Pattaya) officially begin the low season.  And this means that tourist trips to these destinations are reduced in price.  But this does not mean that you should not go on vacation to Thailand in May.  Just the opposite.  The weather at this time is comfortable for relaxation, there are rains, but most often at night.  The sea is so warm that you do not want to leave it at all.  At the same time, there are very few people on the beaches; prices in coastal cafes and restaurants are noticeably lower than in high season.  A great option where you can relax inexpensively in May. </p><p>  But if you still have doubts and are afraid of the possibility of rain, then you should choose the island of Koh Samui for relaxation.  The weather here is excellent and the chance of rain is almost zero. </p><h2>  Turkey </h2><p>  Another option where you can relax in May, especially for those who go on vacation with their children or simply do not like to bother about finding food.  Most Turkish hotels operate on the All Inclusive system.  So, the cost of the permit will include all the main costs: flight, accommodation, meals, insurance.  Turkey is a place where you can inexpensively relax in May abroad. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  True, if you really want to swim in the sea, it is better to choose the second half of May.  At the beginning of the month, the water in the Mediterranean still does not have time to warm up to a comfortable bathing temperature.  But most hotels have swimming pools, often heated, which means that you won’t have to stay without bathing. </p><p>  In May, all Turkish resorts have a very pleasant temperature, during the day the air heats up to + 25 °  - + 27 ° , but at night it is cool, on average up to + 17 °  - + 19 ° . </p><div class="photo" data-original="vacationtime.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coast of Turkey" class="if uuid-2272051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2272051.jpg"></div><h2>  Vietnam </h2><p>  Where to relax in Vietnam in May?  It is better to choose the resort town of Nha Trang as a place to relax.  Rains in Nha Trang in May are very rare, but the sea temperature reaches + 29 ° .  You could even say that this is the best place where you can relax at sea in May in Vietnam. </p><p>  For those who like to relax more extreme, Fantiet resort is perfect.  In May, there are big waves at Phan Thiet, which attracts fans of surfing and windsurfing. </p><h2>  Spain </h2><p>  Spain is especially popular in May.  Despite the fact that the air temperature barely exceeds twenty degrees, many tourists get a beautiful uniform tan.  However, swimming in the sea, especially in the first half of the month, is unlikely to succeed, since the water has not yet warmed up to a comfortable temperature. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Spain attracts many tourists not only with a beach holiday, but also with a large selection of attractions and excursions.  And at the beginning of May there are several holidays in the country: May 2 - City Day in Madrid, May 3 - "Dance of the Peasants" in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and from May 7 the Big Festival of the Middle Ages begins in Ibiza. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kakprosto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Spain in May" class="if uuid-2272053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2272053.jpg"></div><h2>  China </h2><p>  One of the most famous Chinese resorts, Hainan Island will welcome its guests with bright sunshine, warm sea and excellent weather.  In May, the island may experience slight precipitation, but the average temperature reaches + 32 ° C. </p><p>  As for the sea, it is warm in Hainan all year round.  The most popular resort in Hainan is the city of Sanya.  Three gulfs are stretched along the sea: Sanya, Dadonghai and Yalunvan.  In the area of ​​these bays, tourist areas are located and most of the hotels are concentrated. </p><p>  Many travelers choose Hainan not only to swim and sunbathe, but also to improve their health.  After all, Chinese medicine is known throughout the world.  In Hainan, cardiovascular diseases, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal diseases are successfully treated.  Various methods are used, ranging from massages to acupuncture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="azialand.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hainan in May" class="if uuid-2272048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2272048.jpg"></div><h2>  Israel </h2><p>  Another option where you can relax in May is Israel.  Resorts of the Mediterranean and the Dead Seas will welcome travelers.  And not only those who dream of a beach holiday, but also those who came for an excursion holiday. </p><p>  In places, the temperature rises to 30 ° C, but due to cool nights and a refreshing sea breeze it is easy to breathe.  Perhaps one of the best places where you can relax at sea abroad in May is very good. </p><p>  <span>In May, Israel</span> celebrates a holiday - Independence Day.  On this day, festive fireworks, a demonstration of military equipment, parades, and concert venues are held throughout Israel.  National flags are set everywhere on this day.  The holiday is very spectacular and massive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.votpusk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Dead Sea" class="if uuid-2272060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2272060.jpg"></div><h2>  Greece </h2><p>  May is the beginning of the tourist season in Greece.  Many beaches are already open for swimming, and the sea temperature is quite comfortable for swimming.  But besides this, Greece is also a country with a rich history and culture.  May 18 is the day when all museums are open to all comers. </p><p>  In early May, the Greeks celebrate workers' Day on a grand scale, and in some cities the Flower Festival is held, which is dedicated to Demeter. </p><p>  Thus, a vacation in Greece in May will be full of entertainment, but you will not have to refuse a beach vacation. </p><h2>  Montenegro </h2><p>  Located along the coast of the Adriatic Sea, the beautiful country of Montenegro is famous for its resorts.  In May in Montenegro, everything is ready for the opening of the holiday season.  Cafes and restaurants, clubs are opening.  The hotels are ready to welcome guests again.  But there are still few tourists at this time, so you can save a lot on your trip. </p><p>  The average temperature on the Adriatic coast reaches an average of 21 ° C-25 ° C, but slight precipitation is possible at the very beginning of the month.  Although this does not interfere with a comfortable rest.  But the sea has not warmed up enough, and water procedures will have to wait until the end of May. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pogoda.turtella.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro in May" class="if uuid-2272042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2272042.jpg"></div><h2>  Bulgaria </h2><p>  The climate in Bulgaria is very similar to Montenegrin.  In May, the weather will be comfortable for visiting excursions and attractions, but a full-fledged beach holiday, most likely, will not work.  If the air temperature in places and warms up to 21 ° C, then the sea is still quite cool.  And the nights are still cold enough. </p><p>  In May, Bulgaria hosts a festival dedicated to Rosa as the most beautiful of flowers.  The holiday is quite colorful and lasts three days. </p><p>  Bulgaria is one of the great options where it is possible to have a cheap vacation in May abroad without any problems. </p><h2>  Holidays in Russia in May </h2><p>  Somewhere in mid-May, the season begins on the Black Sea coast.  However, tourists at this time are in no hurry to visit domestic resorts.  Although it is warm during the day, the nights are still cool, but swimming in the sea is almost impossible because of the low temperatures. </p><p>  Nevertheless, for those travelers who go more for emotions than for a “seal” vacation, May is an ideal time.  First of all, you can significantly save on flights and accommodation.  Another nice bonus is a visit to the most interesting excursions, museums, and attractions.  After all, the tourist flow in May is so low that you can visit everything yourself and enjoy the beautiful without any rush.  Which is almost impossible in the summer. </p><p>  Resorts of Crimea, Sochi, Gelendzhik, Anapa will welcome their guests in May. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetakrim.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea in May" class="if uuid-2272044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2272044.jpg"></div><h2>  May Holidays </h2><p>  A holiday in May is a great time to relax.  However, European destinations this month are more suitable for active excursion holidays, although the weather can contribute to the beach.  As for holidays in Asian countries, many tour operators in May reduce vacation prices, since this period is considered a low season.  But as a rule, the weather at this time is excellent, although at night the rainfall reminds of itself. </p><p>  Where is it better to relax in May?  The choice is yours. </p>
