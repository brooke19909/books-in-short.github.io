Stunning in its beauty nature, cheerful, friendly people, unforgettable cuisine, interesting traditions and Latin American exotic attract many thousands of tourists here.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôve already been to this country or are going to visit it for the first time, you should be interested in how long it takes to fly to Brazil from Moscow.  And this is a very practical solution - to inquire before the start of the trip the number of hours that will have to be passed on board.  After all, knowing exactly the time of the flight, you can stock up not only with patience, but also with literature, upload a couple of films to your laptop, or find another occupation to your liking.  But, of course, I want to get to Brazil soon.  In this article we will consider all flight options between Moscow and various cities of Brazil.  And it will be up to you to decide which one to choose. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How much to fly to Brazil from Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2202986.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What affects travel time? </h2><p>  At first glance, it seems that the question of how much to fly to Brazil from Moscow is very simple.  We look at the map the distance that separates the capital of Russia from the Latin American country - for example, to its northeast coast closest to Europe.  Divide this distance in kilometers by seven hundred.  It is with this speed - 700 km / h - that modern liners fly.  The resulting figure will be equal to the time on board.  But that‚Äôs all in theory.  But in practice, you need to take into account another 20 minutes of gaining altitude by the plane and the same time that is required for a smooth landing.  And most importantly, the point of arrival.  If three airports in Moscow are located at such a distance from each other that this can affect the travel time by plus / minus ten minutes, then the hubs of Brazil's cities are separated by hundreds or even a thousand kilometers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The speed of movement is also affected by weather conditions (mainly headwind or tailwind) and the air corridor that ground controllers provide.  But the main factor affecting how long it takes to fly to Brazil from Moscow is the time spent at transit airports.  After all, there is simply no direct flight connecting Moscow with any city in this Latin American state.  Well, let's see how to get to the country of your dreams as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Time difference Moscow brazil" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2202984.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How and how much fly to Brazil from Moscow? </h2><p>  So, we decided: the time in the journey is significantly affected, first of all, by the expectation of an adjacent flight.  Even if the passenger does not leave the neutral zone of the airport, landing a liner, approaching a gangway or sleeves for passengers to leave, waiting at the gate, launching travelers into the cabin and taking off will add an extra hour to your trip.  And this is provided that between adjacent flights the temporary pocket will be minimal.  Which airline to trust to cover the distance Moscow - Brazil?  There is a difference, but it concerns mainly the ticket price.  Whether you fly with Swiss Air landing in Zurich, with Iberia (Madrid Docking Airport), with KLM (Amsterdam) or with Air France (Paris), your journey will last from 17 to 20 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Difference Moscow Brazil" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2202992.jpg"></div>

Faster to get to Brasilia via Lisbon.  After 16 hours, you step on the Latin American land.  Half an hour more will take a trip with a dock in Paris.  Rio de Janeiro is separated from the capital of Russia 11,550 kilometers - 350 km more than between Moscow and Brazil.  The flight time, respectively, will increase to 17 hours, if you choose Paris as the transfer point.  You will travel 30 minutes longer in case of transit in Madrid.  Get ready to spend about a day on the road if you want to get to know the airports of Rome or New York.  The Brazilian city of Recife is closest to Europe.  The distance from it to Moscow is 9700 kilometers.  It is best to fly to this resort through Frankfurt.  Then you will spend seventeen hours on the road.  And the <span>Brazilian</span> city, the most remote from <span>Moscow,</span> is Sao Paulo.  The distance that the liner will have to cover is 11,850 kilometers.  Therefore, the shortest trip (through Paris, Rome or Amsterdam) will last 18 hours.  All other options (Istanbul, Miami, Casablanca) will stretch your path for a day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Time between Moscow and Brazil" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2202996.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Time difference Moscow-Brazil </h2><p>  Naturally, a country lying on the opposite end of the globe lives in a different time zone.  And not in one, but in four, since the size of this Latin American territory is not at all small.  In addition, in the south of Brazil there is a switch to daylight saving time.  So it‚Äôs hard to decide how many hours you should turn the hands of your chronometers back.  Let's see what is the time difference between Moscow and Brasilia.  In winter, or rather, from the third Sunday of October to the end of February, it is five hours, and in the remaining seasons - six.  Most of the country lives on capital time. </p>
