    <p>  <span><span><span>The</span></span></span> <span><span><span>sun loungers and umbrellas on Surgin Beach are mainly owned by beach cafes.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>If desired, in one of these institutions at a low cost, you can rent both an ordinary sunbed and orthopedic with a towel.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>In addition to the cafe, on the coastline there are many clubs with swimming pools and beautiful recreation areas.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>Sargin beach is located in a quiet bay.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Therefore, the water in the sea is always very warm.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The landscapes are surrounded by magnificent, magnificent and also very contrasting.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Century-old spruce trees by the beach are adjacent to huge spreading palm trees.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Features of rest in Chong-Tahl </h2><p>  The tourist infrastructure in the city near the hotel is also very well developed.  Many guests of Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort 4 * recommend having lunch and dinner in a cafe located on the right side of the hotel, closer to the sea.  The dishes here are quite tolerable, but the prices do not bite. </p><p>  On the very shore of the sea, according to many tourists, Pla Seafood stands out.  This cafe is located on the left side of Surgin Beach.  This place is praised mainly for its pleasant atmosphere and good menu.  Many torches are lit here in the evenings.  As a result, a very romantic and cozy atmosphere is created in the cafe.  Food prices in this establishment are slightly higher than in ordinary Thai canteens, but not by much. </p><p>  At night in Choeng Thale, you can have fun at Catch Club.  This institution is considered perhaps the most stylish and romantic in all of Phuket.  Girls can come here in a cocktail or evening dress.  Men, of course, should also dress better. </p><h2>  Service Reviews </h2><p>  Opinion about the attitude of the hotel staff to their guests among the tourists was quite good.  Hotel staff are polite and helpful.  The duties of their staff are also very good.  Maids are often cleaned in rooms, shampoo and shower gel are not forgotten to replenish. </p><p>  Some complaints about this hotel are only work respected.  Sometimes, unfortunately, you can see only one employee here.  At the same time, there are many guests at the hotel.  Therefore, it very often happens that the only administrator simply does not have time to serve everyone and a rather long queue forms at the counter. </p>

    <h2>  Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort 4 *: room reviews </h2><p>  Actually the rooms themselves in this hotel, despite the not too large area, most tourists like.  They are very well equipped.  The beds are comfortable, the bedding is clean and well ironed, no living creatures crawl around the premises, do not run and do not fly.  Air conditioning in the hotel is not particularly new, but it works quite quietly.  In some rooms, however, noise from external units is heard. </p><p>  Apartments <span><span><span>Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort 4 *</span></span></span> <span><span><span>deserved</span></span></span> certain complaints <span><span><span>only for the lack of a bath in the bathroom.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But the shower in the rooms works well, and many of our compatriots would still not take a bath in a public place.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  <span><span><span>In addition to a set of standard services,</span></span></span> <span><span><span>the</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort 4 *</span></span></span> <span><span><span>hotel</span></span></span> <span><span><span>(Thailand, Phuket)</span></span></span> <span><span><span>provides its guests with the opportunity to purchase some interesting excursion.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Phuket Island is really rich in sights.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>For example, here you can visit:</span></span></span> </p><ul><li><p>  <span><span><span>Natha Vari Hot Springs</span></span></span> </p></li><li><p>  <span><span><span>viewing platform "Kata-Karon";</span></span></span> </p></li><li><p>  <span><span><span>Ton Prai Waterfall, etc.</span></span></span> </p></li></ul><p>  Many guests of Thailand who have chosen Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort 4 * for their stay advise, among other things, to go to the large <span>Phuket Fantasea</span> amusement park located on Kamala Beach <span>.</span>  To come here, of course, is best with children.  The park is truly grandiose and covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 hectares.  Here tourists will find many attractions and enchanting shows.  The largest restaurant on the island of Phuket, Golden Kinari, also operates on the territory of the park.  At the entrance to this institution, a pond with <span>giant catfish is</span> equipped <span>.</span>  Dishes in the restaurant are served very high quality, tasty and not too expensive.  However, carrying food with you is strictly prohibited. </p>
