It is amazing what scale the creative process took, the whole depth of its content and the richness of forms.  For half a century, the cultural community has risen to a new level: multi-aspect, polyphonic, unique. </p><h2>  Background of the origin and cultural development of the "Golden Age" </h2><p>  The development of Russian culture in the first half of the 19th century was due to a high degree of national interests.  Humanitarian education, begun under Catherine the Second, gave an impetus to the development of education, the opening of many educational institutions and the expansion of opportunities for new knowledge. </p><p>  The borders of the state were expanded, on the territory of which about 165 different peoples lived with their customs and mentality.  The traditions of their predecessors were continued by new sailors and discoverers. </p><p>  The Russian-French war of 1812 influenced the formation of patriotic thought, moral values ‚Äã‚Äãof the Russian people.  <span>The artistic culture of</span> Russia in the first half of the 19th century attracted interest in the national identity that had strengthened in society. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian culture in the first half of the 19th century" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31647/704070.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the current political situation within the country did not give complete freedom for the implementation of all ideas in art.  The uprising of the Decembrists and the activities of secret societies forced the Russian emperors to impede the penetration of advanced thoughts into any cultural spheres. </p><h2>  The science </h2><p>  The improvement of public education reflected the culture of Russia in the first half of the 19th century.  Briefly, it can be called dual.  On the one hand, new educational institutions were opened, and on the other, strict censorship measures were introduced, for example, the lessons of philosophy were canceled.  In addition, universities and gymnasiums were constantly under the strict supervision of the Ministry of Education. </p><p>  Despite this, Russian culture in the first half of the 19th century is characterized by a great leap forward in the development of science. </p><h2>  Biology and medicine </h2><p>  The material about the animal and plant world that had accumulated by the beginning of the 19th century required rethinking and developing new theories.  This was done by Russian natural scientists K.M.  Baer, ‚Äã‚ÄãI.A.  Dvigubsky, I.E.  Uncle. </p><p>  The richest collections of plants and animals from different parts of the world were collected.  And in 1812, the opening of the Botanical Garden in the Crimea took place. </p><p>  His significant contribution to the development of medicine was made by N.I.  Pies.  Thanks to his dedicated work, the world has learned what military field surgery is. </p><h2>  Geology and Astronomy </h2><p>  With the beginning of the century, geology was waiting in the wings.  Its development covered all Russian lands. </p><p>  A significant achievement was the compilation of the first geological map of Russia in 1840.  Did it a research scientist N.I.  Koksharov. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Astronomy required careful and rigorous calculations and observations.  It took a lot of time.  The process was greatly facilitated when the Pulkovo Observatory was created in 1839. </p><h3></h3><h2>  Mathematics and physics </h2><p>  In mathematics, world-wide discoveries were made.  So, N.I.  Lobachevsky became famous for his "non-Euclidean geometry."  P.L.  Chebyshev substantiated the law of large numbers, and M.V.  Ostrogradsky was engaged in analytical and celestial mechanics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian culture in the first half of the 19th century" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31647/704068.jpg" width="556"></div>

    <p>  The first half of the 19th century can be called the golden time for physics, because the first electromagnetic telegraph (P.L. Schilling) was created, the result of the experience of electric lighting (V.V. Petrov) was obtained, the electric motor was invented (E.H. Lenz). </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  The artistic culture of Russia in the first half of the 19th century attracted considerable public interest.  The most important feature of its development was the rapid change of styles, as well as their combination. </p><p>  Classicism reigned in architecture until the 1840s.  Empire style can be recognized in many buildings of the two capitals, as well as in many regional centers that were formerly provincial cities. </p><p>  The construction of architectural ensembles is characteristic of this time.  For example, <span>Theater Square Moscow</span> or Senate <span>Square</span> in St. Petersburg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Bright representatives of this style gave rise to Russian culture in the first half of the 19th century.  Architecture was expressed in the works of A.D.  Zakharova, K.I.  Rossi, D.I.  Gilardi, O.I.  Beauvais. </p><p>  The empire was replaced by the Russian-Byzantine style in which the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, the Armory (architect K.A. Ton) were built. </p><h2>  Painting </h2><p>  For this period, painting is characterized by an interest in the personality of an ordinary person.  Artists depart from traditional biblical and mythological styles. </p><p>  <span>Classicism in painting</span> was introduced by Karl Bryullov, who in his paintings showed the heroism, dignity and greatness of the common man.  His most famous works are The Last Day of Pompeii, The Horsewoman, Self-Portrait, etc. </p><p>  The tragic fate befell the great painter A. A. Ivanov, the author of the grandiose work ‚ÄúThe Appearance of Christ to the People‚Äù.  He worked on it for more than 20 years.  And he died, never knowing what a brilliant triumph happened in this picture. </p><p>  The foundation of realism was laid by P. A. Fedotov, who made a splash in society with his genre paintings with social content.  Everyone knew his "Fresh Cavalier" or "Major Matchmaking." </p><h2>  Sculpture </h2><p>  The culture of Russia in the first half of the 19th century developed under the influence of the last war of 1812 with Napoleon.  It affected the sculpture.  The famous monument to Minin and Pozharsky, which stands on Red Square, artist I.P.  Martos sculpted in the midst of war. </p><p>  The development of Russian <span>monumental sculpture</span> would not have been possible without F.F.  Shchedrin, whose caryatids adorn the <span>buildings of the Admiralty.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian art culture in the first half of the 19th century" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31647/704069.jpg" width="515"></div>

    <p>  Among other prominent sculptors of the time were I.I.  Terebenev ("Poltava battle"), V.I.  Demut-Malinovsky, B.I.  Orlovsky (figure of an angel on the Alexander Column), etc. </p><h2>  Music </h2><p>  The culture of Russia experienced the enormous influence of the heroic past in the first half of the 19th century.  Music was influenced by folk tunes, as well as national themes.  These movements are reflected in the opera Ivan Susanin K.A.  Kavos, works by A.A.  Alyabyeva, A.E.  Varlamova. </p><p>  M.I.  Glinka was central to composers.  He established new traditions and discovered unprecedented genres.  The opera ‚ÄúLife for the Tsar‚Äù fully reflects the essence of the musician‚Äôs creativity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian culture in the first half of the 19th century briefly" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31647/704072.jpg" width="433"></div>

    <p>  Russian culture in the first half of the 19th century gave birth to yet another brilliant composer who introduced the genre of psychological drama into music.  This is A.S.  Dargomyzhsky and his great opera Mermaid. </p><h2>  Theater </h2><p>  The Russian theater opened up the imagination, practically abandoning the parade performances in the style of classicism.  Now romantic motives prevailed there, tragic plots of plays. </p><p>  One of the most famous representatives of the theatrical environment was P.S.  Mochalov, who played the roles of Hamlet and Ferdinand (according to Shakespeare). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian culture in the first half of the 19th century architecture" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31647/704066.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Reformer of Russian acting M.S.  Shchepkin was a native of serfs.  He submitted completely new ideas, thanks to which his roles were admired, and the Maly Theater of Moscow became the most popular place among the audience. </p><p>  The realistic style in the theater was generated by the works of A.S.  Pushkina, A.S.  Griboedova. </p><h2>  Literature </h2><p>  The most important social problems were reflected in the culture of Russia in the first half of the 19th century.  Literature strengthened <span>national identity,</span> referring to the historical past of the country.  An example of this is the <span>creative activity of</span> N.M.  Karamzin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian culture in the first half of the 19th century literature" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31647/704064.jpg" width="404"></div>

    <p>  Romanticism in literature was represented by such outstanding figures as V.A.  Zhukovsky, A.I.  Odoevsky, early A.S.  Pushkin.  The late stage of Pushkin‚Äôs work is realism.  ‚ÄúBoris Godunov‚Äù, ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äôs daughter‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Bronze Horseman‚Äù are inscribed in this direction.  In addition, M.Yu.  Lermontov created the ‚ÄúHero of our time‚Äù, which is an outstanding example of realism literature. </p><p>  Critical realism became the basis of N.V.  Gogol ("The Overcoat", "The Examiner"). </p><p>  Among other representatives of literature that influenced its formation, A.N.  Ostrovsky with his unusually realistic plays, I.S.  Turgenev, who devoted his attention to the theme of the serf village and nature, as well as D.V.  Grigorovich. </p><p>  Literature has made a significant contribution to the cultural development of Russia.  The first half of the 19th century was characterized by the formation of a modern literary language instead of the heavy and ornate language of the 18th century.  The creativity of writers and poets of this period became significant and influenced the further formation of not only Russian, but also world culture. </p><p>  Having absorbed and rethought the works of Russian and European civilizations, the culture of Russia in the first half of the 19th century created a strong foundation for the favorable development of science and art in the future. </p>
