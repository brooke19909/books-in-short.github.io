  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The creation of the USSR</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The creation of the USSR was, according to many historians, rather painful.  The country recently ended the Civil War, the consequences of which were rather severe.  The question of forming a single administrative-territorial structure arose very sharply. </p><p>  At that time, the RSFSR occupied about 92% of the entire territory of the state.  The population of this territory subsequently amounted to about 70% of the USSR.  The eight remaining percent of the area was occupied by the republics of Belarus, Ukraine, as well as the Transcaucasian Federation, which united Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan in the 22nd year.  In addition, in the east of the state, the <span>Far Eastern Republic</span> was formed <span>.</span>  Her management was carried out from Chita.  There were two republics in <span>Central Asia</span> at that time: Bukhara and Khorezm. </p><p>  Background of the creation of the USSR </p><p>  The country was worried about the consequences of the <span>Civil War.</span>  The creation of the USSR would make it possible to accumulate and direct available resources towards the restoration of the state.  This, in turn, would contribute to the development of the economy, national, cultural relations.  In addition, the creation of the USSR would allow to begin to get rid of shortcomings in the development of a number of republics.  It must be borne in mind that the territory of the state was surrounded by different countries, often hostile.  This fact had an important influence on the unification of the republics. </p><p>  History of the USSR </p><p>  To concentrate resources and strengthen the centralization of the management mechanism during the Civil War in June 1919, Ukraine, the RSFSR and Belarus joined in an alliance.  Thus, it became possible to unite all the armed forces and introduce a centralized command.  Moreover, delegates to government bodies were represented from each republic. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Along with this, the agreement on the union of these republics into a union provided for the re-subordination of certain republican branches of transport, finance and industry to the corresponding people's commissariats.  The new state formation went down in history under the name "contractual federation".  A feature of this association was that the Russian management bodies began to function as the sole representatives of the supreme <span>state power.</span>  And the republican communist parties were included in the RCP (b) as just regional party organizations. </p><p>  Soon, disagreements began between the Moscow control center and the republics.  The latter as a result of the association were deprived of the opportunity to make decisions on their own.  Along with this, the independence of the republics in the management industry was officially declared. </p><p>  The prerequisites for the emergence and development of the conflict were the uncertainties of the boundaries of central and republican powers.  In addition, often provoked sabotage adopted by central authorities and not finding understanding among the republican authorities in economic decisions. </p><p>  As a result, with the aim of radically refracting the situation, a commission was created, which included representatives of the republics.  Kuibyshev became its chairman.  Stalin was entrusted with the task of developing a project on the autonomy of the republics. </p><p>  By the middle of the 22nd year, six republics had been formed: Russian, Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Ukrainian.  In May 1922, a commission was formed "to clarify the relationship between Ukraine and Russia."  Subsequently, this issue was considered in relation to other republics. </p><p>  In December 1922, the First Congress of Soviets of the USSR was opened on December 30. </p><p>  The creation of the USSR, according to a number of researchers, had a beneficial effect on the development of various spheres of life (health, culture, education, and others).  The new state united about 185 nationalities and nationalities.  The process of unification into a multinational state did not contradict the interests of the peoples inhabiting the territory of the country.  Consolidation enabled the young power to occupy one of the leading places in the world geopolitical space. </p>
