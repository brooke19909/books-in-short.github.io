  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to check the temperature of a video card using programs?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many of us like to play computer games, because they are so beautiful and so accessible for every person who has at least some kind of computer, but not everyone knows what happens with the components at a time when some kind of graphical application is running on the device .  In this article we will talk in detail about such an important and useful skill, how to check the temperature of a video card using special applications.  The article is recommended not only to novice users of the Windows operating system, but also to avid gamers playing the whole day at their personal computer or laptop. </p><h2>  Risks of overheating a video card </h2><p>  If your school had computer science lessons, then you probably remember the teachers' stories about what computers were big before, and they were built on the basis of lamps that act as semiconductors.  However, the world is changing for the better every year, which is also accompanied by scientific and technological progress, but the greatest achievement of the twentieth century was the invention of silicon semiconductors, and their main feature was the extremely small size, in contrast to electronic lamps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.overclockers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water-cooled computer" class="if uuid-2332664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2332664.jpg"></div><p>  Everything has two sides, so lamps and transistors have one common feature - they heat up during operation.  All this is connected with the friction of atoms, which, at the request of the user, either move on or on.  So, integrated circuits are born, where arithmetic logic devices (ALUs), memory blocks, and much more are created in a serial and parallel circuit. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Few people know, but modern flash drives also use similar technology, but the topic of this article is about overheating.  We figured out why they arise, but what harm does ordinary overheating do?  The first devices on transistors practically did not warm up, but with a decrease in their size, everything changed.  The temperature began to rise more than ever, so people came up with a lot of means for cooling, from coolers to water-cooled ones. </p><p>  The standard temperature of a more or less new video card is from 50 to 60 ¬∞ C, for a processor it is 10 ¬∞ C lower, and it is worth noting that this is the temperature when loading at 100%.  In idle mode, the temperature should not exceed 30 ¬∞ C.  If the textolite reaches 90 ¬∞ C - a critical point, then there are 2 options for the outcome: either the component will burn out, or the computer will turn off. </p><p>  In the next paragraph of the article we will describe in detail how to check the temperature of the video card and processor.  If your components exceed this temperature threshold, then it is worth right now to beat the bell. </p><h2>  How to check the <span>temperature of the processor</span> and video card program? </h2><p>  The relentless struggle for leadership is constantly ongoing in the software market, but not here, that is, the sensors on the computer are the same for everyone, which means that all programs read everything in about the same way.  If you are an experienced computer user, we recommend that you immediately go into the BIOS (standard input and output system) and see what voltage is supplied to the components.  If it is too high, then reset the BIOS and reboot with saving with the F10 button. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ubergizmo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="overheated motherboard" class="if uuid-2332677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2332677.jpg"></div><p>  This method is 100% suitable for the processor and RAM, now you need to figure out how to check the temperature of the video card, because there is practically no information about it in the BIOS.  The temperature is recognized as follows: </p><ol><li>  Download the GPU-Z program from the official website (if you want for the processor, then CPU-Z). </li><li>  Install the application on your personal computer.  If you have a laptop, then the driver disk must have a native application for displaying temperature. </li><li>  In the item ‚ÄúTemperature‚Äù the value in degrees will be displayed.  You can also see additional information, for example, is the chip overclocked or is it in idle mode. </li></ol><h2>  How to check the temperature of a video card in Windows 7? </h2><p>  If you are a demanding user and want to use several applications at once to display not only the temperature of the processor, but also the video card, RAM, hard drive, motherboard, then we hasten to please you: such programs exist.  It is also worth noting that some of them are paid, and free versions cannot display the entire list of functions and features.  All applications are supported by Windows 7 and higher. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cervete.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="one of the first video cards" class="if uuid-2332675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2332675.jpg"></div><p>  List of programs that check the temperature of the video card and other components: </p><ol><li>  AIDA64 Extreme. </li><li>  CPU-Z. </li><li>  Speedfan </li><li>  MSI Afterburner </li><li>  HWMonitor. </li></ol><p>  Read the instructions for use on the official website of each application, because these utilities are not designed for novice users. </p><h2>  Recommendations for overheating </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth understanding a very important thing: the computer, like other equipment, loves timely self-care.  If you do not take it to the workshop or do not regularly clean it yourself, there is a high risk of breakage, since dust prevents the fans from cooling the components, which can cause them to overheat.  We also recommend timely changing thermal grease (refrigerant) (at least once a year).  So you will definitely save the computer from breakdowns of varying complexity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.legitreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Video card cooling" class="if uuid-2332666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64377/2332666.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  We hope that after reading this article you understand how to check the temperature of a video card, because this skill will certainly help you identify numerous problems with the equipment.  Timely care of the computer - a guarantee of health for many years. </p>
