  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Nuremberg: photos with names</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nuremberg is one of the famous cities in Germany.  It is close to the center of Bavaria, in the Pegnitz Valley.  In terms of number of inhabitants, it ranks second in Bavaria and fourteenth in Germany.  It is inhabited by 490 thousand people.  The city covers an area of ​​187 km <sup>2</sup> .  The sights of Nuremberg are well known not only in Germany, but throughout the world.  Thousands of tourists come here.  The sights of Nuremberg are mainly architectural historical buildings and museums. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The first village on the site of the current city appeared presumably in 1021.  This is evidenced by ancient records.  However, excavation data allow the existence of a settlement long before the year 1000.  The then German emperor Conrad II, belonging to the Salic dynasty, founded the royal court at about the place where the city center is now.  The construction of the castle was completed in the middle of the 11th century.  Merchants and minions settled to the south of it.  Located on a hill overhanging a flat plain, the castle built had many defensive advantages. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages, this city became one of the largest trade and economic centers of the region. </p><p>  On January 2, 1945, Nuremberg was largely destroyed during the bombing.  Basically, its historical part suffered. </p><h2>  Transport in Nuremberg </h2><p>  The metro plays an important role in transport support.  The metro includes 3 lines, the newest of which is operated without the participation of drivers.  Public transport is also represented by trams and buses.  There are 6 tram routes in the city. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to public transport, there is an international airport, a large number of railways and roads and a river port.  The city is at the intersection of several highways. </p><p>  The theme of transport is dedicated to one of the museums in the city. </p><h2>  What is Nuremberg famous for? </h2><p>  This city has a reputation as one of the most popular cities in Germany and even the whole world.  One of the famous artists was born here - Albrecht Dürer.  He was named after various institutions of the city and one of the city streets.  Sights of Nuremberg attract tourists from all over the world. </p><p>  The city is also famous for its large museum of toys.  In the Middle Ages, Nuremberg was the largest center for their manufacture in Europe.  Then they were made manually.  Later, industrial production was established.  Famous local gingerbread and sausages have considerable popularity. </p><p>  Another feature of the city is associated with the name of Adolf Hitler, who spent more time here than anywhere else in Germany.  In particular, under his leadership parades of the Nazis were organized here. </p><h2>  Nuremberg (Germany): Attractions </h2><p>  The city has something to see.  In tourist guides you can find a large number of photos of Nuremberg attractions with names.  This ancient German city has a large number of architectural structures, as well as objects of mass visit.  Among them are several churches, museums, a zoo and others.  All this can be seen in the photo of the sights of Nuremberg with a description.  At the same time, there are no natural and archaeological sites here.  In the photo, the sights of Nuremberg look quite spectacular. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nuremberg Fortress </h2><p>  This ancient building is perhaps the most interesting object of the city.  <span>Nuremberg fortress</span> is located in the so-called old city.  It is made of durable brick and is a unique object of medieval architecture.  If it were not for the buildings on top of the tower, then in its form and appearance it resembles in some way the old factory pipe of the Soviet era. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kaiserburg-nuernberg.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nuremberg Fortress" class="if uuid-2269389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48794/2269389.jpg"></div><p>  However, in addition to the original building at the top, there is also an observation deck with a beautiful view of the city and its surroundings. </p><p>  This historic building was built in the 12th century.  Thanks to the massive thick walls, its inhabitants were protected from possible attacks by enemy forces. </p><p>  Around the fortress are historical buildings decorated in the style of wooden architecture typical of northern and central Europe. </p><h2>  Market Square </h2><p>  Nuremberg's market square has a long history.  It appeared in the 14th century after hundreds of people were forcibly burned in this place on St. Nicholas Day in 1349.  Around the square are historical buildings and structures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Market Square" class="if uuid-2272090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48794/2272090.jpg"></div><p>  The area is lined with ancient paving tiles.  Among the unusual objects is a gilded fountain in the form of a spire.  It used to be that they would make it the spire of the city church, but for economic reasons they decided not to build the church, and the spire itself was installed on the Market Square. </p><p>  It is especially interesting to visit the Market Square at Christmas.  At this time, festive fairs open here, and nearby houses are covered with New Year's decorations. </p><h2>  Church of virgin mary </h2><p>  This ancient Catholic temple was built in the 14th century on the site of the destroyed Jewish synagogue.  It is a massive brick building, decorated with various metal ornaments and metal peaks.  The central tower, located on the front of the building, is narrow and towers high above the rest of it.  Church of the Virgin Mary is facing the market square. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of virgin mary" class="if uuid-2272095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48794/2272095.jpg"></div><p>  The church was largely destroyed during the Second World War.  The facade and walls of the building are preserved.  In the late forties - early 50s, the church was reconstructed.  Inside it is an altar from the 15th century. </p><h2>  Church of St. Lawrence </h2><p>  The building was built in the 13th century, but a couple of centuries later it was redone.  This is a gigantic brick building with two huge gabled towers.  It is decorated with various ornaments.  During its construction, the Gothic style was maintained.  It is also considered the most beautiful historical building in Nuremberg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.flickr.com/photos/russianchild007/4618267884"><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. Lawrence" class="if uuid-2269438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48794/2269438.jpg"></div><p>  After the Second World War, reconstruction of this architectural monument was carried out. </p><h2>  Church of St. Sebald </h2><p>  Like the church of St. Lawrence, the church of St. Sebald is made in the Gothic style.  In appearance, it is very similar to a castle with two high peaked peaks at the main entrance.  It was built in the 13th century.  During the war, an organ of the 15th century was damaged in the interior, which was replaced with a new one in 1975. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. Sebald" class="if uuid-2269443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48794/2269443.jpg"></div><h2>  Dürer Museum </h2><p>  Albrecht Durer made a huge contribution to the art of Western Europe of the Renaissance.  He lived in the 15th century and for some time was the owner of this building.  At the end of the 19th century, a museum was opened here.  The museum building was preserved during the war; therefore, it captured historical features characteristic of that time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dürer Museum" class="if uuid-2269446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48794/2269446.jpg"></div><h2>  National Museum of Germany </h2><p>  Nuremberg houses the largest museum in Germany.  This modern building was erected on the site of a former monastery.  In total in the museum you can see 1.2 million exhibits, which are relics of various eras - from the Stone Age to the present.  Here you can see sculptures, paintings, musical instruments, weapons, watches, art objects and many other things. </p><h2>  German Toy Museum </h2><p>  The Toy Museum is located in a three-story building dating back to the early 16th century.  The museum features a private collection of exhibits from the Bayer family.  The most ancient of them are burnt clay dolls that have been produced since the 14th century.  From the 17th century began to produce miniature toy houses for dolls, which were very popular among children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="toy museum" class="if uuid-2269447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48794/2269447.jpg"></div><p>  In total, the collection of this museum has about 65 thousand different exhibits, including ancient and modern works of the toy industry. </p><h2>  City Palace of Justice </h2><p>  This building is famous for the fact that in 1946 the so-called Nuremberg trials took place here, where the leaders of the Nazi regime were tried.  The Palace of Justice was chosen for this purpose due to the fact that it was in it that the Nazis held their regular congresses. </p><p>  The building of the Palace of Justice itself was built at the beginning of the 20th century.  Now anyone can see with their own eyes the hall where there was a trial of Hitler’s associates. </p><p>  The sights of Nuremberg (Germany) are not limited to this.  There are other interesting objects in this city, however, they are not as popular as those described above.  Thus, you can see the most significant sights of Nuremberg in one day. </p>
