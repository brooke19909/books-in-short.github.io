Every year, new resorts appear on the coasts of the seas, attracting the attention of tourists.  For many Russians, Greece has become the "summer home".  Paralia Katerini collected the most positive reviews.  This young resort invites thousands of people to the shores of the <span>Aegean</span> .  Here, in the eastern part of the prefecture of Pieria, there is a huge number of cozy hotels, restaurants, clubs and bars. </p><p>  Holidays at this resort are suitable for everyone: honeymooners, large families and the elderly.  You can and should come to Paralia Katerinis for the sake of shopping, clean beaches and various entertainments. </p><h2>  Heavenly place </h2><p>  Reading reviews about the resort of Paralia-Katerinis (Greece), I would like to run for tickets more quickly and go to this city.  This is a kind of capital of Pieria, a nice village with well-developed infrastructure.  Around this resort there are also many other places that are no less picturesque and beautiful.  Residents of the town are very hospitable and friendly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece paralia katerini reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1434184.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Despite the civilization, which has long "reached" the resort of Paralia Katerini (Greece), the reviews of those who have visited here indicate that the spirit of Ancient Greece still remained in this place.  By the way, the town itself got a historical name that reminds us of St. Katerina.  Here, for four hundred years, a temple has been showing off in honor of the ruler. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Path to the sea </h2><p>  Many European countries have become popular for recreation.  Among them is Greece.  Paralia Katerini, reviews of which are only positive, is located on the coast of the Aegean Sea.  Not far from the village is located no less popular place - Soloniki.  It is from here that you can get to the resort. </p><p>  The distance between these two cities is 70 kilometers.  Trains and buses leave from Soloniki daily to Katerini.  There is a highway between them for those who travel by car. </p><p>  In general, from Russia there are many flights to Greece.  If suddenly you did not find tickets to Thessaloniki, you can fly to Athens.  From here, by train or bus to Paralia Katerinis 350 kilometers.  On average, taking an express train takes 5 hours. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  If you finally get to the resort, you should immediately think about how to move around the city.  The fact is that the traffic intersection here is ‚Äúweak‚Äù.  From public transport there are only buses.  Moreover, drivers and conductors can hardly speak English.  It is better to immediately think well about the route. </p><p>  There is an option to take a taxi, but, like in any resort city, its services are very expensive.  It remains only to rent a car.  This option is the most comfortable, but the only problem is that in Katerini itself this can not be done.  On arrival at Soloniki, you will have to immediately rent a car and go to the resort. </p><h2>  What to pack in a suitcase? </h2><p>  This country is always the most comfortable stay.  In Greece (Paralia Katerinis), climate reviews are only positive.  Those who are familiar with geography will be able to guess what weather conditions to expect.  For others, it is worth noting that the Mediterranean climate has always been distinguished by comfortable temperature indicators.  In winter, despite the rain, the weather is mild, in the summer it is always warm and dry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paralia katerini greece reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1434187.jpg" width="600"></div>

The first begins in October and leaves with the beginning of spring.  The second pleases from April to the end of September.  Despite the fact that winter in many regions of Russia is associated with snow and frost, in Katerini, January and February are considered the coldest months.  At this time, the temperature drops to +5 degrees. </p><p>  But the warm season is as hot as possible in August.  At this time, the temperature rises to +35 degrees.  But since we are talking about coastal resorts, thanks to the fresh sea breeze, even on the hottest day, tourists feel comfortable.  In addition, the town is surrounded by mountains, significantly affecting the weather. </p><h2>  Ayda to the beach </h2><p>  The main attraction of all resorts is the beach.  Unesco marked with blue flag the waters of the Aegean just in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe town (Greece) of Paralia Katerini.  Reviews about the beach are still not always positive.  If the sutra is very clean and the sea is clear, then in the afternoon, the water becomes cloudy.  Of course, this is due to the number of tourists in a given season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paralia katerini greece holiday features" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1434191.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The coast near the resort is gentle, so rest with young children is safe.  The sand is shallow and pleasant to walk.  On the beaches of Katerini, finding entertainment is very simple.  For example, you can explore the depths of the Aegean Sea and get diving lessons.  Like all resorts, there are classic parachute flights, jet skis, catamaran rides, etc. There is an option to go to the nearest water park and get a dose of adrenaline and positive emotions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Where to live? </h2><p>  Of course, independent travelers can also find private accommodation options, but it is best to choose safer accommodation - hotels.  Paralia Katerinis (Greece) hotel reviews get the most flattering.  The fact is that since the resort is young, all the hotels here are new and well-groomed.  They are represented by a huge selection of categories and are located on the first coastline.
