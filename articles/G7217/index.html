Therefore, a passive speaker system with an amplifier is needed.  The latter, by the way, affects the sound quality in the most decisive way.  It depends on him how many watts and kilohertz your speakers can give out. </p><p>  Modern Hi-End amplifiers are unrealistically expensive.  Not everyone can buy them.  However, there are domestic models (even from the last century) that provide acceptable sound quality and cost a penny.  <span>Soviet amplifiers</span> have always been quoted among music lovers.  And the Vega 50U-122S (amplifier) ‚Äã‚Äãis no exception.  Many blame this amplifier on what the light is, others with insane stubbornness prove the opposite.  Who is right?  To do this, you need to consider the technical characteristics of the device, study the reviews of the owners and form your point of view.  Only after this can any conclusions be drawn. </p>

    <h2>  A little bit about the company </h2><p>  The Soviet manufacturer of radio electronics "Vega" was located in the city of Berdsk of the Russian Federation.  In principle, there is a plant now, but things are going badly from it.  But that's not the point.  Previously, the company was called the Berdsky Radio Plant.  She was engaged in the production of consumer electronics: amplifiers, cassette decks, turntables, speakers.  A little later, the plant mastered the production of CD players.  Until the 90s of the last century, Vega products were in almost every home.  Her amplifiers enjoyed wild success.  Our hero is not an exception - "Vega 50U-122S" (amplifier).  However, after 1997, the plant‚Äôs solidity shook.  And at the beginning of the two thousandths, the company was declared bankrupt and disaggregated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, Vega software is engaged in the repair of consumer electronics and the production of devices for special orders.  There is no trace of past greatness.  Now the legendary amplifiers and <span>speakers</span> can only be found in the secondary market.  But their condition will, of course, be far from new.  Nevertheless, the memory of high-quality speaker systems was surprisingly tenacious.  Many music lovers are still looking at the "flea markets" the legendary "Vega 50U-122S" (amplifier).  Why does this device so appeal to audiophiles?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  Let's start with the appearance of this amplifier, because it is too early to go to the technical specifications.  Usually Soviet devices were heavy and bulky.  It's better to keep silent about design.  But the Vega 50U-122S sound amplifier is completely different.  It has an unrealistically thin body (for Soviet equipment).  Most of all, it resembles a Chinese DVD player.  Such a design made it very desirable for many music lovers.  However, despite the slim body and not too large dimensions, the amplifier weighs a lot.  Its weight is more than five kilograms.  For a stationary device, this is quite normal.  However, taking it somewhere with you will be problematic. </p>

    <p>  The second design feature is the buttons for switching the playback device.  They are quasi-sensory.  This means that there will be no familiar click (as in other Soviet amplifiers).  They are pressed gently and easily.  An unprecedented achievement for domestic technology of the 80-90s.  Vega 50U-122S (amplifier), the technical characteristics of which we will analyze a little later, can be considered the most stylish device in the post-Soviet space.  Although the sound quality can be inferior to other more eminent brands.  But we will talk about this further. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  Here is a double-edged sword.  Judging by how they respond about this amplifier, the sound quality in it does not satisfy the exacting audiophiles.  However, for an ordinary person, the quality of "Vega" is more than enough.  It has the ability to reproduce sound ranging from 20 hertz to 25 kilohertz.  This range is enough to capture the fullness of the picture of the musical composition.  The Vega 50U-122S amplifier, reviews of which do not differ in an even picture, is quite suitable for home use, because the sound quality is quite consistent with average needs. </p>

    <p>  An important role in the quality of sound is played by <span>acoustic systems.</span>  If you use speakers with a resistance very different from the nominal, then you do not have to wait for high-quality sound.  For the Vega 50U-122S amplifier, the instruction to which is not required at all, you need to select the speakers based on the technical characteristics of the amplifier itself.  This is the only way to achieve high-quality sound.  Do not forget about the connecting wires.  Thin and low-quality wires can ruin a sound.  And this is a scientifically proven fact. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  So we got to the most interesting.  I immediately want to note that the power of the device, declared by the manufacturer, is real.  In the Soviet Union, they approached this responsibly and did not mold numbers ‚Äúfrom the ceiling‚Äù on boxes.  Specified is exactly the power at which the amplifier is able to work for a long time without any harm to itself and other components of the audio system.  So, the output power is 50 watts with a resistance of 8 ohms and 80 watts with a resistance of 4 ohms.  These are ‚Äúhonest‚Äù watts, so the neighbors will be delighted with your sound.  This is exactly the Vega 50U-122S amplifier.  Its characteristics are not limited only by power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For example, its sensitivity is 79 decibels.  This is a good result.  I would also like to note the presence of loudness for vinyl record players, support for four playback sources and economy in terms of energy consumption.  There is also another feature - a lot of sound settings that make the Vega 50U-122S amplifier sound completely different.  How to connect it?  This is also not problematic, because all connectors are signed in Russian.  It is simply impossible to make a mistake. </p><h2>  Additional options </h2><p>  What else can the Vega 50U-122S amplifier boast?  Its characteristics are far from the main thing.  The most interesting additional features of this model.  These include excellent protection against voltage surges and overload.  If the voltage reaches a critical point, the amplifier will automatically turn off.  So it is completely protected from burnout.  There is also an option to automatically turn off if there is no sound signal from the source for a long time.  This helps save energy.  Thus, this amplifier can be called unique.  Especially against the background of other products from the Soviet Union. </p>

    <p>  What else is characterized by Vega 50U-122S?  The amplifier is equipped with a four-band equalizer.  It helps make the sound better.  It is possible to make the device work in mono mode.  But this is not the main thing.  Much more interesting is the ability to connect additional acoustics.  In addition to the main pair of contacts for connecting speakers, there is one more.  With this type of connection, it is possible to get surround stereo sound using four different speakers.  Not all amplifiers of this class have such a useful option.  This alone makes Vega a very interesting device. </p><h2>  Completion </h2><p>  "Vega 50U-122S" - the amplifier is not very high quality.  Especially those models that were produced after the collapse of the Union.  The soldering was of disgusting quality.  The wires fell off on their own.  Just like other components.  Therefore, after the purchase I had to re-solder everything manually.  But the full potential of ‚ÄúVega‚Äù is revealed only after the correct completion.  What is the essence of the refinement?  In Vega, standard capacitors of the type UM are installed for such devices.  These are not very high-quality components, so you can‚Äôt wait for high-quality sound.  It is better to replace them with something comparable from the TDA or STK.  It seems to be a trifle, but the sound will improve.  To do this, you need to remove the old capacitors from the printed circuit board and put new ones in their place, which it will not be difficult to buy in any radio store. </p>

    <p>  But that is not all.  It would also be desirable to replace the VT49 transistors with more adequate components (VT43 is perfect).  You can also fix the manufacturer‚Äôs flaws (poor soldering, wires).  All this is replaceable, which means that the amplifier will sound much better.  That was the "universal" Vega 50U-122S.  Refinement will help the amplifier work for a long time and efficiently.  That is, exactly as it was originally supposed to.  But move on to the next section of the material. </p><h2>  Amplifier repair </h2><p>  The Vega 50U-122S amplifier is a fairly reliable device.  But he also has the property of failing.  But repair of the Vega 50U-122S amplifier does not present any problem for those who are even a little versed in radio parts.  What most often fails in this device?  Usually these are diodes in the bridges KD202D and KD202K.  Due to the voltage drop, they burn out and the amplifier in the future simply refuses to turn on.  Replacing them is not difficult.  They are in any radio store.  First you need to ‚Äúring‚Äù the diodes with a tester to make sure that the problem is in them, then remove the damaged components and solder the others in their place. </p>

    <p>  However, this is the simplest malfunction.  But what if the amplifier turns on, but there is no sound?  There may be several problems.  However, the most common is the failure of a capacitor.  To confirm this hypothesis, you should ring the capacitor with a tester, identify the faulty one and replace it.  But remember: never do anything with amplifier boards without a circuit.  Out of ignorance, one can do such a thing that the equipment will have a direct road to the trash.  By the way, a diagram of this device is available in the article. </p><h2>  Positive feedback from owners </h2><p>  So what do people say about a product like the Vega 50U-122S amplifier?  The reviews of some are simply laudatory odes to the amplifier.  It seems that these people agree to idolize all Soviet technology.  Whatever quality it may be.  Nevertheless, the owners note the high sound quality for an amplifier of this level (of course, in tandem with a good speaker system).  Many rejoice in the slim body (which, indeed, is unusual for Soviet equipment).  But most are happy with the price (in the secondary market) and ease in terms of refinement and repair.  These are the features against which it is impossible to come up with any counterarguments. </p>

    <h2>  Negative owner reviews </h2><p>  Here the picture is just the opposite.  Dissatisfied users note the disgusting quality of soldering in 1992 models (and this is true).  The sound quality does not suit many (apparently, they are audiophiles).  Almost everyone is annoyed by the automatic shutdown of the amplifier in the absence of a sound signal.  And some are annoyed by the built-in overload protection, which prevents the <span>volume control knob from being unscrewed</span> to the maximum.  The case is also considered flimsy: it is worth dropping the amplifier a little and dents immediately appear.  Also, people are annoyed by the equalizer, which they consider an unnecessary addition. </p><h2>  Where can I buy? </h2><p>  Currently, it is almost impossible to buy such an amplifier in retail.  The only way out is to look for something similar in the secondary market.  There, by the way, there may already be modified models.  And this is good.  No need to spend time on upgrades.  To purchase such a device in a different way is almost impossible. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the Vega 50U-122S.  The amplifier belongs to the entry-level devices, it has excellent sound, a thin body and several very interesting options.  It is perfect for home use and will last a long time after some refinement.  But you don‚Äôt have to expect more from budget devices (especially domestic ones). </p>
