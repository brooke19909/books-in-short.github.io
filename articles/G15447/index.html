In such cases, a <span>credit card</span> with free service may be useful.  It can serve as a financial pillow.  Read more about how and where to draw up such a financial instrument. Read on. </p><h2>  What's the catch? </h2><p>  In a competitive market, banks are fighting for every customer.  Plastic cards have always been a popular product.  Therefore, in addition to ordinary credit cards with a monthly service charge, free cards appeared on the market.  This product has several advantages, but there are also pitfalls.  This can be a percentage for the balance of personal funds in the account, and the minimum amount of monthly replenishment of the account, etc. In order not to overpay the money, you need to study the service contract in detail and not rely only on the words of the manager.  Although today, banks are trying to prescribe understandable and transparent conditions so as not to lose customers and not receive negative reviews.  In addition, a credit card with free annual service and cash withdrawals is provided free of charge.  A financial institution spends money on the production of plastic, which means that it expects a long-term cooperation with the client. </p>

To use the card for free, you need to ‚Äúlend‚Äù 25 thousand rubles a month. </p>
