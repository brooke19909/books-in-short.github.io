    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  This amazing seaside city is located in Fujian province.  It is territorially divided into several parts: the mainland Haitsan and Jimei and the island Gulanyuy, connected to the mainland by a dam.  A hiking trail, a motorway and a railway run along it. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The first mention of the city of Xiamen in China is found in manuscripts dated 1387.  The city began with a sea fortress.  And in the XVIII century, Xiamen already briskly trades with the cities of Southeast Asia.  In 1727, the district capital of Quanzhou was transferred here to control all growing companies and operations. </p><p>  In 1842 (according to the Nanjing agreement), the city was opened for trade with European powers.  International companies knew him as Amoy (due to the peculiarities of the local dialect). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the end of the 19th century, Xiamen became the main port for coolie workers who emigrated from the country to America.  From the beginning of the last century, the development of the city practically stopped, until it, like the whole country, was swept by the economic revolution of the <span>Deng Xiaoping</span> era <span>.</span> </p><p>  By the end of the 20th century, Xiamen received the status of a special economic zone and quickly became one of the leaders in the modernization and transformation of China. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  This city in China is one of the richest and fastest growing with a population of almost 4 million people.  The south coast of Xiamen is beaches of stunning beauty and the main campus of a local university, the west - modern port facilities. </p><p>  Mostly foreigners live on the islet of Gulanyuy.  Sometimes the area is called paradise.  Perhaps because mopeds, cars, rickshaws and motorbikes are prohibited here. </p><p>  Jimei District is famous for Jimei University and the Turtle Park.  This is a kind of memorial complex dedicated to the famous national hero Chen Jiang.  By the way, he himself was buried in a park and a traditional tortoise grave. </p><h2>  Residence </h2><p>  There are many extensions from hotels, and for every taste and budget.  This part of the tourist infrastructure of Xiamen is influenced by both a multinational student community and business urban circles.  That is why there are very modest hotels, hostels and luxury hotels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  A worthy option for families with children or honeymoons is <span>the Marco Polo Hotel.</span>  It is located almost in the center of the area with an active business and entertainment life.  In addition to free internet and satellite TV, the rooms have huge panoramic windows.  They offer stunning views of Yuandan Lake or city blocks.  Both are especially interesting to watch in the evening or at night.  The minibar in the apartment is absolutely free.  Therefore, tours to China from Moscow, especially to Xiamen, are successful from any direction. </p><p>  In the lobby of the hotel there is everything necessary for guests of the country: souvenir shops, a fitness center, a swimming pool, four restaurants with interesting menus. </p><p>  The food in the hotels of the city is thought out perfectly.  In addition to national dishes, which not everyone can eat, there is always a buffet.  Although visiting here and not tasting the local fruits would be an unforgivable mistake.  Later, at home, it will be possible to boast that not only they saw it live, but also tried herring (snake fruit), food and so on.  Well, of course, as in any major city, there are Italian restaurants and vegetarian cafes in Xiamen (Fujian Province). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  An alternative option is also possible - to rent a room, apartment or house.  Price variation can be significant.  It depends on the remoteness of beaches, attractions, entertainment centers, etc. </p><h2>  Attractions Xiamen </h2><p>  The main one, of course, is the sea.  But the centuries-old history of the city offers hundreds more options for interesting places.  Consider the most interesting places. </p><h2>  Tourist mecca </h2><p>  One of the most favorite places for tourists is the national treasure of China - the Nanputuo Temple of the Tang Dynasty.  Followers of Buddhism and just pilgrims most often get religious tours to this temple. </p>

    <p>  Its semicircular golden pavilions with green roofs, the Halls of the Great Mercy, the Great Hero, the Heavenly Kings and the Precious Hall amaze with their luxury.  Inspection of the temple begins with two ponds, on both sides of which are the temple gates. </p><p>  In the main Hall of the King of Heaven, Maitreya, the Buddha, is sitting in a pose with crossed legs.  Behind him stands the guard and the main protector of Buddhist teachings.  Behind the doors of this Hall, a small courtyard opens with a Bell Tower and a Tower of Dragons.  After passing through the courtyard, the temple guests enter the Heroic Treasure Hall.  This building has two floors and three Buddhas.  The foot of the statues is made in the form of a sacred lotus.  They are embossed with biographies of the Buddha and the famous Chinese traveler - the monk Xuan Zang. </p><p>  The Hall of Great Mercy is a recognized spiritual center.  It is made in the form of an octagonal pavilion and hides a statue of Guanyin inside. </p><p>  The Hall of Great Compassion introduces tourists to the figures of badhisattvas.  At the back of the courtyard of the temple is a pavilion built in 1936.  It houses collections of calligraphy, Buddhist manuscripts, ivory sculptures and other Chinese art. </p><p>  Tourists are invited to visit the library of the temple, followed by tombstones and small halls. </p><h2>  Amazing island </h2><p>  Most tourists start exploring this city in China from the Gulanyuy Island.  He has many beautiful associations: ‚ÄúGarden at the Sea‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Island of Music‚Äù, etc. Gulanyuy is almost completely covered with dense forests, in which there are buildings of the XVIII century, built in American or European style. </p>

    <p>  In this amazing place there is no fuel-powered transport.  Therefore, on the island you can safely walk the streets, looking at the houses of the colonists.  Here is the best vacation in China at sea: quiet, beautiful sandy beaches with stunningly delightful rock growths.  In the evening, you can devote walks to unique museums, small parks, restaurants with live music and cafes with local specialties.  To restore balance and peace of mind, judging by the reviews on the Web, a cozy place can not be found in all of China. </p><p>  In addition, the island recorded the highest density per capita ... piano.  Nowhere else in China is this observed! </p><h2>  Patriotic Park </h2><p>  <span>Tours to China</span> from Moscow are most often offered in Haiyueyuan Park.  The place is very curious.  Ideal sandy beaches with numerous summer villas are very conducive to a relaxing holiday.  But the guests of the country are not very clear why their rest is ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù by the commander Chuang Chenggong in the form of a bronze bas-relief.  For the Chinese, he is a national hero, the most ardent patriot: he liberated Taiwan from the Dutch.  And today it is a kind of flag for the campaign to return Taiwan ‚Äúhome‚Äù.  In the southeastern corner of the park there is another monument to the commander: standing on a pedestal, Chuang Chenggong resolutely looks towards Taiwan. </p><h2>  Museums, parks, lakes and other attractions </h2><p>  A visit to the Piano Museum will be quite interesting.  It is located in two beautiful buildings right in the center of Shuzhuhanhuayuan Garden.  The museum has collected more than seventy instruments from around the world.  From it, moving along the main street, you can get to the building of the former British consulate, built in 1870.  Today, the Museum of Coins is open in it. </p>

    <p>  Xiamen in China is famous for its unique Yuandang Lake.  It is famous not only for picturesque views in the evening (the illumination of numerous sculptures is turned on), but also for large flocks of herons. </p><p>  No less beautiful is the promenade of Lujiang Dao.  It stretched along the western tip of Xiamen.  And although not as long as in other major cities, it is very shady and comfortable.  At its intersection with the Zhongshan Lu shopping district, there is a ferry pier. </p><p>  Locals prefer to spend family vacations in Bai Lu Zhou Park, and tourists in Qingyuan Piano Garden.  In addition to the usual shady alleys and quiet paths, the park is interesting for its art gallery and audio-video hall. </p><p>  From this park in the cabin of the cable car you can reach the Rock of Sunlight.  This is the highest point of Xiamen Island - 93 m above sea level.  The panorama opening from this place is amazing.  Already in our time, on the eastern side of the peak, the Temple of the Rock of Sunlight was erected with an open-air statue of Guanyin, but surprisingly fits into a single ensemble and style of this part of the island city. </p><p>  The Hulishan fortress, erected, according to historians, at the end of the 19th century impresses with its foundation.  It is made from a mixture of brown sugar, clay, sand, camphor, wood syrup and glutinous rice.  The fortress itself is granite.  It contains the cannons of the Ming Dynasty. </p>

    <p>  A famous attraction is the Xiamen University.  Rather, the campus of students of Jimei.  Each building is erected in the architectural style of Fujian.  The most striking holiday of the town, according to tourists, is the Dragon Boat Festival. </p><p>  The Botanical Garden in Xiamen (China) is represented by a huge number of interesting subtropical plants. </p>
