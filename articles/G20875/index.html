    <h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  Hotel "Abaata" (Abkhazia, Gagra) overlooks the sand and pebble beach, which is located in <span>Old Gagra.</span>  This place is more suitable for lovers of secluded relaxation surrounded by unspoilt nature.

The use of beach towels, sun loungers and parasols is included in the price. </p><h2>  Hotel "Abaata" (Abkhazia): guest reviews </h2><p>  Vacationers here, according to their reviews, refer to the only drawback available in the hotel is the lack of food included in the price.  However, on the other hand, they are grateful to the hotel for the opportunity to taste the dishes of nearby establishments.  This perspective does not scare the guests at all, but rather inspires a possible varied vacation. </p><p>  Those who happened to live on the third floor of the buildings note that their balcony is a real spacious terrace, and they were pleasantly surprised by this.  The proximity to the sea is also pleasing to the arrivals - it is just a stone's throw away.  In general, the Abaata Hotel (Gagra) receives mostly positive reviews.  Many guests note that they will come here with pleasure.  But is not this the main indicator for any hotel complex? </p>
