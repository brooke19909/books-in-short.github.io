Previously, in order to enjoy leisure and entertainment at the height, it was necessary to go by train out of town to the village of Orekhovo in the <span>rope park "Orekh".</span>  Currently, the Tritutri rope park in Ozerki is gaining momentum, is being equipped, and already has its regular customers aged 4 years and older. </p><h2>  City in the air </h2><p>  For the rope park, one of the best places in the city was chosen.  This is the shore of Suzdal Lakes, on the side of a mountain, among solid trees.  And the name is coined for itself: translated from English tree to tree means "from tree to tree."  This is the meaning of what is happening in the rope park in St. Petersburg.  This is what awaits the guests - overcoming the obstacles between the trees.  On the territory, of course, there are also land types of recreation.  Everything is provided so that everyone in the park likes it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="treetotree lakes" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2157191.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is worth noting that only trained participants are allowed to complete the runs.  A professional instructor will tell about all the tasks still on earth.  Moreover, he will demonstrate on his example how to behave in a particular situation.  The main thing is not to panic.  If something does not work out, or the participant cannot go further on the track, the instructor will help to get off it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Everyone should know that they are not allowed on the track without safety belts, helmets and carbines.  The first rule of the rope park in St. Petersburg is human security. </p><h2>  Track for the smallest </h2><p>  For the passage of routes age does not play a role.  The smallest participants, from the age of 4, are identified on a children's track called green.  This is the first level of difficulty up to a meter with instructor insurance.  Children here are much more interested than just playing on the playground.  After all, here, in addition to the track, for young athletes there are trampolines on which you can jump all day, and a playground with a climbing wall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rope park in lakes" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2157192.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As instructors say, adults can walk along the green track.  You need to start with something if you are in the rope park in Ozerki for the first time. </p><h2>  Highway for schoolchildren </h2><p>  A yellow track is offered for school children.  There are 10 tasks at an altitude of two to five meters above the ground.  By the way, when purchasing a ticket for a passage on the yellow highway, the price includes a green passage (for children).  You can practice on an easier route. </p><p>  The yellow track of the rope park in Ozerki involves difficult passes, and you need to give all your best.  Agility and flexibility are honed on the track.  Passing assignments, the guys temper their character and get a lot of positive emotions.  Between the stages of passage in the trees are equipped platforms where you can rest before the next test.  The grounds offer beautiful views of Suzdal Lakes.  At the end of the track, a brave tightrope walker is waiting for a descent along the troll, and, of course, pride in himself that the task has been completed.  Everyone who passed the track, delighted with the flight on the troll. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Adult track </h2><p>  For older age, youth and courageous teenagers, starting from 14 years old, the rope park in Ozerki offers the highest and most extreme red track at an altitude of 8-10 meters.  The cost of passage on this route includes passes on the previous two, stretch.  On red you will need to give everything in full and sweat well. </p>

    <p>  Here the participant is expected by the so-called pancakes, skis and ladder.  Who once passed these shells knows what these bonuses are.  But when the passage is completed and everything is left behind, for some reason it again pulls to a height. </p><h2>  Road Safety </h2><p>  During the construction of the rope park, special attention was paid to safety on the tracks.  And workers continue to pay particular attention to this aspect.  Before opening the rope park in Ozerki, several tests were carried out by professional stuntmen.  Each task was carried out in the most extreme conditions, which are not present during the passage of each track.  All passes are much easier. </p><p>  Cable and platform mounts are recognized by stuntmen as flawless.  A team of instructors monitors each participant as they complete tasks.  The insurance system is also tested.  The safety cable, to which a person walking along the highway is fastened, can withstand several tons of weight, he will catch and save those who still manage to fly from a height.  Safety in the rope park is the main thing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tritutri rope park in lakes" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/2157410.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It seems that TreeToTree in Ozerki is an ideal place in St. Petersburg for a vacation with the whole family.  Here you can not only walk along the tracks of the rope town, but also sit in a tent, rented and well adapted for rainy and windy St. Petersburg weather.  It accommodates up to 12 people.  You can make kebabs by renting barbecue and skewers.  There is an open summer terrace where you can sit for a cup of coffee while your child conquers the tops of the rope town.  Already, reviews have appeared about this park on social networks.  They write that the place to stay is ideal, everything is nearby, even the metro. </p>
