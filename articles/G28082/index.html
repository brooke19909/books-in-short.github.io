Especially when it comes to holidays abroad, in a country where you have not been.  After all, careful preparation and collection of information will allow you to avoid a lot of difficulties and problems during your vacation.  Experienced tourists are advised to pay special attention to the process of choosing a hotel.  After all, even if you consider yourself to be an unassuming person, you still will surely want to spend several days, or even weeks, of a long-awaited vacation in a comfortable hotel, where it is pleasant to return every day after an eventful day.  Therefore, travelers, sparing no effort, try to collect and analyze as many reviews as possible of those people who have already visited this or that hotel.  After all, this allows you to make a closer to reality idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat will await you in a particular hotel.  To save your time, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of Russian tourists regarding their stay <span>at a Phuket hotel</span> called Karona Resort &amp; Spa.  Somewhat ahead of the events, we note that our compatriots were not disappointed in their choice.

So, according to tourists, the apartments here are quite spacious, comfortable and clean.  True, some guests complained about the insufficient number of lighting devices, and therefore in the evenings the room was dark.  However, most of the guests at the moment did not bother.  To some, this design even seemed romantic.  The rest of the claims to the rooms on the part of the guests were not.  Tourists claim that the rooms have everything you might need.  Travelers were pleased with the presence of a large plasma TV.  True, you will not find Russian-language channels here, but this did not become a serious problem for anyone.  As for the furniture, it is not new in the rooms, but very solid and high-quality.  The beds in the apartments are comfortable, large.  Vacationers also pay attention to the fact that the rooms have a safe.  But you can use it for an additional fee (about 50 baht per day).  Many tourists are advised to store valuables in a safe.  Travelers also note the presence of slippers, umbrellas, sets for making tea or coffee in the apartment as a plus.  Wi-Fi is also available in the rooms.  The connection speed, however, cannot be called very high, but for communication with friends and relatives who stayed at home, it will be quite enough.  Moreover, the Internet can be used for free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand phuket karona resort spa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1100247.jpg" width="600"></div>

According to the guests, cleaning is carried out regularly.  True, it did not seem thorough to all tourists, but this did not cause any particular complaints.  Also note that you yourself will have to hint the maids about the need to change towels or linen.  So, if you want towels to be updated, then just drop the dirty ones on the floor.  To replace the same bed linen, it is necessary to put a special plate on the bed.  In this case, you can be sure that towels and bed linen will be updated upon your return to the room.  In addition, maids will bring bottled drinking water to your apartment every day.  A minibar is available at an additional cost.  Please also note that maids at Karona Resort &amp; Spa (Phuket) do not have to replenish the contents of tea or coffee sets.  You will find bags with drinks only upon arrival.  In the future, you yourself will have to purchase tea, coffee, sugar, etc., if necessary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="karona resort spa photo" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1100248.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in Karon Resort &amp; Spa includes breakfast only.  According to our compatriots, although they are repeated day by day, they are quite diverse.  So you can always vary your morning menu.  In the hotel's restaurant for breakfast you will be offered scrambled eggs and scrambled eggs fried right in front of you.  At the same time, you can ask the cook to add some foods to your taste in your dish (for example, sausages, vegetables, etc.).  Also for breakfast, guests can enjoy rice, noodles, soup, sausages, sausages, pastries, fresh fruits and vegetables, yogurt, juice, tea and coffee.  It‚Äôs difficult for tourists to stay hungry here. </p><p>  Throughout the day, travelers can eat in the hotel's restaurant, serving Thai and international cuisine, as well as in the many cafes in the surrounding area.  Many of our compatriots preferred the second option.  According to them, this allowed them to try a variety of dishes of both local and European cuisine.  They cook almost everywhere here, according to tourists, very tasty. </p><p>  In addition, you can always visit the markets and supermarkets located in the vicinity of the hotel and buy some ready-made products or fruits to eat them right on the street or in your room. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  A big plus of the Karona Resort &amp; Spa, the photo of which can be seen in this article, according to tourists, is its proximity to the beach.  So, to reach the sea, you only have to cross the road.  The closest beach to the hotel is Karon Beach.  However, many vacationers preferred to spend time on Kata Beach.  You can reach it in 10 minutes.  Here, according to our compatriots, the sea is calmer, and the territory itself is cleaner than on Karon. </p>
