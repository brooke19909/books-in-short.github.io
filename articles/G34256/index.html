These are more than 1400 office branches, over 800 ATMs and more than 59 thousand points of sale.  This means that a large number of people turn to Home Credit and Finance Bank.  Reviews, too, of course, are abundant. </p><p>  Their character is very different.  There are positive ones that were left in gratitude for the good service.  And there are negative ones that characterize the problems that have arisen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="home loan reviews" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11061/42462.jpg" width="286"></div>

    <p>  The last of them are usually written in a detailed, detailed form.  And this, of course, is correct.  If you decide to become a customer of Bank Home Credit, the reviews will help you figure out whether it is worth contacting.  You only need to be able to distinguish between cases that occurred due to the fault of the bank's employees and those in which the client is to blame. </p><p>  Today you can get the necessary information without leaving your home.  Before turning to reading the opinions left, carefully study the official website of Bank Home Credit.  Feedback after this will be easier to understand. </p><p>  If a person complains about incorrect service, rudeness, inability to get an exhaustive answer, then this is undoubtedly the fault of the bank employees.  And when complaints are received that the person signed the agreement in a hurry, and at home he carefully read the conditions and became indignant, then he needs to blame only himself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  All the conditions for obtaining comprehensive information are created in the bank branches.  Previously, you should familiarize yourself with the bank's website.  It describes in detail the available loan offers - rates, terms of payments and terms of registration. </p><p>  In the news you will find all the latest innovations.  Pay attention to insurance conditions: it is not obligatory.  If you are in any doubt, check with the Home Credit Bank toll-free line.  Reviews should help you eliminate unpleasant moments. </p><p>  The site has a loan calculator, which is very convenient, and for each loan offer separately.  You simply enter the amount, the number of months to pay off, and a monthly payment appears in front of you. </p><p>  You can immediately calculate how much you will pay in excess of the amount received.  Multiply your monthly payment by the number of months.  Subtract the amount taken from the result.  This difference is <span>bank interest.</span> </p><p>  Make a preliminary online application, get approval.  And, armed with knowledge, go to the Bank Home Credit.  Be sure to leave feedback on cooperation with the bank later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="home bank loan" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11061/42470.jpg" width="210"></div>
