    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  Perhaps one of the key features of the Andakira Hotel 4 * complex is the fact that it is in a very convenient (from all points of view) location.  Firstly, near the sea, and this is one of the main criteria by which potential tourists choose a hotel.  Secondly, not far from a variety of night clubs, restaurants, shops.  And finally, not so far from the airport.  45 minutes is enough to get to it.  A very convenient location is close enough, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about such a thing as a transfer, but it is also relatively far away (in any case, airplanes will not interfere with a relaxing holiday). </p><p>  Andakira Hotel 4 * opened in 2009.  And for all the time of his work, he has already become a favorite for many guests.  And this is understandable, because there is impeccable service, polite staff and comfortable rooms.  Yes, and in the vicinity of tropical landscapes and the beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Booking Nuances </h2><p>  And finally, a few words about the booking process.  Check-in is traditionally made from 14:00, check-out is before noon.  But if a person needs to arrive early or leave later, then the administration can provide this (perhaps for a small surcharge).  The hotel is allowed to come with children, but then not all rooms are suitable for reservations.  If the child is not 12 years old, then he is allowed to stay in the apartment for free.  If the baby is two years old or less, then a cot will be put in the room, and the stay will also be free of charge.  But only about this the administration needs to be notified in advance so that the crib can be prepared. </p><p>  Upon arrival, you must provide your passport and credit card (the one for which the reservation was made).  And yes, one more thing.  The reviews recommend taking care of the issue of room reservation at least one and a half to two months before the planned arrival, because the hotel is popular, and there may simply not be any free apartments.  The season is all year round, so you can easily be late with your reservation. </p>
