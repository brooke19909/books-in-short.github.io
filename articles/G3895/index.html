    <p>  With its beauty and perfection, nature relaxes any trapped spirit.  One of the most harmonious landscapes is considered Japanese.  This place of contemplation and nourishment of positive energy is the Botanical Garden <span>(Moscow).</span>  <span>The Japanese</span> Garden is a place where you can merge with nature, feel in harmony with it. </p><p>  Note that you can easily get to this place in any way convenient for you. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The Japanese Garden in Moscow is located in the <span>Main Botanical Garden</span> .  N.V. Tsitsina (GBS).  It occupies an exposition of 2.7 hectares already beloved by all residents and guests of the capital.  The exposition itself occupies a relatively small territory for GBS.  The Japanese garden in Moscow was created to admire more than 100 species of flowering shrubs, trees, herbaceous plants and, of course, flowers collected in such a small space.  I would like to note that landscape designers working to recreate oriental culture in the main city of Russia (already in the distant 1983-1987), tried to comply with all the canons of the building, without which the construction in the <span>Land of the Rising Sun, Japan,</span> simply can not do.  Thanks to a professional in his field, the eminent Ken Nakajima, with the support of the Japanese Embassy in Russia, a real, traditional Japanese garden was created.  Moscow immediately fell in love with this cozy, soulful place, similar to which at that time it had not yet been.  And now it is very difficult for other gardens to compete with the picturesqueness and harmony of this place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The main aspects of Japanese culture in the landscape </h2><p>  The first thing that architect Ken Nakajima drew attention to when he created the Japanese garden in Moscow was the culture itself and the sequence of construction.  No wonder the center of the composition is not a beautiful <span>sakura tree</span> and not a hill of stones, but a temple (a statue of 13 tiers, made of rock, which has been more than 200 years old).  It was around him that kindergartens were created in Japan 1,500 years ago, and they served as a center of meditation and enlightenment. </p>

    <p>  An integral part is also stones of an unusual form, recreated brooks from these rocks.  The first element to fall into place, again, taking into account another indisputable aspect of Buddhist culture, was the bamboo gate.  Stone fountains, absolutely unobtrusive, but so organic in the landscape, add magic and an amazing spirit to this paradise place.  In general, the Japanese garden in Moscow is a complex for tea ceremonies, and it was originally conceived in order to introduce Russian culture to Japanese revered traditions.  By the way, for such rituals in the culture of the <span>country of the East,</span> water is taken from a stone fountain.  A bridge of eight natural wooden canvases located above a small pond is also picturesque. </p><h2>  Especially the complex is beautiful ... </h2><p>  The <span>Japanese-style</span> garden is beautiful at any time from mid-April to October.  But especially the zone of Japan in GBS is beautiful in late April and early May, when sakura trees light up.  It was at this time that this institution was visited by the maximum number of people. </p>
