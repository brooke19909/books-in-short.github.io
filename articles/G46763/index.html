There is no shortage of people who want to get a dose of adrenaline.  But the suitable mountain slopes are quite far away. </p><h2>  Skiing </h2><p>  To engage in this sport, one should have a certain level of well-being and character traits corresponding to steep slopes.  Alpine skiing is a sport for the elite.  For successful and independent people, for those who know their worth.  It is such an audience that usually gathers in fashionable ski resorts located on the alpine slopes of Switzerland, France, Italy and Austria.  In all these countries, the highest level of infrastructure for skiing has been created - sports facilities, prepared tracks, a modern ski lift and <span>hotel services.</span>  The only problem is that all this is located very far away, the trip there is fraught with significant costs and with obtaining a Schengen visa.  And what about those skiers who have neither the desire nor the opportunity to spend a vacation in the Alps? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the mountain is warm" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/379710.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <h2>  In the Ural region </h2><p>  The unconditional traditional respect for Switzerland as the world capital of skiing does not mean that it has no alternatives.  Have you heard anything about the Gore Teplaya sports complex and other Ural <span>ski slopes?</span>  Unfortunately, they are less known than the French Courchevel.  The recreational potential of the Ural region has not yet been fully utilized.  But the prospects for the <span>development of tourism</span> in all Ural regions, from north to south of this mountain range, make it possible in the future to make it attractive not only for Russian skiers.  The Urals can become a place of attraction for fans of this sport on a global scale.  Ski complex "Mount Teplaya" is only one of the most successful investment projects.  Currently, the sports complex has not yet been fully equipped.  It is located near the capital of the Ural region and is an example of how to properly invest in the development of the tourism sector in order to get the desired return on investment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in warm mountain" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/379709.jpg?1398180655790" width="496"></div>

Getting here is pretty easy.  "Teplaya Mountain" is located less than fifty kilometers from the capital of the Urals, Yekaterinburg, near the small town of Pervouralsk.  You should go north along Bilimbaevskoe highway.  The ski complex is very well located on the ground.  This is expressed in the fact that all three of its permanent routes are oriented in the south and south-west directions.  And this circumstance is an excellent natural defense against the northern winds, which could create some discomfort for skiers.  Downhill lovers are provided with three routes with a total length of about two kilometers with a vertical drop of 135 meters.  They differ in degree of difficulty: the side ones are more suitable for beginner athletes, and the central one contains quite complex sections. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Warm Pervouralsk" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/379708.jpg?1398180710286" width="494"></div>

    <h2>  Service and mode of operation </h2><p>  Downhill skiing routes are periodically processed by special equipment and maintained in accordance with international standards accepted for this sport.  Visitors to the Mount Teplaya ski complex can rely on the use of ski lifts and primary ski downhill training with a qualified instructor.  There is a rental center for sports equipment.  Those who are not thrilled enough can even rent a quad bike.  The sports complex is designed for a one-day stay.  There are <span>catering facilities</span> and a guarded parking lot.  Accommodation in hotels of Pervouralsk is possible.  The ski resort accepts visitors from mid-November to mid-April. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="perm warm mountain" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/379707.jpg" width="491"></div>

Its prospects are due to both the increasing popularity of this sport and the general tourist attractiveness of the Ural region.  Many of those who happened to be in the Urals for the first time in their life note with surprise that by its natural expressiveness it is not inferior to Switzerland.  And in terms of the number of mountain slopes suitable for downhill and slalom, it significantly exceeds it.  In addition, a Schengen visa is not required for a trip to the Urals, and staying here is much cheaper.  The development of tourism in the region can bring significant benefits to those who decide to invest in the development of ski infrastructure in the region.  A positive point is the administrative measures taken in most of the Ural regions, aimed at supporting and developing the tourism business. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="warm mountain Perm region" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/379706.jpg?1398180826047" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  Teplaya Gora, Perm Territory </h2><p>  This historical village, founded in the nineteenth century, in the northern Urals is sometimes confused with the name of a popular ski resort in the vicinity of Yekaterinburg.  He has no direct relation to skiing yet.  Nevertheless, the village is very promising in many tourist destinations.  Among other things, in this area there is no shortage of hillsides suitable for downhill.  The deficit is still felt only in the sports and service infrastructure.  On tourist maps, this area is listed mainly as a starting point for hiking in the <span>northern Urals</span> and rafting on the <span>rivers Koiv,</span> Vilva and Usva.  Even though the weather in Teplaya Gora is not always comfortable, these places have their own stable circle of fans who will not exchange these harsh lands for anything else.  It is difficult to single out the season of the year in which the northern Ural foothills would lose their beauty.  These places are attractive primarily for those who dream for a while to break away from the usual benefits of civilization.  You can go here all year long.  You can get there by rail using the Perm-Teplaya Gora train or by bus along the same route.  Travel time is about five hours. </p>
