The most popular services are property protection, health and car insurance.  Reviews about the Renaissance insurance company are left by both satisfied customers and those who do not like the services of the insurer. </p><h2>  About company </h2><p>  The Renaissance began its activities in 1997.  The company immediately became one of the most significant structures in the insurance business.  At the beginning of its activities, its assets amounted to 2.2 billion rubles, and 20 years later, in 2017, their size doubled and amounted to 4.4 billion rubles. </p><p>  During the existence of the company, several subsidiary members of the Renaissance Insurance group were created: </p><ol><li>  Medical insurance company "Medkorp". </li><li>  "Renaissance Life" is an insurer specializing in protecting the life and health of clients. </li><li>  Foundation of NPF Renaissance Life &amp; Pensions.  The fund was later sold. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="kaskohelp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance life insurance company reviews" class="if uuid-3075641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3075641.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews of the Renaissance insurance company, the insurer in 2017 merged with one of the largest <span>non-state pension funds</span> in Russia - NPF Blagosostoyanie.  They created a joint project, Baring Vostok also acted as a partner. </p><h2>  The management of the insurance company "Renaissance" </h2><p>  According to employees of the Renaissance Life insurance company, the involvement of Boris Yordan as the director of the insurance company was an important step towards increasing the brand‚Äôs influence.  Boris Yordan, a well-known businessman, previously led the company NTV and Gazprom Media. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  His connections in the television industry and other media have created an effective advertising campaign.  The result of advertising activities was an increase in the number of clients of Renaissance Insurance by 15%. </p><h2>  Achievements in the insurance business </h2><p>  Already at the beginning of the journey in the insurance business, Renaissance attracted customers with favorable insurance conditions.  Therefore, it is not surprising that, based on the results of its activities, the Renaissance insurance company has always been among the top 15 Russian insurers in terms of capital and products sold. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ibins.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance insurance company customer reviews" class="if uuid-3075654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3075654.jpg"></div><p>  In 2014, Renaissance was the first insurance company in Russia to successfully sell the e-CASCO electronic policy.  Now CASCO can be issued in almost every major insurance company within 15 minutes. </p><p>  Thanks to assets over 3 billion rubles (in 2005), Renaissance was able to buy out one of the leaders in insurance in the North-West region of Russia - the Progress-Neva group.  This allowed to enter the top 3 insurers in the North-West of the Russian Federation in 2005-2007. </p><h2>  Renaissance Insurance Products </h2><p>  In the Renaissance, the client has the right to insure: </p><ul><li>  health; </li><li>  property (house, apartment, cottage); </li><li>  car and driving responsibility; </li><li>  interests during travel (including abroad); </li><li>  mortgage collateral. </li></ul><p>  According to customer reviews of the Renaissance insurance company, all services can be arranged at the insurer's office.  Some products are available to order online. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of car insurance with the insurer "Renaissance" </h2><p>  In 9 out of 10 cases, customers of insurance companies are looking for information about car insurance.  The CASCO policy in the Renaissance, together with the CTP insurance service, is especially popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ameinfo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance life insurance company customer reviews" class="if uuid-3075664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3075664.jpg"></div><p>  To issue a policy, it is not necessary to contact the office of the insurance company.  The policyholder can insure their interests under CASCO or CTP insurance online. </p><h2>  How to buy a hull with a 50% discount? </h2><p>  According to reviews of CASCO in the Renaissance insurance company, it follows that the policy is available for customers to order with a discount of up to 50%.  Buy a policy at a special price can only drivers who do not risk driving.  This requires the installation of the unique SafeDrive app. </p><p>  The application allows you to track the nature of the customer‚Äôs driving in order to take into account the possibilities of obtaining a discount.  Before installing the application, the policyholder must purchase a CASCO policy with a franchise of 15 thousand rubles.  A deductible is the amount by which the insurance company reduces the payment in the event of an insured event. </p><p>  After purchasing a policy and installing SafeDrive, the client must earn the trust of Renaissance.  To do this, you must adhere to the rules of careful driving for 3 months from the date of installation of the application.  Based on the results of driving, the app will evaluate the driver‚Äôs skills using a 10-point system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The assessment will reduce the deductible to 100%.  If the driver received from 7.5 to 10 points, a deductible of 15 thousand rubles will be completely canceled.  With a ride rating of 6.5-7.4 points, the deductible will be reduced by 50%. </p><h2>  Additional savings on CASCO </h2><p>  More than 2/3 of drivers are insured under CASCO with a 5% discount.  These are those who do not include more than 3 clients in their insurance.  The reviews about the Renaissance insurance company describe other ways to save. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mexperience.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance company renaissance reviews for comprehensive insurance" class="if uuid-3075661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3075661.jpg"></div><p>  Neat drivers deserve a 10% discount.  Prior to the sale of the CASCO policy, the company studies the insurance history of customers under the CTP policy.  Those who have not been the initiator of an accident for 1 year or more are given a discount. </p><p>  For drivers who have previously entered into a CASCO insurance contract with another company, discounts of 20 or 30% are provided.  The condition is relevant only for customers who did not have insurance events for the previous insurance period.  A 30% discount is provided to residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg.  Drivers from other regions can extend CASCO at Renaissance 20% cheaper. </p><h2>  Features of car insurance in the Renaissance </h2><p>  According to reviews of the Renaissance Insurance insurance company, the client can independently regulate the terms of insurance under CASCO.  This is very convenient, since there is no need to pay for options that are not of interest to the insured.  In addition, the choice of risks allows to reduce the cost of hull insurance up to 70%. </p><p>  What can be included in CASCO from Renaissance: </p><ul><li>  Damage protection.  A feature of insurance is not just payment for technical repairs, but the ability to receive a refund in cash if the car is significantly damaged.  This applies to cases when as a result of an accident the car cannot be restored.  Money is paid in an amount not exceeding insurance coverage. </li><li>  Payment as a result of damage to the car without the possibility of restoring the vehicle.  If the damage exceeds 75% of the amount of insurance coverage, the client receives a refund.  In case of minor damage insurance is not paid. </li><li>  Vehicle theft insurance. </li><li>  Protection of additional equipment.  Paid for parts, devices that do not belong to the standard set of vehicle release from the manufacturer.  It can be a radio or a video recorder, for example. </li><li>  Liability insurance.  Unlike CTP, CASCO in Renaissance allows you to protect a client in the amount of up to 2.5 million rubles. </li><li>  GAP insurance.  The service is available only for cars no later than the previous year of release.  In the event of an insured event, the client receives a reimbursement of 100% of the insured value of the vehicle. </li><li>  Protection of health and life.  If the driver or passengers were injured, disabled or died as a result of an accident, the payment will be transferred to the beneficiary. </li></ul><h2>  Features of the formation of the policy </h2><p>  According to customers of the Renaissance insurance company, life and health include almost everything in the CASCO policy.  More than 2/3 of the payers prefer to supplement the risk with protecting the vehicle from theft, significant damage.  Every 3rd includes in CASCO additional protection of civil liability. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance insurance company osago reviews" class="if uuid-3075667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3075667.jpg"></div><p>  The client may not include all services in the policy online.  GAP insurance is available only at Renaissance offices.  The possibility of obtaining insurance through the Internet is affected by the cost of the package and the risks involved. </p><h2>  Additional CASCO features </h2><p>  The possibilities of the CASCO program are not limited to individual risks.  According to reviews of the Renaissance insurance company, insurance allows customers to: </p><ul><li>  Repair glass and body parts without reference.  The service is available if the cost of replacing damaged parts is not more than 5% of insurance coverage. </li><li>  Use the commissioner service from the insurance company.  The policyholder can come at the option of the client: for each accident with his participation (issued only at the offices) or an accident with 2 or more participants. </li><li>  Get help on the road in case of an emergency.  For example, if the engine does not start due to severe frost, the Renaissance will help to solve the problem by hiring a specialist.  The service is limited: no more than 3 thousand rubles for each situation. </li><li>  Reimburse the cost of renting a car.  "Renaissance" allows you to get up to 10 thousand rubles for the temporary replacement of a vehicle during the repair of a client‚Äôs car. </li><li>  When evacuating a client‚Äôs car, reimburse a taxi payment in the amount of not more than 2 thousand rubles. </li></ul><h2>  CTP insurance in the Renaissance </h2><p>  Unlike CASCO CTP, it is compulsory insurance for each driver.  Without it, the client does not have the right to drive a vehicle.  Therefore, the existence of a valid OSAGO insurance is a necessity, not a privilege. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thebalance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance insurance company osago customer reviews" class="if uuid-3075671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3075671.jpg"></div><p>  In the Renaissance, customers can order eOSAGO - an electronic version of the document.  It is no different from the classic driver insurance, but it saves the client time.  MTPL is available online on the Renaissance website. </p><p>  According to customer reviews of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in the Renaissance insurance company, the insurer offers a favorable rate and fully complies with legal requirements.  According to the law, compensation is carried out within 400 thousand rubles if the damage is caused to the vehicle, and 500 thousand rubles if the other driver or his passengers were injured. </p><p>  CTP from Renaissance allows you to get paid if the insured is the culprit.  In this case, it is not the client himself who seeks the compensation, but the victim. </p><h2>  Conditions for the purchase of a policy of compulsory motor liability insurance in the Renaissance </h2><p>  When reading reviews on compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in the Renaissance insurance company, customers want to know how much it will cost them to buy or extend compulsory insurance.  The following factors affect the cost of a policy: </p><ul><li>  who concludes the contract: private individual or organization; </li><li>  car model and power; </li><li>  the life of the car; </li><li>  number of drivers included in the policy, length of service and age of clients; </li><li>  the city of residence of the policyholder; </li><li>  accuracy of the driver (whether there were accidents with his participation). </li></ul><p>  The policy can be purchased by presenting the required documents: </p><ol><li>  Passport (if there are several drivers, each will need documents). </li><li>  PTS and STS. </li><li>  Driver's license. </li><li>  Diagnostic card (only for cars older than 3 years). </li></ol><p>  Legal entities are also required to provide a certificate of registration of the organization. </p><p>  When buying an insurance policy, it is worth considering the new changes in the law.  This is relevant only for the electronic version of OSAGO.  As stated in paragraph 7 of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation Directive 4190-U dated 11/14/2016, issued on the website of the insurance company OSAGO will begin to operate no earlier than on the 3rd day after the acquisition. </p><p>  When buying eOSAGO, the driver must print a copy of the policy and always have it with him when he is driving. </p><h2>  CTP or CASCO?  Customer Opinion </h2><p>  According to reviews of the Renaissance insurance company, the life and health of the insured are not risks when purchasing OSAGO.  Therefore, every 10th driver in Russia prefers to protect himself and his car, additionally acquiring a CASCO policy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="impremedia.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews about insurance companies renaissance insurance" class="if uuid-3075670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3075670.jpg"></div><p>  Customer opinions regarding the benefits of CTP and CASCO are divided.  At the same time, those who insured at Renaissance were 85% satisfied with the terms of the insurance company. </p><p>  What do clients of "Renaissance" write in their reviews about OSAGO: </p><ol><li>  The electronic version of the policy after payment was sent to the post office without delay. </li><li>  The insurer complies with the requirements of the legislation regarding the price and tariffs of mandatory motor liability insurance. </li><li>  Those who applied for payment (injured participants in an accident) received reimbursement in 8 out of 10 cases within 6 months of the incident. </li><li>  Support service promptly responds to customer requests.  According to reviews on compulsory motor third-party liability insurance from the Renaissance insurance company, in Moscow the average time for processing a client‚Äôs application does not exceed 15 minutes (when contacting by hotline). </li></ol><p>  The MTPL tariff is up to 10 times more profitable than the conditions for the acquisition of CASCO.  But insurance is aimed at protecting the interests of not the client, but those who suffered as a result of an accident with his participation (including property).  According to reviews of the Renaissance insurance company, life cannot be insured under compulsory motor third-party liability insurance (meaning the life and health of the insured).  Therefore, customers prefer to pay extra and buy a CASCO policy. </p><p>  It guarantees: </p><ul><li>  damages up to 2.5 million rubles; </li><li>  protecting the interests of the insured and its passengers; </li><li>  additional guarantees for customers (paying taxi, renting a vehicle). </li></ul>
