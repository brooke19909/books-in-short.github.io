It is surrounded by the slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range, in which gorges form along the small mountain rivers Olkhovka and Berezovka.  In one of them are the famous Honey Falls. </p><p>  Mountains in Kislovodsk are everywhere; he is surrounded by them.  The city was formed at the location of the Russian fortress at the beginning of the XIX century.

There are many caves in it.  At the edge of the mountain, wind and water formed a large through ring with a diameter of 8 meters.  It is famous for what was described by M. Yu. Lermontov in one of the stories of the “Hero of our time”.  <span>The Caucasus Mountains</span> in Kislovodsk are not in vain considered a landmark.  Many legends and beliefs are associated with them.  The healing air of the mountains, together with mineral waters, has a beneficial effect on human health. </p><p>  <span>Mount Ring</span> is very popular with tourists.  It has been known since the time of the conquest of the Caucasus, when residents of St. Petersburg and Moscow came here for treatment with mineral waters.  Near the ring there are caves, in one of which there is an inscription on the wall, supposedly related to the times of the poet's visit to Kislovodsk.  Be sure to visit this attraction while relaxing in Kislovodsk.  How to get to the mountain ring?  A path leads along it, along which you can buy souvenirs made by local residents.  It starts at the entrance to the city, a pointer points to it. </p><p>  The mountain offers a magnificent view of Kislovodsk to admire it, and at the same time go through the ring to become a strong body and spirit, hundreds of tourists come here daily.  Only when lifting do you need to observe safety rules, since collapses occur here.  In Soviet times, special work was carried out to make the path safe, but recently no one has been doing this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="rusunion.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="honey waterfalls Kislovodsk" class="if uuid-2965904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2965904.jpg"></div><h2>  Honey waterfalls </h2><p>  The Alikon Gorge, where the famous Honey Falls are located, is very popular with tourists.  Kislovodsk is located near them.  This is a group of five waterfalls, each of which has its own name.  The largest waterfall - "Honey" has a height of 18 meters, the smaller falls from a height of 6 meters, the other three break out from under the boulders. </p><p>  Falling from a height, water forms a water cloud that envelops the gorge and the slopes of the mountains.  Water jets under the scorching rays of the sun sparkle with all the colors of the rainbow.  Beautiful nature serves as a frame for this cascade.  Even on the hottest day, coolness and freshness reigns here.  The story of the origin of such an unusual name is amazing. </p><p>  According to local residents, wild bees once lived here.  There were a huge number of them.  During the flowering of herbs, they collected honey, which was stored in hives attached to trees and mountain crevices.  In the gorge, where there are waterfalls, in the summertime there was an aroma of honey and flowering herbs.  Since then, the name Honey has been assigned to the waterfalls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="large saddle kislovodsk" class="if uuid-2965887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2965887.jpg"></div><h2>  Mount Big Saddle </h2><p>  In Kislovodsk and its environs there are a large number of natural attractions.  12 kilometers from the city there is the Big Saddle Mountain, which with its outlines really resembles a saddle.  This is the highest point in the vicinity of the city, its height is 1408 meters above sea level.  From it you can see a magnificent panorama of both the surroundings of Kislovodsk and the surrounding mountains.  Particularly impressive is Mount Elbrus, whose peak is covered with a snow cap. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most tourists come here for beautiful views.  In early summer, there is a flowering of herbs, many of which are medicinal.  The buzzing of bees and the singing of birds make the picture presented idyllic.  Filled with fragrance, clean mountain air calms the nervous system and fills the body with life-giving energy. </p><p>  Well-trodden trails lead to Kislovodsk.  They go to the Big Saddle through the city park, then through the Temple of Air, the Red Sun and the Narzan Gallery.  This is a long walking route, since you need to overcome 12 kilometers of the path, which constantly rises uphill.  But all efforts will pay off with interest, as the panoramic views of the mountains of the Greater Caucasus and Kislovodsk are simply fascinating. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small saddle kislovodsk" class="if uuid-2965873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2965873.jpg"></div><h2>  Mountain Small Saddle Kislovodsk </h2><p>  Vacationers and just tourists who want to see the highest mountain in Europe, Elbrus, make a trip to the Small Saddle Mountain, which rises more than 500 meters above Kislovodsk.  The total height of the mountain above sea level is 1325 meters.  Two routes lead here from Kislovodsk.  Through the western spur and from the park through the Red Sun, then along the hiking trail. </p><p>  From here you can see all the surroundings of the resort town, the valley of the Podkumok river, the grandiose Bermamyt plateau, intersected by deep green beams.  Ahead in the south is a view of the chain of mountains of the Main Caucasian Range, among which the magnificent two-headed Elbrus rises, sparkling in the sun with a snowy peak. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mytravelbook.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mountains in kislovodsk" class="if uuid-2965900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2965900.jpg"></div><h2>  Mount Red Sun </h2><p>  The city of Kislovodsk is the country's main climatic resort.  Terrencourt routes have been laid along its surroundings (cross-country movement, one of the methods of spa treatment).  Routes No. 2 and 3 lead here. They originate from the Narzan Gallery located in the resort park.  No. 2 is longer, No. 3 is more complicated, as the climb goes along the serpentine. </p><p>  Why the mountain got such a name: holiday-makers, coming here in the morning, saw the red sun rise.  And so it happened - Mount Red Sun.  It is all covered with massifs of pine, spruce, ash and birch.  Forbs make the air saturated with floral aromas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cableway in Kislovodsk" class="if uuid-2965877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2965877.jpg"></div><h2>  Cableway </h2><p>  The resort park in Kislovodsk is a unique complex located on the territory of 950 hectares.  This includes a large number of multilevel objects.  Therefore, it was divided into three zones along which routes of paths of varying complexity were laid.  The first (lower) level extends from the Narzan Gallery to the Valley of Roses, the second (middle) level starts from the Valley of Roses and ends with Gray and Red Stones, from them to Mount Small Saddle - the third (high) level. </p><p>  It is between the first and third levels that the cableway functions.  Kislovodsk from the observation deck can be seen in full view.  The cableway, having a length of 1743 meters, is equipped with wagons in which passengers climb up and down. </p><div class="photo" data-original="varandej.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="red stones Kislovodsk" class="if uuid-2965917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2965917.jpg"></div><h2>  Red stones </h2><p>  Gray and red stones are gray and reddish sandstone rocks.  A bright reddish tint to the stones gives nitrogen hydroxide.  For thousands of years, wind and precipitation have honed rocks, giving them unique bizarre shapes.  They are the sightseeings of the resort and are located in the middle and upper level of the park.  In addition, the name "Red Stones" in Kislovodsk is the famous sanatorium. </p><p>  The city has a huge number of health resorts, where people from Russia and neighboring countries come.  Two main factors played a major role in this: life-giving air and healing water.  One of the oldest health resorts is the Red Stones sanatorium located in the central part of the resort in Kislovodsk Park. </p><p>  Until 1991, it was a nomenclature health resort and it was not so simple for a simple person to get here.  Now everything is different.  Sanatorium "Red Stones" is open to anyone.  It treats diseases of the digestive tract, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular systems, metabolism and reproductive organs. </p>
