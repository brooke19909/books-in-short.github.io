It is more appropriate to keep silent about the regions, for example, in Yaroslavl and the region, a young specialist will hardly receive 20,000 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Earnings in private clinics (Moscow) </h2><p>  About how much dentists earn in Moscow, they prefer to remain silent.

From 75,000 rubles, according to last year. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.dentistry.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Young doctor" class="if uuid-3139125" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78846/3139125.jpg"></div><h2>  Salary in other regions </h2><p>  How much does a dentist earn in Russia on average?  <span>Salaries</span> range from 50,000 thousand rubles, but everyone understands how the average figure is calculated.  By the principle: Seryozha has ten candies, and Ira has two.  On average, each child has six sweets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="allsmiles-dental.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's dentist" class="if uuid-3139122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78846/3139122.jpg"></div><p>  Consider the wages of specialists working in private clinics.  Before readers a list reflecting the regions and areas with the highest earnings: </p><ul><li>  In the first place - Moscow region, which is not surprising.  In the city of Pushkino, the average salary of a dentist is 100,000 rubles, in Zvenigorod - 80,000 rubles, in Khimki - 60,000 rubles. </li><li>  The second line is occupied by the Ryazan region.

Dentists earn about 70,000 rubles on average. </li><li>  In the Magadan Region, the salary of a dentist in a private clinic varies between 56,500 rubles. </li><li>  Three thousand less will receive dentists working in the Kostroma region - 53,500 rubles. </li><li>  The Republic of Sakha closes the list, where the average income of a good specialist is 52,000 rubles. </li></ul><h2>  Benefits of working in a private clinic </h2><p>  How much a dentist earns in Russia, working with a private hospital, we found out.  Consider the main advantages of this work: </p><ol><li>  Official employment.  Many clinics offer specialists full-time employment with all due deductions to the tax service and pension fund. </li><li>  There are private hospitals in which employees provide hot meals.  It may seem unthinkable, but it's free. </li><li>  Bonuses and bonuses for good work are another plus of private dental clinics. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="centreforimplantdentistry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scared customer" class="if uuid-3139124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78846/3139124.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative aspects of employment </h2><p>  Working in a private hospital, having an extensive client base and receiving excellent salaries is the dream of many dentists.  Why do they prefer to work for less money than to find a job in a private clinic? </p><p>  The fact is that payroll depends on its owner.  They are different: adequate or not quite.  To get to work for the latter is sheer hell.  Dentists who have such experience are willing to share their memories. </p><p>  For example, a leader may begin to find fault with trifles.  The dentist working with him will have no idea why he will be fined next time.  As a result, fines are regular, first at 100 rubles, then at 200 rubles, and on an increasing basis.  One day, the manager will not like the look of his employee, then something else.  The dentist will be fined again, after which he will sooner or later change his job at will.  Tired of enduring such a boss. </p><div class="photo" data-original="loveteethdp.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Doctor and patient" class="if uuid-3139120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78846/3139120.jpg"></div><h2>  Are bad specialists taken to private clinics? </h2><p>  How much a dentist earns in Russia, we found out.  As well as the features of payroll, we sorted it out: this is a mark-up on work and materials, interest and bonuses. </p><p>  Private clinics prefer not to mess with young specialists, citing the lack of the necessary experience.  However, among professionals there are those from whom the client wants to cry.  The fact is that such dentists untwist their patients for money where it would be possible to do with little blood. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nypost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bad doctor" class="if uuid-3139126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78846/3139126.jpg"></div><p>  Practitioners speak dismissively of such colleagues, considering them deceivers chasing easy money.  Managers look at bad specialists (we are talking about the moral plane) in different ways.  Some dismiss those, others are encouraged, having additional income from their activities. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Readers now know how much a dentist earns in Russia.  Amounts are quite decent, especially in Moscow and the Moscow region.  Before reaching a similar level of income, a young specialist has to torment himself as a dental assistant, and then in state hospitals, where the income is minuscule.  At least for a person who has devoted about 10 years to school, has a family and is forced to support her. </p><p>  Is it worth it to study at the dentist, everyone decides for himself.  If there is a disposition to this matter and an opportunity for full study, why not.  Just remember that it is necessary to find a job as an assistant assistant as a student.  Many future specialists clutch at other part-time jobs, missing the opportunity to gain the necessary experience.  Without it, it is impossible to find a job even in a state institution. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The article has come to an end.  We hope that readers have received comprehensive answers to their questions.  Once again, we recall how much a dentist receives in Russia on average: from 50,000 thousand rubles or more.  It all depends on the region of his residence and skills. </p>
