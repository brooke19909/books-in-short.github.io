Among them are expensive coins of Ukraine.  There are two types of rare <span>coins: loose change</span> and jubilee (commemorative and investment). </p><h2>  General Provisions </h2><p>  What are rare and expensive coins of Ukraine?  An indicator of such a phenomenon as a rare coin is, first of all, its circulation.  It is he who forms its value.  The second component is the <span>market price.</span>  The simplest and most common misconception is that the older the coin, the more expensive it is.  This is not true.  In the history of numismatics, it also happened that coins of 300 years ago simply did not cost anything because of the large circulation. </p>

    <h2>  List of expensive coins of Ukraine </h2><p>  The cost of <span>rare coins of Ukraine</span> varies in the amount of hundreds to thousands of rubles.  These are coins of 1996 and 1994, 2003 and 2001, as well as 1992.  Price List: </p><ul><li>  1 kopeck minted in 1994 costs 1,600 rubles, and in 1996 - no more than 550 rubles. </li><li>  2 kopeks issued back in 1992 cost 10,000 rubles.  1996 and 2003 - less rare - are estimated at 550 and 1600 rubles, respectively. </li><li>  5 kopecks in 1994 cost 15,000 rubles, in 1996 - 450-550 rubles, and in 2003 - in the region of six hundred Russian rubles. </li><li>  10 kopecks minted in 2001 cost 600-800 rubles. </li><li>  25 kopecks in 1995 of release cost up to 2500 rubles, and in 2001 - 550-800 rubles.  But the most expensive 25 kopecks were issued in 2003 - their cost varies between 2500-3000 rubles. </li><li>  50 kopecks in 2001 are not the rarest, but they cost 550-700 rubles, and the rarest in 2003 - 1600-1900 rubles. </li><li>  1 hryvnia, which appeared in 1992 - the most expensive coin in Ukraine.  It can cost numismatists from 14,000 to 16,000 rubles.  The hryvnia of 1995 is estimated to be less than 150-250 rubles.  And one hryvnia in 2008 - 300-500 rubles. </li></ul><h2>  The most expensive coin in Ukraine </h2><p>  There are also non-standard coins of Ukraine, on which the year of issue is not indicated.  They were first minted at the Lugansk Engineering Plant in 1992, along with standard coins.  They were put into circulation in 1996, during the time of the monetary reform.  These defective (experimental) coins were distinguished by metal, dimensions, weight.  It is to them that numismatists are of particular interest, since they have survived to this day.  So, the rare and expensive coins of Ukraine include commemorative, commemorative and investment coins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  5 hryvnia </h2><p>  Ukrainian coins in 5 hryvnia are only commemorative and commemorative.  They are classified by the metal of which they are made.  There are 4 types of them: </p><ol><li>  From nickel silver.  There are a lot of them (unlike others).  From nickel silver they made coins that were dedicated to the founding dates of important cities of Ukraine. </li><li>  Of silver.  The cost of such a coin is almost the same as the cost of the metal from which it is made + extra charges.  For example, the jubilee coin ‚Äú100th Anniversary of Kiev National Economic University‚Äù with a face value of 5 hryvnias in 2006. </li><li>  From nickel silver.  <span>Bimetallic coins</span> with a high circulation and low cost in the market.  Such were in the series "Anniversary dates for the creation of areas." </li><li>  Of gold. <h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of expensive coins of Ukraine" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15108/408806.jpg" width="500"></div></h2></li></ol><h2>  Investment coins </h2><p>  Investment Ukrainian coins are divided into two categories.  These categories are determined by the metal from which they were made - gold and silver.  The issue itself began in 2011, a series of coins was called "Archangel Michael."  This series was made of different metals, and the coins were of different weights.  Also in this series there are several coins that can be referred to as the most expensive coin in Ukraine.  Nowadays, there are 5 types of such coins: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  20 hryvnias.  She is the most expensive coin of Ukraine from this series.  Its cost is 60,000 rubles.  Together with the edge, its thickness is 2.4 mm.  The mass of the metal is 31.10 g and the diameter of the coin is 32 mm </li><li>  10 hryvnia.  Such a coin costs 26,000 rubles.  The mass is fifteen and a half grams and the diameter is 25 mm.  The very thickness of the coin along with the edge is 2 mm. </li><li>  5 hryvnia.  It costs 14,000 rubles.  Its diameter is 20 millimeters, weight is 7.78 g, and the thickness along with the edge is 1.6 mm.  One of the distinguishing features of this coin is the quality of minted "antircirculated". </li><li>  2 hryvnias.  Quite small, and the price is the same, only 4800 rubles.  The thickness with the edge is 1.1 mm, the diameter of the coin is 16 mm, and the mass of the metal is 3.11 grams. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="expensive coins of Ukraine" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15108/408808.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  All of the above <span>valuable coins of</span> Ukraine are made of 999 gold, and their edge is sectoral corrugation. </p><ul><li>  1 hryvnia.  It costs only 1200 rubles.  This is the only coin made of 999 silver.  Its groove is corrugated, its diameter is 38.6 mm, its mass is 31.10 g, and the thickness along with the hermet is three millimeters. </li></ul><p>  On the reverse of each coin is the archangel Michael, mentioned in the Bible as the patron saint of warriors and the conqueror of evil.  At the top of the coin is the State <span>Emblem of Ukraine,</span> and on the shield is the logo of the National Bank of Ukraine: griffins, between which the hryvnia. </p><h2>  The main thing is not to miscalculate </h2><p>  The value of any investment coins depends on the price of the metal from which they were produced.  Therefore, before buying, you need to study the cost of an ounce of silver and gold and compare with the mass of the coin, only then you can understand whether its price is real. </p>

    <h2>  EURO 2012 </h2><p>  The most expensive Ukrainian coin in our time is 500 hryvnias dedicated to the final of EURO 2012.  The high cost of such a coin is determined by the material from which it is created - 500 grams of gold, as well as the circulation - 500 pieces.  This makes it truly the most expensive coin.  According to some reports, its exact cost is 1 012 388 rubles.  All coins that have value in our time will not fit on the page, if you make a list.  In fact, the high cost of most commemorative coins is associated with a high content of precious metals in them, and only a small part will be expensive because of the rarity and small issue. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  A valuable coin can also act as a symbol of power.  It is rumored that coins with the inscription ‚Äú10 years of Ukrainian independence‚Äù in denominations of twenty hryvnias containing 62 grams of silver were issued in a rather small print run of 1000 coins, and only deputies and ministers of Ukraine received them.  There is nothing left for collectors.  But the rarest coins of Ukraine are silver, weighing 1 kilogram. </p>
