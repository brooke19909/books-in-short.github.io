At the same time, Beeline Smart 2 features quite good, and for the most part, superior parameters of other devices of the corresponding price category.  Despite the fact that this phone is locked for use only on Beeline SIM cards, it can be flashed, and then used with SIM cards of other mobile operators. </p><h2>  Beeline Smart 2: basic characteristics </h2><p>  If you buy a phone on a stock from an operator, this does not mean that it will be of poor quality.  The practice of buying a phone with a contract with the operator came to us from America.  There on such stocks you can buy an iPhone for a third of the price.  For example, the 5S model costs a contract for only 199 dollars.  However, our contracts are open-ended, and operators are asked to pay a fee several months in advance. </p><p>  When considering Beeline Smart 2, its characteristics can be assessed as quite acceptable.  For the price you had to pay for the device along with the <span>monthly fee,</span> you get a smartphone with a four-inch <span>touch screen.</span> </p>

    <p>  The display of this device is quite clear and displays 16 million colors in a resolution of 800 by 480. Of the <span>positive qualities of</span> this display can also be called a good viewing angle.  You can set the brightness, which will be the most comfortable.  In general, the display is a strong point of this device.  Touch multi-touch system responds immediately, you do not have to click on it several times, which also can not but rejoice.  The phone lies comfortably in your hand and has a small weight - only 124 grams.  As a drawback, you can specify only the grainy surface of the rear housing cover.  A significant flaw is considered only by those who do not like this design.  Meanwhile, such a cover helps to hold the phone.  The filling "Beeline Smart 2" characteristics are also very good for its price category.  First of all, a dual-core processor with a frequency of 1.2 gigahertz is good.  With it, you can easily visit pages on the Internet, view photos and videos (including from the network).  RAM is only 512 MB, but when working with ordinary applications that do not require high performance, this resource is quite enough, and the gadget responds very quickly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Embedded Media </h2>

    <p>  The smartphone has only 4 GB of internal memory, but this is enough for a small number of lightweight applications.  To store information, such as music, you can put an SD card with a capacity of up to 32 GB.  Also on the card you can store photos that are taken using a 3 megapixel camera without flash.  Using Beeline Smart 2, the quality photo can be made quite acceptable, despite the small number of pixels.  In the application, which is responsible for the operation of the camera, you can select various settings as you wish. </p><h2>  What options does the standard Beeline Smart 2 firmware contain? </h2><p>  In order to make it more convenient for the user to work with the Beeline network, special applications are preinstalled on the smartphone.  Among them there is an antivirus from Eset, which you will get for free.  There are also applications that have been developed by Beeline specialists.  Using them, you can change the dial tone, listen to music and connect services. </p>

    <p>  Many people want to change the standard firmware so that the smartphone acquires new qualities, and this can be done, but no one guarantees stable operation after this manipulation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the option "Mobile TV", which comes with other programs.  When the smartphone only connects to the video stream, the image and sound slow down a bit, but after a few seconds the TV starts showing no worse than satellite. </p><h2>  How to unlock "Smart 2 Beeline" </h2><p>  If you want to work with a SIM card of another operator, then ZTE provides for the introduction of a phone unlock code, which can be purchased separately.  This is done through the official website of the manufacturer.  You can go there through intermediaries (there are several sites from which you should choose a proven one). </p><h2>  NSK </h2><p>  The code will not be provided to you immediately, in some cases it is necessary to wait up to 4 days.  The fact is that it is obtained using the official manufacturer base.  The price of the NSK code is also due to the fact that everything is done officially, and the manufacturer also provides the code for a fee.  At the same time, from an economic point of view, it is more profitable if on Beeline Smart 2 unlocking occurs using a code. </p>

A change of software will also help so that the gadget can work with all SIM cards.  On a Beeline Smart 2 phone, unlocking is possible not only with a code, but also by changing the firmware.  This method requires a small amount of knowledge, skills and root-law.  However, you can change the firmware yourself only at your own peril and risk, since there are currently no official versions.

    <h2>  What is the difference between ordinary firmware from CyanogenMod </h2><p>  First of all, Beeline Smart 2 has the system firmware blocked for using a SIM card of one operator.  The modified CyanogenMod firmware, the most popular among users who decided to improve the performance of their device, has no problem using one operator.  In addition, with the help of it you can get a more advanced device in terms of iron compliance with the gadget system.  It is possible to solve with the help of a flashing the situation when Beeline Smart 2 does not turn on.  It is not necessary to install modified firmware for this, just put the official one from ZTE. </p><h2>  How to install firmware on a smartphone? </h2><p>  The instruction ‚ÄúSmart 2 Beeline‚Äù does not stipulate that the user will independently change the software on the device.  It should be noted that there are also several standard algorithms for such cases.  In order to unlock the Beeline Smart 2 phone, you will need to reset the firmware using the Open C Upgrade Tool.  First of all, you need to install this program on your desktop computer, then to update the firmware of the device through it.  Now you will need to enable the device <span>debugging via USB</span> and connect it to a personal computer.  After these manipulations, the Connected program should see and identify your phone.  Then in the program window it is necessary to mark the item Erase CEFS with a marker.  Next, you need to specify the path to the folder with the firmware version.  Once everything is ready, you will see the status ‚ÄúReady‚Äù in the window. </p>

    <p>  It is important that at this moment only the telephone is connected to the PC.  Other devices may fail.  Before the installation is completed, in no case should the connection be interrupted, since in this case the device will not work, and in some cases the help of a wizard from the service center may be required in order for it to start working again.  In order to start the software installation, you must click on the ‚ÄúUpgrade‚Äù button.  At the end of the program, you will see a window with a message stating that the update was completed successfully.  And in order to determine whether the unlock was successful, you need to insert a SIM card of any operator and check its operability.  Usually only this measure is enough for the phone to support all operators. </p><h2>  Unlock with Cyanogenmod </h2><p>  In order to install this firmware modifier, you need to download the firmware and gapps to the memory card.  They are usually distributed in archives, so they must be placed on a map.  Please note that the name of the folder in which the archive is located must be written in Latin letters.  The CWM archive must be unpacked to the root of any drive, after which the phone in the "recovery" mode must be connected to the PC.  Run the file in bat format, after which the firmware of your device will start, after the work is completed, the phone will reboot.  If the firmware did not finish correctly, and the message ‚Äúwaiting for device‚Äù appears, then you need to take a few more steps to restore the functionality of your device. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Those who have Windows 7 or 8 operating systems installed on their desktop PCs need to open the list of all devices and find Android in it.  In the menu, select <span>"Update Driver"</span> and find it yourself.  Most often, the driver is stored under the name or in the ZTE Android adb interface folder. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ XP users need to additionally download the driver and install it on a PC. </p><p>  After the download from the PC has finished, you need to download the smartphone in debug mode and do all Wipe-procedures.  Then you can start installing data from archives.  Start with CWM and then install gapps.  At the end of the installation, reboot the system. </p><h2>  freedom of choice </h2><p>  After loading the smartphone, you will find that it can work with any SIM card, as well as the installed mod.  This firmware is able to solve the general problem of saving applications and their data on an SD card, so users often use it. </p><h2>  How to fix possible bugs when working with non-standard firmware </h2>

There are not many ways to avoid this, since the manufacturer does not recommend using unofficial software, and the developers of the mod do not guarantee operability.  First of all, use the latest firmware to install.  If the phone is unstable, it is best to flash it back to stock software.  You should not carry out the firmware without having experience in this field, since in the absence of it, instead of increasing productivity, you can get a completely inoperative device.
