  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Payment of overhaul contributions: calculation of the amount, payment rules, deadlines and benefits</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Overhaul is a procedure consisting in improving the main parts of a house.  This process requires spending a really large amount of money.  In order for the necessary amount of funds to already be available for repairs, all residents of the apartment building must pay the fees for major repairs.  If there is a need for expensive and specific repairs, then there will already be an optimal amount for these purposes. </p><h2>  Payment details </h2><p>  Based on the provisions of Article  169 ZhK each owner of an apartment in an apartment building must transfer a certain amount of funds for major repairs and maintenance of property.  The process of depositing funds begins 8 months after the relevant program is adopted in a specific region, the main purpose of which is the creation of a capital repair fund. </p><p>  According to the law, the payment of capital repairs should be voluntary, but in fact, citizens are faced with the fact that if for various reasons they do not transfer funds, then they accumulate debt, collected through the court by compulsory methods. </p><p>  The obligation to deposit funds arises for a person immediately after registration of ownership of real estate.  Payment of contributions for the overhaul of common property is carried out every month. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.midlandgroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment of the overhaul fee via the Internet" class="if uuid-3062203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3062203.jpg"></div><h2>  When can I not pay? </h2><p>  Not always the payment of contributions for the overhaul of an apartment building is mandatory.  In some situations, owners of apartments in the house are exempted from the need to transfer funds.  These include the following situations: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  the house is officially recognized as emergency, therefore, even after major and costly repairs, it will not be suitable for further residence of people; </li><li>  the land plot where the building is located is withdrawn for the needs of the state or municipality, therefore, people are offered other apartments for a certain period, but during this period funds are not transferred to pay for the overhaul; </li><li>  the owner of the apartment may be a beneficiary under federal or regional legislation, so he is either completely exempt from payment, or receives a significant discount. </li></ul><p>  The above list is exhaustive, therefore, there are no other options for exemption from payment.  If the house is considered to be in disrepair, from the next month the column related to overhaul will be excluded from receipts.  Moreover, if the funds transferred for these purposes earlier are available on the current account, then they will be returned to all residents of the house.  Even the new owner of the apartment who has not paid for a long time overhaul fee can receive such a payment. </p><h2>  Deposit Rules </h2><p>  The procedure for paying capital repair fees is the same for all residents of an apartment building.  This is indicated in Art.  169 LCDs, as well as regional operators, keep a strict record of the timing of depositing funds.  The fee is set at the regional level by local authorities. </p><p>  A person who has bought housing on the basis of a contract of sale must pay a fee for this property as early as next month.  If it turns out that the former owner did not pay a fee, then the debts will have to be repaid by the new owner.  This is due to the fact that the debt is assigned to the apartment, and not to a particular citizen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Based on the provisions of the LCD, payment of overhaul fees should be made monthly until the 10th day.  If a delay is revealed, the apartment owner will have to pay fines and penalties for each day of delay.  With a significant increase in debt, the operator can file a lawsuit against the tenant of the premises for the forced collection of money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment of capital repair fees" class="if uuid-3062209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3062209.jpg"></div><h2>  Creation of overhaul fund </h2><p>  Funds transferred by the owners of the apartments are sent to a specialized fund created to accumulate money for major repairs in the future. </p><p>  In addition, residents of an apartment building can decide to open a special account to which they will transfer money for expensive repairs.  In this case, a specific person is appointed who will be engaged in the collection and use of funds. </p><p>  If a regional operator is selected for these purposes, then it strictly records incoming funds.  This money is not allowed to be used for purposes other than high-quality repair work; therefore, it is not used to pay workers or other purposes. </p><h2>  Payment Amount </h2><p>  Each owner of an apartment in an apartment building has an obligation to pay capital repair fees.  But the board size may vary slightly in different regions.  It is the administration of a particular region that sets the minimum rates on the basis of which the amount of payment is calculated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To determine the final size of the payment, you must multiply the regional tariff by the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment.  Additionally, regional authorities have the opportunity to introduce benefits for the payment of capital repairs. </p><p>  When setting the minimum tariff, the following factors are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  how much minimal repair work is covered by collected means; </li><li>  whether payments are available for property owners, for which the size of the payment on housing and utility bills receipts is taken into account; </li><li>  What kind of support is given to the regions from the federal budget. </li></ul><p>  Even in one entity, the tariff may differ, for which the district in which the multi-apartment building is located is taken into account.  On average, a fee of 15 rubles is set.  for 1 square.  m </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbcnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="overhaul" class="if uuid-3062205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3062205.jpg"></div><h2>  Can owners themselves determine the size of the fee? </h2><p>  Payment of contributions to the capital repair fund may not be made, since the residents of one house can independently open a bank account where the funds allocated for overhaul will be transferred.  In this case, citizens at a general meeting of owners decide on the optimal payment amount. </p><p>  But when choosing a size, it is taken into account that it cannot be lower than the tariff established by local authorities.  It is allowed to reduce the amount of contributions, but only on the condition that through the use of common property the house can receive any income.  The decision regarding the use of this property for rental is made by all apartment owners at a general meeting. </p><p>  At the meeting, it is additionally determined who will be the owner of this account.  To do this, you can organize a HOA or housing cooperative.  In addition, the Criminal Code responsible for the multi-apartment building is often selected.  The responsible company must send payment documentation to each tenant. </p><h2>  What information is contained in the receipt? </h2><p>  Responsible for the collection of funds may be a regional operator, cooperative, HOA or UK.  The selected organization must generate special receipts, sent further to each owner of the apartment in the building.  It is on the basis of these payment documents that payments are made for the overhaul of the MKD.  This payment receipt contains the following information: </p><ul><li>  amount of monthly payment; </li><li>  the amount of debt, if the owner of the apartment did not transfer the fee for the previous months on time; </li><li>  applicable tariff; </li><li>  details for the transfer of funds. </li></ul><p>  If the management company is appointed as the fundraiser, the overhaul fee is usually included in the standard receipt with utilities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.volyn24.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment procedure for capital repairs" class="if uuid-3062208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3062208.jpg"></div><h2>  Deposit Methods </h2><p>  Payments for major repairs can be made in various ways.  Apartment owners choose the best method for depositing money on their own.  The most common methods include: </p><ul><li>  payment through cash desks of banking institutions; </li><li>  use of terminals belonging to different banks; </li><li>  appeal to employees of post offices; </li><li>  the use of various services on the Internet, for example, online banking or electronic means; </li><li>  depositing funds through a mobile bank. </li></ul><p>  When applying to different organizations, you need to prepare for a commission.  Most often, regional operators enter into agreements with post offices, so when contacting these organizations, you can minimize the size of the commission. </p><h2>  How to make a payment? </h2><p>  Payment of the overhaul fee via the Internet or in another way is possible only if the following information is available: </p><ul><li>  personal account number assigned for a particular apartment in the house; </li><li>  details of a regional operator or a special current account open for fundraising. </li></ul><p>  Data on the amount of payment is usually sent by operators to different payment systems, so it is not difficult to find the details. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.winterparkha.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment of general repair fees" class="if uuid-3062204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3062204.jpg"></div><h2>  The nuances of payment through Sberbank-online </h2><p>  Most often, citizens prefer to use methods that allow them not to leave home to pay for overhaul.  For this, online banking or a mobile bank is considered the ideal solution.  If a person has a Sberbank card, then he can connect online banking, through which various operations are performed at home. </p><p>  To transfer funds to pay for overhaul, the following actions are performed in the system: </p><ul><li>  you must first log in to the Sberbank system, for which one-time passwords or SMS messages arriving on the phone are used; </li><li>  the section for payments and transfers is selected in the main menu; </li><li>  Further there is a link offering payment for utilities or a mobile phone; </li><li>  in a new window there will be several sub-items, among which a line called ‚ÄúQuarter payment‚Äù is selected; </li><li>  several organizations will be represented, among which the desired institution is selected, and usually it is represented by a capital repair fund; </li><li>  after choosing the right institution, account details are entered into the open form where funds should be transferred; </li><li>  a card or account is selected, from where the funds will be transferred; </li><li>  after entering the necessary information, a receipt will open with the previously entered values, which must be carefully checked; </li><li>  Confirms the deposit of funds with a special code that comes to the citizen's phone in the form of SMS messages; </li><li>  Further, a receipt confirming the transfer of funds will be available in the online banking account. </li></ul><p>  This method is considered the most simple and convenient for many citizens, so often people take this opportunity.  But for the transfer of funds, a commission may be charged, which must be provided in advance so that the necessary amount of funds is available on the account. </p><h2>  How long do you have to pay? </h2><p>  The deadline for the payment of capital repairs according to the recommendations of the Ministry of Construction is 30 years.  Repair work will be implemented in different years, as well as in stages.  Since even in the future repairs will be required, it is planned that the overhaul program will become unlimited. </p><p>  Payments cease only when the house is declared emergency. </p><p>  The term for depositing funds is determined by the provisions of Art.  155 LCD  It indicates that payment of overhaul fees via the Internet or other means must be made by the 10th of each month.  It is allowed to establish a different term, for which a decision is made at a meeting of apartment owners in the house. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbcnewyork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment of contributions to the capital repair fund" class="if uuid-3062207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3062207.jpg"></div><h2>  What work is done? </h2><p>  The depositing of funds into a special account or into a capital repair fund is required so that in the future, if necessary, really serious, expensive and complex work is performed.  Therefore, due to these funds, the following actions can be implemented: </p><ul><li>  repair of communication engineering networks represented by equipment for power supply, gas supply, heating or water supply; </li><li>  installation of metering devices; </li><li>  assembly of nodes, with the help of which control and regulation of various engineering systems is provided; </li><li>  replacement of the elevator or its complicated repair if it breaks for various reasons or is completely considered unsuitable for further operation; </li><li>  repairs in the elevator shaft; </li><li>  improving the condition of the roof, for which the coating can be replaced or the overlap can be improved at all; </li><li>  carrying out repair work on the facade of the building, in the basement, as well as in other rooms and places that relate to the common property of the house; </li><li>  overhaul of the foundation, the condition of which worsens over time. </li></ul><p>  All of the above works require a significant amount of funds.  Therefore, it is necessary to collect money in advance so that immediately after the breakdown you do not have to recover substantial amounts of money from the apartment owners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rogers-masonry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="overhaul obligation" class="if uuid-3062210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3062210.jpg"></div><h2>  What are the federal benefits offered? </h2><p>  Benefits for the payment of capital repairs may be federal or regional.  In the first case, residents of any region who are included in the category of beneficiaries can count on relief.  These include the following citizens: </p><ul><li>  invalids and participants of the Second World War; </li><li>  war veterans; </li><li>  people with a special sign that confirms that they are residents of besieged Leningrad; </li><li>  disabled people of the first two groups; </li><li>  children with disabilities and their parents; </li><li>  Russian citizens exposed to radiation for various reasons. </li></ul><p>  If the house is deemed to be in emergency condition or seized for the needs of the state or municipality, then the payment of capital repair fees ceases.  Compensation of previously transferred funds is paid to each owner of an apartment in such a building. </p><h2>  Regional exemptions </h2><p>  Additionally, different citizens can rely on preferences based on a decision made by representatives of local authorities.  For example, benefits are often offered for the payment of capital repair contributions to pensioners or large families.  In some cities, benefits are offered to low-income families, in which each family member has less than half the minimum wage. </p><p>  Preferences can be represented by large discounts or even a complete exemption from the need to pay funds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ruidoso-nm.gov" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="capital repair dues" class="if uuid-3062202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3062202.jpg"></div><h2>  The consequences of no payments </h2><p>  If a citizen who owns an apartment in an apartment building consciously refuses to transfer funds to pay for overhaul, he will have to face the following negative consequences: </p><ul><li>  interest and penalties; </li><li>  collection of debt by compulsory means through the court and bailiffs; </li><li>  the inability to carry out a major overhaul, since there will not be the necessary amount on the account for these purposes, so living in such a house will become dangerous for all residents; </li><li>  living in a house where the elevator does not work, stucco disappears or the roof leaks. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, each person living in such real estate must responsibly approach their obligations in paying for various utilities.  These include payment for overhaul. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Payment of overhaul is the responsibility of each owner of an apartment in an apartment building.  Funds can be directed to regional operators or to a special account opened by apartment owners.  The minimum tariff is set by the local authorities in the region. </p><p>  You can transfer funds in different ways, so each homeowner can choose the appropriate method.  Lack of payment for overhaul will lead to the appearance of large debt, fines and other negative consequences. </p>
