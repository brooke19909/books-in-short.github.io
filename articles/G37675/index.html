There are problems opening the back cover. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About cost and operating system </h2><p>  XL - this can be said, "elder brother" X of the "Nokia".  You can buy it on average for 7000 rubles.  The device works on the basis of its own firmware, bringing the appearance of the interface closer to Windows Phone.  This, of course, limits the possibilities and makes it impossible to access services from Google, including Play. </p><h2>  What's in the box? </h2><p>  The kit for the device includes: </p><ul><li>  headset, unfortunately, without a call key; </li><li>  Charger that connects to microUSB. </li></ul><h2>  Nokia XL Dual, review: a brief about the main </h2><p>  The screen is made using TFT IPS technology and has a resolution of 480 x 800 pixels, or 187 dots per inch.  The processor of the device is dual-core with a frequency of 1 GHz.  RAM - 768 MB.  The internal memory of the smartphone is 4 GB.  Dimensions - 41.4 x 77.7 x 10.9 mm.  These Nokia XL specifications say a lot, but do not allow to appreciate this unit. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Allows you to explore the look of the Nokia XL photo.  The buyer is offered a wide variety of color schemes.  It is possible to install a different color phone cover.  The build quality of the phone can be called ideal.  Given that it is collapsible, when you hold it in your hand, this is not felt.  Thanks to the polycarbonate from which the case is made, the phone does not scratch, does not slip, pleasant and firm to the touch.  Its front side is completely covered by glass.  The five-inch display has an aspect ratio of 16:10.  Directly above it is the eye of the <span>front camera.</span>  There are also light and proximity sensors.  Under the display, the manufacturer placed touch keys. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the bottom there is a microUSB connector.  On the top there is a 3.5 mm headset input.  The right end carries a polycarbonate volume rocker.  Below it is a lock / power button. </p><p>  In the middle of the rear panel is the camera eye, above which the flash is located.  In the lower back of the case there is a speaker. </p><p>  An easily removable cover hides the battery, connectors for two SIM cards and a microSD slot. </p>

    <h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  Ease of use Nokia XL Dual SIM is provided by a small weight - only 190 grams, thoughtful arrangement of buttons, rounded back cover.  Despite its size, it lies comfortably in the hand.  Its shape follows the shape of the palm.  The rough body inspires confidence that the device will not slip out of the hand.  The lock and volume keys comfortably fit under your fingers, which makes it possible to control the device with one hand. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  This device is quite large and bright.  Generally pleasant, but still budget.  It features high quality performance, has the correct color rendering and wide enough viewing angles.  I would like the pixel density to be higher, but this is quite enough so that the eyes do not get tired when working with the device for a long time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Disadvantages include poor glare protection.  No matter how you turn the device, and reflections can not be avoided.  A finger glides freely around the screen, which pleases that it does not get dirty much. </p><h2>  Interface </h2><p>  The most interesting in this device, of course, is its interface.  In it (which may upset fans of this software), very little remains of Android.  The firmware was developed based on an outdated version of this operating system.  The new interface is called Fastlane, since there is practically nothing left of the old one.  We must pay tribute to the developers - it turned out to be very simple and understandable and prettier than Google. </p><p>  Icons located on the poles have a colorful background.  The screen can be scrolled down like a web page, which is clear, convenient and pretty.  At the top is a search bar, using which you can easily search the Internet and open applications. </p><p>  Swipe opens the curtain from the bottom up, in which you can switch between SIM cards, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, turn off the sound, etc. It's bad that there is no flashlight icon here. </p><p>  The only place that clearly testifies to the fact that this is still ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù is the settings menu.  It, like all "google phones".  If desired, the Fastlane interface can be changed to another ‚Äúlauncher‚Äù - and the device will become more similar to Android devices.  But doing this is not recommended, since the installed one is adapted for this device and is much more convenient than the others. </p>

    <p>  There are no non-screen keys, which allowed to give more space under the screen.  There is only one touch key.  A short press returns to the previous position, a long press transfers it to the home screen (which, of course, is very convenient in operation). </p><p>  To say that the device flies means to lie, but its speed is still very good.  The device does not have long freezes. </p><p>  Despite the fact that it is not tied to Google, it allows you to use social networks and transfer photos.  Although there is no Play Market in the device, all the familiar applications can be found in the Nokia store. </p><p>  The choice in it, of course, is not the same as on Google Play, but there are no various virus applications and garbage.  And Yandex.Store provides almost everything you need for a not-so-demanding user.  At the same time, the choice is better than that of Windows Phone. </p><p>  Advanced users will certainly be disappointed.  But they can solve all their problems by flashing the device. </p><h2>  Photo video </h2>

    <p>  The advantages of all Nokia include their cameras.  But you should not be very happy, because this is still a state employee, and not a representative of the Lumiy line.  Therefore, PureView is not here. </p><p>  The main camera is 5 megapixel.  With it, you can take quite good pictures during the day.  But even with artificial lighting, they leave much to be desired.  The device has autofocus and flash.  The flash is more for show, but autofocus is pretty good.  Color rendering is clearly dull.  The image is easily smeared, so you need to hold the smartphone tightly in your hands and not take pictures on the go - nothing good will come of it. </p><p>  The front camera is only good because it is.  But for those who do not need a high-quality image when communicating on Skype, it‚Äôs quite suitable.  But for "selfie" on Instagram it is better not to use it. </p><h2>  Wireless interfaces </h2>

    <p>  Smartphone Nokia XL Dual SIM does not indulge in a variety of wireless technologies.  Neither MIRACAST nor NFC smartphone supports it.  Of course, like others, it has a good Wi-Fi gadget and, although outdated, it works stably without Bluetooth glitches. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The device can function for a sufficiently long time without recharging.  This makes it possible a fairly capacious 2000 mAh battery, not a powerful processor and low <span>screen resolution.</span>  On the day of the charge, even the most active user suffices with a head. </p><h2>  The device is in operation </h2><p>  Of course, it is not designed to play FullHD video.  Not all 3D entertainment and heavy games will go with a bang, but everything else is without problems. <br>  The speaker is good, but not so musical.  With a strong sound, noises are heard, so listening to songs is better with headphones. </p><h2>  Results from experts </h2><p>  <em>Pros</em> : </p><ul><li>  beauty of design; </li><li>  good build quality; </li><li>  excellent ergonomics; </li><li>  convenient and simple interface; </li><li>  two SIM cards; </li><li>  long battery life. </li></ul><p>  <em>Cons</em> : </p><ul><li>  no access to Google Play; </li><li>  processor not powerful enough for a wide monitor; </li><li>  low resolution; </li><li>  not very good front and rear cameras. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia xl dual sim" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21907/482761.jpg" width="413"></div></h2><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  About Nokia XL reviews indicate that this is a perfectly assembled device.  Suitable as the first smartphone and those who are not very demanding on such devices, for which the size of the display, the simplicity and clarity of the interface are important. </p><p>  In general, having studied the reviews and characteristics of experts about the Nokia XL Dual SIM, we can conclude that this device, despite the shortcomings (who does not have them?), Has every chance of winning the love of a certain category of customers and part of the market for Nokia.  We must pay tribute to this company - she tried.  What once again did not disappoint its fans, providing a fairly high-quality and balanced device. </p>
