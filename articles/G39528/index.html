Phone bus station Rostov</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, most of the settlements in our country can be reached by such a comfortable and fast form of transport as a bus, if we talk about long-distance traffic. </p><h2>  Bus - a comfortable and economical means of transportation </h2><p>  Especially important is the speed and convenience of travel when making business trips or tourist routes.  Moreover, it is no secret to anyone that traveling by intercity transport is a financially economical way to travel. </p><p>  If we analyze the schedule of flights departing from the bus station of the capital of the Southern Federal District - Rostov-on-Don, it becomes clear that the benefits do not end there: intercity buses often run through the most remote villages and hamlets, where it is impossible to get to by plane or train. </p><h2>  Donavtokzal </h2><p>  The main part of passenger traffic is taken over by the main bus station in Rostov-on-Don, which began to function back in 1978. </p>

    <p>  Contact one of them, and you will no longer need to engage in the purchase of tickets.  The employees will do everything for you: they will go to the main bus station in Rostov, purchase tickets and, importantly, personally bring them to your home.  In particular, this applies to routes to and from Moscow. </p><p>  Of course, not all potential passengers have the opportunity to pay for intermediary services.  What can I advise?  Of course, to purchase tickets in the classical way, that is, contact the help desk to clarify the flight schedule and take a queue at the ticket office. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Of course, a huge number of people depart daily and arrive at the main bus station in Rostov-on-Don.  Unfortunately, not everyone knows how to get to it. </p><p>  We emphasize once again that the above object has a convenient location.  In the immediate vicinity of it is the main railway station "Main Railway Station", where a trolley bus number 9, minibuses No. 126, 7a, 85, bus number 7 make a stop. Using these means of transportation, you can get to the airport and back. </p>

    <p>  The bus station (‚ÄúRostov-main‚Äù) has a telephone number for the help desk: (863) 205-41-41.  Call this number and the bus station employee will tell you the exact time of arrival or departure of regular buses, the operating hours of ticket offices and other important information related to the trip. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Today, few will question the fact that the bus station we are describing (Rostov-on-Don) is the main transport hub in the south of the country, because people from all over Russia come here during the holiday season to go on vacation on the Black Sea coast.  In addition, in the summer season, a huge number of tourists flock to the Crimea. </p><p>  If we talk about the advantages of the main bus station in the capital of the Southern Federal District, the first thing that catches your eye when you visit it is a large and spacious waiting room, which is located on the second floor.  It is noteworthy that in the territory of OJSC Donavtovokzal there is a huge parking for buses. </p>

    <p>  The disadvantages include, perhaps, the fact that if a person does not want to take his luggage to the storage room, which is paid here, he is forced to carry things along the stairs.  Also, not all passengers like that during the period from 23.00 to 6.00 the information desk does not work, which creates certain inconveniences. </p><p>  It must be emphasized that the main bus station in Rostov-on-Don is not the only one in the city.  There is another one, which is located at: st.  Sholokhov, house 126. It is customary to call it "old."  It mainly serves suburban services.  The distance between the two bus stations is approximately nine kilometers.  After another two kilometers is the building of the Rostov airport, at the address: st.  Sholokhov, 270/1. </p><p>  It should be noted that the reviews of passengers about the main bus station in Rostov are very mixed.  Many are satisfied that you can go to various regions of Russia.  However, the vast majority of passengers are disappointed with the quality of service and not always the high professionalism of drivers on the roads. </p>
