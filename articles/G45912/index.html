  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Political Advertising</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Political advertising is the dissemination of certain information about political parties, <span>associations, public</span> and state organizations, government bodies and citizens participating in political activities.  The public can hear ideas, programs, relationships through various means.  The dissemination of political information began from the moment the state appeared.  At that moment, it became necessary for the authorities to enter into communication (communication) with the population in order to receive help from it.  Thus, it was convenient for the state to influence the behavior of its citizens through information. </p><p>  Political advertising, being a system of specific communications, is designed to change the behavior and <span>consciousness of people</span> in accordance with the goals pursued by the advertiser. </p><p>  The structure of this specific dissemination of information includes: </p><ol><li>  Subject.  Under this definition should be understood political movements (associations, parties), candidates for elected posts. </li><li>  An object.  In this case, the <span>target audience</span> (voters) is meant. </li><li>  The subject is the identities of leaders of parties, movements, associations, election programs and more. </li><li>  Goal.  Political advertising may be conducted to <span>shape public opinion.</span>  The goal may be the coming to power through the occupation of an elected post. </li><li>  Tasks.  Specific goals are often used in this definition. </li><li>  Facilities.  These include publications and broadcasts in the media, posters, clips, leaflets, television debates, meetings with the target audience (voters).  Photographs, cartoons, cartoons became integral forms of political information dissemination.  Broadcasts are also quite popular.  Souvenirs are very common as a form of conveying political information. </li><li>  Feedback and direct communications.  The presence of these elements involves conducting public opinion polls, researching attitudes to the applicant and his agitation, etc. </li></ol><p>  Being a communication structure from a psychological point of view, political advertising includes three main components.  The first is the cognitive (cognitive) element.  It gives the consumer new information.  The second element is considered affective.  He forms the necessary emotional attitude.  The third is the regulatory component, designed to induce certain actions. </p><p>  Features of political advertising should be considered specifically, but given the presence in it of the psychological specificity of commercial advertising. </p><p>  The similarity between the two concepts lies in the presence of a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù or proposal (idea, political leader or party) and a market in which voters are consumers. </p><p>  The difference is the place that political advertising occupies in a democratizing society in life.  The dissemination of information is not limited to certain samples (posters, stands, publications, etc.).  From the point of view of psychological consideration, various targeted speeches by political candidates aimed at influencing the consciousness and, therefore, the choice of the voter, also apply to political advertising. </p><p>  Despite the fact that there are many definitions, in each of them there is the concept of ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù.  Thus, the dissemination of political information is carried out using the media and other means of providing communication with voters.  In this case, the aim is to influence the attitudes of people regarding political objects or subjects. </p><p>  With the help of political advertising, the image of parties, people, programs, <span>political views is created.</span> </p>
