Lenovo S650</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern smartphones amaze with their performance and capabilities.  However, sometimes for a comfortable performance of the necessary tasks, the time-tested model is quite enough, which cannot be attributed to the latest products.  This is the gadget <span>Lenovo S650, the</span> characteristics of which we will consider in more detail. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The smartphone is packaged by the manufacturer in a cardboard box, on which there is practically no information.  Most likely, Lenovo‚Äôs minimalist style is expressed in this, emphasizing that this device is still the ‚Äúyounger brother‚Äù of the flagship smartphone of the time, Lenovo Vibe X. </p><p>  For most buyers, it may be important that, in addition to the charger, USB cable and documents, the manufacturer took care of the presence of a wired headset in the starter kit.  Although it looks simple and, frankly, cheap, the sound is quite pleasant and can be liked by most unassuming music lovers. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The smartphone received a 4.7-inch display, but at the same time it looks quite large.  The reason is the wide frames around the screen, which can not be clearly called a minus, but some users may not like them.  Despite such dimensions, the gadget lies pleasantly in the hand and does not slip out of it. </p><p>  The case is completely made of plastic, in some places matte, and in some places with a metallized coating.  The color of the case is light, pleasant, and with proper lighting, a golden shine effect is also created.  The device is assembled efficiently, there are no backlashes and creaks.  In general, the smartphone gives the impression of a well-designed model, albeit from the budget segment.  This feature can boast of many Lenovo smartphones, whose prices remain in the range of 7-8 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The back cover is removable, under it there are slots for SIM and a memory card.  The Lenovo S650 battery is removable, which has recently become a rarity in most smartphones. </p><p>  According to some reviews, the wear resistance of case elements is quite high, and even with careless use, the gadget will not lose its attractive appearance soon.  The display has <span>an oleophobic coating that</span> provides protection from fingerprints that could appear during operation and interfere with comfortable viewing of photographs and videos. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  We touched on the topic of coverage a bit, and now let's talk about the matrix.  Perhaps it can be safely called the weak side of this device, since it has a low resolution for a modern device, namely 960x540 pixels.  With such parameters with a diagonal of 4.7 inches, pixelation becomes noticeable even to the naked eye, which is why the picture gets an unpleasant ragged ‚Äústaircase‚Äù structure, and the Lenovo S650 screen becomes more a minus than a plus. </p><p>  However, the rest of the display showed good results.  Good color reproduction, without emphasizing any particular color, rather large viewing angles, a sufficient margin of brightness for using the device even in sunny weather - all this can partially compensate for the low resolution of the display. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The sensor was able to perceive up to 5 touches at the same time, which is an ordinary indicator for state employees.  But at the same time, any errors and sticking are completely absent, so it can surely be called good and high-quality. </p>

    <h2>  Iron Characteristics </h2><p>  The main processor is the <span>MediaTek MT6582</span> SoC platform <span>,</span> known for most budget models from 2014-2015.  It is a single-chip chip on which there is a processor with four cores capable of reaching a frequency of up to 1.3 GHz, and a Mali-450MP2 video accelerator.  The crystal was made according to the 28 nanometer process technology, which provides fairly low power consumption and low heating of the device when working with resource-intensive processes. </p><p>  The processor works in conjunction with 1 GB of RAM.  This is a bit by modern standards, but quite enough for comfortable work with two or three lightweight applications at the same time.  In order to unload the RAM to the maximum, the system is optimized by the manufacturer, as a result of which the user is always available about 500 MB, the rest is occupied by system applications.  It is worth noting that in some Lenovo models with the same amount of RAM, there is a problem during operation, since only a fifth of the RAM remains available to the user.  Here "Lenovo S650", whose characteristics often do not differ from problem models, undoubtedly wins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Antutu benchmark test shows a result of 17,000 rating units, which is comparable to such flagships of previous years as the HTC One X and Samsung Galaxy S3, although the ‚ÄúLenovo S650‚Äù characteristics seem less significant at first glance. </p>

    <h2>  Smartphone Communication Features </h2><p>  Nowadays, a smartphone without 4G support is sometimes considered too outdated, but do not forget that the higher the communication standard, the greater the battery consumption.  In this model, there is no 4G support, but the mode of all frequencies and 3G standards, including HSUPA and HSDPA, is fully implemented. </p><p>  SIM cards are used in a standard size, you do not need to cut or change them to start using your smartphone.  When calling traditionally, one of them becomes inactive, since the device is equipped with only one radio module. </p><p>  In addition to the radio module of the cellular network, the Lenovo S650 telephone is equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 generation modules, as well as Wi-Fi with support for b / g / n protocols.  If necessary, the smartphone can be turned into a portable Wi-Fi router in several stages.  Check with your operator in advance whether additional funds will be charged for this, since recently in some companies a similar practice has appeared. </p><p>  The smartphone does not do without a GPS module.  The signal level of the satellites is pretty confident even in cloudy weather.  When testing in most cases, a <span>cold start</span> took about 1 minute, while a hot one took less than half a minute, or even several seconds. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The internal non-volatile memory of the smartphone is not particularly happy with its size.  It is a built-in flash drive with a capacity of 8 GB.  About 3 GB of it are occupied by system files.  In total, a little less than 5 GB of disk space is available to the user from the box. </p><p>  To expand it, you can use microSD memory cards with a capacity of up to 32 GB, preferably class 10, in order to ensure maximum performance.  According to the feedback of users who tried to use larger memory cards, the smartphone simply refuses to see them, so when buying it is worth counting on the limits declared by the manufacturer.  However, comparing prices for Lenovo smartphones, this model wins in terms of price / quality ratio, and it‚Äôs worth considering - perhaps this amount of memory will be quite enough. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The regular battery supplied with the smartphone received a rather ordinary volume of 2000 mAh.  This is a small indicator in the modern world of battery-demanding gadgets, however, for its modest characteristics, this battery is more than enough. </p><p>  A charger is supplied with the smartphone, capable of delivering power up to 1 A. At these rates, it takes about 2 hours to fully charge the battery. </p><p>  According to reviews, one charge is enough for the active use of the smartphone all day, this is noticed by users who comment on the Lenovo S650 w3bsit3-dns.com topic.  However, at the same time, you will have to connect it to the power every night, which means that the resource of the battery charge / discharge cycles will be used up in about 2.5 years. </p>

    <h2>  Main and front cameras </h2><p>  The Lenovo S650 w3bsit3-dns.com smartphone was developed at a time when software image interpolation was still not in fashion, so the claimed resolution of the photos corresponds to the resolution of the camera matrix.  For the main camera, it is 8 megapixels, but with the front camera the situation is more sad - its indicator is only 0.3 megapixels, so you can forget about the selfie.  Considering the <span>Lenovo S650</span> model <span>, the characteristics of the</span> cameras are quite acceptable for its price segment. </p><p>  The camera is quite decent for its level, with good lighting, the pictures are saturated and clear.  However, using the automatic settings during shooting, monitor the result.  Sometimes the software makes a mistake with the choice of the mode, as a result of which the colors may be distorted, and highlights appear on the photo or, conversely, too dark areas. </p><p>  The front camera can only be used for conversations using video messengers, but no more.  You should not take pictures with it: you definitely can‚Äôt call them quality. </p>

    <h2>  Smartphone setup </h2><p>  After removing from the box, the smartphone should be configured.  In this, this model is no different from other Android devices.  She has on board a set of service applications from Google, so it is recommended to immediately create an account for comfortable use of the smartphone and data synchronization.  The rest of the setting "Lenovo S650" is intuitive.  The smartphone has tips on the functions of the interface. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The smartphone turned out to be solid and pleasant to use.  It is suitable for those for whom communication is the first place, not entertainment.  Of the minuses, we can only note overheating of the processor during very long, heavy loads not provided for this hardware, poor display resolution, and the version of Android that is already starting to become obsolete.  If this is not important for you, you can safely buy this model - otherwise it will not fail.  In addition, if necessary, repairing the Lenovo S650 is quite cheap due to low prices for components, so accidentally broken display will not be a tragedy. </p>
