    <p>  The guys will also really like the slides in the pool, which you can ride from until six in the evening.  Conveniently, the hotel has a photographer.  Some liked the store functioning at the hotel, which sells fur coats, many massage and boors also liked.  There is also an office where you can make a temporary tattoo, as well as an office that takes a photo on glass as a keepsake. </p><p>  Very convenient shuttle to the beach.  A lot of positive reviews about the hotel, which is fully landscaped and equipped.  Impressions about the work of staff diverge.  Some say that it works great and is highly professional, while others say that maids perform their duties in bad faith.  In any case, most of our compatriots believe that the Batont Garden Resort is an excellent hotel for the price they paid for a vacation in it. </p>
