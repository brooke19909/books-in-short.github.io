    <h2>  What kind of payment </h2><p>  Let's start by examining the payment as such.  What kind of requisitions are these?  Who should pay them?  And most importantly, for what? </p><p>  Transport tax - a payment that is paid by all transport owners.  He is charged for registration with the traffic police.  This allows you to drive on the roads of the city, country and the world as a whole.  In each region, this tax is established individually. </p><p>  What does it mean?  There are no uniform calculations and rules that would help the entire population.  Each entity has its own numbers and benefits.  We will be interested in transport tax in the Krasnodar Territory.  Who should pay it?  How to calculate amounts?  Up to what point to pay?  And are there any beneficiaries among the population?  About all this - further. </p><h2>  Does everyone pay </h2><p>  The first thing that interests modern taxpayers is whether everyone should pay this tax?  Here you can answer unambiguously: yes.  All taxpayers who own a particular vehicle are required to pay annually. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But of course, there are exceptions.  There are beneficiaries in the Krasnodar Territory.  Some are completely exempted from paying transport tax, while someone gets a discount.  The vast majority of the population is still not exempt from our current contribution.  So, who can not pay or pay a lower transport tax.  Krasnodar Territory provides benefits to several categories of the population. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="find out transport tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199375.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About beneficiaries </h2><p>  It should be noted right away: if you are a beneficiary, hurry up to claim your rights.  Indeed, otherwise you will receive invoices for payment.  You can ignore them, but this is undesirable.  Then you have to prove your rights and defend your own innocence. </p><p>  Transport tax in the Krasnodar Territory completely exempts from paying disabled people.  Not all, but only those who belong to the 1st and 2nd group.  The same rule applies to special services that transport people with disabilities.  If this or that organization is engaged in the creation of roads and their repair, you do not need to <span>pay a transport tax</span> either. </p><p>  In addition, do not forget about the generally accepted beneficiaries.  We are talking about the victims of Chernobyl, veterans and Heroes of the USSR.  This also includes, as a rule, military personnel (elderly) who took part in hostilities.  Their families are also exempt from tax in the event of the death of an employee.  But large families in the Krasnodar Territory in 2016 do not have exemption from contributions to transport. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Senior citizens </h2><p>  What about retirees?  Transport tax (Krasnodar Territory, 2014-2016) is paid by them.  But not fully.  Yes, if a pensioner is disabled, he has every right to be exempted from payment.  But no more than that. </p><p>  There are special rules for the average elderly person in the region.  The thing is that such citizens are entitled to a 50% discount in respect of transport tax.  This condition applies to everyone who went on a well-deserved rest.  And they are very actively using it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax Krasnodar Territory 2014" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199376.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But keep in mind: pensioners who own several vehicles can receive a privilege only on one of them.  At your discretion.  When contacting the tax service, you will have to clarify which transport you intend to pay in part and which in full.  These are the rules. </p><h2>  How to count </h2><p>  You can find out the transport tax in several ways.  For example, trust the data that will be indicated in your payment.  This is not the best option, as many try to first independently calculate how much they will have to pay for transport per year. </p><p>  Therefore, you can use simple formulas and special services on the Internet.  They will help you calculate the transport tax.  A calculator (the Krasnodar Territory will need to be selected in the list of regions) for this is available on the official website of the tax service of the Russian Federation.  True, using it is not recommended.  After all, Internet services have some errors.  So, in order to find out the transport tax, you have to calculate it yourself.  How exactly? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What will help </h2><p>  You can calculate using simple formulas.  Even a schoolboy will cope with them.  The main thing is to know certain components.  For example, transport tax rates are an important component.  Krasnodar Territory has its own rates.  This item is established in each subject of the Russian Federation individually.  And reflects the cost of one horsepower in a particular vehicle. </p><p>  You will also have to find out the power of your engine.  These data are usually available at the TCP.  Expressed in horsepower.  Nothing difficult or special.  The number of months of ownership will also have to be considered.  Mostly when your vehicle is owned for less than 1 year.  Otherwise, this indicator is not useful.  The last thing that may be required is the so-called up-factor.  It concerns luxury cars (cars with a value of more than 3 million rubles). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax rates Krasnodar Territory" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199377.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The calculation of the transport tax (Krasnodar Territory is no exception) will take place according to several formulas.  The first of them is called standard.  The amount is obtained after multiplying the <span>tax rate</span> by the horsepower in the engine.  When it comes to a car that has been owned for less than a year, you need to multiply the standard formula by the quotient of dividing the number of months of ownership by 12. </p><p>  Do you have a luxury car?  Then just multiply the standard formula by the increment factor.  It's all.  If the luxury car is owned at the time of payment of less than a year, multiply with the coefficient will have the second formula.  On this, all the calculations end. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax Krasnodar Territory benefits" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199378.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Bets </h2><p>  As you see, the transport tax in the Krasnodar Territory is calculated in the same way as in any other region.  The only difference is in tax rates.  They have a direct impact on the total amount that the taxpayer will have to pay.  What do we have in this regard?  The main tables that help calculate the transport tax in 2016 for residents of the Krasnodar Territory are presented below. </p><p>  Cars: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr align="center"><td>  Engine power (horsepower) </td><td>  Tax rate (rubles) </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  Up to 100 </td><td>  12 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  101 to 150 inclusive </td><td>  25 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  151-200 </td><td>  fifty </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  201 to 250 </td><td>  75 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  Over 250 </td><td>  150 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Motorcycles: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr align="center"><td>  Engine power (horsepower) </td><td>  Tax rate (rubles) </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  Up to 35 </td><td>  8 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  36-50 </td><td>  fifteen </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  51-100 </td><td>  20 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  More than 100 </td><td>  fifty </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Buses: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr align="center"><td>  Engine power (horsepower) </td><td>  Tax rate (rubles) </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  Up to 200 inclusive </td><td>  25 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  From 201 and more </td><td>  fifty </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Trucks: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr align="center"><td>  Engine power (horsepower) </td><td>  Tax rate (rubles) </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  0-100 </td><td>  fifteen </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  101-150 </td><td>  thirty </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  From 151 to 200 (inclusive) </td><td>  fifty </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  Up to 250 </td><td>  60 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  From 251 </td><td>  80 </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  For luxury </h2><p>  What to do to those who have purchased a luxury car?  Tax rates alone are not enough.  As already mentioned, a so-called up-factor is also required.  It is set based on the average cost of the car and its year of manufacture.  What are the options in the Krasnodar Territory? </p><p>  The average cost of a car is from 3 to 5 million, but was it released 2-3 years ago?  Then you need a coefficient of 1.1.  At a similar cost, but if the car was produced from 1 to 2 years ago, this figure will increase slightly.  Now it will be 1.3 and 1.5, when the transport is completely new.  That is, if it was released less than 12 months ago. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax calculator Krasnodar Territory" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199380.jpg"></div>

    <p>  2 - coefficient relevant for cars with an average cost of 5,000,000 to 10,000,000, manufactured no more than 5 years ago.  As you can see, the more expensive the car, the higher the indicator we need.  <span>A raising factor</span> with a value of 3 is relevant if the transport costs up to 15 million and was produced no more than 10 years ago.  Or when it cost the owner up to 20 million rubles, and the issue took place no more than 20 years ago. </p><h2>  The order of treatment </h2><p>  Strictly speaking, this is all that can come in handy for transport tax in the Krasnodar Territory.  Please note: individuals must pay this fee until approximately December 1.  But the <span>advance payment</span> is available until the end of the reporting tax period.  More precisely, then until April 30.  Firms and organizations have fewer privileges in this regard.  They must pay the transport tax until March 1 inclusive. </p><p>  What is the procedure for applying to the tax service in the Krasnodar Territory for benefits and discounts?  Exactly the same as in any other region.  Take the following documents with you and present them to the appropriate service: </p><ul><li>  passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  application for benefits; </li><li>  SNILS; </li><li>  TIN (optional, but desirable); </li><li>  Title to the car; </li><li>  ownership of the vehicle; </li><li>  certificates confirming the right to benefits. </li></ul>

    <p>  It's all.  If you previously paid the transport tax, but did not know that you have the right to benefits, you can apply for a refund.  True, only in the last 3 years.  To do this, attach all the payments and receipts with checks to the documents already listed, as well as provide bank details for the transfer of funds.  It's all.  The calculation of the transport tax (Krasnodar Territory or another region - it doesn‚Äôt matter) is extremely simple.  Especially when all the necessary data is known. </p>
