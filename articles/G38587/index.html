It is located just 50 meters from the hotel buildings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The distance to the sea from the hotel is approximately 200 meters.  Therefore, its guests do not have to get to the beach for too long. </p><h2>  General description of the hotel </h2><p>  The Marilena Hotel complex in Crete accepts tourists in one multi-storey building, built in the Greek style.  For the first time, rooms at this hotel were handed over to the guests of the island in 1989. Renovation was last held here, unfortunately, also quite a long time ago - in 2008, the Hotel has a spacious private territory with a garden.  Tourists in their reviews note that everything is buried in bright colors and greenery.  The paths and the playground in front of the hotel are covered with paving tiles in a pleasant color.  In the garden you can relax in the afternoon heat or take a walk in the evening. </p><p>  The checkout time at the Marilena Hotel, as in many other three-star hotels in Crete, is 14:00.

    <h2>  Marilena Hotel Crete Beach Reviews </h2><p>  The nearest beach is literally across the road.  She is not too lively, so her transition does not cause difficulties.  The beach here, like most of the coast of Crete, is municipal, but there are always a lot of people, even during the peak season.  Therefore, there is no crowding here.  Beach cover - fine sand.  It is quite soft and clean, so you can sit on the beach on straight towels.  Sunset in the sea on this stretch of the coast is gentle, but at the very edge of the water there are stones and large pebbles, so it is advisable to purchase special bathing shoes.  Tourists are very enthusiastic about the purity and transparency of the water in the sea.  Here, even at a decent depth, you can see at the bottom of every pebble, every small fish. </p><p>  From all of the above, we can conclude that the Marilena Hotel is suitable for a quiet measured vacation with or without children. </p>
