This is especially true for those people who need mobility, speed and practicality.  Debit cards allow you not to carry a bunch of bills and have round-the-clock access to your funds practically anywhere in the world.  Credit cards provide an opportunity to purchase the desired product or service at the expense of the borrowed funds of the bank and provide the right to use an interest-free loan during the grace period.  The most common class of such payment instruments is ‚Äúclassic‚Äù cards related to the middle segment.  They combine a reasonable cost of service, the necessary set of services and services, as well as attractive bonus privileges.  The representative of this segment is the Mastercard Standard card, the features of which are discussed below. </p><h2>  About Mastercard Payment System </h2><p>  Mastercard is an international payment system, the second most popular after Visa.  The share of payment cards issued by the company is about 25% of the total number in the world.  Mastercard cards accept more than a million service points in 210 countries of the world.  About 22 thousand financial institutions cooperate with the corporation.  Registered address in the USA.  The main difference from Visa‚Äôs main competitor is the settlement currency: Masterkard has the euro;  Visa works with dollars.  Therefore, Mastercard is more preferable for those who travel to European countries more often, and Visa - for the USA, Canada, Thailand, etc. The payment system processes up to 140 million transactions every hour, up to 20 billion in total complexity for a year.  The share of Mastercard card holders in Russia is about 38.5%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mastercard standard" class="if uuid-3022172" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3022172.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of Mastercard cards </h2><p>  All Mastercard payment cards can be divided into three segments: </p><ul><li>  entry-level plastic cards (Maestro); </li><li>  mid-level cards (Standard); </li><li>  premium cards (Gold, Platinum, World, Black Edition, World Elite). </li></ul><p>  The differences between the categories are the cost of service, security technologies, payment methods and additional services for travelers. </p><p>  Maestro electronic card is the best choice for those who do not plan to regularly use the card and do not make card transactions abroad.  A payment instrument has some limitations due to its class: </p><ul><li>  You cannot pay for purchases on the Internet; </li><li>  cards are mostly unembossed; </li><li>  not all service points support payment through Maestro. </li></ul><p>  The MC Standard is great for everyday use as well as for traveling.  The acceptable price of the service, pleasant bonus programs, the absence of restrictions on use both on the Internet and abroad - all this makes the "classic" card from Mastercard a convenient and practical means of payment. </p><p>  Cards of the premium segment are intended for the business layer of society: top managers of companies, businessmen, politicians, etc. The presence of a card of this class emphasizes the status of the owner, his wide financial capabilities and influential position.  The high cost of servicing premium cards is justified by exceptional advantages and features: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  priority service at many points of sale and <span>service services</span> ; </li><li>  access to VIP zones of airports and waiting rooms; </li><li>  increased bonuses when paying for purchases; </li><li>  ATM cash withdrawals worldwide. <div class="photo" data-original="www.dashforcenews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mastercard cards" class="if uuid-3022286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3022286.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  "Classic" from Mastercard </h2><p>  Mastercard Standard is the most common payment tool that provides access to a wide range of services: free cash withdrawals at ATMs, cashback, bonus programs, transfers within the system, the ability to use cards abroad, full technical support 24/7.  Standard cards are equipped with PayPass contactless payment technology, which allows you to make payments much faster, excluding contact with the payment terminal.  The "classic" options are protected by 3D-Secure technology - this means that when making online purchases to authenticate the cardholder on the seller‚Äôs website, you must enter the code sent to the cardholder‚Äôs phone. </p><h2>  Who is this card for? </h2><p>  MC Standard is intended for use by a wide range of people.  Often the debit issue of "Mastercard Standard" is carried out as part of a salary project or to receive social benefits.  Banks provide a choice of Standard cards with a variety of features and services.  For example, among the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù segment of Mastercard cards, Sberbank has the usual Mastercard Standard, Youth Mastercard Standard, a standard one with an individual design, as well as a Standard class credit card with a massive and approved offer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="sdasia.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plastic cards Mastercard" class="if uuid-3021427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3021427.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefits of Mastercard Standard </h2><ul><li>  Universality.  "Mastercard Standard" - a personal card for all occasions.  It can be kept both for everyday use and for travel. </li><li>  Favorable service.  Standard annual maintenance is inexpensive, given the package of services that the cardholder receives at his disposal.  Some banks do not charge a service fee at all.  For the most part, this applies to debit cards with a basic set of services and limit payment instruments.  So, for example, under the credit "Mastercard Standard" in Sberbank with the possibility of issuing a limit of up to 600,000 rubles and a grace period of up to 50 days, there is no commission for servicing the card throughout the entire term. </li><li>  Wide geography of use.  Mastercard can be used to pay or withdraw cash practically anywhere in the world. </li><li>  Appearance.  The data of the card holder is applied to the plastic through embossing, during which the letters and numbers are extruded and become convex.  This method provides more opportunities for customer identification and removes the restrictions inherent in entry-level cards. </li><li>  Bonus program and special promotions.  Mastercard Rewards is a special program for Mastercard cardholders.  For each purchase, a certain number of bonuses are credited to the account, which can be exchanged for gifts from the bonus catalog of the payment system. </li><li>  Security.  3D-Secure technology protects the payment card holder from unauthorized access to the account, and Mastercard round-the-clock customer support will allow you to timely block the card and avoid financial losses as a result of loss or theft. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="mashable.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mastercard cards" class="if uuid-3022308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3022308.jpg"></div><h2>  Where and how to get? </h2><p>  To receive a Mastercard Standard debit card, you just need to submit an online application on the bank‚Äôs official website or come to the office with a passport and fill out an application for plastic issue.  The standard issue of a registered embossed card lasts up to 5 business days.  When applying for a credit card in most cases, proof of income is required.  A positive credit history will also be a plus for approving a card limit. </p><h2>  Mastercard Standard in Russian banks </h2><p>  Consider the current offers of MC Standard in the Russian plastic card market.  The debit Mastercard Standard in Sberbank will cost 750 rubles in the first year, and 450 rubles in the following years.  For this money, the client receives a card on the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  validity period: 3 years; </li><li>  cash withdrawal from Sberbank ATMs without commission up to 150,000 rubles per day; </li><li>  the ability to open an account in rubles, dollars and euros; </li><li>  contactless payment; </li><li>  participation in the bonus program ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù; </li><li>  remote servicing through the Sberbank Online system. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.mildberry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mastecard sberbank" class="if uuid-3022193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3022193.jpg"></div><p>  ‚ÄúAlfa-card with benefits‚Äù - an interesting card product Mastercard Standard from Alfa-Bank for those who make frequent purchases and loves to use all the bonus benefits.  Card service costs the first two months free of charge, the next two months - 100 rubles, or also without commission if the amount of purchases per month on the card was more than 10,000 rubles or the average monthly balance exceeded 30,000 rubles.  Cashback will be up to 2%, remuneration for the account balance - up to 6%.  Access to Alfa-click Internet banking is provided, free transfers, payment for utilities, mobile communications, fines, etc. are provided. </p><p>  There are interesting offers from smaller banks.  So, Severgazbank issues the salary Mastercard Standard with a free annual service for the entire period of validity, the presence of Internet banking, the possibility of issuing additional cards, connecting an overdraft, etc. </p><h2>  Experience in using Mastercard Standard: reviews and recommendations </h2><p>  Due to the reasonable ratio between maintenance costs and the services offered, MC Standard cards are very popular among middle-income people.  Among the positive qualities are the convenience of using a means of payment abroad, prompt customer support services, quick contactless payments and favorable rates.  The disadvantages include a small number of affiliate bonus programs and additional services.  This is the key difference between Mastercard Standard and Mastercard Gold - a higher-class card in which a similar service is already included by default. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Mc gold" class="if uuid-3022332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3022332.jpg"></div><p>  When issuing a card at a branch, you should carefully familiarize yourself with the banking conditions and tariffs.  In some cases, the increased cost of Standard services is due to a range of additional services that are not always of value in daily use, but are necessary, for example, when traveling to foreign countries.  These options include travel insurance, legal assistance, concierge service, etc. </p><p>  You can use your payment card to your advantage.  Mastercard jointly with partner companies and banks regularly holds promotions and offers for cardholders.  Customers are offered to pay for purchases at certain retail outlets and chain stores, and in return receive discounts or bonus points that can later be spent on prizes or the purchase of new goods or services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.talkmarkets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mastercard cards" class="if uuid-3022222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3022222.jpg"></div><p>  The ‚Äúclassic‚Äù Mastercard Standard card is a suitable solution for those who are not ready to overpay extra money for unnecessary services and appreciate ease of use, versatility of use, security and special advantageous offers when paying for purchases.  The presence of a chip and an embossed inscription on the card allows it to be used in almost all service points and ATMs, and 3D-Secure technology guarantees protection when making online payments.  A flexible tariff policy of banks and a wide range of offers will allow you to choose a Standard payment card with a range of services, the most appropriate requests and a wealth of different categories of customers. </p>
