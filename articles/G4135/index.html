    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Vyborg (St. Petersburg) is attractive because it is located on the shores of the Gulf of Finland.  One part of the city is located on the mainland, while the other - on the small islands of the bay.  This is one of the largest and most beautiful cities of the Leningrad region.  Anyone can get here by any route St. Petersburg-Vyborg (electric train, shuttle or sightseeing bus, etc.). </p><p>  The relief of the city is diverse.  The highest point is 33 meters above sea level.  Beautiful <span>architectural monuments,</span> centuries-old history and traditions - these are the hallmarks of the city of Vyborg.  A good transport network connects St. Petersburg, Moscow, Karelia and Finland with Vyborg.  The motorway St. Petersburg - Helsinki runs through this city. </p><p>  The proximity of Vyborg to Finland determines its developed infrastructure.  Some bars, cafes and shops have a second name in Finnish.  It is very clean, cozy and comfortable.  By right, it can be called the European city of Russia.  Part of the buildings that have been standing here for centuries give Vyborg a general historical significance and make it a museum city.  The city has its own seaport and shipyard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sights of the city of Vyborg </h2><p>  St. Petersburg (the distance between cities is not so great, but the architecture is completely different) is much younger than Vyborg.  Therefore, these cities are so different. </p><h2>  Vyborg castle </h2><p>  The history of the city begins in the 11th century.  Then a small settlement was organized here.  The Swedes in the 12th century tried to conquer these territories.  In order not to lose the conquered, in 1293 the famous <span>Vyborg Castle</span> was built <span>here.</span>  To this day, he retains his grandeur.  It is located on a small stone island in the middle of the bay.  For so many centuries, it has been restored and rebuilt more than once.  So, some of its towers were built after two centuries.  The height of the tower with a dome reaches 48 meters.  There is an observation deck with a beautiful view of the city and the bay.  The building is truly magnificent, because the thickness of the stone walls in some places is 5 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg-Vyborg train" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/460901.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fortress wall </h2><p>  In the 15th century, the then still not very large settlement was fenced with a powerful fortress wall, around the perimeter of which there were towers.  Today, two towers have survived: the Town Hall Tower and the Clock Tower.  Sentinel appeared here in the late 15th century.  She draws up the Cathedral.  She became a watchmaker in the 18th century, when, by order of Empress Catherine II, a watch was installed on her.  Now you can climb to the very top of the Clock Tower by buying a ticket for 30 rubles.  It offers a beautiful view of the city.  There is a very strong wind at the observation deck.  The bell located on the tower must not be touched.  By the way, the tower itself does not stand on the foundation, like traditional buildings, but on a huge boulder.  There are a lot of such stones in these places, they just wallow in the forest, because it is almost impossible to move such a colossus from a place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Schedule of trains St. Petersburg - Vyborg" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/460902.jpg" width="600"></div>

St. Petersburg was already built when Peter I decided to conduct a line of fortifications, which in German sounds like "Crown of St. Anne."  The best architects and designers fought for the right to build this building.  General de Coulomb defeated.  Four gates were laid in his project.  In our time, only the Friedrichsgan Gate remained, which are now used for communication between the two parts of the city. </p><h2>  North Wall and South Wall </h2><p>  Such a name are two beautiful streets of Vyborg.  Not far from them you can see the Lutheran Cathedral of Peter and Paul and the Orthodox Transfiguration Cathedral.  Both of them were built in the late 18th century.  Nearby, one of the main attractions of the city is <span>Monrepos Park.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Saint Petersburg - Vyborg bus schedule" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/460903.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Monuments of the 20th century </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, many different buildings and monuments were built in this city.  One of the most striking creations of this period is the City Library, created by the Finnish architect Alvaro Aalto (1935).  The library is located in a surprisingly picturesque place - a park on Lenin Avenue.  Here you can walk along the alleys, take pictures near the small bronze sculptures of the Forest Boy and the Elk (these sculptures were also created in the early 20th century). </p><p>  In 1910, a monument to Peter I was unveiled in Vyborg. The construction of the monument marked 200 years since the return of Vyborg to Russia.  The greatest ruler depicted the sculptor Bernshtam.  Peter relies on the gun carriage, he looks very powerful, his gaze is fixed on the fortress.  The monument stands on huge boulders.  From this place, a view of the <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãwaves</span> breaking on a rocky shore opens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Saint Petersburg - Vyborg how to get" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/460900.jpg" width="324"></div>

    <p>  The main thoroughfare of the city is Lenin Avenue, which continues to Red Square.  Here, houses built in the 19th century are everywhere.  The place is very beautiful and bewitching. </p><p>  Of course, every tourist who comes to the Leningrad region needs to visit Vyborg.  St. Petersburg is a beautiful city, but small towns in its area are also beautiful. </p><h2>  Restaurants and cafes of the city </h2><p>  Tourists note that there are quite high prices for food.  There are not so many cheap and simple cafes in the city.  There is a cheap Blinok cafe on the market square.  There is a small restaurant "Camelot", the food in it is quite expensive, but the atmosphere is pleasant.  Vyborg, as noted above, is divided into two parts - the Old Town and New.  The business center is far from historical.  Many foreigners come here to the historical center, which is why there are so many expensive restaurants. </p><h2>  Route St. Petersburg - Vyborg: how to get there? </h2><p>  There are three ways to get to Vyborg: by car, by bus, by train.  Buses depart from two <span>metro</span> stations <span>: Parnas</span> and Devyatkino, the fare to Vyborg is 200 rubles per person.  Go to any of the bus stations and buy a bus ticket Saint Petersburg - Vyborg.  The bus schedule is simple: depart every 40 minutes or every hour.  The journey to the final destination takes about 2 hours.  There may be traffic jams along the highway.  The bus drops off passengers at the station, from which you can easily reach the main attractions of the city. </p>

    <p>  Also goes on the route St. Petersburg - Vyborg train.  The road takes less time, because due to traffic jams the bus can travel much longer than 2 hours.  The electric train leaves from <span>Finland Station.</span>  An ordinary electric train makes several stops.  There is also an express train.  He makes a stop only at the Udelka metro station (though almost all the seats here will already be taken).  The train schedule "St. Petersburg - Vyborg" is also very convenient.  They go from lunchtime until the evening with a frequency of about 60 minutes.  An express train runs 2 times a day (at 7.45 and 11.30), it leaves Vyborg in the evening (20.40).  Ticket price - 243 rubles.  Both options will be convenient.  Having left St. Petersburg at 11.30, you can have a good night's sleep and walk around Vyborg all day.  The train is convenient in that you can carry a bicycle in it.  Of the minuses, a large number of people can be noted (not the fact that you are lucky to buy a seat), as well as a high cost in comparison with a bus. </p><p>  The schedule of trains "St. Petersburg - Vyborg" is best specified at the station in advance, because any changes can be made to it. </p>
