Its location is more than convenient.  To the island's capital (Palma de Mallorca), take a bus for about fifteen to twenty minutes.  And the town itself is very quiet, although not without the joys of civilization.  There is a market, and shops, and restaurants, and cafes.  But Santa Ponsa is not neighboring Magaluf.  In the evenings there is quiet, chamber.  The central part of the town is flat.  The hills start a little off.  The coast is also beyond praise.  The surrounding hills overlook the sea and form a convenient bay called Cala Santa Ponsa.  And in this wonderful place there are two hotels that are part of one complex - Delfin Mar Complex 4 *.  What are these hotels, we will tell in this article.  The main material for its writing was the reviews of tourists and their photos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Delfin Mar Complex 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1550573.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location, territory, buildings </h2><p>  The hotels are located very close, literally thirty meters from each other.  But their addresses are different.  Hotel "Dolphin Mar" is located on King Sancho Street 11. And Hotel Delfin Siesta Mar is located on Lisboa Street 4. From all of them go to the sea for about three minutes or one hundred and fifty meters.  And unlike other hotels in Santa Ponsa not on the stairs or the steep slope. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Delfin Mar Complex 4 * (Mallorca) photos are presented as typical resort hotels.  Floor buildings are surrounded by a beautiful garden.  Hotel Dolphin Mar is larger.  It has two outdoor pools and one indoor heated.  He eats a children's "paddling pool".  The Dolphin Siesta Mar Hotel has only one seasonal pool - in the fresh air and without heating.  Tourists say a lot of laudatory words about the territory of the complex.  Although hotels are lonely buildings, there is no atmosphere of crowding.  Balconies offer lateral sea views. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Delfin Mar Complex 4 (Mallorca)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1550577.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What's near </h2><p>  Tourists reveal small tricks to quickly get from Delfin Mar Complex 4 * to Palma de Mallorca.  Stop - five minutes walk from the hotel.  But two routes run to the capital.  One hundred and second goes straight and reaches the final stop in half an hour.  A bus route one hundred and four visits all towns and villages along the coast.  As a result, the trip drags on for an hour and fifteen minutes.  But if you want to visit the party of Magaluf, you are on the 104th.  Not far from the Dolphin Siesta Mar hotel is the Eroshki store, there is also a food department where you can buy ready-made dishes.  Santa Ponsa is located on the southwestern tip of the island.  Near the resort town is the largest golf club in Mallorca.  It is good to come here with the whole family.  Indeed, in the urban area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSanta Ponsa there is a large amusement park for adults and children "Jungle".  Bourne Boulevard - the main trade <span>route of the resort,</span> passes very close to the hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Delfin Mar Complex 4 Santa Ponsa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1550561.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Meals at the Dolphin Mar Hotel </h2><p>  By this criterion, the hotel is the best in the Delfin Mar Complex 4 * complex.  Tourists are advised to take "all inclusive" in order to fully enjoy those culinary masterpieces that create a cook in the restaurant "Dolphin Mar".  Weather permitting, breakfast and dinner are served on the outdoor terrace.  Meals are buffet style.  But there is a "trick" - an open kitchen.  At the request of the client, the steak is fried from the selected piece of meat right in front of the tourist.  If you eat according to the all inclusive system, then table wines, beer, mineral water and juices are free at all meals.  With half board (breakfast and dinner) drinks are served in the evening, and their price is indicated on the invoice.  Dishes are served a wide variety.  Every week there is a gala dinner where you can simply swallow your tongue - such a feast for the stomach.  Reviews say that even breakfasts at this hotel, although they always consist of the same set of dishes, are very diverse.  Several types of fried eggs, sausages, baking.  There are always a lot of fruits and vegetables. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Delfin Mar Complex 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1550578.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dining at the Dolphin Siesta Mar Hotel </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, this hotel is simpler.  But even in her restaurant the concept of "open kitchen" is introduced.  In this hotel, tourists also have a choice in the food system.  You can pay "all inclusive" or half board.  Reviews were divided on which is better.  Those who can‚Äôt sit still, of course, is more profitable to take half board.  But if you came to Mallorca for a cloudless relaxing holiday, then choose ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù.  All meals, of course, are served in buffet style, as in the entire Delfin Mar Complex 4 *.  The chefs specialize in the cuisine of the Balearic Islands (shrimp, mussels, grilled meat and fish).
