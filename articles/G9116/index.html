  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Developmental Learning Technology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In connection with the intensive technologization of the educational process, advanced ideas of training and education are clothed in the form of technologies.  One of the universally recognized is the <strong>technology of developing education.</strong> </p><p>  <strong>The psychological foundations of developing education</strong> were justified by the outstanding Russian psychologist <span>L.S.</span>  <span>Vygotsky.</span>  He first revealed the priority of development in training and education.  Orientation to the concept of L. S. Vygotsky ‚Äúzone of proximal development‚Äù in training has become the basis of many psychological and pedagogical studies, experiments in education. </p><p>  The followers of the scientist <span>A.N.</span>  <span>Leontiev,</span> P.Ya.  Halperin developed a psychological <span>theory of activity</span> in which the ideas of L.S. Vygotsky were further developed.  The implementation of developing <span>education in primary school</span> was undertaken by L.V.  Zankov, and later DB  Elkonin and V.V.  Davydov in the practice of experimental schools. </p><p>  The ability to develop exists in a person from birth.  Development is due to some hereditary mechanisms, however, the <span>social environment</span> is an essential factor in the formation of personality.  An important property of a personality - self-regulation, self-government - affects the process of human development, which proceeds in an individual version.  The development process is characterized by staging and unevenness.  Age-related changes determine the quantitative and qualitative development opportunities. </p><p>  In connection with the development of the theory of developmental education, suggestions were made that a child from <span>preschool age</span> is able to master many general theoretical concepts.  In this regard, it is possible to enhance mental development through the content of educational material, in which priority is given to raising the theoretical level. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>The technology of developing education</strong> involves the interaction of the teacher and students on the basis of collective distribution activities, the search for various ways to solve educational problems through the organization of educational dialogue in the research and search activities of students. </p><p>  <strong>The technology of developing education</strong> includes stimulating the child‚Äôs reflexive abilities, teaching self-control and self-esteem skills. </p><p>  <strong>The technology of developmental education is</strong> based on the concepts of developmental education of Russian scientists (L.V. Zankov, V.V. Davydov, D. B. Elkonin, Z. I. Kalmykova, E. N. Kabanova, G. A. Tsukerman, I. S. Yakimanskaya, G.K.Selevko and others) which are based on various aspects of the development of the child and certain motivational components. </p><p>  So, for example, L.V.  Zankov, V.V.  Davydov, DB. Elkonin rely on cognitive interest in the development of concepts of developing education.  I.S. Yakimanskaya gives priority to the individual experience of the individual.  G. Altshuller, I. Volkov, I. Ivanov focus on the creative needs of schoolchildren, and G.K.Selevko - on the need for self-improvement.  In any case, the technologies of developmental education consider the child as an independent subject of the learning process that interacts with the outside world. </p><p>  In the practice of schooling, the most widely used technologies of developing education are L.V. Zankova and D. B. Elkonin-V.V. Davydova. </p><p>  Didactic principles of developing education L.V. Zankova: </p><p>  - A high level of complexity at a fast pace of learning educational material. </p><p>  - Theoretical knowledge plays a leading role. </p><p>  - Promoting awareness of the learning process by people with practical skills. </p><p>  - The overall development of all students. </p><p>  The didactic foundations of developing education of D. B. Elkonin-V.V. Davydov: </p><p>  - The purpose of the training is the formation of theoretical thinking and consciousness. </p><p>  - The content of training is dominated by a system of scientific concepts based on general methods of learning actions. </p><p>  - Methodological features - the problematic presentation of educational material, the use of the method of educational tasks, the organization of collective distribution activities. </p>
