How to get to Zelenograd</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Zelenograd city district is one of the existing administrative regions of the capital of Russia.  There are 12. There are only 37 km from such a large metropolis as Moscow, Zelenograd, and it is located in the northwestern part of the region.  It is also the very first of three districts formed outside the MKAD.  And few people know that for a long time the city has been considered the main scientific and production center of Soviet and Russian electronics and microelectronics.  At one time, outstanding Russian researchers and scientists worked here.  Note: the city was originally intended as a large scientific platform. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Zelenograd has its own history of origin, its own traditions.  There is also a well-developed infrastructure.  Many residents of the capital and other regions buy real estate here.  Houses and apartments in Zelenograd, especially in new areas, are considered elite.  The city is literally surrounded by greenery.  Its name literally translates as "green city".  Despite the relatively close location from the capital, there is exceptionally clean air.  This is possible due to the abundance of plantations both within the boundaries of the settlement, and in its environs.  Transport links between Zelenograd and Moscow are well established.  Further in the article we learn more about the city, its features, territorial division.  The material will also provide information on how to get to the village from the capital and back, what mode of transport can be done. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zelenograd Moscow" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/460716.jpg" width="400"></div>

Its southeastern part borders on Fr.  Khimki, and the rest of the territory - with the Solnechnogorsk district.  Zelenograd, the photo of which is presented in the article, includes a number of settlements.  This, in particular, the village of Malino, the villages of Rozhki, Novomalino, Kutuzovo and part of the settlement Alabushevo.  Compared to other Moscow districts, the territory of Zelenograd is the smallest.  Before the accession to the capital in 2012 of new territories, it was also smaller than the rest in terms of population.  But at the same time, the city is more densely populated than, for example, Balashikha.  The latter, for information, is considered the largest settlement in the vicinity of the capital, and as a separate region it could well enter the first hundred of <span>the largest cities in Russia.</span>  Not so long ago, before the <span>expansion of Moscow,</span> Zelenograd occupied the second place of honor among urban districts in the number of green spaces.  Then their share was 30% of the entire territory, second only to the Eastern Administrative District. </p><h2>  The beginning of the story </h2><p>  Zelenograd (Moscow) was built on the site of the previously located villages of Matushkino and Savelki, the village of Kryukovo and a number of other smaller settlements and summer cottages.  With the <span>outbreak of World War II</span> in 1941, along the Kryukovsky highway (today it is called Panfilovsky Prospekt), a defensive line of Soviet troops passed from Kryukovo station.  Today in the city, as well as its environs, you can see a large number of monuments in honor of those important events.  The most famous of them is the Bayonets memorial complex.  December 3, 1966, in honor of the 25th anniversary of the defeat of enemy troops under the capital, the remains of the Unknown Soldier were taken from the <span>mass grave</span> and then reburied near the walls of the Kremlin in the Alexander Garden.  To this day, the remains of the dead, unexploded ordnance and other evidence of fierce battles are found on Zelenograd earth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="g Moscow Zelenograd" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/460718.jpg" width="400"></div>

On this day, the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a resolution on the construction of a new settlement near the Kryukovo station of the OZD to distribute the population.  For this, the state allocated 11.28 square meters.  km, which is only 30% of the total territory of the modern city.  The construction was to unfold between the Leningrad highway and the October Railway at a distance of 37-41 km from the central part of the capital.  The construction of the satellite town began in 1960. The development plan was developed by the chief architect Igor Evgenievich Rozhin.  Initially, the city of Zelenograd was conceived as the main center of textile production.  However, in 1962, thanks to the proposal of Alexander Ivanovich Shokin (chairman of the State Committee on Electronics), the main activity began to be planned in a different direction.  Now the task of developers has been to create a scientific center focused on the development of electronic and microelectronic technology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zelenograd how to get from Moscow" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/460719.jpg" width="500"></div>  Later, Zelenograd was often compared with the American Silicon (Silicon) Valley, in connection with which he received his main nickname - "Russian Silicon (less often - Silicon) Valley."  Some researchers in the history of the Russian electronic industry believe that Shokin's decision to put forward the reorientation initiative was significantly influenced by American engineers who fled to the USSR - Alfred Sarantu and Joel Barra (known in the country under the names Philippe Georgievich Staros and Joseph Veniaminovich Berg).

It was Lukin Fedor Viktorovich, and his deputy for science was F. G. Staros.  On January 15, 1963, the city under construction was found its name - Zelenograd.  It was appropriated by the act of the Executive Committee of the Metropolitan City Council of People's Deputies under number 3/25.  January 16, 1963 suburban n.  Zelenograd (Moscow) on the basis of the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the RSFSR was transferred to the subordination of the district administration.  January 25, 1963 all management functions were transferred to the hands of the Leningrad District Council of the capital.  In February 1965, Zelenograd was transferred from district to city subordination, thereby increasing the status of the city.  On March 2, 1965, in connection with the decree of the Moscow City Executive Committee, the city metropolitan Council of Workers' Deputies began to manage it.  In the fall of 1968 (on the basis of a new decision of the <span>Supreme Council of the RSFSR)</span> Zelenograd was additionally assigned the status of the Moscow region.  The general development plan, developed by the chief architect Igor Alexandrovich Pokrovsky and his large team (it included architects G. E. Saevich, F. A. Novikov and others), was adopted as the basis in 1971. </p>

    <h2>  Expansion <strong> </strong></h2><p>  In 1987, the village of Kryukovo and its surrounding environs were annexed to the territory of Zelenograd.  According to the developers, this place was intended for the construction of a new industrial zone.  But with the collapse of the USSR, the construction of the Center for Informatics and Electronics (EEC) was discontinued, without really having time to start, while the construction of a large housing stock continued.  The result was an imbalance in the number of city residents and the necessary jobs that Zelenograd could no longer provide.  The situation was also aggravated by the crisis of the Russian economy of those times.  A significant part of the city‚Äôs population was forced to travel from the New part of Zelenograd to the old one every day, or even to leave the region for Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="buses Zelenograd" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/460721.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Modern stage in development </h2><p>  In the summer of 1991, the capital, in connection with the decision on the need to form administrative districts instead of old districts, a reform of territorial division was put into effect.  According to her, Zelenograd (Moscow region) was transformed into a separate district.  In January 1992, this decision consolidated the decision of the current president of the Russian Federation, as well as the chairman of the Supreme Council of the Russian Federation.  In the same document, demarcations of Zelenograd appeared in 5 municipal circles: No. 1-4, Kryukovo.  Official registration as an administrative district was recorded on July 5, 1995 by the law on territorial division.  It also provides information on the zoning of the district in 5 parts.  After some time, the formations were renamed to the districts of Savely, Matushkino, Silino and Old Kryukovo.  Four industrial zones located on the territory of the Old Town turned out to be outside the Zelenograd district.  Later they were united into a single territorial group.  On December 4, 2002 Zelenograd (Moscow), along with its five inner-city municipalities, was further divided into 3 districts.  This, in particular, Panfilovsky, Matushkino-Savelki, Kryukovo.  The territorial unit "Zelenogradskaya", as well as a forest park located in the Old Town, were distributed between the areas of Matushkino-Savelki and Panfilovsky.  At the beginning of 2010, the number of districts increased to five.  Their names and territorial distribution were performed in accordance with the municipalities of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zelenograd Moscow train" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/460722.jpg" width="460"></div>
