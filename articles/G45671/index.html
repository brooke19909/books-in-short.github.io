So, here is the Sony Xperia E1 D2005.  We continue the review with information that the processor used is asynchronous, its kernels are switched off and started independently of each other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia e1 d2005 reviews" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/607964.jpg" width="600"></div>  That is, only the power that is currently required is used, and the battery is not consumed unnecessarily.  This is due to the STAMINA mode, which recognizes which functions you are not using and turns them off.  All important notifications are saved at the same time.  As soon as the smartphone enters the active mode, the functions are restored.
