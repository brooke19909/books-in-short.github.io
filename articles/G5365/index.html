  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scientific and technological revolution: pros and cons</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The scientific and technological revolution began in the middle of the twentieth century.  This was the rapid leap that world science made, and beyond it, and technology, fundamentally changing the <span>productive forces that</span> had existed so far in society.  Over the 20 years of scientific and technological research, the economy of most developed countries has grown several times, which gave rise to the development of a scientific and technological revolution in scientific and technological progress. </p><p>  <span>The</span> scientific and technological <span>revolution</span> takes place in close interaction of the scientific environment with the technical one, which leads to the development and improvement of technologies, as a result of which <span>labor productivity</span> grows and new <span>methods of managing</span> economic processes develop.  This process in any country has its own characteristics, due to common features that need to be addressed in more detail. </p><p>  So, the most important common features that the scientific and technological revolution has are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Science is turning into a direct productive force, the number of scientific studies on which countries spend huge material resources is growing.  Knowledge-intensive processes require appropriate specialists who are purposefully prepared by new education systems. </li><li>  Widely used computers, information and innovative technologies, old ones are intensified and new sources and types of energy are opening up.  In this regard, there are growing demands for advanced training of the <span>workforce</span> and an increase in their labor efficiency. </li><li>  The scientific and technological revolution leads to a sharp increase in the share of industry; there is an industrialization of agriculture.  A special place in the economies of the countries is occupied by mining and manufacturing industries, as well as mechanical engineering, the chemical industry and the electric power industry. </li><li>  A special place during the scientific and technical progress is given to management as the art of personnel management in modern production enterprises. </li></ol><p>  The scientific and technological revolution in the USSR also began in the 1950s.  In a short time, the following scientific institutions were organized and began to operate: Institute for High Pressure, Semiconductors, Computers, Nuclear Research.  The costs of science increased by more than 10 times, and the number of scientists increased by 6 times. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Urgently mastered new machines and technologies.  Rail transport was switched to electric traction, the first nuclear power plants were built.  The atomic icebreaker "Lenin" was launched into the voyage, the world's first <span>artificial</span> <span>Earth satellite was</span> sent into space <span>.</span>  The real victory was the flight into space of the first man. </p><p>  However, due to well-known circumstances, the scientific and technological revolution in the USSR soon began to lag behind the pace of the West.  Workers continued to work manually, which enabled the Soviet Union to proudly declare no unemployment.  At that time, few people thought about the damage to the economy. </p><p>  The scientific and technological revolution and medicine are also in conflicting interactions.  On the one hand, there are new possibilities for applying medical knowledge in previously unexplored areas of human health.  There is a narrowing of medical specialization, a qualitatively new technique is used.  All this has the most positive effect on the achievements of all areas of the medical field.  And on the other hand, the scientific and technological revolution and medicine together become the cause of new problems that exacerbate old, unresolved issues.  Narrow specialization leads to red tape during the examination of patients, the relationship between the patient and the doctor is lost.  There is a replacement of live communication mechanical. </p><p>  Thus, we see that STR, like any other phenomenon, has its pluses and its negative points.  Regardless of this, it is considered a progressive phenomenon. </p>
