How do these stands differ from ordinary parks?  For what purpose were the botanical gardens originally created?  What work is being done on them today?  Let's try to consider the example of a specific object, what role in ordinary life today is played by an ordinary botanical garden.  Yekaterinburg, as a city that can be proud of its work in the field of botany, will become the site of our little virtual research. </p><h2>  What is a botanical garden </h2><p>  The park is broken for the sake of a pleasant atmosphere, a kind of green oasis of nature among the gray concrete jungle of urban society.  And, although at first glance it might seem that the purpose of the botanical garden is the same, its role is much more thoughtful and serious. </p><p>  The Botanical Garden of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences Yekaterinburg (the Ural Branch of the <span>Russian Academy of Sciences of the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãof Yekaterinburg), like other similar objects, was founded primarily for research purposes.  Its aesthetic appeal is in no way disputed, but it is only secondary in priority. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yekaterinburg Botanical Garden" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/447270.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to do in the botanical garden </h2><p>  Botanical Garden (Yekaterinburg) was founded in 1936.  His primary task was to study in the field of possible acclimatization of various flora representatives in the given climatic zone.  In addition, a lot of attention in the work of this department is paid to the study of local plant species. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thanks to such studies, programs are being developed to preserve and increase the <span>diversity of plants,</span> which can take root at fairly low average annual temperatures.  The interdependence of various organisms and the possibilities of enrichment and restoration of endangered species are also being studied. </p><h2>  Current state of affairs </h2><p>  Currently, the Botanical Garden (Yekaterinburg) has six modern laboratories that are equipped with the appropriate equipment.  A collection of different species and varieties of plants reaches 4 thousand.  Some of them grow in greenhouses, where they maintain the necessary microclimate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yekaterinburg Botanical Garden site" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/447269.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  What to see </h2><p>  But if you are not a professor in biology, the Botanical Garden (Yekaterinburg) is more interested in you, as a beautiful living museum.  And this interest is not only deserved, but also highly praised. </p><p>  In fact, colorful compositions and landscape solutions in this garden will not leave anyone indifferent.  A number of greenhouses deservedly attracts special attention from visitors. </p><p>  The first greenhouse features a rich collection of flowering plants.  Among them, it is especially worth highlighting a diverse palette of orchids.  These exotic plants do not cease to amaze fans with their unusual shapes and a wide range of colors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Botanical Garden (Yekaterinburg), whose operating mode allows you to visit it both on weekdays and on weekdays, provides the opportunity to conduct photo shoots in this flowering environment.  But the time of the shooting must be agreed in advance. </p><p>  Representatives of the flora in this greenhouse may be inferior to their neighbors from the first division in the number of flowering plants.  However, the diversity of their forms and structures more than compensates for this gap.  Many species of these grassy representatives of the plant world attract the eye and fascinate even more of their bright counterparts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yekaterinburg Botanical Garden" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/447275.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The third greenhouse is actually also divided into two compartments, but the second is an experimental base for studying plant behavior and their reaction to various environmental stimuli.  Therefore, in itself, their contemplation is not of particular interest to visitors and excursions in this part of the greenhouse are not conducted for the general public. </p><p>  But the first section will provide you with a lot of fruit plants, about which people of our latitudes only read in books, but saw on television.  Here you can see how papaya, cinnamon and avocado grow.  Slender eucalyptus trees are adjacent to the sophisticated <span>Surinamese cherries,</span> and the fragrant myrtle grows next to a sprawling olive.  Here you can see rarities such as <span>candy tree</span> and <span>Japanese medlar.</span>  It is also interesting to see how fruits grow, which we used to see exclusively on store shelves.  Such as pomegranate, grapefruit and orange. </p><h2>  Pride <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="uro ran botanical garden" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/447284.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  However, the most famous and most visited is the greenhouse at number 4. The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis room is 750 square meters.  And its height allows you to grow large plants here that need heat.  These include various types of palm trees, ficus, cypress and cryptomeria. </p><p>  Many of the plants represented here are most attractive at the time of their flowering.  You can learn about flowering periods in advance.  This information is provided by the Botanical Garden (Yekaterinburg).  The site, created for communication with the general public, contains all the necessary data. </p>
