But the country is famous not only for this.  This ancient land holds many historical and cultural attractions.  There are more than one hundred seventy pieces of medieval castles in Slovakia alone!  Therefore, excursions will leave you with a deep impression.  If you look at the castles of Slovakia on the map, you can see that they are distributed unevenly throughout the country.  Especially a lot of them in Spissky region.  Of course, the time of building castles, as well as their degree of preservation, is different.  There are ruins of once proud feudal nests, and there are magnificent palace and park complexes of the late Renaissance.  This article is dedicated to Spissky Castle.  This is a castle inscribed on the World Heritage List of Humanity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spissky castle in slovakia" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/655895.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Spissky Castle (Slovakia) </h2><p>  Of the one hundred and seventy castles of the country, only six are on the UNESCO list.  According to tourists' reviews, both Betliar and Budmerice, as well as Zvolen, Devin and Mosowice are worth visiting.  Ghosts are found somewhere, somewhere the glorious history of the region has frozen in stone.  But the Spissky Castle in Slovakia is the most important.  This, as they say, is ‚Äúmast si,‚Äù according to country guides.  He, like the Tatras, is the <span>hallmark of</span> Slovakia and is often depicted on various souvenir products.  By the way, the castle is located near the mountains.  Climbing the hill that this citadel occupies, you can take a picture of the wonderful view of the white crown of the Tatra Mountains.  Magnificent pictures are obtained at the entrance to Spissky Castle.  Dolomite cliffs rise almost steeply to a height of 200 meters.  The castle, like an eagle, hovers above the town of Spisske Podhradie, hidden in the shadow of a hill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  Castles of Slovakia have a different origin.  Some appeared as fortified villages, later abandoned by the inhabitants and turned into military strongholds.  Others were built by the Hungarians as fortresses to defend against the Mongols.  Still others sprang up as baron hunting lodges or aristocratic country houses.  The history of Spissky Castle is very interesting.  Dolomite rocks, on which the castle now stands, were inhabited ten thousand years ago.  A Cro-Magnon skull was found here, but, unfortunately for modern tourists, the artifact was lost during World War II.  At the turn of the epochs (II century B.C. - I century A.D.), a Celtic settlement occupied the top of the rock.  Tourists claim that you can still find the ancient ramparts surrounding the village.  Later, for unknown reasons, residents moved to the nearby Drevenik hill. </p>

    <h2>  Castle appearance </h2><p>  The first monumental building that laid the foundation for Spissky Castle itself was the stone tower-dungeon.  She appeared at the turn of the XI-XII centuries.  The tower had several floors.  Here lived the family of the seigneur, as well as a military guard.  Tourists are shown the remains of the <span>water tank, the</span> foundations of the tower.  The structure itself was not preserved.  The tower was destroyed at the beginning of the XIII century as a result of an earthquake.  But even then Europe was clearly aware of the threat emanating from the East.  To protect their lands from the invasion of the Mongol hordes, the Hungarian king Bela IV ordered to strengthen the mountain and build a border outpost on it.  So the castle Spissky Castle arose in Slovakia, which we still see.  In particular, a palace and a round tower in the <span>Romanesque style</span> were built <span>.</span>  The efforts of Bela IV were not in vain - in 1241 the Mongol-Tatars did not take the stronghold. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spissky Castle Slovakia" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/656441.jpg" width="300"></div>

So the Upper Courtyard of the castle appeared with a three-story Gothic palace and a new tower called "Do not be afraid."  Judging by the style of this building, Italian architects were invited to build it.  Tourists advise not to be too lazy and climb the observation deck of the tower on a spiral staircase - from there breathtaking views open.  Although tours of the Knight's Hall and the owner‚Äôs rooms on the third floor are also interesting.  The castle at the end of the 13th century was owned by the regent and mother of King Laszlo IV Alzbiet Kumanska.  So it happened that the first persons of the kingdom began to dwell here.  In the middle of the 15th century, the Hetman of the Hungarian king Ladislav, Postumus Jan Iskra, ordered the expansion of the stronghold and its strengthening according to modern technology to protect against a possible siege.  So the Lower Yard appeared.  During the Ottoman conquest of <span>Hungary, the</span> Spissky Castle in Slovakia was in the center of events.  Here was born Jan Zapolsky.  After the defeat of Lajos II in the battle of Mojac, he became king of Hungary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Castles of Slovakia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/655901.jpg" width="384"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Passing from the hands of some owners to others, the castle was constantly being rebuilt in connection with the development of military art.  In the mid-sixteenth century, Spissky Grad ‚Äúgrew‚Äù with mighty bastions, and special loopholes for guns cut through its walls.  In 1636, this stronghold passed to the family of Tssaki, who owned it until 1945. At the end of the 18th century, a big fire broke out in the castle.  The owners considered it better to relocate to more convenient places than rebuild the burned property.  And in 1969, archaeologists began to work in the castle, then restorers.  In 1993, this <span>architectural monument</span> was honored to become an object of world cultural significance.  Now it has a museum.  He, according to reviews, is interactive.  Tours are conducted by knights, alchemists and princesses.  And in the Lower Courtyard you can practice archery and crossbow shooting.  Often, theatrical fights and tournaments are held on the territory of the castle museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Castles of slovakia on the map" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/655931.jpg" width="600"></div>
