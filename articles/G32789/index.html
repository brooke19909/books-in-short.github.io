There are industrial centers, and cultural, and even sports.  And also on the territory of the state are, so to speak, closed cities.  What does this mean?  As a rule, they are created near secret objects.  One of these cities is Mezhgorye (Bashkortostan).  Of course, to come here to visit is quite problematic, however, it is possible.  The city is very beautiful, clean.  Its area is slightly less than 220 square meters.  km  Anyone who still wants to visit Mezhgorye can use the coordinates: 54 ¬∞ 03‚Ä≤00 ‚Ä≥ s.  w.  57 ¬∞ 49‚Ä≤00 ‚Ä≥ c.  d. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="foothills of Bashkortostan" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1213529.jpg" width="600"></div>

According to one version, secret weapons, nuclear warheads and much more are interesting and secret.  But another version says that a bunker has been built in Mezhgorye (Bashkortostan), in which there are huge reserves of food and treasures.  In it, in the event of a negative situation in the country, the first persons of the state can live for a long time calmly and completely comfortably.  Rumor has it that the construction of <span>an underground city</span> for 300 thousand people, the so-called reserve capital of the country, is still ongoing in Mezhgorye. </p><h2>  City development </h2><p>  The city of Mizhhiria (Bashkortostan) has the status of a closed territorial entity and it is hardly possible to go on vacation here to get acquainted with local attractions, for example, the ski resort "Abzakovo".  Just want to note that you can admire the infinitely beautiful and picturesque landscapes. </p><p>  Mezhgorye is among the top 10 safest places found by scientists in the world in which it will be possible to survive during and after the end of the world.  Despite the special secrecy, people also live here and culturally develop in 3 municipal cultural institutions.  Children go to kindergarten.  In the city of Mezhgorye (Bashkortostan) there are 5 preschool institutions, 3 schools, children's interest groups and studios.  There are also two hospitals, pharmacies, outpatient clinics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="g intermountain republic of Bashkortostan" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1213526.jpg" width="500"></div>

You can see many monuments to the heroes of the Second World War, builders, the <span>Poklonnaya Cross,</span> as well as a monument to the ruler of Spain, Francisco. </p><p>  Sports occupy a special place in the life of local residents; a stadium, a tennis court, sports halls, chess clubs, and fitness clubs function in the city. </p><h2>  Mount Yamantau - a great place to relax </h2><p>  Despite the impossibility of the public to get to Mizhhiria (Bashkortostan), many tourists can climb secretly on Mount Yamantau.  According to them, since 2000, in order to engage in mountaineering here, a number of rules must be observed.  Such measures are necessary, since the mountain is located on the territory of the reserve and is strictly guarded by rangers and military.  It is necessary to observe silence, not to make fires and, in general, not to betray his presence, unless, of course, there is a desire to get acquainted with the "culture" of the special forces and the harsh laws of huntsmen. </p><p>  Those who ascended to the top say that the mountain is a small plateau, and there is also a lot of debris thrown by the builders long ago.  Tourists also saw many mines that go deep into mountain formations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="republic of bashkortostan mezhgorye" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1213537.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is an opinion (the legend of the ancestors) that Yamantau is the heart of the Universe, it supplies blood (energy) to everything on the planet.  And if, despite all the obstacles created by the local authorities, you manage to somehow get on a mountain or swim in the Small Inzer River, then you will be filled with powerful energy that will bring health, strength, wisdom and immortality to your life. </p>
