The successful location of the complex makes it possible to visit the Dubai Mall with its many entertainment venues, as well as visit the Saga Republic.  Visiting Dubai, you should definitely pay attention to its amazing sights. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Movenpick Hotel Jumeirah Beach 5 * is located in close proximity to the beach.  The road to the coast takes no more than three to five minutes.  Jumeirah Beach is one of the best stretches of the coast of Dubai.  It stretched for a distance of two kilometers along the famous promenade "Wok".  The beach is free, but it is equipped with showers, toilets and changing rooms.  A lot of playgrounds, sections with street exercise machines are equipped on its territory, there are also green lawns and a treadmill.  It is worth noting that the beach is incredibly popular among tourists and locals.  There are always a lot of people here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="movenpick jumeirah beach 5 service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2095217.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The popularity of this stretch of coast is explained by the fact that there is no need to pay entry fees, and the infrastructure is no worse than on private beaches.  Local patrols pay close attention to safety, which is important for tourists.  There are also rescue stations where real rescuers are on duty around the clock. </p><h2>  Holidays in November </h2><p>  Weather in the UAE in November favors holidaymakers.  It is this month that the largest number of tourists is observed.  And this is due to the fact that the heat is gradually subsiding.  The weather in the UAE in November is becoming more favorable for all kinds of events: sporting events, tournaments, championships, festivals and tourist excursions.  True, in Dubai, air temperature is higher than in other emirates.  On average, there is + 30-32 degrees.  Even at night, the readings of thermometers do not fall below the mark of + 17-18 degrees.  Therefore, in the evenings you can take exciting walks along the coast of the Persian Gulf.  The new promenade is literally created to have a good time here. </p><p>  November is considered a comfortable time to relax in the Emirates.  If before this there is heat, then with the onset of autumn, the situation changes slightly.  Resting in November, you can see local attractions.  The weather is favorable not only for beach vacations, but also for active travel and shopping. </p><h2>  Guest room reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews.  Movenpick Jumeirah Beach 5 * is located in a very beautiful and incredibly convenient place.  Nearby is the sea, the promenade, the best shopping and entertainment centers, and what else is needed on vacation in Dubai.  According to tourists, the only minor drawback can be considered a construction site near the hotel.  But this is no longer the institution's fault.  It is worth saying that construction work does not bother guests, especially if you live on the upper floors.  Dubai is an intensively built and developing city, so new hotels and shopping centers are being erected here and there very often. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are very beautiful and have a luxurious design.  All furniture and appliances are modern and new.  The apartments are very functional, they have everything you need, including a coffee machine, tea sets and a work area.  The entire hotel has a very high-quality Internet connection, and it is free.  This is very convenient for guests, because you can not only contact your relatives at any time, but also solve work matters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="movenpick jumeirah beach 5 food" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2095264.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The rooms have beautiful comfortable beds that are praised by all vacationers.  There is also a minibar, if you plan to use it, you will have to make a deposit.  Otherwise, refuse it upon arrival, then they will not take money from you.  The hotel has a very high quality daily cleaning.  Maids are responsible for their duties.  They not only keep the apartments clean, but also regularly replenish detergents and the contents of the minibar. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  According to tourists, the Movenpick Jumeirah Beach 5 * service is worthy of praise.  Of course, negligent employees are found in any institution, but in general, the service of the staff is very good.  A Russian girl works at the reception and helps our tourists with any questions.  Therefore, if necessary, you can safely turn to her.  By the way, the hotel staff willingly make contact with guests and try to help in everything.  If for some reason you do not like the number, then it will be replaced in literally a matter of minutes.  Here you do not have to spend your precious time on persuasion. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel has an excellent manager, for whom the impression of his establishment is important.  It helps to resolve all issues so that tourists are satisfied. </p><p>  The hotel has many bars and restaurants, all of them are beautiful and offer delicious food.  Breakfast at the restaurant is popular with many guests.  Tourists will definitely recommend visiting the spa.  Stunning treatments and good service will complement the already good hotel experience. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="movenpick jumeirah beach 5 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2095263.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A huge advantage of the complex is its proximity to the sea.  The hotel, in fact, is on the first line.  True, at present, the road to the beach passes a little away from the construction site.  But such moments do not interfere at all.  On the coast, the hotel has its own plot, where guests are given free umbrellas and sun loungers.  Holidays in the Persian Gulf - it's just a paradise.  Beautiful landscapes and stunningly warm sea - a guarantee of a good vacation. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, it is worth emphasizing that tourists unanimously recommend the hotel not only for business, but also for a beach holiday.  The high level of service, excellent location and chic rooms will leave a lot of pleasant impressions about the time spent in this wonderful place. </p>
