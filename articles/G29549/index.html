    <p>  Let's start with the characteristics of the bank, its general description.  According to official information from shareholders, he belongs to 98% to billionaire Dmitry Pumpyansky (the remaining share is in the hands of minority investors).  This is confirmed by the fact that the bank is engaged in servicing settlements of the Pipe Metallurgical Company, which is controlled by the same person. </p><p>  However, if we look at the funding sources of this institution, we notice the lion's share related to <span>deposits.</span>  Probably, this area is singled out as a priority. </p><p>  If we turn to history, it was founded back in 1990, but at that time it was a branch of Agroprombank, only later it was renamed the Bank for Assistance to Commerce and Business.  It is from here that the contraction that we see today has occurred.  Until 2013, the bank changed hands, until it was bought out by a group led by Pumpyansky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To understand the scope of activities, you should look at the following figures: SKB Bank (employee reviews can confirm this) consists of seven branches operating in Moscow, Khabarovsk, Vologda, Udmurtia, Volgograd, Ryazan and Omsk.  In total, the institution is divided into 69 management offices, as well as 108 operating rooms.  For the convenience of <span>working with clients</span> , the bank has a network of terminals (about 200 machines in different cities) and almost 600 ATMs.  If you read the reviews on the highest echelons of management devoted to SKB-Bank, you can find out more than 2.3 million serviced cards.  Partially these data are confirmed by the bank itself. </p><h2>  Services to individuals </h2>

    <p>  On the official website of the institution there is a whole section devoted to options for <span>individuals.</span>  If you go into it, you can learn about the classic banking set - lending, accepting deposits and other options.  As the customer reviews describing SKB Bank show, the information policy in the institution is simple - you can either read everything that interests you yourself or find out from the representatives of the institution.  We could not find out about any hidden information that would put a person at a disadvantage.  Thus, the transparency of the conditions and the availability of information cannot but rejoice. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Loans </h2><p>  An institution such as SKB Bank (credit reviews can be found without any difficulty) has 8 products for issuing funds to private clients.  In addition to their selection, the client is given the opportunity to use a special designer, in which you need to specify the amount of the desired loan, the term and conditions for its receipt. </p>

    <p>  For example, the most universal product is ‚ÄúFor Everything About Everything‚Äù, within the framework of which the user can provide from 51 thousand to 1.8 million rubles for various purposes.  Starting from the amount of 180 thousand rubles, the bank will require a certificate of income from the borrower.  With it, the interest rate can reach a level of 18 to 30.9%, while without it the client can count on 34.9% per year. </p><p>  In addition, such options as a credit card (with a limit of up to 300 thousand rubles, providing for cash-back), three types of mortgage programs (for a secondary object, with state participation, as well as for the purchase of housing in the Roshchinsky complex) are presented here, a loan for holders of bank cards issued and serviced in an institution such as SKB Bank (reviews indicate that there are quite favorable conditions on this plan), and so on.  As we see, the bank has a wide range of tools for working with private clients in the field of lending.  And now, for example, a mortgage received in an institution called SKB Bank (reviews will confirm this) can be a great chance to make housing more affordable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Deposits </h2><p>  The same can be said about the set of deposits, allowing everyone to receive income from placing their funds in this institution.  So, at the time of writing, we were able to identify 4 main programs for which finance is raised. </p><p>  The most popular of them, which SKB Bank is actively promoting, is the Lucky Coin deposit.  Reviews call it the most flexible and versatile product, because its conditions allow you to open a deposit in three currencies, partially withdraw ahead of schedule without loss of interest.  The first year, the investor makes a profit of 10.5% per annum, after which the bank pays 3 percent per year for another 2 years. </p>

    <p>  You can also open a contribution that allows you to do charity work, a pension deposit (8% of profit), the product ‚ÄúActive Account‚Äù for the ability to constantly withdraw funds (7% of income).  Such offers its customers deposits of SKB Bank.  Reviews characterize this financial instrument as a good opportunity to increase their savings. </p><h2>  Other options </h2><p>  For more comfortable work with the bank, the client is invited to use one of the additional services.  In particular, it is a mobile banking service (‚ÄúBank-on-the-go‚Äù), an Internet service for banking operations (‚ÄúBank-on-the-couch‚Äù), Begom money transfer program.  Also, as an add-on, VIP clients are offered the Elite-bank service, within the framework of which individual service is organized.  For ordinary customers, the bank offers the function of SMS informing about all operations on the account. </p><h2>  Services for business and corporate clients </h2><p>  In addition to interacting with private users, the bank also works with business representatives (entrepreneurs and companies).  For them, on the institution‚Äôs website SKB Bank (reviews can confirm this), two corresponding tabs are provided.  By clicking on them, the client receives all the information he needs regarding his service in the institution. </p>

    <h2>  Loans </h2><p>  One of the most popular is the service of providing borrowed funds - lending.  The programs for issuing loans in the case of entrepreneurs and companies differ from those presented on the page working with private individuals.  In particular, four plans are provided here, within the framework of which completely different conditions for working with a client are applicable.  For example, under the Stable Growth program, a borrower can receive from 10 million rubles for a period of 12, 24 or 36 months to choose from.  For his part, he will be required to provide a security deposit in an amount not less than 50% of the loan amount.  There is also a mandatory requirement regarding the duration of the business for which a loan is issued.  The activity of the borrower must be no less than 12 months.  The interest rate starts at 13% per annum and increases depending on what means the loan will be secured.  According to the establishment of SKB Bank, feedback on loans left by customers, here are quite flexible conditions that can adapt to your expectations. </p><h2>  Deposits </h2><p>  For legal entities and business entities, the opportunity to make deposits for further capital increase is also available.  The specific conditions of what interest rate a bank can offer its customers are not indicated on the site, because it all depends on many factors, such as the amount of the deposit, the duration of its placement and the like.  Therefore, the interaction of the institution with any company is carried out individually in each case, within the framework of a particular deposit program.  The latter may include both a long-term contribution and placement of funds for a period of 1 day (for example, for a weekend period). </p><p>  As an alternative to deposits, the bank describes the repurchase of bills. </p><h2>  Salary projects </h2><p>  For more comfortable work, SKR-Bank offers its customers to create a special salary project.  Within its framework, the issuance of bank cards to employees and the further creation of a payment system for them may be provided.  This, as indicated on the bank‚Äôs page, is a simple, profitable and safe way to transfer funds to a large number of employees without delays or any difficulties. </p><p>  In addition to beneficial cooperation with the employer, the bank also offers a lot of options for employees holding cards.  For example, it may be providing an opportunity to get a loan on more favorable terms according to a simplified scheme. </p><h2>  RKO </h2><p>  If we consider SKB Bank (2015, reviews from corporate clients), you can also see information about the settlement and cash services.  This, as you know, is one of the activities of the institution and a separate service to entrepreneurs and small businesses. </p>

    <p>  As part of this option, the bank opens an account according to which it conducts all further activities (issuing certified copies of documents to it, reports for submission to state regulatory authorities, informing via SMS, access to Internet banking, etc.).  A single payment for all these operations is 500 rubles. </p><h2>  Bank guarantees </h2><p>  Another service for corporate clients is the issuance of guarantees.  This can be either a guarantee on a contract, a customs guarantee or a guarantee of an advance payment.  In this area, SKB Bank (customer reviews confirm this) provides a wide range of tools, more about which is indicated directly on the institution‚Äôs website. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  In fact, if we consider the characteristics devoted to the bank, left by customers, you can find many negative ones.  If you analyze most of them, you can notice the opinions of those who are dissatisfied with the conditions of certain products.  This is a normal process, since such situations developed, as we see from the reviews, most often not in favor of the client. </p>

    <p>  However, it is very simple to deal with this course of things - it is enough to read all the documents provided by the bank in advance and find out all the conditions under which you will cooperate with the institution. </p><h2>  Employee Reviews </h2><p>  To understand how the bank works, you also need to refer to the reviews left by employees.  Many of them are negative, but there are those where good working conditions are noted.  This is normal, because people who are satisfied with everything are unlikely to start looking for sites with reviews on the network - this is mainly done by those employees who do not like something. </p><p>  <span>Working at SKB Bank, the reviews</span> we were looking for, is not easy - some say that it really needs a lot of effort.  Nevertheless, wages will be worthy of all efforts.  At least this is confirmed by the same employees. </p><p>  There are a lot of comments about the fact that the employees of this structure were impudent (or even somehow brought trouble) to the authorities.  However, in all such situations, it should be understood that the reason is not the general policy of the institution, but the position and attitude of a particular person.  Since about 3.6 thousand people are part of the staff of an institution called SKB Bank, feedback from employees based on stories when someone offended them is not serious.  And this is easy to verify by independently looking at the reviews. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  You can summarize about this bank, taking into account the indicators of its success and what results it achieved in the commercial market.  Since this is the second largest <span>bank</span> in its region in terms of <span>assets</span> , having representative offices in the capital and constantly increasing its share in a certain segment of the business, we can note its work only on the positive side. </p>
