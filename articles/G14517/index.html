In 2020, he will turn 200 years old.  This is a typical Cuban city of medium size. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guantanamo prison" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/226880.jpg" width="575"></div>  It has ‚Äúcube-shaped‚Äù modern buildings, a beautiful church, several examples of nineteenth-century architecture.  Around are sugar plantations, a semi-desert famous for Monitongos - stone natural formations similar to a train running through the desert.  But Guantanamo is not known today for this.  The prison (photo), built in 2002, is today considered one of the most cruel on the planet.  Officially, it is intended for terrorists and those who fought on the side of the enemy.  This place today is one of the most visited "attractions" of Guantamo.  The prison is located 30 km from the city, and, of course, tourists are not allowed even close to it.  But few of them miss the opportunity, even from afar, to look at the walls of the casemate, which has become famous throughout the world for its rigidity and violation of the rights of prisoners.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Why Guantamo?  The prison is built by the United States and is indefinitely rented from Cuba.  In the same territory is the <span>military base of America.</span>  It bears the same name as the bay, river, province and city: Guantamo.  Prison is its natural extension.  The first "tenants" were brought here in 2002.  20 Afghans fighting on the side of the Taliban became the first prisoners of the casemate.  Since then, more than 750 foreigners passed through it, among which there were eight Russians.  Some of them were extradited, some were transferred to other prisons, some were released.  But Guantanamo was not famous for this.  The prison is notorious for the fact that many prisoners have been held there for years without charge.  Moreover, there were and are many criminals whose names are kept secret in the most thorough manner.  Is it justified?  There are different opinions among politicians.  In 2006, B. Obama issued an order to disband and close the casemate.  The whole world knew how cruelly prisoners were tortured there, how they mocked and humiliated their dignity.  After Obama‚Äôs decree, some of them were released, another was transferred to other places.  But the decree was never fulfilled: several prisoners (according to various sources, from 10 to 490 people) are still kept there. </p>

    <p>  Why is everyone so afraid of Guantanamo?  The prison became famous for the fact that they contain not only those who have already committed a crime.  Even those who can do this are kept here.  What is Guantanamo?  A prison on the territory of which not a single law or convention operates. <br>  A few months ago, the world was shocked by shots of mockery of prisoners.  Of course, such cruelty and such lawlessness have no justification.  On the other hand, it is known for certain: 99% of the prisoners who were released from Guantanamo again take up arms and direct them against peace on the planet.  Some politicians believe that they are doing this in order to take revenge on those who kept them in prison.  Others are sure that no camera, no bullying will be able to re-educate terrorists.  What awaits Guantamo next?  Unknown  But now, not only the beauty of nature attracts tourists to the <span>island of Cuba.</span>  Guantanamo Prison is an object that attracts the close, sometimes unhealthy attention of many people arriving on Liberty Island. </p>
