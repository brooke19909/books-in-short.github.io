Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a more interesting occupation, especially crocheting: simple, fast and beautiful. </p><p>  Truly, a hook is a magic wand!  After all, with the help of this little magic wand you can create simply amazing things: clothes, toys, jewelry, accessories, shoes, hats, bedspreads, tablecloths and this is not the whole list! </p><p>  Of course, you can also knit all this with knitting needles, but knitting with needles requires more professionalism than crocheting, it‚Äôs all harder: there are at least two knitting needles, there are a lot of open loops, you need to make sure that you don‚Äôt run away, and when crocheting, there is only one open loop, for it‚Äôs easier to keep track of it. </p><p>  But, of course, the argument does not make sense which is better: knitting needles or hook.  Here, those who like more, taste and color, as they say, have no friends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingmatters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple crochet flowers" class="if uuid-2593325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2593325.jpg"></div><h2>  The benefits of needlework </h2><p>  Crochet or knitting, however, like any other type of needlework, is a very useful activity.  It is proved that women (and sometimes men) are attracted to such opportunities in handiwork: </p><p>  - firstly, relax, distract from daily worries, we can say this is a kind of meditation; </p><p>  - secondly, to prove oneself, one‚Äôs creative potential, creative ideas, that is, self-realization is evident; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - thirdly, the creation of beauty from accessible materials, because every woman wants to be at least a little witch! </p><div class="photo" data-original="thegreendragonfly.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Warmer with flowers on a teapot" class="if uuid-2593332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2593332.jpg"></div><h2>  Flowers - a magnificent gift of nature </h2><p>  Flowers are a wonderful creation of nature, people have always admired them.  I always wanted to use such beauty to decorate my clothes and housing: flowers accompany a person all his life. </p><p>  But fresh flowers are very short-lived, especially cut ones.  Therefore, I had to work hard to figure out how to extend their century. </p><p>  One option is the manufacture of artificial flowers. </p><p>  From which only they do not!  From paper, from fabric, from beads, from various modern materials, foamiran, for example.  You can embroider them with threads or ribbons, make from any improvised raw materials, lots of options. </p><p>  Better yet, grab them and crochet, for example.  Crocheting flowers is an incredibly interesting activity!  In addition, it does not require almost any costs: each needlewoman will always have the remains of thread, special hooks also do not need to be bought.  And to tie such a small thing as a flower does not take much time. </p><p>  But the pleasure received from the result of his work is incomparable with anything! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="lucykatecrochet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet flower" class="if uuid-2581573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2581573.jpg"></div><h2>  How to crochet a flower? </h2><p>  So, you need to take yarn, the appropriate hook, a suitable pattern and boldly get down to business. </p><p>  Crochet flowers for beginners knit easily and uncomplicated </p><p>  For this, a simple scheme is taken, which consists of only two parts: the middle of the flower and the petals (their number is determined by the circumstances). </p><p>  When choosing yarn for a flower, you need to pay attention to its texture, that is, the thickness of the thread: it should match at different parts of the flower. </p><p>  Any color is possible for knitted flowers, the main thing is to have a harmonious and beautiful combination. </p><div class="photo" data-original="susanshippiecrochet.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Double layer flower" class="if uuid-2581579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2581579.jpg"></div><h2>  Crochet flowers: master class </h2><p>  The master class consists of two stages of knitting a flower: the middle and the petals. </p><p>  Legend: </p><p>  in / p - air loop; </p><p>  RLS - SC; </p><p>  CCH - double crochet; </p><p>  Description of crocheted colors usually uncomplicated.  For example, chamomile. </p><ol><li>  The middle is knitted of yellow threads.  We make a ‚Äúmagic ring‚Äù, we knit 6 sc in it. </li><li>  In each RLS of the previous row we knit 2 RLS, that is, a total of 12 RLS should be obtained.  We cut the thread. </li><li>  We connect a white thread in the middle completion column, we knit a chain of 12 v / p. </li><li>  We knit 10 CCH into it, fix the thread with a half-column in the next column of the center. </li><li>  Then we knit again a chain of 12 CCHs, that is, move on to the next petal. </li><li>  So we knit to the end of the row. </li><li>  The thread from the last petal is connected to the beginning of knitting of the first petal, cut and carefully tucked. </li></ol><p>  As a visual aid, we suggest watching a video of the master class, and then it will turn out to crochet the flowers even for a novice craftswoman. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="ImnPvinHLlQ" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImnPvinHLlQ" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/5/0/5/9/5059.jpg"></div><h2>  Crochet flowers with patterns </h2><p>  For beginner knitters, you will need patterns by which you can tie the selected flower.  In order to understand the scheme, that is, read it, you need to know the conventions, they are always described in detail at the beginning or at the end of the scheme, so that even those who only comprehend this science should not have difficulties. </p><p>  And, by the way, in crocheting flowers, workshops like the ones suggested above will always help. </p><p>  There are many flowers, you can decorate anything with them. </p><p>  For example, you can use a crocheted flower on a hat, or to decorate a handbag, blouse. </p><p>  For a summer hat, you can knit a whole bouquet of different flowers, complementing them with connected stems and leaves.  Here, for example, is not a very complicated knitting pattern for a daffodil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet color schemes" class="if uuid-2590748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2590748.jpg"></div><h2>  Variety of shapes </h2><p>  Crocheting flowers is so diverse that it is simply amazing what beauty human imagination and skillful hands can create! </p><p>  Flowers are knitted in pots, and the pot is also crocheted, they are in a vase, they are used as jewelry for hats, blouses and so on. </p><p>  Knitted flowers can be voluminous or single-layer, large or miniature. </p><p>  You can crochet absolutely any flowers, even irises, poppies are knitted.
