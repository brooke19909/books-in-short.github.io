This happened so unexpectedly and at the same time naturally that the Russians began to take what had happened as a matter of course.  Until some time, no one resented Tsarevna Sofya Alekseevna, whose biography is so unusual.  However, after several years, when she had to transfer the reins of power into the hands of Peter I, people were surprised: how did it happen that they honored the empress, who was only a woman.  Of course, Princess Sophia was an outstanding personality.  A photo and biography of her will give you some idea of ​​her. </p><h2>  Sophia’s life in retreat </h2>

    <p>  It all started with the death of <span>Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich.</span>  However, after his death, Princess Sophia (years of reign - 1682-1689) did not immediately realize that she had become free.  The autocrat’s daughter was a recluse in a tower of 19 years with her sisters.  She went to church only accompanied and sometimes attended shows with her father that were arranged with Artamon Matveev.  The princess, brought up in house-building, was also one of the best students of Simeon of Polotsk, a well-known enlightener.  She was fluent in Polish, read in Greek and Latin.  Repeatedly, this woman surprised her surroundings, writing a tragedy that was immediately played out in the family circle.  And sometimes poetry was written by Sophia.  The Tsarevna was so successful in art that even the famous writer and historian Karamzin noted this.  He wrote that the princess's talent allowed her to compare with the best writers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Chance to Get Out of the Terem </h2><p>  In 1676, with the accession of <span>Fyodor Alekseevich,</span> Sophia’s brother, the latter suddenly realized that there was a chance to finally get out of the tower.  Her brother was seriously ill, and at that time Sophia was often with him.  The princess often visited Fedor’s chambers, talked with clerks and boyars, sat in the Duma, and delved into the essence of governing the country. </p><p>  The autocrat died in 1682, and a dynastic crisis ensued in the state.  The candidates for the throne were not suitable for such a responsible post.  The heirs were the son of Natalia Naryshkina, a young Peter and the moron Ivan, whom Maria Miloslavskaya gave birth to Alexei Mikhailovich.  These two parties - the Naryshkins and Miloslavsky - fought among themselves. </p><h2>  Election of sovereign Peter </h2><p>  According to the established tradition, Ivan was to become the king.  However, this would entail the need for custody during his reign.  Sophia hoped for this.  The princess was disappointed when the sovereign was elected 10-year-old Peter.  Sophia could only congratulate his half-brother on this.  It was now difficult for her to challenge the legality of his accession. </p><h2>  Sagittarius Riot and Sophia's reign </h2>

    <p>  However, Sophia had nothing to lose.  The decisive and independent princess could not help but take advantage of the situation prevailing in her favor.  For her purpose, Sofia involved the Streltsy regiments.  The princess persuaded them to revolt, as a result of which John and Peter officially began to reign.  And Sophia was handed over government by the state. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the joy of this victory could be premature.  Sophia’s power seemed ghostly these days.  Sagittarius, headed by Prince Khovansky, possessed too real power.  Under a plausible pretext, Sofia lured from the capital of Khovansky to the village of Vozdvizhenskoye.  Here, the head of the <span>Streletsky order</span> was accused of treason and executed.  The army, therefore, was without a leader.  Tsarevna Sofya Alekseevna immediately threw a cry, mobilizing a noble militia to protect the legitimate authority.  Sagittarius was in a state of shock, they did not know what to do.  At first they conceived to give battle to the ruler and the boyars, however, they caught on and capitulated in time.  Sophia now dictated her will to the archers.  Thus began the 7-year regency of Princess Sophia Alekseevna. </p><h2>  <span>Prince Golitsyn,</span> commutation of sentences </h2>

    <p>  Favorite Sophia, Prince Vasily Golitsyn (pictured above), became the head of government.  It was a talented diplomat.  Close and prolonged communication with him made Sophia a staunch supporter of leniency and education.  By the way, later rumors spread about the existence of a carnal connection between them.  Nevertheless, neither correspondence with the favorite of the princess, nor evidence relating to the time of her reign, confirm this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, the influence of Golitsyn on Sophia, of course, was great.  In particular, a decree was issued according to which creditors were forbidden to borrow debtors husbands without their wives to work off the debt.  In addition, it was forbidden to collect debts from orphans and widows, if there was no estate left after the death of their fathers and husbands.  From now on, for "outrageous words" did not execute.  Severe punishment has been replaced by a link and a whip.  Previously, a woman who had changed her husband was buried in the ground alive in the neck.  Now, such an excruciating death was replaced with a lighter one - the traitor was threatened with a cut off of the head. </p><h2>  Industry development </h2><p>  The reign of Princess Sophia was noted by a number of initiatives for the development of industry, the revival of trade with the West.  This was especially true of weaving.  In our country, they began to produce expensive fabrics: brocade, satin and velvet.  Previously, they were imported from overseas.  Foreign specialists began to be discharged from abroad in order to teach Russian masters. </p><h2>  Foundation of the Academy, promotion of education and the arts </h2><p>  Sophia in 1687 opened the Slavic-Greek-Latin Academy.  The work of its creation was begun under Tsar Fedor Alekseevich.  After the Kiev scientists began to pursue the patriarch Joachim, Golitsyn and Sophia took them under protection.  Tsarevna encouraged the construction in Moscow of stone choirs, the study of languages ​​and various arts.  Young people from noble families went abroad to study. </p><h2>  Success in Foreign Policy </h2>

    <p>  And in the sphere of foreign policy, success was noticeable.  Russia concluded the Eternal Peace with the Commonwealth.  This power, in accordance with the conditions presented by Golitsyn, recognized the transition to the Russian state of Kiev and Russia's belonging to the Left-Bank Ukraine, Seversky and Smolensk lands.  The Nerchinsk Treaty concluded with China has become another important political event.  At that time, Russian lands in Siberia bordered on this state. </p><h2>  Crimean campaigns </h2>

    <p>  However, there were setbacks that made, in the end, and led to the overthrow of Sophia and Golitsyn (his portrait is presented above).  An experienced diplomat, the favorite of the princess was a gentle and indecisive person.  He completely did not imagine himself a commander.  However, Sophia insisted that this man lead the Crimean campaign, which ended in failure.  The army from the campaign carried out in 1687 returned.  They were prevented by the Tatars, who set fire to the steppe.  However, Sophia even arranged an inglorious return with all solemnity.  She wanted to support Golitsyn.  At that time, the favorite was openly said that he only killed people in vain, having embarked on this adventure.  And the second campaign was unsuccessful.  It was undertaken two years later. </p><h2>  Sophia is losing power </h2>

    <p>  Until the kings grew up, the regency of Princess Sophia allowed her to independently solve all state issues.  During the reception of foreign ambassadors, the princess hid behind the throne and told the brothers how to behave.  However, time passed, Peter over the years of the reign of Sophia matured.  On May 30, 1689, <span>Peter the Great</span> turned 17 years old.  At the insistence of Natalia Kirillovna, his mother, he had already married by that time Evdokia Lopukhina and had become an adult, according to the concepts of that time.  In addition, Ivan, the eldest king, was also married.  That is, there were no formal grounds for continuing the regency.  However, Sophia still held the reins in her hands.  This led to conflicts with Peter. </p><p>  Relations between him and his sister became increasingly hostile.  The princess was well aware that the balance of power with each year would change not in her favor.  In order to strengthen her own position, she made an attempt to marry the kingdom back in 1687.  Fyodor Shaklovity, a close clerk of the princess, began agitation among the archers.  However, they did not forget what happened to Prince Khovansky and refused to support Sophia. </p><p>  The first skirmish between the princess and Peter occurred when Sophia dared to participate with the kings in the procession of the cathedral.  Peter was angry.  He said that she was a woman, so she should immediately leave, since it was obscene for the fair sex to follow the crosses.  However, Sophia decided to ignore her brother's reproach.  Then Peter himself left the ceremony.  He inflicted a second insult on his sister, refusing to accept Prince Golitsyn after the Crimean campaign. </p><h2>  An attempt to eliminate Peter </h2>

    <p>  So, the wedding attempt Sophia failed.  However, there was another way out - it was possible to eliminate Peter.  Once again the princess relied on the archers, but this time in vain.  Someone started a provocative rumor, saying that Peter’s ridiculous regiments were going to Moscow in order to kill Tsar Ivan and the ruler.  Sophia called the archers to the defense.  And in turn, rumors reached Peter that the attack of "dirty tricks" was being prepared (that is exactly what Peter called archers).  The tsar was not afraid of the threat, however, from childhood, the picture of 1682 remained in his mind when the archers carried out massacre of people close to him.  Peter decided to take refuge in the Trinity-Sergius Monastery.  After some time, amusing regiments came here, as well as, to the surprise of many, one regiment of archers, commanded by Sukharev. </p><p>  The flight of Peter perplexed Sophia.  She wanted to make peace with her brother, but the attempts were unsuccessful.  Then Sophia decided to seek the help of the patriarch.  But he reminded her that she was just a ruler under the sovereigns, and went to Peter.  Sophia's supporters became less and less.  The boyars, who had recently swore allegiance to her, somehow imperceptibly left the princess.  And the archers set Peter, who was going to Moscow, a penitential meeting.  As a sign of humility, they laid their heads on the block at the road. </p><h2>  Conclusion in the monastery, last hope </h2><p>  At the end of September 1689, 32-year-old Sophia was imprisoned by order of Peter in the Novodevichy Convent.  However, in 1698, she had hope.  Then Peter went to Europe, and the archery regiments, which were housed in a distance from the capital, moved to Moscow.  They intended to return Sophia to the throne, and the sovereign, who did not favor the archers, to "lime" if he returned from abroad. </p><h2>  The execution of archers, the fate of Sophia </h2><p>  But the rebellion was crushed.  Descendants for a long time remembered the mass execution of archers.  And Peter, who had not seen his sister for 9 years, came to her for the last explanation in the Novodevichy Convent.  The princess's involvement in the Streltsy rebellion was proved.  The former ruler was tonsured shortly afterwards as a nun by order of Peter.  She was given the name Susanna.  She no longer had any hope for the throne.  Shortly before her death, she took the schema and returned her name.  On July 3, 1704, Princess Sophia died, whose biography was so atypical for her time. </p>
