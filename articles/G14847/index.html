On sale are models of the brands Samsung, Beco, Candy, Indesit, Ariston.  Korean company LG is also on this list. </p><p>  Each manufacturer has its own characteristics.  They consist not only in the color range and appearance, but also in the applied technologies, innovations. </p><p>  The lineup of LG washing machines is really impressive.  The article describes all the advantages, features of use, nuances, the most common devices, as well as their characteristics. </p><h2>  LG story </h2><p>  LG appeared in 1947.  Its production was deployed in South Korea.  At that time, the main company specialized in the creation of hygiene products.  It was then that plastic was first used to form containers.  In 1958, In Hoi founded a subsidiary brand called Gold Star.  He was creating radio.  Since that time, the production of equipment has begun actively.  A little later, the creation of plastic was discovered.  By 1969, the first washing machine in Korea was assembled.  In European countries, debut devices appeared much earlier.  The lineup of LG washing machines began to replenish quickly. </p><p>  By the 90s, the company was expanding sales points around the world.  Her equipment is collected not only in the producing country, but also in America, Britain, Thailand, Egypt and the Philippines.  Now there are a lot of branches of this company, and the main headquarters is located in Seoul. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pros of LG washing machines </h2><p>  In order for the LG range of washing machines to be compared with other brands, it is necessary to highlight certain advantages and features. </p><ul><li>  The most famous nuance is that the Korean manufacturer was the first to use direct drive technology.  Thanks to it, you can do without a transmission belt, which is why washing is carried out as quietly as possible. </li><li>  Due to the direct drive, the life of each device is about 10 years.  According to reviews, on average, LG washing machines have been operating for 8 years. </li><li>  The main technology that distinguishes these devices from others is the ‚Äú6 movements of care‚Äù.  Thanks to her, the machine has several rotation options. </li><li>  The assortment is extensive, so each consumer will be able to choose the right device for himself.  They differ in design: there are white, black, silver options.  The lineup of LG automatic washing machines is usually available in a classic light shade. </li><li>  If we talk about the price range, then both inexpensive (budget) equipment and one equipped with the latest technological "chips" will be excellent. </li><li>  Another feature of the machines from the Korean manufacturer is the process of processing things with the help of steam.  It is served either during the operation of one of the programs directly during washing, or after its completion (without water). </li></ul><p>  Based on the positive feedback from consumers, we can conclude that all models fully meet the requirements of an optimal price-quality ratio.  However, there are still devices that, due to factory defects or poor materials, have only served 4 years.  After this period I had to change the heater. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  LG E1096SD3 </h2><p>  The described model is a narrow automatic type machine that can wash up to 4 kg at a time.
