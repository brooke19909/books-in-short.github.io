    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  The term "social integration" in modern literature does not receive much attention.  The sources lack a clear <span>conceptual framework.</span>  However, some general characteristics of the category can be distinguished.  <span>Social integration is a</span> combination into a whole, joint coexistence of elements of the system, previously disparate, on the basis of their mutual complementarity and dependence.  Analyzing encyclopedic data, you can define the concept as: </p><ol><li>  The degree to which an individual feels belonging to a group or collective on the basis of shared beliefs, values, and norms. </li><li>  Combining elements and parts into one. </li><li>  The degree to which the functions of individual institutions and subsystems become complementary, rather than contradictory. </li><li>  The presence of special institutions that support the coordinated activities of other subsystems. </li></ol><h2>  O. Comte, <span>G. Spencer,</span> E. Durkheim </h2><p>  Within the framework of positivist sociology, the <span>principles of a functional approach</span> to integration were first updated.  According to Comte, cooperation, which is based on the division of labor, ensures the maintenance of harmony and the establishment of "universal" consent.  Spencer distinguished two states.  He said that there is differentiation and integration.  According to Durkheim, social development was considered in the framework of two structures: with mechanical and organic solidarity.  By the latter, the scientist understood the cohesion of the team, the consensus established in it.  Solidarity is conditioned or explained by differentiation.  Durkheim understood cohesion as a condition of stability and collective survival.  He saw integration as the main function of public institutions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Suicide phenomenon </h2><p>  Studying suicide, Durkheim searched for factors that protected the individual from isolation.  According to the results of research, he revealed that the number of suicides is directly proportional to the level of integration of those groups into which a person belongs.  The scientist‚Äôs position is based on the idea that the behavior of people aimed at realizing collective interests forms the basis for cohesion.  The key factors on the basis of which <span>social integration</span> takes place <span>are</span> , according to Durkheim, political activity and moral education.  A close position was occupied by Simmel.  He agrees with Durkheim in the sense that he also discovered in the institutions and structures of capitalism the functional equivalents of the simplest links of custom.  They must maintain the unity of the traditional collective.  Simmel also considers <span>socio-economic integration</span> .  He points out that the division of labor and operations in the economic sphere contribute to building trust in human relations.  Accordingly, this provides a more successful integration. </p><h2>  T. Parsons </h2><p>  He believed that <span>social adaptation and integration</span> are phenomena that have a close relationship.  Parsons argued that the establishment and maintenance of relationships and interactions is one of the functional conditions for equilibrium in a team along with achieving goals and maintaining values.  For the researcher, <span>social adaptation and integration</span> provide the solidarity of individuals, the necessary degree of their loyalty to each other and to the structure as a whole.  The desire to unite people is considered a fundamental property, a functional imperative of the societal team.  He, acting as the core of society, provides different orders and degrees of internal integration.  Such an order, on the one hand, requires a certain and clear solidarity in the sequence of the normative model, and on the other hand, of societal "coordination" and "harmony".  Thus, the <span>integration of social activities</span> is compensatory in nature.  It helps to restore equilibrium after past disturbances and guarantees reproduction and continuity of collective existence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Internationalization </h2><p>  She, according to Parson, is the basis for <span>social integration.</span>  <span>Society</span> forms certain collective values.  They are ‚Äúabsorbed‚Äù by the individual born in him, in the framework of interaction with other people.  Thus, <span>integration is a socio-communicative</span> phenomenon.  Following universally valid standards becomes an element of the motivational structure of a person, his need.  This phenomenon is clearly described by J. G. Mead.  According to his ideas, the individual must enter into his personal consciousness a social process in the form of adopting an attitude that is valid for other people in relation to him and to each other.  Then his behavior is directed towards collective activity.  From this it follows that the formation and existence of the personality is realized in the course of the interaction of the subject with members of a particular social group, communication, and joint affairs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="social development integration" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1638475.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <h2>  Interaction specifics </h2><p>  This phenomenon as a whole is presented in the form of a certain system.  It has a close functional relationship between the centers of relations.  The behavior or condition of one immediately reflects on the other.  Changes of one individual, which is currently dominant, determine (often hidden) adjustments in the activity of the counterparty.  It follows from this that unity, <span>high integration of a social group are</span> possible in the formation between the subjects of functional relationships - interaction relationships. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Opinion of C. Mills </h2><p>  This American researcher studied the ordinal (structural) <span>problems of social integration</span> .  During the analysis, he came to an important conclusion.  The solidarity of structures focuses on combining the motivations of activists.  In an interpersonal way there is a mutual penetration of the actions of individuals under the influence of ethical standards.  The result is <span>socio-cultural integration</span> . </p><h2>  The unity of the individual and behavior </h2><p>  This question was considered by M. Weber.  He believed that the individual acts as a "cell" of sociology and history, "the simplest unity", not subject to further splitting and decomposition.  I. Kh. Cooley analyzed the phenomenon through the initial integrity of public consciousness and the relationship of society and man.  As the researcher noted, the unity of consciousness does not lie in similarities, but in the mutual influence, organization, and causal relationship of the components. </p><h2>  The properties </h2><p>  <span>Social integration</span> , thus, acts as a characteristic of the degree of coincidence of goals, values, interests of diverse associations and individuals.  Close concepts in different aspects are harmony, solidarity, solidarity, partnership.  As a natural variant of its absolutization, syncretism is considered.  It assumes the value of the individual, not so much in itself, but on the basis of his belonging to a particular unity, organization, and association.  The subject is considered as a component of the whole.  And its value is determined by the contribution that it makes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="social and cultural integration" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1638477.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Legal factor </h2><p>  He acts as another prerequisite for the integration of the individual in society.  The concepts of jurisprudence were used in their writings by G. Spencer, M. Weber, T. Parsons, G. Gurvich.  All opinions of scientists agree in essence.  They believe that law is a certain combination of restrictions and measures of freedom.  Through fixed norms of behavior, it acts as the basis for the self-reproduction of relations between individuals. </p><h2>  The concept of J. Habermas </h2><p>  In discussions about the life structure and the world within the framework of conceptual strategies, the scientist states that the fundamental issue of the theory is the task of satisfactorily combining the two directions indicated by the concepts of "life world" and "structure".  According to Habermas, the first is "social integration."  As part of the strategies, another important factor is described.  It is communication.  The research approach focuses on several elements.  First of all, this is the life world.  In addition, it analyzes the nature of the integration of the system of actions by means of regulatory consensus established or achieved through communication.  Theorists, starting from the latter, identify the union of individuals with the world of life. </p><h2>  Thoughts of E. Giddens </h2><p>  These scientists considered the <span>integration of the social system</span> not as a synonym for consensus or cohesion, but as interaction.  A scientist makes a differentiation between concepts.  In particular, he shares systemic and social integration.  The latter is the interaction of collectives, which form the basis of the association of individuals as a whole.  <span>Social integration</span> involves the relationship between the subjects of activity.  Giddens defines it as structural on a personal level.  <span>Social integration</span> , in his opinion, involves the temporary and spatial presence of interacting agents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="problems of social integration" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1638478.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Research N. N. Fedotova </h2><p>  She believes that any definition of social integration will not be universal.  Fedotov explains his position by the fact that they take into account only a few components that function in the world.  <span>Social integration</span> , according to the scientist, is a complex of phenomena, due to which there is a connection of heterogeneous interacting links into a whole.  It acts as a form of maintaining a certain balance and stability in associations of individuals.  In analyzing Fedotov, he identifies two key approaches.  The first is related to the interpretation of integration in accordance with common values, the second - on the basis of interdependence in a division of labor. </p><h2>  The point of view of V. D. Zaitsev </h2><p>  According to the scientist, the consideration of the unity of goals, beliefs, values, views of individuals as one of the key reasons for their integration should be considered insufficiently legitimate.  Zaitsev explains his position as follows.  Each person has his own system of preferences, values, views, and integration involves mainly joint activity on the basis of interpersonal interaction.  It is her, Zaitsev believes, that should be considered as a defining feature. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  <span>The space of social</span> integration, thus, contributes to the formation of a communicative model of man.  It provides an opportunity to consciously and unconsciously comprehend the necessary, appropriate and productive practices of interaction with the help of previously mastered roles.  As a result, the individual forms the behavior expected by the team, due to the status of the subject - his position related to specific rights, obligations and norms.  Social integration as a whole comes down to: </p><ol><li>  To unite people on the basis of common values ‚Äã‚Äãand mutual dependence. </li><li>  The formation of practices of interaction and interpersonal relationships, mutual adaptation between groups and individuals. </li></ol><p>  Above, many concepts are considered.  In practice, there is no single theory with which to identify the universal foundations of the phenomenon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="social educational integration" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1638479.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Social, educational integration </h2><p>  The foundations of the sciences studied in antiquity took the form of holistic knowledge.  Comenius believed that everything that is in interconnection should be taught in the same form.  The issue of integration in education arises in situations when it is necessary to introduce children with developmental disabilities to school.  It is worth saying that such cases cannot be called massive.  As a rule, we are talking about interaction with a specific child and parents, to one degree or another - with an educational institution, a kindergarten.  <span>Integration in social work</span> with children with disabilities is largely determined by the level of organization of psychological and pedagogical support. </p><h2>  Relevance of the issue </h2><p>  Currently, there is a tendency to integrate different disciplines.  This is due to an increase in the volume of factual material of sciences, an understanding of the complexity of the studied subjects, laws, phenomena, theories.  All this cannot but affect pedagogical practice.  This is confirmed by the expansion of the number of disciplines studied in educational institutions of a new type.  The consequence of the processes is increased attention to intersubject interactions within the framework of organizational and methodological support.  In the curricula of comprehensive schools, various integrative disciplines are introduced (OBZH, social studies, etc.).  Taking into account the rather extensive experience that has been formed in the pedagogical field, we can talk about the prevailing approach related to the study and use of techniques in education and training to increase their effectiveness. </p><h2>  Social and Economic Integration </h2><p>  It is considered the highest stage of the division of labor at the international level.  Economic integration is associated with the formation of stable and deep interconnections of associations of states.  This phenomenon is based on the implementation of coordinated policies by different countries.  In the course of such integration, there is a fusion of the processes of reproduction, scientific cooperation, and the creation of close trade and economic ties are intensified.  As a result, zones of preferences, free trade, customs unions, and common markets arise.  This leads to the formation of an economic union and full integration. </p><h2>  Questions of the present </h2><p>  Currently, the subject of research is socio-cultural integration.  In rapidly changing modern conditions, young people are forced to adjust their behavior to the surrounding circumstances.  Recently, this problem has been discussed in the pedagogical sphere.  Modern realities force us to rethink the concepts that have been in force for a long time, to search for new resources and opportunities in technologies and practice.  This issue is exacerbated during periods of crisis.  In such situations, socio-cultural integration becomes the most important condition for the quality of life, a means of ensuring the continuity of an individual biography, preservation of mental and personal health in a deformed society. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="integration of social activities" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1638480.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Determining factors </h2><p>  The severity and scale of the problem of sociocultural integration are determined by the content of reforms, the increasing institutional alienation of people, the depersonalization of an individual in the framework of professional relations.  Of no less importance is the non-optimal functioning of state and civil institutions.  The non-integration of people, provoked by the content and scale of transformations in the usual psychological, cultural, social, professional environment, begins to acquire an all-embracing character.  As a result, established ties are disrupted.  In particular, the professional-corporate, ethnocultural, and spiritual community is lost.  The marginalization of large associations of the population, including young people, difficulties in self-realization and self-identification are accompanied by increased personal dissatisfaction in key areas of life, increased tension. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of existing government programs </h2><p>  The activities that are carried out within the framework of state policy do not completely eliminate the problems that have arisen.  Young people need systematic measures.  Considering the complex of measures aimed at creating conditions for the intellectual, creative, professional, cultural self-realization of the individual, it is worth noting the lack of developed projects.  This, in turn, actualizes the issue of planning the functioning of the relevant institutions based not only on the situational approach.  It is also necessary to introduce systemic methods into practice.  The search for additional reserves cannot be limited to the range of professional, leisure and other organizations.  The priorities and functions of all institutions, the organization of the entire model of their interaction should be reviewed. </p><h2>  Individualization </h2><p>  It is carried out through joint activities.  The result of individualization is a person‚Äôs awareness of his creative, intellectual, physical, moral differences from other people.  As a result, a personality is formed - an infinite, unique being.  However, in reality, a person is always within.  It is limited by conditions, <span>sociocultural environment,</span> resources (temporary, biological, etc.). </p><h2>  Moral aspect </h2><p>  One of the most important factors is the totality of the individual's values.  It is at the same time the core of society, reflects the spiritual quintessence of the interests and needs of individuals and their groups.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Depending on the functions, values ‚Äã‚Äãcan be unifying or differentiating. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this case, the same category can implement different tasks in certain conditions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Values ‚Äã‚Äãare one of the key incentives for </font></font><span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">social activity. </font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They contribute to the unification of individuals, ensure their inclusion in the team, helping to make an acceptable choice of behavior in significant cases. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The more universal the value, the higher will be the integrating function of social actions stimulated by it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this regard, ensuring the moral unity of the team should be considered as the most important direction of state policy.</font></font></p>
