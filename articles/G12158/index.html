According to the text of the provisions, all information must be provided on the basis of reliable information, quantified and documented. </p><p>  There are special methods for determining the <span>customs value of goods</span> that can be used by the declarant.  Moreover, the correct pricing is controlled by the relevant authorities involved in cargo clearance. </p><p>  When determining the value of a customs nature, one of the main documents is considered a <span>foreign trade contract.</span>  This is due to the fact that the currency financial conditions in it indicate the transaction price, the currency of the agreement and the basic conditions in accordance with which the delivery is carried out. </p><p>  Methods for determining the customs value: </p><ol><li><p>  Subtraction of the price. </p></li><li><p>  In accordance with the value of the transaction regarding imported products. </p></li><li><p>  Addition of price. </p></li><li><p>  In accordance with the cost with identical products. </p></li><li><p>  Reserve way. </p></li><li><p>  At the cost of the transaction with homogeneous products. </p></li></ol><p>  The main method is considered at the transaction price relative to imported products.  If it is impossible to use this technique, others apply in the prescribed manner.  Methods for determining customs value by subtraction and addition may be used in any order. </p><p>  1. The method at the transaction price relative to imported products.  The cost of the delivered products is set as the transaction price paid actually or subject to deduction for the moved products at the time of border crossing.  At the same time, the transaction price includes additional costs (if they were not previously included).  These costs are listed in the Tariff Act and in the relevant government decree. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. Acceptance of an estimate of the transaction value with respect to identical products  The basis is the transaction price of goods that are the same with the goods being valued in all respects.  Common features, including, should include market reputation and quality, physical properties, manufacturer, country of origin.  At the same time, the transaction value of relatively identical products can be taken as a basis if the products are sold for the purpose of import into the country, imported at the same time with the goods being valued (or not earlier than three months before the import of products), brought to approximately the same conditions and about the same amount.  If <span>identical goods were</span> moved on different conditions and in a different quantity, then the declarant should make an adjustment in accordance with the differences and confirm the validity of the changes with documents. </p><p>  3. The valuation method in accordance with a transaction with homogeneous products provides that the basis is the value of the transaction with products that, while not being identical in all respects, have similar characteristics and include similar components.  These features allow the goods to perform the same functions and thus imply commercial interchangeability. </p><p>  4. Methods for determining customs value by subtraction and addition. </p><p>  Subtraction based on deduction is applied if the evaluated product (homogeneous or identical) will be sold in the country without changing its initial condition. </p><p>  When using the addition method, the sum of the cost of costs and material, the total costs that are inherent for the sale from the state of import of goods of the same type, are taken as the basis. </p><p>  5. If the above methods for determining customs value do not allow the evaluation of products, the declarant has the right to use the reserve method.  In this case, world practice is taken as a basis. </p>
