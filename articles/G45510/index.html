    <p>  One of the most vivid impressions will remain after visiting the local medieval market.  The focus of retailers is the national Arab neighborhoods in the city center, including the X century fortress with a large mosque.  Locals call this area medina, which in Arabic means "city".  A significant portion of the products on offer are souvenirs, local fruits, a variety of spices and <span>handicrafts.</span>  It should be remembered that buyers in the markets are required to bargain with sellers.  The process of buying a product is a kind of game, or even a ritual.  In some cases, you can bring down the price several times. </p><h2>  Real relaxation </h2><p>  Relaxing in the Sun Holiday Beach Club 2 * Hammamet, you should definitely use the services of thalassotherapy salons.  The resort town has many similar centers.  The most famous of them have pool complexes and several dozen massage rooms.  Water, algae and healing mud for procedures are delivered from the depths of the sea.  Massage, body wraps and hammam contribute to the restoration of psychological calm and immunity. </p><h2>  Secret rules of conduct </h2><p>  Although the population of the country is overwhelmingly Islamic, there are no such stringencies as in the United Arab Emirates.  Rest on the beaches of "topless" - in the order of things.  In tourist areas you can dress easily and freely.  However, when visiting ancient Muslim quarters, frank clothing should be avoided. </p><p>  Security is monitored almost everywhere.  Even at night on the beach, the police will ask if everything is in order and wish you a pleasant stay. </p><p>  Strangers in cafes and bars should not be offered to smoke a cigarette or treat them to alcohol, all the more it is better to refrain from drinking strong drinks together. </p><p>  It is considered bad form to look closely at Muslim women, to look in the face of a person eating food.  Arabs do not cut bread, but break it off with their hands; fatty foods are not washed down with water.  Also in Tunisia, it is not customary to eat while standing or on the go and be amazed at the prayers on the street. </p><p>  During Muslim fasting, Tunisians do not smoke or eat food during daylight hours.  Respecting the feelings of believers, during this period it is better not to smoke or eat on the streets.
