By the way, some settings must be deleted manually.  For example, data in browsers.  This should be remembered by every owner of the iPhone.  Especially if the smartphone is planned to be sold. </p><h2>  Delete with password </h2><p>  Initially, it is important to understand which method most users use.  How to reset all settings on the iPhone?  The first and most common tip is to use the standard features of the gadget.

Be sure to wait until the mobile device is fully loaded.  If the phone does not turn on, you can forget about resetting the settings using this method. </li><li>  Go to the "Settings" - "General" menu. </li><li>  Click on the "Reset" item. </li><li>  Select "Reset settings and content" from the menu that appears.

If not, it is proposed to act differently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How can I reset the settings on iPhone 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1643727.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About Hard Reset </h2><p>  Any modern smartphone has the ability to force reboot and reset to factory settings.  Usually this process is called Hard Reset.  Some believe that this is the ideal option for resetting the iPhone. </p><p>  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  The thing is that the "Hard Reset" of such gadgets is just a way to restart the phone.  And nothing more.  The method does not allow you to quickly and easily reset the settings.  However, it is important to know how to make the device work again if necessary.  For example, if during the use of one of the methods of resetting the parameters listed above a hang-up occurs. </p><p>  Hard Reset on the "iPhone" is carried out in the following way: </p><ol><li>  Simultaneously press and hold the Home button and the Sleep mode button. </li><li>  Release the specified combination after the <span>Apple logo</span> appears <span>.</span> </li><li>  Wait for the device to reboot. </li></ol><p>  As a rule, this option helps to restart the phone, but it does not reset the settings.  Other smartphones using Hard Reset are invited to "roll back" the operating system.  Each user must remember this feature.  Accordingly, Hard Reset will not help answer the question of how to reset all settings on the iPhone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reset iPhone to factory settings without password" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1643722.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Safari Browser </h2><p>  The following tip applies only to browsers.  Most often, the corresponding program refers to Safari.  The thing is that before selling the phone it is recommended to get rid of the data and settings in the browser. </p><p>  It is proposed to do this using the standard capabilities of a mobile device.  How can I reset my iPhone without a password for the browser? </p><p>  To do this, follow the instructions: </p><ol><li>  Turn on and wait until the iPhone / iPad is fully loaded. </li><li>  Go to the "Settings" - "Safari" section. </li><li>  Select the necessary functions there.  For example, "Clear History" or "Add-ons" - "Site Data" - "Delete All". </li><li>  Wait for the operation to complete. </li></ol><p>  In fact, everything is not as difficult as it seems.  Similarly, it is recommended that you work with any browser on your smartphone.  Only when resetting Safari data will the basic settings remain intact. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to reset iPhone settings before selling" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1643726.jpg" width="600"></div>
