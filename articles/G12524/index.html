    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Caravel - a hotel of the 2nd category, consists of only one building with six floors.  The construction was completed in 1980, so the building can not be called new, but since it is being repaired from time to time, it looks quite decent.  The latest hotel updates took place in 2007 and 2013. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel has a very favorable location - in a quiet park area, with which the resort town of the island of Cyprus (Limassol) is so famous.  Caravel 2 * is only 4 km from the center, which is very, very convenient.  If necessary, you can easily go about your business using local transport - by bus or taxi.  It takes about an hour to get to the nearest airport, of course, you can overcome this path with your car much faster.  Also nearby are water parks with a variety of attractions, they can be reached on foot in just a couple of minutes.  And across the road, 200 meters from the hotel, the sea splashes, which offers a beautiful view from the windows of the hotel. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2>

    <p>  In the evening, you can comfortably sit in your room or on the balcony with a book in hand, since the selection of literature in the hotel library is quite wide.  Prefer noisy parties - drop by the night club.  If you did not manage to exchange money for the local currency, you can contact the reception, they will certainly help you do it.  It is possible to store valuables in a safe, but you will have to pay for such a service. </p><p>  If you come to resolve business issues, the helpful staff will provide you with a separate meeting room, which is great for holding mass events. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Many travelers dream of swimming in the sea when they come to Cyprus.  Caravel 2 * provides you with this opportunity, and for free.  There is a good beach area and clean natural sand, alternating with pebbles.  The entrance to the sea is made shallow, which is very convenient for those who do not like to swim in depth. </p><p>  There are showers, changing cabins, sun loungers and umbrellas around the beach, which you can use for a fee.  Outdoor enthusiasts can go fishing, take diving lessons, play beach volleyball or enjoy the local scenery while taking pleasure boats, water skiing or motorbikes. </p>

    <h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  If you are going on vacation with your children, don‚Äôt worry: the hotel will make sure that you and your children enjoy a comfortable stay and a fun holiday.  For a baby up to two years old, an extra cot will be brought to the room, and a high chair will be issued in the restaurant. </p><p>  For fun, the kids here are also provided for.  You can take the kid on the playground in the shade of the garden trees or take him to a dip in a shallow pool, equipped specifically for small guests.  In Caravel 2 * for an additional fee, you can use the services of a qualified nanny who will look after your child while you relax. </p><h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  The issue price on average varies from 34,000 to 57,000 rubles.  The cost depends on the type of room chosen, the number of people calling and the length of stay.  As in many hotels, the season plays a big role here, in summer accommodation will cost more. </p><p>  Sometimes a hotel makes special offers to its customers.  For example, free check-in of one child from 2 to 11 years old in a room for adults for the whole season or discounts on one child and one adult in one room. </p><h2>  Caravel 2 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists note that this hotel is good for its category, is clean and has good service.  This is just what vacationers with low demands need.  The hotel has a good location: in a quiet street, close to the sea, close to discos, shops and local attractions, which can be reached on foot in 15 minutes.  In the evenings, the real nightlife boils in the nearby bars and taverns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="caravel 2" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/473518.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to the assurances of experienced tourists, rooms are cleaned every day, and bed linen is changed every 3 days, as promised.  The furniture is not broken, the plumbing is new (which happens by no means in all hotels of this category), it is functioning properly.  True, in some rooms the air conditioner works round-the-clock in several modes, and in others - only during the day, without the ability to change the mode, which, of course, is not pleasant to guests.  In addition, not all rooms have a TV.  But, as some vacationers note, its absence is compensated by free Wi-Fi. </p><p>  The design of the rooms in the Caravel 2 * hotel, the photos of which you see in this article, is not satisfactory.  Of course, this is not a luxury, but the category of the hotel is not the highest.  Everything is simple, but quite comfortable and clean.  A huge window through the wall easily closes from the scorching sunshine with blackout curtains, a wonderful view of the mountains and sea opens from the balconies.  Many note the possibility of choosing a beach area: despite the fact that the hotel offers its own beach, you can go to sunbathe on any other. </p><p>  24 hour service deserves all praise.  They welcome everyone, even those who arrived late at night.  In any case, guests will be fed dinner and quickly accommodated, which is very important after a long journey. </p><p>  Sometimes there is a staff who is fluent in Russian, some maids are happy to tell you where to go to relax and where you can eat well and cheaply.  However, guests do not complain about food at the hotel.  They feed well here: they offer tea, juice, eggs, cheese, ham for breakfast (some, however, are unhappy that there are not enough dairy products on the menu).  Dinner is also always delicious and varied, and the bar is able to prepare cold <span>Frappe coffee.</span>  After 7 pm, customers receive 50% discount on cocktails and beer. </p><p>  Vacationers note that the pool at the hotel is not as large as we would like, but this shortcoming is easily covered by a small number of people who want to swim.  Sunbeds are always free.  Around is quiet, calm. </p>
