It is here that the Sokolova Deserts boarding house is located, which residents of the capital region love to visit.  This is a great place for families. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding house falcon deserts stupino" class="if uuid-2573731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/2573731.jpg"></div><h2>  A little about the boarding house </h2><p>  Pension "Sokolova Deserts" is located in an amazingly picturesque place, with which many legends are associated.  It is generally accepted among the people that this is a blessed place in which thoughts ascend to God.  Perhaps this is why in the middle of a secluded pine forest, Fedor Sokol decided to settle, to which other hermits later joined.  Here they prayed for the salvation of the Russian land and asked the Almighty to cleanse human souls from evil thoughts.  It is believed that after these frantic prayers, a healing spring that gave women beauty and power to men scored from the earth. </p><p>  The Sokolova Deserts boarding house was opened in 1953.  Part of the buildings was reserved for summer cottages of employees of large industrial enterprises Stupino.  In 1996, the Ministry of Health praised the quality of water at a local source, which gave new life to the boarding house.  People who longed for physical healing and spiritual purification rushed here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.8440823" data-lng="38.04772419999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/8/2/6/4826.png"></div><p>  In the city of Stupino, Moscow Region, on the territory of the village of the same name, the Sokolova Pustyn pension is located.
