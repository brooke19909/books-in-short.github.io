    <p>  Depending on the position, there can be incomes ranging from 12 to 15 rubles, which is compared with working professions.  The more responsibilities, the higher the salary.  The average income of civil servants of the Federal Tax Service, for example, the inspector, is 16,000 rubles, the senior inspector is 23,000 rubles, and the chief inspector is 25,000 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Earnings in the cities </h2><p>  To find out how much they receive in the Federal Tax Service of Russia, information on the income of civil servants can be found on the basis of information from the statistical service.  The following average salary levels apply in cities: </p><ul><li>  26 thousand rubles - Yekaterinburg, </li><li>  25 - Ryazan; </li><li>  21 - Khabarovsk; </li><li>  19 - Kirov; </li><li>  15 - Kazan. </li></ul><p>  The employees of the Far East, the Urals and other settlements have the highest income.  Revenues of civil servants of the Federal Tax Service in the Tambov region are in the range of 20,000 rubles.  Salary depends on the load of the department in which the employee is employed.  Additional funds are paid to workers in the Far North and the Far East. </p><h2>  Why are salaries low? </h2><p>  Small salaries of service tax officers are due to the fact that employees were not included in the state plan for increasing the income of civil servants.  This document has been in force since 2012 and has been extended to many employees in this field.  Therefore, the salary of tax officials today may not differ from that accrued several years ago. </p>

    <p>  Why this is observed remains a mystery to everyone.  After all, with low income, unscrupulous employees commit corruption.  Moreover, in the tax sphere there are many abuses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Why are professions popular? </h2><p>  Why, even with low wages, work in the tax service continues to be in demand.  This phenomenon has several reasons, especially since each applicant can have his own factors.  Some consider the profession prestigious, while others dream of moving forward in a career where they earn high incomes. </p><h2>  Salary Growth Prospect </h2><p>  It is difficult to determine whether the salaries of tax officials will increase.  This is possible due to an increase in salary or rate.  Perhaps there will be a phased increase in revenue. </p>

    <p>  If there is no work experience, then there will be no high salary right away.  The salary of a young specialist is 10 to 20 thousand rubles, depending on the region.  Over time, the income level may be higher, because the length of service, bonuses, and allowances are taken into account. </p><p>  The advantage of working in the tax office is that you can start a career in it for graduates of economic and legal educational institutions.  Employees are provided with social protection: paid sick leave, leave, payment of allowances.  Official salary allows you to apply for loans and loans. </p><h2>  Concept of declaration </h2><p>  The level of salaries is confirmed using the declaration of income of civil servants of the Federal Tax Service of Russia.  It must be submitted necessarily, otherwise it is considered a violation of the law.  <span>Information about the income of</span> civil servants of the Federal Tax Service is confirmed by documents.  For this, a 2-NDFL certificate is required. </p>

    <p>  The declaration includes 2 sheets and appendices.  The document consists of the following information: </p><ul><li>  on 1 sheet indicate personal data; </li><li>  on sheet 2 information about the amount of profit and tax is indicated; </li><li>  Appendix A contains income from which 13% tax is calculated; </li><li>  B: to be filled in to account for profits issued in foreign currency; </li><li>  B: filled out by entrepreneurs and individuals; </li><li>  D: fill in then, if there are tax deductions or profit amounts that are not taxable; </li><li>  D: includes income from copyright and civil law contracts; </li><li>  E: consists of standard, social tax deductions; </li><li>  G: includes monthly calculations; </li><li>  H: consists of a deduction for the construction and purchase of housing; </li><li>  And: filled out by persons from whose income tax of 35% is calculated; </li><li>  K: includes information on the receipt of dividends. </li></ul><h2>  Filling out a declaration </h2><p>  Information in the document can be entered manually or using a computer.  It is most convenient to use special programs in which you only need to enter data, and the calculation is performed independently.  This allows you to avoid errors when filling.  A blank or printed form can be used to create a declaration. </p><p>  Strikethroughs and corrections, stapling of sheets with a stapler should not be allowed.  The pen can be black or blue.  At the top of the sheet is the name, taxpayer identification number, and below - the signature.  Only those fields are required that are required, while others remain empty. </p><p>  The declaration is filed by civil servants because of the active <span>fight against corruption.</span>  Therefore, tax inspectors provide annual income reports.  In addition, we need information on property, transport, bank accounts, property obligations. </p><h2>  Late submission of declaration </h2><p>  The documentation must be delivered on time, otherwise responsibility is provided for this.  Since 2013, the amended law has been in force, according to which fines are imposed not only on individuals, but also on tax and non-tax agents.  Responsibility comes from the next day, which was the last for delivery. </p>

    <p>  If an individual submits a declaration at the wrong time, then he pays a fine.  Its size is 5% of the tax amount.  The fine cannot be more than 30%, and at least 1 thousand rubles.  It is paid only after a court decision. </p><h2>  Electronic declaration </h2><p>  The official tax site contains a lot of useful information.  There is also a form for filling out a declaration.  In the column "Software" you need to find the option of reporting that suits personal status. </p><p>  <span>A tax return</span> is an important form of reporting.  It is necessary to follow the rules for its delivery.  If for some reason it is not possible to provide the document on your own on time, an authorized person can do this.  With the return of the declaration, the income will be confirmed. </p>
