Of course, immediately understanding the intricacies of loops is quite difficult, you can even lose interest in this needlework.  To prevent this from happening, it is better to start with simple knitting techniques and only then move on to patterns of aran or lace. </p><p>  The basics of knitting begin with the front and the wrong side.  After that, you can try knitting openwork patterns according to simple patterns.  By learning to understand symbols and read patterns, you can create amazingly beautiful knitwear. </p><h2>  Openwork Knitting Technique </h2><p>  Openwork consists of a combination of a basic front or wrong side and yarn, from which holes are obtained.  Combining these two simple techniques, you can create a huge number of different patterns. </p><p>  There are several rules, compliance with which will help to understand and knit both a complex and a very simple openwork pattern with knitting needles according to the pattern: </p><ul><li>  It is very important to monitor the constant number of loops in the work.  The number of loops must not exceed the number of loops. </li><li>  It is necessary to learn how to reduce loops with different slopes.  To make the loop seem to be inclined to the right, you need to insert the spoke into two loops at once and stretch the working thread through them.  The inclination to the left fits differently: remove one loop as the front one, knit the next one, then stretch the removed loop through it </li><li>  Before you begin work on an openwork product, you need to tie a control sample.  The density of knitting can be different, and such an experience will help to choose the right number of knitting needles. </li></ul><h2>  Openwork mesh </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Type and pattern of the classic mesh pattern" class="if uuid-3117268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3117268.jpg"></div><p>  "Grid" is considered the simplest openwork pattern for beginners.  Using knitting needles to perform it is quite simple.  The pattern consists of alternating knit and double crochets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To knit a classic "mesh" you need to dial an odd number of loops.  Do not forget about the hem, which will not be involved in the pattern, but will give the edges of the sample a smooth appearance. </p><p>  After a set of loops, knit the first row on the wrong side.  This is necessary to get a neat bottom edge of the sample. </p><p>  <em>Row 1.</em> Remove the first edge loop without knitting.  Then 2 loops together front, one yarn.  Repeat until the end of the row, finish the front and do not forget about the last edge loop. </p><p>  <em>Row 2 and all further back rows.</em>  Knit according to the pattern or description of the "mesh" pattern.  With knitting needles, most of all the yarn is made with purl loops. </p><p>  <em>Row 3.</em> The sequence of loops is changing.  Edge, 1 front, throw a loop, two loops together front.  Repeat the sequence ‚Äúyarn, two loops together‚Äù.  Finish with an edge loop. </p><p>  Just in case, count the number of loops so as not to spoil the sample. </p><p>  Next alternate the first four rows. </p><h2>  Variants of the "openwork mesh" pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork knitting pattern" class="if uuid-3119373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3119373.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the classic version of this beautiful pattern, more complex schemes and descriptions of the ‚Äúgrid‚Äù pattern were invented.  You can knit the product with a "round net" or "zigzag".  There is also an interesting version of the ‚Äúfishing net‚Äù pattern, when knitting which all the crochets are knitted like facial loops. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Experienced needlewomen advise trying to combine fine yarn, such as mohair and thick knitting needles, to achieve a delicate effect.  The use of such materials allows you to get a very delicate, weightless canvas. </p><p>  You can knit a product using only this simple openwork pattern with knitting needles.  But combinations of a grid with a front smooth surface or a pattern ‚Äúsmall rice‚Äù look very impressive.  No less interesting is the canvas made of vertical stripes of mesh and thin braids. </p><h2>  Vertical Mesh Pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="intheloopknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Examples of knitting openwork patterns" class="if uuid-3123208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/3123208.jpg"></div><p>  A beautiful effect can be achieved by alternating a transparent grid and denser vertical stripes.  For knitting a delicate scarf, lace socks or dresses for a little girl, a simple scheme of an openwork pattern is quite suitable.  You can knit such a product quickly enough. </p><p>  A young stylish girl may like a tunic for the beach, connected by such a pattern.  For the product, you will need to choose thin threads with a maximum content of cotton or linen.  Knitting needles are better to take a size larger, then a more delicate and openwork product will be obtained. </p><h2>  Leaves Pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.interweave.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leaves Pattern and Pattern" class="if uuid-3117667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3117667.jpg"></div><p>  Even a simple pattern with knitted imitation of leaves will require skill and patience from the needlewoman.  But dresses and blouses made with such a pattern will look very elegant. </p><p>  When working with patterns, it is important to carefully read the diagram and monitor the number of loops on the knitting needles.  For knitting according to the pattern and description of the pattern, "leaves" on the spokes gain an odd number of loops.  The above diagram shows both the front and back rows.  In this case, the front rows need to be knit from right to left, and the wrong rows, on the contrary, from left to right. </p><p>  The product will look beautifully like the entire canvas connected by such a pattern, and vertical inserts of more even patterns, for example, the front surface. </p><h2>  Stylized Leaves Pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="intheloopknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Examples of openwork pattern &quot;leaves&quot;" class="if uuid-3119385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3119385.jpg"></div><p>  A simple openwork pattern with knitting needles will be possible even for a beginner needlewoman.  It can be used to create a hat, scarf or cute baby blouse.  Using the scheme and description of the ‚Äúleaves‚Äù pattern, you can knit a beautiful children's plaid for a crib or a stylish stole with knitting needles. </p><h2>  Rhombuses and geometric patterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.newcrochetpatterns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern with openwork rhombuses." class="if uuid-3117280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3117280.jpg"></div><p>  Among the simple openwork patterns, not only mesh and ‚Äúleaves‚Äù are popular.  Knitting patterns such as lace diamonds, squares or alternating straight lines look very elegant. </p><p>  Products with even stripes of lace look very impressive.  The main feature of knitting is simplicity: after all, laconic patterns are well suited for thin blouses or a bodice of an elegant knitted dress.  With a simple combination of loops, you can quickly knit a light shawl or stole from a gentle mohair. </p><h2>  Loop patterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mamainastitch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loop pattern" class="if uuid-3119403" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3119403.jpg"></div><p>  Among the popular lace patterns, there is one that is ideal for creating youth models of clothing.  Knitting according to the scheme of a simple openwork pattern creates the effect of a bit sloppy, elongated loops.  For this pattern, a technique is used when the dialed loops are not knitted from the wrong side, but are discarded from the knitting needle. </p><p>  When performing this pattern, the yarn and the wrong loop are alternated in the front row.  When knitting the wrong side, the fabric is done with the front stitch, and the dialed loops are reset.  To maintain the shape of the product, between the rows of removed loops you need to knit a denser fabric. </p><p>  An interesting effect can be obtained if you knit this openwork pattern from two separate tangles of mohair.  Moreover, the wrong side of the surface to perform a double thread, and the single loop removed.  Sometimes you can choose yarn in different colors, which will further emphasize the unusual model. </p>
