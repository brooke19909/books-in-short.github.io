    <p>  The rooms are very nice looking and comfortable.  If something from the equipment breaks down or for some reason doesn‚Äôt work, the problem can be fixed right away by moving to another room.  They repair equipment on request very quickly, you just have to warn the reception staff. </p><p>  The condition of the rooms is relatively good, inside the furniture is at least already old, but brought into proper shape.  The sewerage system in the room is not very well established, since the water after washing takes a long time to leave.  There is no safe, which is a little upsetting.  In the bathroom there is a bathroom and a washbasin, and in the room there is a bench, a pair of nightstands, a wardrobe, a bed and a table.  There is no refrigerator in the rooms, there are few sockets for connecting equipment, if necessary, it is worth carrying a tee with you.  The location of the outlets is inconvenient: everything is high. </p><p>  Hot and cold water is served in the hotel Djerba Sun Club 3 * (Tunisia) uninterrupted, which pleases.  Drinking water can be obtained for free by going to a bar opposite the office building.  The hotel balconies offer wonderful views.  The negative side is poor protection against noise and extraneous sounds. </p><p>  The Hotel Sun Club 3 * (Djerba, Tunisia) is located in a clean and well-kept place.  There are a lot of shrubs, which gives an indescribable flavor to each number.  Garbage bins are located throughout the hotel, so there is absolutely no garbage in the vicinity. </p>

    <p>  All retail outlets and restaurants can be visited by going down to the ground floor.  Sometimes local merchants bring a variety of pastries to the hotel to pamper guests.  On the ground floor, they sell spices, jewelry, jewelry, toys and branded clothing.  The downside is that the prices here are very high, when compared with retail outlets in the vicinity. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Room service pleases with tact.  If desired, and for a small reward, figures are twisted from towels, and the bed can be showered with flower petals.  Towels at the hotel are old but clean.  Lingerie changes regularly. </p><p>  The staff treats guests very friendly if customers leave a small monetary gratitude.  The restaurant feeds vacationers with fruit, which can be sold chilled for a small fee. </p><h2>  Contingent </h2><p>  The public of the hotel is international, mainly Arabs predominate, in second place the French, followed by residents of England and Germany.  Travelers from Russia are also more than enough.  The audience here is very noisy, Arabs and French constantly shout and laugh, preventing others from sleeping soundly. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  There are practically no problems with access to the World Wide Web.  You can access the Internet both in the hotel lobby and in each room.

    <p>  The food on site is just fine.  Meals are issued on special cards, which are issued to the manager on the first visit to the restaurant, assigning a separate waiter to the client.  Breakfast is prepared and selected by guests on their own, while for lunch and dinner, refreshments and delicious natural ice cream with fruit additives are served. </p><p>  The restaurant is huge, as guests from the entire hotel go there to eat.  The situation is quite clean, but there is always something to complain about.  Alcohol and cocktails practically do not dilute, which pleases.  The menu has all kinds of vegetable and hearty salads, coffee, hot chocolate and many main dishes of fish, meat and seafood.  From fruits, there are always melons, watermelons and bananas. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Despite the impressive size, the beach is often dirty, there is a lot of garbage and cigarette butts, and all the beds are busy and they can hear the cries of crazy foreign and Russian children.  Jellyfish sting very often, but in the bar they give out something cold in case of burns. </p><p>  As for the wellness bathing procedures, they few people delighted.  Of course, for the first time this seems like a real paradise, but experienced tourists advise you to pass by, as everything is much poorer than described by travel agencies. </p><h2>  Pools </h2>
