In fact, this is a depositary deposit to broker accounts, income from which can be received in the form of tax deductions, as well as in the form of interest due to the competent money management.  The profitability of such deposits can reach twenty percent per year.  The aim of the program is to increase the financial literacy of the population.  Thus, customers are drawn to the stock market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.golestanchto.ir" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="isis sberbank" class="if uuid-2960260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960260.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews about IIS of Sberbank will be presented at the end of the article. </p><h2>  What is an IIS and what are the rules for depositing funds? </h2><p>  To begin with, it‚Äôs worth understanding the concept itself.  Investment accounts are special brokerage elements that can be opened by individuals in order to invest money in stock markets.  It is worth highlighting seven important features of the IIS of Sberbank: </p><ul><li>  The period for which such a service is opened is three years. </li><li>  Minimum replenishment amounts are not limited.  And the maximum can not exceed four hundred thousand rubles. </li><li>  For individual investment accounts, special taxation is provided.  According to one of the schemes (for contributions), each year you can receive a thirteen percent tax deduction for the amount of funds contributed.  The maximum value for the tax deduction is four hundred thousand per year.  That is, in the event that within one year a person has contributed this amount, then during the filing of a tax return for deduction it will be possible to return fifty-two thousand rubles.  And so every year for three years.  That is, if you replenish four hundred thousand, in three years you can return one hundred fifty six from the state.  The legislation provides for a second scheme (for income), exempting the client from paying tax on such an account for three years.  This is beneficial if the client, for example, immediately invested all the money. </li><li>  IIS of Sberbank can be closed before the expiration of a three-year period, but then any benefits provided by law will not apply. </li><li>  You can have only one account per person.  Then the tax will give benefits on one of its product. </li><li>  The service is opened exclusively at brokerage and management institutions.  Banks with other financial institutions do not have the right to open this type of account. </li><li>  Previously purchased shares with bonds from another brokerage financial instrument cannot be transferred to individual investment accounts. </li></ul><p>  Reviews about IIS of Sberbank are mostly positive.  Next, we provide information on the conditions for opening such a financial instrument that are currently being put forward. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="bizfluent.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank IIs customer reviews" class="if uuid-2960257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960257.jpg"></div><h2>  Conditions for opening </h2><p>  The conditions are usually as follows: </p><ul><li>  Individual investment accounts can only be opened by individuals. </li><li>  IIS in Sberbank is opened only by Russian citizens. </li><li>  Each individual has the right to receive only one investment account. </li><li>  Only monetary funds are contributed to the IIS. </li><li>  Such an account is replenished, partial withdrawal of money is not provided. </li><li>  The maximum investment amount is four hundred thousand rubles per year, which makes the proposed instrument unattractive for large investors, in connection with this the issue of increasing the limit is being discussed. </li><li>  New and previously existing customers with whom an agreement on brokerage services was concluded can open IIS in Sberbank. </li></ul><p>  The minimum investment period is three years (counting down from the date of conclusion of the agreement), the maximum period is five years.  This clause implies that entering into a contract is permitted now, and cash is allowed to be deposited later.  The main thing is to do this until December 31.  The minimum validity period expires on the date of conclusion of the document after three years. </p><p>  The management company‚Äôs service is paid from another deposit account, but not from the IIS.  Therefore, in most situations, the launch of an additional deposit instrument is required.  The type of tax deduction is chosen before the financial funds are paid.  In the future, it is impossible to change the decision on the chosen type of tax deduction.  Combining the two types of deduction is not possible.  In cases of early closure, all tax benefits are removed.  Now we turn to the discussion of the issue of profitability and find out how profitable it is to have such an account and invest in it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is better to familiarize with customer reviews about IIS of Sberbank in advance. </p><h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  In the event that, when opening such an account, choose the opportunity to receive a tax deduction for the finances contributed, then the minimum investment income will already be thirteen percent.  True, without loss, an investment account can be closed after three years. </p><p>  Thus, the minimum risk-free return will be about four percent per year.  In order to achieve a higher rate, you need to invest in various financial instruments, whether it be bonds along with stocks or other structural products. </p><p>  In the event that a person does not have experience in trading or has little time to engage in it in the market, then the most optimal option is a management strategy so that professionals control their funds for the client.  Of course, they will not show a yield of fifteen to twenty percent per annum, but in any case it will turn out to be higher than on a deposit in Sberbank. </p><p>  According to reviews, the profitability of IIS is quite difficult to predict. </p><p>  It is best to start learning about investment information yourself and create an individual portfolio of bonds and stocks for yourself.  It is recommended that fifty percent capital be <span>invested in</span> blue chip stocks.  The remaining twenty-five let them go to the second echelon and exactly the same amount to Russian highly reliable bonds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.investright.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Isis in Sberbank" class="if uuid-2960263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960263.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The following advantages of this financial instrument are distinguished: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  The availability of investment opportunities even for customers who do not understand the principles of functioning of stock exchanges. </li><li>  Making big profits compared to making a simple deposit. </li><li>  The amount necessary for investing is affordable even <span>for beginner investors,</span> according to reviews of IIS of Sberbank. </li><li>  The provision of tax benefits. </li><li>  There is an excellent opportunity for novice investors to understand the stock markets, get the first experience in the framework of capital investment. </li></ul><p>  Are there any negative points? </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  This account also has disadvantages.  They are usually as follows: </p><ul><li>  IIS, whatever one may say, is still a risky investment option.  In this case, there are no state guarantees. </li><li>  A similar investment tool is best used during a boom. </li><li>  There are difficulties in determining the type of deduction that the owner wishes to receive, since this must be done immediately, before transferring the finances to the management company. </li><li>  The integrity of the reports of the managing institution is very difficult to track.  Profitability is a volatile and inconsistent quantity, and a company, making large profits, can file a declaration only for a small part of it. </li></ul><h2>  How is such an account opened with Sberbank? </h2><p>  Funds on the IMS can be managed independently; you need to buy and sell different stocks along with bonds and other securities on the exchange.  In this situation, Sberbank of Russia provides only brokerage services, that is, a trading platform. </p><p>  Also, funds management can be transferred to trust management companies, which will invest them at their discretion.  That is, the client opens an account with Sberbank, after which all funds are transferred to the management of the selected organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="expertgazette.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sberbank iis profitability reviews" class="if uuid-2960259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960259.jpg"></div><p>  To open such an account with Sberbank, you must contact the branch in which such a service is provided, that is, you can open a brokerage financial instrument.  You can also call the customer support hotline to clarify the list of branches in your city. </p><p>  After this, you need to make an appointment, since the queue, as a rule, signs for several days in advance.  To find out if a client will be accepted and what kind of documentation is needed, and if there is a need to make an appointment, call any of the branches prompted by operators working on the hot line. </p><p>  When a client visits Sberbank without a preliminary call, you can open a regular deposit account, you will need it to launch an investment account.  For the opening procedure, you need a passport. </p><p>  After registration, immediately before replenishment for a certain amount, you need to choose a management agency that will manage the client‚Äôs funds in order to make a profit.  This will be needed in that situation if the person himself does not understand the work of stock markets.  For the services of the management company it will be necessary to pay a certain commission, and at the same time incur some costs. </p><p>  According to reviews of IIS ‚ÄúSberbank Premier‚Äù, even an inexperienced beginner can get high profits. </p><h2>  How can a client receive a tax deduction of the first type? </h2><p>  It is worth recalling that choosing such an account is beneficial for people with official confirmed income.  To obtain a tax deduction on contributions, you need to contact the inspection with the following documents: </p><ul><li>  Submission of a tax return in the form of 3-personal income tax.  It must be submitted at the end of the year (i.e. the tax period) until the thirtieth of April of the following year. </li><li>  Papers that officially confirm the income of the client from whom the thirteen percent tax was regularly paid during the year (most often this is a standard certificate of employment). </li><li>  Documents that confirm the contribution to the IIS. </li><li>  Submission of a standard form statement on the refund of the deduction for the amount of the contribution.  This statement requires you to indicate your bank account details in order to receive a tax refund. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.amitghosh.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="open isis in sberbank reviews" class="if uuid-2960262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960262.jpg"></div><h2>  How can a client receive a tax deduction of the second type? </h2><p>  In order to be exempt from taxation, it is necessary for the broker to provide a certificate from the inspection that the client did not receive any deductions for his contributions throughout the entire period.  In such a situation, the broker will not be charged the required thirteen percent of income tax on profits.  In the event that the IIA was closed before the deadlines, then thirteen percent of taxes will be deducted from the closing profit. </p><p>  Thus, IMSs were created as a whole to increase the financial literacy of people, which allows them to raise the investment market, improving the operation of the stock market, which leads to economic growth in the country.  In the event that citizens will learn to invest, understanding the work of the market, instead of just out of habit to keep their finances under their pillows or at insignificant interest in the bank, the money will remain in circulation, and the economy will gain more rapid development. </p><p>  According to reviews, opening an IIS in Sberbank is quite simple, while you can get double benefits.  First of all, income in the form of tax benefits.  And besides, the profit from trading on the exchange.  In any situation, a very high return is assumed compared to the usual deposit in the bank.  But the proposed tool has certain disadvantages associated with the limit.  In this regard, questions on its revision and timing are currently being resolved. </p><p>  Is it worth it to open IIS in Sberbank, according to reviews? </p><h2>  Is discovery advisable? </h2><p>  Here are some important facts about why it is beneficial to open IIS. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cashcowcouple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="isis sberbank asset management reviews" class="if uuid-2960261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960261.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Reliability.  An agreement on this matter is concluded directly with the managing organization of Sberbank.  The shareholder is PJSC Sberbank.  This says a lot, especially about reliability. </li><li>  Management strategy on the investment account.  In Sberbank, you can choose one of two management strategies.  In the event that a person does not want to independently trade in the market, then, as noted earlier, he can trust this matter to specialists.  Professionals will control the money.  The client will only need to choose a strategy: ruble or dollar bond. </li><li>  Availability of convenience in replenishment of the account.  Feedback on the opening of IMS in Sberbank is positive.  You can replenish it for free by transferring to Sberbank Online.  For convenience, among other things, you can configure automatic payment, and certain amounts will be transferred monthly, for example, from a salary card. </li></ul><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  What is the ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù of IIS Sberbank? </p><p>  Another of perhaps the most noticeable amenities is the presence of a ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù, in which you can view absolutely all the information with reports on your account.  Thus, clients are presented with evidence of transparency of the entire financial system of this banking organization. </p><h2>  The company managing the IMS - ‚ÄúSberbank-Asset Management‚Äù </h2><p>  IIS can be opened today in some branches of this bank.  It should be borne in mind that the contract itself is signed with the management company, that is, with Sberbank-Asset Management (the former largest and oldest investment organization, formerly called Troika Dialog). </p><h2>  Ruble bonds </h2><p>  There are also reviews of the IIB of Sberbank and ruble bonds. </p><p>  Client assets are invested in diversified portfolios denominated in rubles of municipal, state and corporate bonds.  Funds can also be invested in foreign currency and financial instruments for the purpose of hedging a portfolio.  It usually maintains a high level of diversification.  The strategy involves the active management of the sectors of the debt market, which largely depends on the situation.  The strategy is aimed at profitability in excess of inflation with bank deposit rates in rubles due to coupon incomes, an increase in the exchange rate, and, in addition, active management of the bond portfolio of Russian issuers with a risk limit. </p><p>  Having connected a strategy called ‚ÄúRuble Bonds‚Äù to Sberbank, customers generally do not spend their time researching the situation on the stock markets.  For them it is done exclusively by professionals.  For example, it is reported that in one year the yield can be about twenty percent, subject to a conservative investment strategy.  This is a good result, especially when compared with other Sberbank products like deposits.  Next, we find out what customers who open such an account with this banking institution write on the Web. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businessmagazinegainesville.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="isis ruble bonds of sberbank reviews" class="if uuid-2960258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960258.jpg"></div><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Consider reviews of IIS of Sberbank.  People write that having opened an investment account, they did not regret anything.  According to customers, this financial instrument has many advantages, which makes investing in the stock markets through Sberbank very comfortable, and at the same time very convenient.  For example, consumers like the ability to set up automatic payment.  Contributors praise Sberbank's IIS in addition to holding regular training seminars along with providing free subscription to the latest news and reviews. </p><p>  In the comments, it is reported that in order to get answers to certain questions it is not at all necessary to go to the branch, but you can always turn to an online consultation by e-mail or phone.  Thus, based on the majority of feedback from depositors about IMS in Sberbank, it can be safely stated that most customers are satisfied with the described banking service and consider it very profitable, characterized by a large number of different advantages that help to make good profit. </p>
