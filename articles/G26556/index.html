  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Manors of Russia: addresses, operating museums and reviews of visits, a list of abandoned castles, legends and historical information</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To plunge into the world of family traditions, learn about ghosts and ghosts, hear romantic stories, it is not necessary to go to a distant country.  Ancient manors of Russia are unique creations of human hands, which at one time were a source of inspiration and spiritual strength, plans were made in them, fate was created and ordinary everyday problems were solved. </p><p>  No typical development is a slogan of bygone days, no one approved the projects of houses, so the owners were given complete freedom to realize their fantasies. </p><h2>  Noble estates of Russia </h2><p>  You can also be delighted with the ancient structure on the territory of our state, because in the country there are a huge number of architectural creations that previously belonged to famous people.  Although, to be honest, most of the buildings are desolate and actually abandoned.  But these are peculiar symbols of Russian culture, but reflecting the milestones of the country's historical development.  But I want to believe that the situation will soon change. </p><h2>  Arkhangelsk </h2><p>  Perhaps this is the most famous and well-preserved noble estate in all of Russia, despite the fact that it suffered a sad fate - it was plundered during the revolution, it also suffered from the fire of 1820. </p><p>  The first mention of the village can be found in the annals of the XVI century.  Then it was called as "the village of Upolosa on the Moscow River", the estate itself appeared a little later.  At a time when Yusupov owned the house, there was a real center of social life.  Politicians, nobles and just interesting people came to the estate.  Yusupov himself was a collector and a wealthy man; there were more than 5,000 unique works of art in the house. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This estate of central Russia is located in the Krasnogorsk district of the Moscow region on the very banks of the Moskva River, two kilometers from Krasnogorsk. </p><p>  According to visitors' reviews, this is a beautiful place near Moscow, where wedding photo shoots are often held. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nemiga.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arkhangelsk scheme" class="if uuid-2685720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2685720.jpg"></div><h2>  Ostafyevo </h2><p>  The estate was built in the middle of the 18th century.  The main building is beautifully preserved, and it was erected in the style of classicism.  On the estate there is the Trinity Church (built in 1781) and a beautiful alley with old linden trees. </p><p>  The last owner was Count Sheremetyev, he was immortalized in the statues of great people: Pushkin A., Zhukovsky V., Karamzin N., who, incidentally, lived in this estate for about 12 years and wrote as many as 8 volumes of his work entitled ‚ÄúHistory of the Russian State‚Äù . </p><p>  "Russian Parnas" is located in the village of Ryazanovsky, in the village of Ostafyevo.  According to travelers, you can come to the estate at any time of the year, it is always beautiful here, even in winter. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.51467220000001" data-lng="37.52845479999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/6/7/3/8/6738.png"></div><h2>  Glinka Manor </h2><p>  Perhaps this is one of the most mysterious estates in Russia.  Its owner was Russian Faust - Bruce Jacob.  This man was an associate of Peter I, and after retiring, he took up the construction of the estate.  The service staff called him ‚ÄúDamn himself‚Äù, because Jacob was a real scientist who constantly conducted some experiments, ‚Äúmade living water‚Äù, froze ponds and did other incredible things. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The following owners of the estate believed too much that the former owner was a warlock and cut down almost all the trees and removed the statues.  Now esotericists and other biolocation experts gather in Glinka. </p><p>  The estate is located near the Monino station, in the town of Losino-Petrovsky, in the place where the Vorya River flows into the Klyazma.  According to people who have been here, the estate is very calm, a very interesting excursion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smolnarod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Glinka Manor" class="if uuid-2685731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2685731.jpg"></div><h2>  Places shrouded in mysticism </h2><p>  Many family stories are associated with mysticism.  Of course, if the estate has been standing for several hundred years, then you can not do without mysterious events.  Some owners of ancient estates were too fond of occultism, and at a certain period of time it was even a fashionable trend, and in other places anomalies unrelated to occult sciences were simply observed. </p><h2>  Kuzminki </h2><p>  This place has been notorious for many years.  This manor of Russia is located in Moscow, in the <span>Kuzminsky forest park,</span> which is also considered a mystical place in the capital.  In the forest, people and animals constantly disappear, all sorts of crimes, suicides are created and abnormal phenomena occur. </p><p>  The estate was built in 1702 by Golitsyn.  Groves were laid out on the land and ponds dug up.  The estate was called Russian Versailles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is a small dilapidated outbuilding in the estate, which used to be a house for servants in the old days.  Now, especially sensitive persons cannot even be near, it seems to them that someone is following them.  According to one version, Kozma, the miller, lived here.  In addition to the mill business, he killed people whom he buried near the outbuilding.  According to this legend, these places were called Kuzminki. </p><p>  But there is another legend, much worse.  They say that even in pagan times, blacksmiths-killers lived here, they worshiped Chernobog (the pagan prototype of the Christian devil).  It is believed that they killed the elderly, who became a burden for their own family.  They hit their heads with their hammers, and dumped their bodies into a ravine. </p><p>  There is also a suicide elm in the forest park.  The tree is inclined to the pond and gallows are often found on it.  They say that people who do not want death are even hung on it, just a tree attracts them and pushes them to a rash act. </p><p>  Now the forest park has been restored, the Paustovsky Museum and the culture of Russian estates have been opened on the territory, and the estate itself has been put in order. </p><div class="photo" data-original="samovar.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kuzminki Manor" class="if uuid-2685728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2685728.jpg"></div><h2>  Manor Filippova </h2><p>  This manor house of Russia is located in the village of Sportbaza (Moscow region).  The mansion is quite young, it was built at the beginning of the last century.  The main building is a prime example of eclecticism. </p><p>  In their reviews, many argue that in the walls of an abandoned mansion you can meet the ghost of a gypsy woman, Asa.  According to legend, Dmitry Filippov built a house for her among the dense forest for her.  He saw her in a gypsy camp, fell in love and stole.  They lived happily not for long, Dmitry was windy and amorous.  He saw another beauty, fell in love and began to live with her.  Aza could not stand it and rushed from the observation tower. </p><p>  In Soviet times, the estate was used for the location of athletes, then there was a medical center and all people claimed to have seen the ghost of a gypsy.  Now this is an abandoned manor, where only the most desperate tourists get to. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  There is a very mysterious place in the Tver region, in the Bologovsky district - the estate of Przedie, which belonged to the architect Khrenov and was built according to his design.  This is not a classic Russian estate, but a medieval castle. </p><p>  However, Khrenov was not destined to live and enjoy.  His son, being an officer of the white army, died in 1904.  The architect understands that it is necessary to flee the country, and he leaves for China.  However, before leaving, he curses the estate. </p><p>  In Soviet times, a children's tuberculosis sanatorium is opened here, but not a single child can leave before the end of the shift.  As eyewitnesses say in their reviews, it seems that someone is constantly watching from the dark, and in this place it only gets worse.  Even random mushroom pickers who have fallen into the estate are trying to escape from here faster.  Probably, the curse still works.  Not so long ago, the entrepreneur even tried to restore the estate, but everything didn‚Äôt add up, the castle is standing, it is being destroyed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.esosedi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Khrenova" class="if uuid-2685733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2685733.jpg"></div><h2>  Abandoned estates of Russia </h2><p>  It‚Äôs unpleasant to realize that many more magnificent old houses are in an abandoned state.  After all, this is not just estates, but a whole world where you can learn about Slavic traditions and family traditions. </p><p>  In Soviet times, most of the estates were used under sanatoriums, they somehow looked after the buildings, but also mercilessly rebuilt them.  Now these houses can be rented at a reduced price for living and doing business, but with the condition of restoration. </p><h2>  "Not boring" </h2><p>  In the Ivanovo region, between the villages of Potekhino and Marfino there is a Razorenov estate. </p><p>  The first owner was Bakunin Semyon, then the house passed into the possession of Razorenov, who partially rebuilt the estate. </p><p>  The house is located on the banks of the river Pishchuha, surrounded by a pine forest, which was laid in 1850.  There is a greenhouse on the estate, where citrus crops were once grown.  By the way, Bakunin‚Äôs sister was a muse and an object of admiration for Pushkin.  But the young people did not have a romance, the girl looked at the poet as a child, because she was 4 years older than him. </p><p>  Razorenov lived in the estate constantly, practically without going anywhere, so she flourished.  He was a recluse not only because of his sick son, but also because he was a stranger (the oldest sectarian religion).  Now the estate is a miserable sight, everything is plundered, both inside and outside, even the platbands are removed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Neskuchnoe, Razorenov's estate" class="if uuid-2685735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2685735.jpg"></div><h2>  Alexino </h2><p>  Another abandoned estate of Russia.  It is located in the Smolensk region in the village of Aleksino.  The construction of the estate began in the 18th century and belonged to the nobleman Baryshnikov.  After the revolution, a museum worked here, telling about the estate life of the Slavs, and the director was Prishvin M. </p><p>  After World War II, the estate was completely abandoned. </p><h2>  Easter </h2><p>  In the Tula region, in the village of Kolosovo, there is an estate of the Chertkov family.  It was erected at the beginning of the 19th century, and already in 1890 the estate passed into the possession of Paschalov, who underwent a radical reconstruction, creating a real Gothic castle. </p><p>  Since the 90s, half of the building is in dilapidated condition.  In another part, people live, and even a post office works, and in the once beautiful garden gardens are laid out. </p><h2>  Chernyshevs estate </h2><p>  In the Moscow region, in the village of Yarolets (Volokolamsk district), the once-most beautiful manor of Russia, built in 1760 by Count Chernyshev, disappears.  Before the war, children were treated here, but the Patriotic Building suffered too much, and it has not been restored to this day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="strana.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chernyshevs estate" class="if uuid-2685738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2685738.jpg"></div><h2>  Naryshkin Manor </h2><p>  In the Ryazan region, on Bykova Gora there is the estate of the Naryshkin family, which was built in 1870.  This is a two-story wooden structure, with beautiful views of the surrounding landscapes.  In the Soviet period, children with tuberculosis were treated here, a camp was located.  But now the estate belongs to the Holy Assumption Vyshensky Monastery, reconstruction work is not carried out. </p><p>  The list of Russian estates that are in a deplorable state can be continued for a very long time, these are: </p><ul><li>  Taldykin estate (Lipetsk region); </li><li>  estate of the Venevitinov and Chokolovs (Voronezh region); </li><li>  <span>Manor Semenovskoye-Otrada</span> (Moscow region); </li><li>  Manor <span>Petrovskoye-Alabino (Moscow region)</span> and others. </li></ul><p>  I would like to believe that in the near future these houses will get their original appearance. </p><h2>  Museum of Historical Heritage </h2><p>  In most cases, Russian estate museums are actually memorial institutions within the walls of which you can learn about the life and work of a certain person and his family.  In such museums, employees are trying to fix the stages of development of the fate of a certain person and revive the former glory of the noble way of life. </p><h2>  Yasnaya Polyana </h2><p>  In the Tula region, in the village of Yasnaya Polyana, a museum works.  Here in 1828 Leo Tolstoy was born and lived his whole life until 1910.  The museum began its work in 1921.  The estate also houses Volkonsky‚Äôs house, a shop where Leo, a bathhouse, and a forge were captured. </p><h2>  Muranovo </h2><p>  In the Moscow region, in the village of Muranovo, there is a museum dedicated to the work of Tyutchev, although the poet himself did not live here, his relatives lived.  On the territory of the estate, in addition to farm buildings and the main estate, there is also the Church of the Holy Savior.  The poet Boratynsky and his family lived for some time in the estate. </p><p>  In the museum you can get acquainted with the stages of Tyutchev‚Äôs life, see his personal belongings and manuscripts that his relatives collected, and plunge into the atmosphere of the nobility of the 19th century.  Celebratory events are often held on the territory of the estate: Maslenitsa, the festival of Senokos and others, travelers recommend arriving on such days, then it is very interesting in the estate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor in Muranovo" class="if uuid-2685745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2685745.jpg"></div><h2>  Free </h2><p>  Photos of the Russian estate, picturesque groves and a pond are very beautiful in these places.  This estate is located in the Moscow region, in the village of Darovoe.  In these places Dostoevsky Fedor grew up, it was a country residence of the writer‚Äôs family.  The museum was opened in 1974. </p><p>  Despite the fact that there are many abandoned estates in the country, there are those that delight in their beauty and are in excellent condition.  Today it is easy to find a map of Russian estates and usefully spend the weekend, going to one of them for new experiences. </p>
