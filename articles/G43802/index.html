It is really worthy of attention.  This village is a resort area, located 17 kilometers from Novorossiysk, and more specifically, on the Abrau Peninsula.  Wide Beam is famous for its pebble beach.  It is spread about a kilometer.  Holidays in the Wide Beam, reviews of which are mostly positive, are remembered for a long time, if not forever. </p><h2>  <span>Wide Beam</span> in antiquity, sea view from a height </h2><p>  According to archaeologists, in ancient times on the site of the village was the residence of the ruler of Greece.  To this day, mysterious artifacts dating back to that period are discovered here.  If you climb a mountain dotted with numerous trails, located in close proximity to the beach, then from a small height you can admire magnificent views of the stunning Black Sea.  Holidays in the Wide Beam, reviews of which are full of enthusiastic expressions, are the best that can happen to a person who is tired of monotonous work and a noisy city. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment, beaches, dive center </h2><p>  As for entertainment, there are as many of them in this resort as in Anapa.  On the shore there are a large number of entertainment venues, restaurants, coffee houses and discos, where tourists are ready to dance until the morning.  In general, there is something to do in the Wide Beam at night.  But there are people who like a calm and measured beach holiday.  They should walk along the water's edge, bypassing the cliffs, between which is the center of the resort.  Thus, you can reach several small beaches, where the concentration of tourists is much less than on the main.  It is very nice and comfortable here.  And if you go a little further, you can get to the <span>nudist beach,</span> located in the western part.  The sea here is simply magnificent, the water is clean and clear.  Tourists are delighted with such a marvelous place.  There are also many fish and other underwater inhabitants in the sea.  If you want to dive or rent the necessary things for this, you can contact the dive center.  It was founded specifically to provide tourists with a chic vacation.  Wide Beam, reviews of which prove the benefits of this resort, is notable for the wide range of entertainment available to visitors.  Isn't that wonderful? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Active leisure: mountains, waterfalls </h2><p>  The resort comes a lot of fans of outdoor activities.  They are provided with water skis and motorbikes, paragliders, wakeboards.  You can ride on a yacht or take a tour along the coast.  Many people like to swim in the sea, because it brings a lot of vivid impressions that remain for life.  It is also recommended to walk in the mountains, where you can come across a waterfall, of which there are, by the way, several.  Local highlands are very popular among tourists who trampled many paths here.  In the mountains there are wonderful glades.  Conveniently located on one of them, you can watch the sea and the life that boils below, on the beach.  At the top, everyone notes how beautiful the Wide Beam is.  Novorossiysk, reviews of which are sometimes rather ambiguous, became famous partly due to this village located nearby. </p>

Life here is quite measured, people are in no hurry and are not fussing.  Also attracts a large beach.  Experienced tourists are advised to stay at the Diana Hotel, which is famous for its excellent service.  Here you can even order dishes to your taste: employees listen to the wishes of the guests.  It is not surprising that, having visited this area once, people want to return here again.  They tell their friends and acquaintances that rest in the Wide Beam is just a fairy tale accessible to everyone.

    <h2>  Choosing a hotel or a boarding house </h2><p>  If you definitely want to enjoy swimming in the warm sea, it is recommended to visit the Wide Beam in the middle and end of summer.  Of course, you should think about choosing a hotel or a boarding house in advance.  Much depends on its size and the number of people living there.  If you want to feel peace and tranquility, you should choose a small boarding house located in a quiet place.  For complete happiness, only polite employees and a good kitchen are needed.  Wide Beam, reviews of which testify to the splendor of this place, has quite comfortable recreation facilities.  And this is very important for most tourists. </p><h2>  "Spark" and "Sadko" </h2><p>  Some people travel to the Wide Beam for several years in a row, and each time remain completely delighted.  Attracts, in particular, the opportunity to go diving.  In reviews often appear bases "Spark" and "Sadko".  A potential tourist needs to know at least a little about them.  Going to the "Twinkle", it should be borne in mind that there, to get to the beach, you need to climb a small hill.  However, this can hardly be considered a serious obstacle to rest at this base.  In general, the Wide Beam, reviews of which make you think about visiting this resort, is replete with such hills. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in the Wide Beam" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/457550.jpg" width="600"></div>  But if you opted for "Sadko", we recommend once again to think it over carefully, because the beach located nearby cannot be called ideal.  There are many large stones and an abundance of algae.  But housing is quite normal.  And one more important point: there is no kitchen in ‚ÄúSadko‚Äù, so tourists do not have the opportunity to cook something, they have to order dishes in the dining room or cafe.  Another drawback is that you can wash yourself in the shower until 2:00 p.m., and then it closes.  As for the "Spark", then there is a small kitchen.  And you can wash until 21:00.  In the immediate vicinity of the base is a magnificent beach with clear, warm water.  Dolphins live in the sea, and sometimes they even swim to people.  Which of all this can be concluded?  Wide Beam, reviews of which for the most part are quite true, is a place for people who do not pretend to stay in a high-class hotel, preferring a calm, measured and affordable vacation.  Nevertheless, Russia can be proud of such a resort.

    <h2>  Some more information </h2><p>  In the end, I would like to talk a little more about Sadko.  Every tourist who is going there on vacation should know that in the dining room located at the base there is not such a big choice, so some prefer to eat in a cafe located nearby.  In the morning and evening there are usually a lot of people.  But there are vacationers who prefer establishments located by the sea.  There you can always find dishes to your taste.  Having eaten, you can go sunbathing by renting a deck chair, the cost of which is 100 rubles. </p><p>  Here it is, Wide Beam.  The reviews presented to your attention should have a definite effect on the choice of resort.  However, it is worth noting that it is not always worth blindly trusting the comments left by strangers, because they are usually subjective.  It is best to explore the situation yourself, and then draw conclusions.  Have a nice rest! </p>
