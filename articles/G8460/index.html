In most cases, Russia took part in anti-French coalitions, but the measure of activity of the Russian Empire as part of such a union was different each time. </p><h2>  First Anti-French Union </h2><p>  The anti-French coalition No. 1 was formed in connection with a deep crisis in France itself.  Raising his <span>political image,</span> King <span>Louis XVI</span> declared war on Austria.  Particularly cynical was the fact that the king was satisfied with any outcome of military operations.  In case of victory, the king‚Äôs authority would be strengthened, as a result of defeat the actions of the leaders of the revolutionary movement would be weakened.  The European government was seriously concerned about developments in France.  In the period from 1791 to 1815, seven anti-French unions were created.  The anti-French union of the first and second convocation had as its goal the overthrow of the republican system in France.  The composition of the anti-French coalitions of the following years sought to defeat Napoleon. </p><h2>  War with Austria </h2><p>  The loudest about the <span>outbreak of war was the</span> scream of the newly formed Girondinsky government.  But in their quest to bring "peace to the huts, and war to the palaces" they clearly overdid it.  France was sorely lacking money for military operations.  Meanwhile, the German states took the declaration of war more than seriously.  So the first French coalition was created.  Austria and Prussia soloed in it.  The new regime began to pose a serious threat to European monarchical states.  The Russian Empire was well aware of the seriousness of the danger.  In 1793, the Russian Empire joined them - a convention was signed with England on mutual requirements for assisting each other in the fight against France.  After the death of Catherine II, <span>Paul I</span> terminated the agreement, explaining that Russia does not have the means to conduct wars.  Instead, Russian diplomats tried to limit France‚Äôs victories through diplomatic means. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="anti-french coalition" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/726985.jpg" width="400"></div>

In order to restrain the young republic, a second French coalition was signed.  Its most active members are Russia, England, Turkey, Sicily.  After a series of naval victories under the leadership of Nelson and Ushakov, the Allies decided on military operations on land. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="composition of anti-French coalitions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/726999.jpg" width="600"></div>  The Italian and Swiss <span>campaigns of Suvorov</span> were carried out <span>.</span>  Due to the passive behavior of Austria and England, Paul I ceases Russian participation in the anti-French coalition, concludes new treaties with France and Prussia.

    <h2>  Anti-Napoleonic Unions </h2><p>  Subsequent coalitions no longer aimed at the restoration of the monarchy in France and the overthrow of the republican system.  The frightening successes of the French army under the leadership of Napoleon forced European countries to seek new opportunities for creating defense alliances.  The third anti-French coalition was exclusively defensive in nature.  The participants were Russia, Sweden, England and Austria.  Allied forces suffered defeat after defeat.  The most devastating blow was the ‚Äúbattle of the three emperors‚Äù near Austerlitz, where the Allied forces were completely defeated. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The fourth and fifth anti-French coalitions could not restrain Napoleon's victorious advance on Europe.  One by one capitulated European states.  Prussia ceased to exist, Austria lost a good part of its lands, and the Duchy of Warsaw fell under the protectorate of Russia.  Napoleonic troops entrenched in Egypt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="participation in anti-French coalitions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/726996.jpg" width="387"></div>

    <p>  The sixth coalition arose after <span>Napoleon</span> 's military <span>invasion of Russia.</span>  The anti-French union united Russia, Sweden and Prussia.  The main burden of hostilities fell on the Russian Empire.  Later, England and a number of smaller states joined the union.  The coalition broke up in connection with the deposition of Napoleon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia in anti-French coalitions" class="if" height="470" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/727004.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <p>  The seventh and final anti-French coalition arose in connection with an event known in history as ‚ÄúOne Hundred Days of Napoleon‚Äù.  The coalition united almost all the major European countries.  After the final defeat of Napoleon at the <span>Battle of Waterloo, the</span> coalition broke up, and more alliances of this kind did not arise. </p>
