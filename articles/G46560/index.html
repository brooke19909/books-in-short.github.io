Even entry-level devices did not offer low prices due to the complexity of the technical filling.  In addition, only large companies, including Apple, Samsung, Sony, could start developing such gadgets.  Actually, these brands today set the fashion for products of this kind, ahead of any undertakings of competitors.  Nevertheless, the niche of affordable electronics could not be empty for a long time, and today you can find many interesting options from Chinese manufacturers on the market.  Such offers include the <span>Smart Watch</span> GT08.  Reviews of the performance and functionality of this model, of course, can not be compared with impressions of the original branded products.  However, the low cost in the range of 5-7 thousand rubles.  reconciles many owners with the shortcomings of the device and its average quality. </p>

    <h2>  Gadget Overview </h2><p>  Despite the modest size of smart watches as such, they are capable of providing a huge range of options.  Among them: the functions of a manager-planner, mobile phone, alarm clock with timer, fitness tracker, etc. Typically, branded products combine a complete set of such features, and the same Chinese counterparts can only be content with basic applications.  And in this sense, the <span>‚Äúsmart‚Äù watch Smart Watch</span> GT08 has taken a significant step forward, as its owner for a small price gets an almost complete set of functions that wearable electronics support in the latest versions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By and large, this was facilitated by the introduction of a wireless module, thanks to which the gadget allows the owner to use it as a headset for making calls and sending SMS.  Of course, not everything is smooth here, but the <span>model</span> provides the main opportunities for this kind of <span>communication</span> on a par with competitors of a higher class. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The claimed technical and operational indicators of the model distinguish it against the background of analogues made in the Middle Kingdom, but not so much inferior to the parameters of the "apple" devices.  In any case, we can talk about a good combination of price tag and performance, which is provided by the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù GT08 watch.  An overview of the characteristics of the model can be represented as follows: </p><ul><li>  Processor - MTK6260A. </li><li>  Screen parameters - TFT matrix with a resolution of 240 x 240. </li><li>  Gadget data channels - EDGE and GPRS. </li><li>  Memory - built-in 128 MB, which can be supplemented with a microSD card. </li><li>  Camera implementation - 0.3 megapixel module. </li><li>  The battery is a 350 mAh lithium-ion cell. </li><li>  Mass - 62 g. </li><li>  Dimensions - 49 x 43 x 11 mm. </li></ul><p>  In addition, the device provides ample opportunities for compatibility with other electronics.  Moreover, the creators have implemented a fairly effective configuration for this, allowing you to bring together Android and Bluetooth technologies.  The only negative in communication functions is that the GT08 smartwatch is not able to work with iOS devices.  There are also some risks when performing firmware on the MIUI platform. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Design and ergonomics </h2><p>  Chinese manufacturers, not being able to provide their gadgets with high-performance technical stuffing, traditionally strive to pay special attention to external performance.  In this case, both good hardware and the original design are used.  Moreover, the watch not only looks beautiful, but also has a high-quality assembly.  The absence of backlashes, creaks and gaps is a pleasant surprise for those who focus on the budget segment. </p><p>  In many ways, high-quality performance was made possible thanks to well-chosen materials.  In addition to the plastic, which is the basis of the case, the GT08 smart watch also received a glass display panel and aluminum inserts on the sides.  As a result, a very attractive look was formed, according to which you can‚Äôt say that the model belongs to the lower class.  As for ergonomics and control, everything is simple and minimalistic here.  Of the functional elements on the case, there is only one button in the form of a wheel, which, however, most likely performs a decorative function. </p>

    <h2>  Main functions </h2><p>  The basic features include a pedometer, alarm clock and calendar.  Of course, the watch also performs its primary task - the display of time.  Moreover, the choice of the user offers several formats of a digital dial.  The calendar is simple and straightforward.  You can assign notes and set reminders to each date.  I must say that, unlike other representatives of this class of wearable electronics, the screen allows you to display the full calendar in such a way that there are no problems with viewing it.  The alarm clock is also simple-minded - it knows how to make calls and vibrate.  A ‚Äúsmart‚Äù GT08 watch and a pedometer are provided, which can work in the background or start manually.  True, there are debates about the accuracy of measurements in this device.  According to some reports, the pedometer underestimates the performance by about 15%.  At least, if we draw an analogy with models from the original corporate lines. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Mobile Features </h2><p>  The device can be used as a full-fledged Bluetooth-headset when working with a smartphone.  We must pay tribute to the Chinese developers, who have provided maximum opportunities from this method of communication.  The user can not only receive and make calls via the gadget on his wrist, but also manage the address book, dial a number in digital format and even write SMS with subsequent sending.  True, using this feature is not always convenient, despite the stability of the wireless connection that the Smart Watch GT08 provides. </p><p>  The manual notes that the Bluetooth headset mode involves sending a call first to the watch, and then to the smartphone.  In some configurations, the scheme looks like this: the call arrives at the wrist, you can answer only through the phone, and for the conversation you need to attach the gadget to your ear.  That is, even for an experienced person, such manipulations can cause a lot of trouble.  The only thing that facilitates such actions is the ability to set up a speakerphone, which eliminates the need to bring your wrist to your ear. </p>

    <h2>  Applications </h2><p>  Built-in programs are for the most part represented by various planners, instant messengers and fitness trackers.  All the disadvantages of Chinese origin of this development are most clearly found in this particular filling.  Even the build quality and hardware do not cause as many negative reviews as the device gadget.  For example, applications such as WeChat and QQ can only be launched if the GT08 smartwatch is equipped with a SIM card.  As for fitness applications, their interface does not stand up to criticism.  But even if we discard this nuance, then full-fledged work with such programs will not work due to regular ‚Äúcrashes‚Äù and reboots. </p><h2>  Camera features </h2><p>  The device is equipped with a rather weak camera matrix, which has 0.3 megapixels.  Once again, the low cost of the gadget affects, for which it is simply impossible to get a high-quality device in all senses.  As a result, the user has to be content with a practically useless module for taking pictures with a resolution of 640 x 480. It is also possible to record video in 320 x 240 format. It is difficult to say who will use the <span>Smart Watch</span> GT08 smartwatch for shooting with such parameters.  By all modern standards, 0.3 MP cameras have no value.  By the way, even auxiliary modules in smartphones are rarely supplied with 2 megapixel matrices. </p>

    <h2>  Positive device reviews </h2><p>  Among the main positive aspects in operation, users distinguish: ergonomics, a fairly high level of functionality and, of course, communication capabilities.  The main advantage of the device can be called a connection with devices based on Android.  But these are not all the advantages that a <span>Smart Watch</span> GT08 possesses.  Reviews also note the quick operation of the interface.  Undemanding technical stuffing allows you to flexibly use the full potential of the device without delays or violations in third-party connections.  Of course, this does not apply to certain nuances of the operation of the gadget, which should be attributed to the minuses. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Chinese developers sought to make the most original product without borrowing "on the side."  This applies to both hardware and software stuffing.  And if in the first case the manufacturer as a whole coped with the task, then the quality of the applications significantly spoiled the "smart" GT08 watch.  Reviews say that using most of them is simply impossible.  True, this does not apply to basic options, including a pedometer, calendar and alarm clock.  Relate to the minuses and the camera with an extremely low resolution.  To date, electronics is less and less equipped with such modules, since in practice they are useless. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart watch gt08 review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1177349.jpg" width="568"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  There are a lot of inexpensive models of the same type on the market that have a bright design, ergonomic interface and useful options.  However, not all of them can be compared with the high level of functionality set by the SmartWatch GT08 smartwatch.  Reviews pay attention, first of all, to the possibility of using the gadget as a wireless headset for the phone.  Of course, similar options have long been mandatory for wearable electronics in different segments, but similar models cost less than 5 thousand rubles.  so far extremely rare.  Another thing is that the user will have to pay for the implementation of such an opportunity with the uselessness of the camera and embedded applications.  The rest of the device is quite worthy of attention as an ergonomic, stylish and technologically advanced representative of the new generation wearable electronics class. </p>
