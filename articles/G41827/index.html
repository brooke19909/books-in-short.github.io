  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kiwi Bank: user and employee reviews, list of services</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The banking system is constantly evolving: new elements appear in it that attract millions of customers.  Success is enjoyed by those companies whose activities are different from others.  One of the new, promising trends in the banking environment is Kiwi Bank.  Despite its short existence, there are already reviews on the Qiwi Bank of both employees and customers of the financial institution. </p><h2>  Company Profile </h2><p>  Qiwi Bank began its activities in 1993 as one of the leading processing centers in Russia.  The basis of the company, unlike most Russian banks, is the implementation of payment transactions. </p><p>  But this does not mean that Kiwi Bank offers customers only to make payments.  Users can open deposits and plastic cards, use an installment payment card, transfer funds to their loved ones and to legal organizations.  But Qiwi Bank‚Äôs core business is transactions. </p><p>  Previously, the bank was called "1st Processing".  Some experts believe that the former name more fully reflected the specifics of the financial organization.  Many customers who have an online wallet or Qiwi debit card still do not know that they are customers of the bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coindesk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kiwi bank conscience reviews" class="if uuid-3016336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3016336.jpg"></div><p>  The processing operations brought Qiwi Bank in 2017 more than 69 billion rubles.  The bank carries out transactional operations based on the Contact payment system.  In 2017, the company‚Äôs activities expanded due to the accession to the QIWI group of the non-profit organization Rapida, the rights of which were completely transferred to Kiwi Bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  On the capital and advantages of Qiwi Bank </h2><p>  Reviews of Qiwi Bank indicate that even a narrow specialization in the banking sector can bring financial success.  Currently, the bank's assets amount to more than 34 billion rubles. </p><p>  The main profit is the commission for transfers and payments.  The fee is charged both in the company's self-service devices and in online services. </p><p>  Kiwi Bank is one of the leaders in the processing environment of Russia.  Currently there are over 53 million active online wallets.  Reviews about Kiwi Bank confirm the convenience of this format: online wallets not only allow you to store funds, but also make payments and transfers. </p><p>  The commission charged by the company competes with the offers of banks when paying for housing and communal services and other regular bills.  Some services, for example, cellular communications and the Internet, online wallet owners can pay without a commission. </p><p>  It is allowed to open bank cards with a single online wallet account, which greatly simplifies its use.  In this format, customers can withdraw cash from the Kiwi Bank account at any ATM in Russia (but with a commission). </p><p>  Many products of the bank, for example, the "Conscience" installment card, are very popular among customers.  Such offers are the best way to conquer the market and receive rave reviews about Qiwi Bank. </p><h2>  How to become a bank customer? </h2><p>  A feature of the bank is the lack of standard offices.  The head office and operating offices are located in Moscow.  Moreover, in Russia there are more than 150 thousand points of Qiwi Bank.  These are terminals in which customers can perform the operation 24 hours a day, without days off. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the Kiwi Bank terminals, you can not only deposit funds to your cell phone and pay for the Internet, but also transfer to an account in another bank or plastic card, deposit funds to online wallets, pay utilities, to government services and other organizations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiabusinesstoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="qiwi bank conscience reviews of employees" class="if uuid-3016272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3016272.jpg"></div><p>  All who use the terminals are clients of a financial institution.  But the list of users on this is far from limited.  The first customers are those who have a Qiwi e-wallet.  This is an online service for storage and payment, which does not require documents for registration and is absolutely free. </p><h2>  The list of services "Kiwi Bank" </h2><p>  Being a banking organization, Kiwi Bank offers its customers the following types of services: </p><ul><li>  issuing bank cards; </li><li>  opening deposits; </li><li>  payments to legal entities and individuals; </li><li>  settlement and cash services; </li><li>  currency operations; </li><li>  online services and online payments. </li></ul><h2>  Description of Kiwi Bank products </h2><p>  Most of the bank's customers are owners of online wallets.  With the help of a wallet, you can not only make regular payments, but also store funds, send transfers, repay credit debt, and pay contributions to the accounts of state organizations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Bank debit cards are not very popular.  More than 4/5 clients open them to make it more convenient to use an online wallet. </p><p>  QIWI Bank's main debit product is QIWI payWave card.  This is a plastic medium that has a joint account with a client‚Äôs wallet.  The card is paid, the client must pay 199 rubles for registration.  Service is provided free of charge for the entire period of use - 3 years. </p><p>  QIWI payWave gives customers the opportunity to receive cash at any terminal.  Withdrawal is made with a commission - 2% of the amount + 50 rubles.  Card replenishment in the terminal is free, when transferring from other cards - without a commission for an amount of more than 1000 rubles. </p><p>  With a QIWI payWave debit card, users can pay abroad.  Commission in foreign currency - 0%, in rubles - 2.5% of the purchase amount.  This is a convenient way to pay from your online wallet account without losing your own funds. </p><p>  Another way to save money for bank customers is to issue a Conscience installment card.  This is the most popular Kiwi Bank product in 2017, not counting the opening of online wallets.  The network has reviews of Kiwi Bank employees about Conscience, as well as the opinions of customers who have already managed to use the card. </p><p>  Not all reviews on the card are positive, but in most cases, customers are satisfied with the unique Kiwi Bank product.  In addition, installment cards are still gaining popularity in the Russian market.  Competition "Conscience" now can only make a card installment plan "Halva".  The remaining debit and credit cards of other banks, with cashback and bonuses, cannot boast of a complete lack of commission when making purchases from the credit limit. </p><h2>  Installment card "Conscience": product advantages </h2><p>  This is a unique payment tool that combines a credit card and a debit card.  Product Advantages: </p><ul><li>  issued within 5-10 days; </li><li>  suitable for payment both in ordinary retail outlets and online stores; </li><li>  progressive credit limit - increases with the constant use of the card without delays; </li><li>  more than 20 thousand partners throughout the country, the list is constantly growing; </li><li>  installment plan 0% up to 12 months; </li><li>  free release and maintenance; </li><li>  credit limit up to 300 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  The main advantage is the 100% lack of commission when using the installment card correctly.  When paying in partner stores, customers do not have to worry about interest - the store pays them to the bank.  It is enough for the owners to simply deposit funds until the limit is fully renewed during the specified installment period. </p><div class="photo" data-original="credity-banky.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kiwi bank voronezh work reviews" class="if uuid-3016346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3016346.jpg"></div><p>  The network has numerous reviews of Kiwi Bank employees in Moscow about the popularity of the banking product.  Every 3rd client of the bank is aware that a new unique offer has appeared on the market.  And almost every 10th person wants to get an installment card with free annual service. </p><p>  Such popularity does not pass without a trace.  The network already has data on card deficiencies that customers also note in their negative reviews on the Internet and on the bank's website. </p><h2>  Is it convenient to use the card?  The opinion of the owners of "Conscience" </h2><p>  Reviews about the Kiwi Bank installment card regarding the ease of use are positive in 89% of cases.  Customers like the fact that you can pay in more than 20 thousand outlets, including online stores.  Even those who are owners recently have already managed to appreciate the convenience of installments. </p><p>  With skillful handling, the client does not spend a penny of his own funds on interest to the bank.  And for this, it is enough to only comply with the limits established by the company. </p><p>  It is important to remember that each partner has its own time frame.  For example, in the Perekrestok supermarket chain, customers are provided with installments for 1 month, and the M.Video trademark makes it possible to split the payment into 4 months without overpayments. </p><p>  In addition, if the owner wants not to think about the installment terms, he can activate the special ‚ÄúTen‚Äù option, within which 10 months are given for purchases from all partners.  The option is paid - 599 - 999 rubles, depending on the connection option. </p><h2>  Installment Card Owner Reviews </h2><p>  Despite the obvious benefit of the product, customer reviews on the Kiwi Bank card ‚ÄúConscience‚Äù on the network are not always positive.  And there are several reasons for this: </p><ul><li>  Earlier card service was paid.  The client was charged 290 rubles for registration in the first year, then it was necessary to pay 590 rubles each.  Those who issued cards at the beginning of the product launch cannot change the tariff plan and are forced to pay the installment card service to date. </li><li>  The declared limit is practically not approved by anyone.  Users complain that after considering the application they receive a ‚ÄúConscience‚Äù card with a very low limit of funds - 5000 - 25000 rubles.  Such a credit limit does not suit more than 90% of owners. </li></ul><p>  Many also include courier delivery services on the list of shortcomings.  Reviews on the ‚ÄúConscience‚Äù of ‚ÄúKiwi Bank‚Äù in this area come down to the incompetence of employees.  Couriers who accept an application for Conscience often did not fully advise customers about the card's capabilities.  And the limit declared by users was not approved in most cases, which no one also notified them when handing the card. </p><h2>  Why do customers complain about the work of Qiwi Bank? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Kiwi Bank is mainly engaged in transactions, many customers are dissatisfied with the work of the company.  Most complaints are related to problems using online wallets.  For example, the network has customer reviews of Qiwi Bank, which describe cases of unauthorized account blocking.  Moreover, every 6th client has such problems repeatedly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.express.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="qiwi bank employee reviews" class="if uuid-3016340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3016340.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, cardholders are not always happy with bank rates.  More than 4/5 reviews are associated with the use of a popular product - Conscience installment cards. </p><p>  Difficulties in obtaining a card, low limits instead of 50-100 thousand rubles declared by customers, lack of consultation - this is what repels many cardholders from Kiwi Bank. </p><p>  The problems for every 3rd client begin with the stage of processing the application.  Applications submitted via the Internet in 87% of cases were considered longer than those that customers made out in mobile phone stores or other points of sale of the product. </p><h2>  Positive moments in the company </h2><p>  Despite the negative that some customers have expressed about the work of Qiwi Bank, the majority of users respond positively about it.  Each bank has technical failures, as well as problems with delays in funds or the provision of a check in terminals.  But this does not mean that the bank cannot be recommended to its friends and use it constantly. </p><p>  On the contrary, Qiwi Bank was one of the first in Russia to promote online services and payments.  The number of transactions in the QIWI system is always in the TOP 10 among Russian processing centers. </p><p>  The number of officially registered online wallets is constantly growing.  In 2017, over 53 million QIWI Bank customers were registered in the Russian Federation.  Only the largest online banks of the country, such as Sberbank and VTB, Tinkoff and Alfa Bank, can compete with such indicators. </p><div class="photo" data-original="qiwi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kiwi bank reviews" class="if uuid-3016270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3016270.jpg"></div><p>  Customers note that QIWI does not require confirmation of data when opening an account on the Internet.  It is enough to enter a mobile phone number and come up with a password.  This is convenient if the user wants to make payments in small amounts, for example, replenish mobile communications. </p><p>  Performing more complex operations requires identification, which takes 24 hours.  All that is needed is client passport data.  Fast service, convenient format and low commission - this is the basis of Kiwi Bank's transactional business, which brings the company billions of rubles annually. </p><h2>  Kiwi Bank terminals: customer and employee reviews </h2><p>  Almost every resident in our country has used the Kiwi Bank terminal at least once in a lifetime.  More than 150 thousand points across the country have made the bank one of the leaders in the transaction sector. </p><p>  In the Kiwi Bank terminals you can not only pay for services, but also deposit funds into your wallet, replenish a plastic card and pay off credit obligations. </p><p>  Qiwi Bank customer reviews on the operation of the terminals are 70% positive.  Users are satisfied with the size of the commission offered by the company, and the convenient location of the machines.  Almost every major center in the city has a Kiwi Bank terminal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="qiwi bank customer reviews" class="if uuid-3016331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3016331.jpg"></div><p>  But not always the operation of the terminals provides customers with 100% comfortable service.  The network has reviews from Qiwi Bank employees about the operation of devices that describe frequent customer complaints.  Most users are not happy that terminals often do not issue checks.  At the same time, it is not possible to re-print the document, which is inconvenient when paying for significant operations, for example, loans. </p><p>  Reviews about the Qiwi Bank credit card, which can be replenished in the organization‚Äôs devices, also come with a description of a specific problem - the long-term receipt of funds in the account (more than a day).  For the bank, which is the issuer of the product, this is a very long time.  In most credit organizations, for example, Sberbank, when depositing through the terminals, funds are credited to the credit card account within 4-6 hours, and in 15% of cases - within 2 hours from the moment of payment. </p><p>  Reviews of Kiwi Bank in Voronezh showed that the operation of the terminals periodically fails.  Most often this is due to a software update during the use of the device by customers, but other problems arise.  For example, employees themselves complained that it is not always possible to qualitatively identify difficulties encountered by subscribers who turned to the support service for help. </p><p>  But, despite all the problems, more than 65% of customers are satisfied with the operation of the devices.  About 1.2 million Russians use the terminals daily.  Such a volume of operations provides the company not only a stable profit, but also credibility in the processing services market. </p><p>  In addition, the list of services that customers can perform at Kiwi Bank terminals is constantly growing.  This allows users to save money and make transfers and payments in self-service devices at any time. </p><p>  Individual entrepreneurs and legal entities can establish a terminal for themselves and employees on the territory of their enterprises.  Such a service is provided by the Kiwi Bank management. </p><h2>  Inside view: what do Qiwi Bank employees think about the company's products and work? </h2><p>  Employee reviews on the ‚ÄúConscience‚Äù card of ‚ÄúKiwi Bank‚Äù in 98% of cases are positive.  Company employees almost always respond positively to the products they offer.  Of course, unlike most Russian banks, Kiwi Bank's services and products can be issued only online, at points of sale or by calling the hotline, and not at the company's offices.  But this option is ideal for those who do not like the "four walls" setting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.boxxcomms.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kiwi bank installment card reviews" class="if uuid-3016343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3016343.jpg"></div><p>  As in any commercial organization, work at Kiwi Bank is built taking into account the fulfillment by employees of planned targets.  One of the criteria is also a high-quality customer consultation on new products and attracting new users.  Such conditions are suitable for ambitious and active workers who are not afraid to show themselves and are ready to fully surrender to their work. </p><p>  Not everyone can handle such conditions, as evidenced by the feedback from employees about working at Qiwi Bank.  Those who failed to prove themselves complain of high plans and harsh bosses.  But most of the negative feedback comes from employees who did not want to become part of a single evolving system. </p><p>  For example, in Voronezh, many vacancies from Kiwi Bank are posted.  Specialists such as information center or financial product sales managers are required.  ,  ,       ,     24 . . </p><p>   " "         :  ,     .       3 ,       . </p><h2>    :    ? </h2><p> ,     ,  ,         .   ,      , ,   ,    ,       . </p><p>      " "     ,     ,                .     ,  ,      .

According to sales leaders, the basis of a successful dialogue with a client is the correct presentation of the product and the knowledge of its advantages. </p><p>  For example, in Qiwi Bank employees' reviews of Conscience there is information about new partners and cases of participation in unique campaigns of the company.  Moreover, offers in the form of cashback and other advantages are regularly updated, enabling customers to take part in several promotions at the same time or choose the most suitable options for themselves. </p>
