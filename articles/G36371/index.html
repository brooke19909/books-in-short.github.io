Some people like to watch live television, while others use satellite and cable digital broadcasting.  In some cases, TVs are used just like a large monitor to watch movies.  Most TVs are bought with minimal requirements: high-quality picture and low price - this is what users expect from a purchase.  The Sony KDL-32WD603 model can be called suitable specifically for these requests, reviews of which will help to understand its advantages and disadvantages.  However, for starters, you should familiarize yourself with the detailed characteristics and main features of this model. </p><h2>  TV Brief </h2><p>  Having a low cost, the Sony KDL-32WD603 TV was still able to combine many of the positive aspects inherent in more expensive models.  The panel has a SmartTV system that allows you to use it as a multimedia center without the need to connect additional equipment such as an IPTV set-top box or desktop computer.  Although the speed of its work is relatively low, it is still enough to comfortably view videos on Youtube or movies through special services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.whathifi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv sony kdl 32wd603" class="if uuid-2896612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2896612.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The manufacturer did not complicate the design and increase the cost for the sake of a more attractive appearance.  The TV is a classic rectangle with fairly wide frames around the matrix.  As users often say in reviews of the Sony Bravia KDL-32WD603, these frames do not look invisible, but at the same time fit harmoniously into the overall concept of the product.  A distinctive feature is the leg, which brings its zest.  It is made in the form of a small metal pyramid, inverted for stability.  At the same time, it is very light due to the hollow structure, and can even be located on a small shelf, which facilitates the placement of a TV in the apartment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  In the factory box there is everything necessary for the initial installation and connection of the Sony KDL-32WD603 TV.  In addition to the LCD panel itself and the stand for it, inside the package, the user will find a remote control equipped with appropriate batteries, an adapter for connecting the TV to an outlet, a network cable to it and accompanying documentation in the form of a detailed user manual and warranty card.  This manual describes all the steps in the initial setup and connection of additional accessories and equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.arredatutto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony bravia kdl 32wd603 reviews" class="if uuid-2896615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2896615.jpg"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The TV received a fairly compact size, despite the budget version.  Its thickness is only 6.6 centimeters and its weight is 4.9 kilograms without a stand.  Thus, it can be easily hung on the wall, for this an inexpensive mount suitable for a small mass of device is suitable. </p><p>  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmatte, which allows you to easily view programs without being distracted by glare and reflections caused by room lighting elements or sunlight.  Resolution by modern standards is low - only 1366x768 pixels.  According to reviews, the characteristics of the Sony KDL-32WD603 are enough to watch broadcasts, however, if the TV is quite close to the audience, then image defects and individual pixels will still be slightly noticeable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="community.sony.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony kdl 32wd603 specifications reviews" class="if uuid-2896617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2896617.jpg"></div><h2>  Picture quality </h2><p>  The main indicator in this case can be considered the color rendition and viewing angles, since, as already mentioned, it makes no sense to consider image detailing at low resolution.  Thanks to laboratory measurements, you can find out that the panel has a good and natural color palette, and deviations from a given shade do not exceed 4 points.  This indicator is enough to call the matrix high enough for the budget model. </p><p>  There are minor problems with brightness, and it may be missed in direct sunlight.  In their reviews, owners of Sony KDL-32WD603 TVs note that in bright light the picture will also appear faded.  There are some problems with viewing angles - in general, the image remains natural, but the black color acquires excessive brightness and mutates into light gray.  Therefore, it is best to place the TV at the most right angle. </p><h2>  Video display </h2><p>  The video signal received from external inputs is of rather high quality.  The reaction time of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãonly 42 milliseconds, which allows you to transfer a picture frame by frame without visible hangs, the image remains smooth and clear.  Due to the low resolution, most devices, including computers and laptops that cannot be called new, cope with the task of signal transmission.  At the same time, the image does not have to be transmitted with a resolution of 1366x768.  The integrated signal processing system can convert to any resolution up to 1080i in appropriate resolution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="gearopen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="led sony kdl 32wd603 reviews" class="if uuid-2896620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2896620.jpg"></div><h2>  Playing media files </h2><p>  Thanks to the built-in SmartTV system and the presence of a connector for connecting USB-devices, the TV can play user files recorded on various media.  Most modern formats are supported, including MP4 and MKV.  However, as stated in reviews of the Sony KDL-32WD603 LED, the hardware performance is not enough to smoothly play videos with a resolution of 4K or FullHD.  Therefore, for comfortable viewing without microfreezes, it is recommended to use files whose resolution corresponds to the resolution of the TV matrix itself. </p><p>  In addition to video, using the built-in player you can view photos, including in the form of slideshows with a small set of effects, as well as play music files. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.migomby.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv sony kdl 32wd603 owner reviews" class="if uuid-2896616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2896616.jpg"></div><h2>  A set of ports for connecting devices </h2><p>  Since this model belongs to the category of budget technology, it does not have such a wide variety of connectors.  Nevertheless, they are enough to connect the rest of the multimedia equipment located in the house or apartment.  So, this list includes two connectors for USB devices, one SCART, two HDMI with a different direction of location (one for the corner cable and one for the straight), audio output for headphones, digital output for transmitting optical audio and RJ-45 for connection panels to the internet.  As a result, it will not be a problem for the user to install, for example, a game console or an additional multimedia player. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the ability to install modules in the CI standard connector.  Such devices are in demand, according to the statements of some owners in their reviews of Sony KDL-32WD603, and allow you to expand the functionality by "teaching" the TV to work with previously unknown formats, for example, to receive a direct satellite signal without an external receiver. </p><h2>  First setup and management </h2><p>  In order to configure the TV and control the switching of functions, a simple but convenient and functional remote control is provided.  The TV interface itself is noticeably outdated and does not look simple at first glance.  This is due to the fact that the manufacturer uses the SmartTV system, developed for a long time, without the latest updates.  However, you can get used to it pretty quickly. </p><p>  The remote does not have touch panels and other amenities that would facilitate data entry.  Therefore, if you plan to actively use the device in the mode of surfing the Internet and watching videos, experienced users in their reviews of the Sony LCD KDL-32WD603 recommend purchasing an additional keyboard and mouse to speed up the typing of alphanumeric characters while searching for the desired content. </p><h2>  Wireless technology </h2><p>  Connecting the TV to the worldwide network is possible not only with a cable.  It provides a wireless module using Wi-Fi technology, which during the tests showed pretty good results regarding the speed and quality of signal reception. </p><p>  It can only be used to connect to a router.  The technology for wireless image transmission from a smartphone or tablet via Wi-Fi Direct for some unknown reason is not installed by the manufacturer in the firmware, although there is a technical basis for its use.  However, due to the presence of Wi-Fi, it is possible to use special keyboards and mice that will not occupy one of the available USB ports. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gearopen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd tv sony kdl 32wd603 reviews" class="if uuid-2896614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2896614.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  Among the interesting features, it is possible to highlight the ability to record TV shows on external media, whether it be flash drives or external hard drives.  This function may be useful to those who are used to watching certain programs, but cannot do it on time for a number of reasons, and the channel, in turn, does not post their recordings in the public domain.  By turning on the recording, you can subsequently return to watching and not miss your favorite TV show.  Reviews of the Sony KDL-32WD603 LED TV say that there is a scheduler in the menu with which you can set up recording for a specific time. </p><h2>  Positive aspects of the model </h2><p>  In order to understand how this model is suitable for purchase, you should carefully read the reviews of those who have already bought it before and used it for some time in normal living conditions.  The following positive aspects are most often mentioned in reviews of the Sony KDL-32WD603 LED TV: </p><ul><li>  Low cost.  Many can afford such a TV, since it is offered at the best price among models with similar characteristics. </li><li>  Good picture quality.  Despite the low image resolution, the TV has good color rendering, which makes watching videos comfortable and enjoyable. </li><li>  The presence of SmartTV.  This option allows you to use Internet resources without connecting additional equipment.  According to reviews of the Sony KDL-32WD603, it‚Äôs especially convenient to use this feature to watch videos on Youtube - for this, the TV has enough performance. </li><li>  Low power consumption.  Due to the presence of LED backlight, the TV turns out to be much more economical than the version with lamp backlight or plasma TV. </li><li>  Light weight.  Due to the lightness of the device, it is possible to easily place the panel even on a not very strong wall, for example, made of drywall, using special fasteners. </li><li>  The ability to play video from a flash drive.  Many users in reviews of Sony KDL-32WD603 note that this option allows you to easily turn on the TV for children, without fear that they will stumble on Youtube or on unacceptable advertising on a simple TV channel. </li><li>  External power supply  In the case of voltage transfer and the failure of this element, there is no need to disassemble the panel itself and costly repair in a service center. <div class="photo" data-original="www.socket.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="led tv sony kdl 32wd603 reviews" class="if uuid-2896621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2896621.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Negative points </h2><p>  The model was not without its drawbacks, emphasized by some users in their reviews.  The main disadvantage, according to many, is the inability to install additional applications.  The built-in proprietary SmartTV system simply does not have a store, so it is impossible to expand functionality.  You have to be content with the basic set of programs pre-installed at the manufacturer's factory. </p><p>  In addition, processor performance is sometimes not enough to work with this software.  So, when you open sites through the built-in browser, sometimes quite noticeable hangs occur, and the speed of some pages leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  Some users in reviews of the Sony KDL-32WD603 TV say that the remote control is not very convenient, since it has a symmetrical rectangular shape, and its sides can be easily confused when the lights are off. </p><p>  Of the additional points that can not be called full minuses, the flat sound of the built-in speakers stands out most.  The sound cannot be called quiet, it just lacks the volume and wider and more pronounced frequencies.  The rest of the claims to the TV when taking into account its cost is not observed.  The model is recommended for purchase by those who are not too picky about the picture, but at the same time want to get an inexpensive and pleasant to use device.  Some say that this TV is ideal for use in a large kitchen. </p>
