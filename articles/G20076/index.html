The warm sea, hot climate, sandy beaches, exotic cuisine and no less amazing and vibrant traditions of the country aroused serious interest from Europeans.  One of the largest and most adapted for tourism areas is Arambol.  Rumor has it that the legendary Four Beatles came to this beach to meditate in the shadow of a banyan tree.  The place is quite remote, but attractive.  For those who are used to traveling economically, there are many places to stay at an affordable price, including the Arambol Plaza Beach Resorts 2 * hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2>

    <p>  The seclusion and isolation of the Arambol beach from the main highways and tourist centers also explains the rather large distance of the hotel from the same airport (about 40 km), as well as transport interchanges.  It is located in North Goa, close to Terekol Beach and Mandrem Beach.  It is difficult to find vivid entertainment nearby; people go to Arambol for harmony and solitude. </p><h2>  Arambol Plaza Beach Resorts: Description </h2>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  When booking payment for rooms, you can immediately choose the power system.  Hotels of this level do not have a large kitchen, so you need to evaluate the situation realistically.  At Arambol Plaza Beach Resorts you can choose half-board service or breakfast only (buffet).  There is one Castle Rock restaurant and a small bar with drinks and light snacks.  Dishes on the menu - mainly local cuisine, as well as international. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><p>  The hotel offers its guests fairly modest conditions.  On the territory of their services, as already mentioned, a small pool with a section for children.  All other water activities are only on the beach and are paid separately.  Anyone can can do parasailing (a combination of a boat and a parachute), water skiing, a banana ride.  Bicycle and car rental services are available for guests. Free parking is available for those arriving by car. </p>

    <h2>  Who is the hotel targeted at? </h2><p>  This question must be asked at the planning stage of leisure and hotel selection.  You should definitely read the advice of tour operators and people who have already spent their vacation, and maybe not one, at Arambol Plaza Beach Resort 2 * (India, Arambol). </p><p>  It‚Äôs worth starting with the fact that the hotel is quite ascetic and modest, which is consistent with two stars, so for those who are used to relaxing with increased, luxury comfort this is not a good place.  Secondly, for children the conditions are rather weak, and there are few entertainments nearby.  In this regard, the hotel has established itself as a vacation spot for young couples, including for a romantic or honeymoon trip, youth, companies and simply secluded relaxation.  The guests in it are completely different nationalities.  Type of relaxation - beach, calm or moderately active, sightseeing. </p><h2>  Arambol Plaza Beach Resort (Goa): location reviews </h2><p>  To India and Goa in particular, as many experienced tourists say, they do not go for high service, starchy sheets and impeccable cleanliness in the rooms.  To find such a hotel is a rarity, most package tours do not offer hotels much higher than this one.  Goa is a place of relaxation, so most tourists, knowing the specifics of the country, were ready to live in such conditions. </p><p>  Most of our compatriots, noting the imperfection in the hotel itself, forget about everything, remembering the beautiful sea.  It is not only warm, but also clean, the beach is also worthy, but be prepared to take towels with you, and also recommend stocking up with sunblock with a high level of protection, since the rest on Arambol will be mainly beach and relaxed, and the sun here is very bright and burning. </p><p>  The result - the location of the hotel on a good and solid five.  Privacy, silence and an atmosphere of complete relaxation will be provided to you in full. </p><h2>  Reviews about rooms and service </h2>

    <p>  Travelers agree that the rooms at Arambol Plaza Beach Resorts have seen a lot in their lifetime.  Someone calls the whole complex extremely ascetic, but generally not bad, while others hint at the presence of various insects (mosquitoes and lizards), which easily penetrate through cracks in the walls and floor.  But in the end, all tourists say that the friendly and very friendly attitude of the staff in conjunction with the surrounding nature brightens up all the shortcomings.  It takes only a little effort to make your stay at this hotel more comfortable, for example, take out the garbage from the room to the kitchen and remember to grab your own towels from the house.  Air conditioning and plumbing are working properly, and there are no complaints about the Internet at all.  But travelers note the complete lack of equipped space for clothes and things: there are no closets or hooks on the walls. </p><h2>  Food Reviews </h2><p>  Indian cuisine in gastronomy is one of the most popular.  Restaurants open all over the world, and fans of spicy-spicy tastes and unique aromas of spices, the names of which can never be learned by a European, are becoming more and more.  Therefore, where, if not in Goa, to try unique and unique dishes!  You can do this in the restaurant of the Arambol Plaza Beach Resorts 2 * hotel.  Reviews about him, however, are quite restrained. </p><p>  Hotel guests, who visited there in 2014-2015, note that only a child or an adult on a diet can be fed breakfast served.  The maximum that awaits you is coffee (or tea) and a toast with jam, for a separate and very modest payment you will prepare fried eggs.  Noting the small portions and scarcity of breakfast, at the same time emphasize that, of course, these are not gastronomic delights, but tasty. </p><p>  This shortcoming, meanwhile, was not particularly displeasing among the guests, and all of them unanimously say that Goa is going to enjoy nature and fruit.  In addition, there are a large number of restaurants, cafes, bars near Arambol Plaza Beach Resorts, so there will be no problems with food. </p><h2>  Tips: what to see in the surroundings? </h2>

    <p>  What could be better than Arambol beach?  Another or even a few nearby!  Therefore, the main advice of all tourists is to show more activity and not lie near the pool, but to explore the surroundings, for example by renting a scooter or bike.  Nearby you will find the very picturesque and small village of Marbella with the beach of the same name (pictured).  There is everything that a tourist tired of fuss needs - the absence of a large number of people and very tiring merchants with various souvenirs and trinkets.  The coastline is wide and gentle, there are no pitfalls and rocks, as well as garbage, which distinguishes this place from the rest, especially for families with children. </p><p>  Another beach nearby is Ashvem.  The place is simply wonderful, with a shallow coast and clear sea.  It is believed that it is here that everyone can enjoy the most beautiful sunset in North Goa. </p>

    <p>  In short, the Arambol Plaza Beach Resort hotel (3 * or 2 * - there is not much difference for India, so you should not pay attention to its low category) is a good place.  Experienced tourists, as a rule, know what awaits them in this country, and therefore they relate to all the inconveniences with a certain amount of humor, because there will be a stunning sea and one of the best beaches in the northern part of Goa. </p>
