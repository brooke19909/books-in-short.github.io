    <p>  The sanatoriums on Lake Baikal are so numerous that it is sometimes difficult for an ignorant tourist to make the right choice.  Improvement in the climatic resorts of this largest freshwater reservoir in the world is primarily associated with an environmentally friendly environment, fresh air filled with the healing smells of the Siberian taiga and the aromas of many medicinal plants.  In addition, the sanatoriums on the shore of Lake Baikal use local mineral waters and therapeutic muds for treatment and combine the methods of medical and alternative medicine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The water in the lake has no organic impurities, while it is saturated with oxygen as much as possible.  And by the amount of mineral salts dissolved in it, it is close to distilled.  That is why many people consider Lake Baikal to be not just a pearl in Eastern Siberia - according to many, it is a real wealth and a special pride of Russia.  The pond, which occupies a vast territory, the bulk of which falls on undeveloped and uninhabited places, is interesting from the point of view of a wellness holiday because of its excellent ecology. </p><h2>  Pensions and motels </h2><p>  Medical institutions are located, for the most part, along the southern shore of the lake.  This makes it possible for tourists to easily reach them by rail - along the Trans-Siberian Railway. </p><p>  Health resorts for the military, resort complexes - many of them annually take several thousand people.  For the convenience of military personnel, as well as military pensioners and members of their families, reception departments function in Chita and Ulan-Ude.  Here you can apply for rest and treatment, and nonresidents can send a letter by fax.  For some categories, benefits apply. </p>

    <p>  This resort and medical institution is located on the south-west coast of the lake, five kilometers from the source of the Angara near the village of Listvyanka.  Sanatorium "Baikal" (on Lake Baikal) is located in a dense coniferous grove, which has a natural origin.  Its complex of buildings and secondary structures was built in 1960.  The sanatorium in those years was created as a state dacha, where the then US President D. Eisenhower was going to come.  During the first few years of its existence, it was used as a place where senior foreign delegations received. </p><p>  Since 1994, this health resort was transferred to the balance of the FSB.  Today it is the Federal State Institution ‚ÄúBaikal‚Äù Sanatorium (on Lake Baikal) of the <span>Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.</span>  On its territory in a separate building a pump room with mineral water is arranged.  The sanatorium has its own well, located in Burduguz.  The water in it is as close as possible to the source in Truskavets, and therefore it is prescribed for problems with the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and liver.  In the treatment, the dirt imported from Usolye is also used. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Located on sixty-two hectares of parkland, this health resort was last renovated in 2011.  Its infrastructure includes a pharmacy, a large sports, gym and cinema halls.  The latter is designed for two hundred and fifty places.  There is also a parquet dance floor, a billiard room, a pool with four paths twenty-five meters long, as well as a sauna with two small pools - cold and warm.  Water in them comes directly from the lake. </p><p>  Sanatorium ‚ÄúBaikal‚Äù on Baikal has an excellent library, considered the pride of this medical institution.  It has over twenty five thousand volumes of books, and their number is constantly replenished.  The resort also has its own post office.  Many companies come here to conduct seminars and corporate events in the banquet and conference rooms that the Baikal sanatorium offers. </p>

    <p>  An individual diet is selected for vacationers in a health resort.  Three meals a day in the sanatorium.  It is served in the restaurant according to the menu, based on the spa card of each resident, taking into account the contraindications indicated in it.  There is also a bar and cafe on site. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Those who rested in the sanatorium were mostly satisfied with their rest and treatment.  The procedures and medical staff were highly rated.  Many were pleased with the presence of an excursion company, which very cheaply organizes tours not only to the lake, but also to its surroundings.  There is a phytobar where <span>vitamin tea is</span> made, based on the fees of local herbs.  Food vacationers rated at "five with a minus", with half a point reduced due to dietary dishes.  But there is nothing to be done, the sanatorium is a sanatorium. </p><p>  Those who came here a few years ago note the fact that over the years the furniture has worn out a bit, but on vacation, according to many, the main thing is nature, healing water and a lake. </p>
