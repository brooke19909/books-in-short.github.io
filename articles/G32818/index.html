This is explained by the fact that a person will then be able to independently acquire the necessary thing for himself, and not hope that he will be presented with something necessary.  To this conclusion very many people come, and therefore provide the donee with a certain freedom of choice. </p><p>  In addition, not everyone has the talent to ideally choose a gift for any occasion, and therefore financial support will be relevant in absolutely any situation, whether it be a wedding, the anniversary of a work colleague or the birthday of a loved one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gift envelope for money" class="if uuid-2259238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69791/2259238.jpg"></div><p>  But there is one caveat.  It will not be very beautiful to present absolutely ‚Äúnaked‚Äù banknotes - this is not festive, and therefore people often use various beautiful envelopes for such a gift.  Previously, money was put in ordinary mail envelopes, and later the postcard industry went far ahead and began to sell color options that are specially made to give banknotes. </p><p>  But not everyone wants to buy such products, and therefore they ask themselves how to make an envelope for money with their own hands. </p><p>  Scrapbooking is an amazing art, thanks to which you can create very beautiful objects yourself.  It is these skills that can be used to prepare an original gift envelope.  But in order to do everything as beautifully and accurately as possible, it is necessary to study some instructions for making an envelope using the scrapbooking technique. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Master Class </h2><p>  A laconic but stylish envelope, which is made by yourself, will be an excellent packaging for a cash gift.  Such a present can easily be presented to a colleague for an anniversary.  Moreover, such a technique is ideal for a beginner who has never before created such an original product. </p><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ringaroundthetoezees.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tools for work" class="if uuid-2259388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69791/2259388.jpg"></div><ul><li>  pencil and ruler; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  Double-sided tape; </li><li>  hole puncher; </li><li>  paper flowers; </li><li>  buttons or half beads; </li><li>  satin ribbon. </li></ul><p>  When you have all the necessary components at hand, you can go directly to manufacturing. </p><h2>  Simple envelope </h2><p>  A fundamental element in the <span>manufacture of an envelope</span> for money is a template.  You can draw it by parameters or use a standard envelope.  If this is not available, then you can take any banknote, step back along the edges of 2 mm and draw a line with a pencil on the sheet.  It should be a kind of little book, opening which you can see the bills. </p><p>  After the template is ready, apply it to the colored cardboard, circle and cut the workpiece.  We outline the fold line under the ruler and bend the paper in the necessary places. </p><p>  We begin to decorate our product.  The outer part can be glued with scrap paper using double-sided tape.  We process the edge with a figured hole punch (here after we attach the ribbon tied with a bow so that the money does not fall out). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We make a simple decorative composition: we fasten or draw a congratulatory inscription using thematic pictures, paper flowers as a decoration, and you can also add half beads or buttons to your taste.  We decorate the lower and upper edges with a lace ribbon and satin ribbon, then the envelope will turn out to be very elegant.  Such a succinctly designed envelope is a rather original gift that you can make yourself.  This present will certainly be appreciated by a colleague or a strict boss. </p><p>  The result should be a kind of opening book, which is decorated with various elements of decor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Envelope for money template" class="if uuid-2259223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69791/2259223.jpg"></div><p>  This technique can be applied by making an envelope for money "Happy New Year."  You just need to decorate everything with decorative snowflakes, for example. </p><h2>  Second simple option </h2><p>  To make the envelope you will need the following tools: </p><ul><li>  decorative hole punch (makes holes in the shape of flowers); </li><li>  double-sided sheet of paper 30 by 30 cm; </li><li>  ribbon 60 cm long; </li><li>  any glue; </li><li>  good scissors; </li><li>  ink; </li><li>  stamps; </li><li>  acrylic block; </li><li>  decorative items such as stickers, logging, pendants and flowers. </li></ul><p>  The procedure is as follows: </p><ol><li>  To get started, take a double-sided sheet of paper.  Determined with the front side, the inside will be the second color. </li><li>  We bend the sheet diagonally, and then straighten it back.  By bending, gently cut our workpiece.  You should get two big identical triangles.  From one triangle we will make an envelope.  On the wide side we mark the middle.  A point can be found using a ruler, and a mark can be made with a pencil, but do not forget to erase it later.  And you can also bend the triangle in half and make a small clamp, and then straighten the sheet again. </li><li>  To the designated center, we begin to bend all the corners.  From the second triangle we will make a substrate for decoration.  In general, you can do without it, but only if there is no desire to make borders, as well as machine lines and other elements that have an unpresentable appearance on one side of the sheet.  They are just what the substrate can hide. </li><li>  We carry out all the necessary measurements.  Do not forget to take into account that the substrate should be slightly smaller than the triangle of the base of the envelope (approximately 6 mm on each side).  That is why we cut off the excess parts. </li><li>  Glue the envelope.  We glue only the bases, attaching the corners of the triangle to the middle, where previously put a mark.  To do this, we use glue, a thermogun or just flashing everything with a machine. </li></ol><p>  The envelope is ready, now you can start decorating. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Envelope decoration </h2><div class="photo" data-original="artfullymusing.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decorative hole punch" class="if uuid-2259390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69791/2259390.jpg"></div><p>  We use thick paper to make a border with the help of a decorative hole punch. </p><p>  The width of the border and the smaller sides of the triangular substrate should approximately coincide.  From the borders we cut off the edges at an angle of at least 45 degrees.  This must be done so that they do not stick out of the triangular substrate.  Now you can glue them to the substrate from the wrong side of the workpiece.  Decorative parts as a result will be visible only from the front side. </p><p>  Next, you can decorate the envelope at your discretion.  For example, attach various flowers, stickers, pendants and other cute little things to it, but so far you should not stick them, first you need to evaluate the composition from the side. </p><p>  Using a special stamp, we make a congratulatory note and place it in a suitable place. </p><p>  Similarly, we put other prints (with birds, flowers), if they were planned on an envelope.  Stampings are best done before the envelope is fully assembled and the decorations are not yet fixed, as they may interfere. </p><p>  We turn to the flowers.  Commonly used are decorative elements with wire stems.  Sometimes they are simply cleaned with scissors, and sometimes they can also go into business if they can manage to make a curl using an ordinary awl or knitting needles.  The wire is tightly wound, and then the needle is pulled.  The result is a very beautiful curl. </p><p>  We lay out all the flowers and other decorative elements at our discretion.  Beads that match the color can be inserted into the flowers. </p><p>  In all places where there was a desire to place brads, it is necessary to make a hole with an awl.  After it can be inserted in the right place, on the other side of the sheet to straighten the legs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decorative brads" class="if uuid-2259397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69791/2259397.jpg"></div><p>  After all the elements have been laid out and fixed, the substrate is best removed to the side and proceed to decorate the envelope itself.  We take a tape 60 cm long and apply it to the middle of the envelope.  We glue the tape with a thermal gun.  On the reverse side, we act in a similar way so that the tape does not hang.  To do this, use a few drops of glue.  Cut off the excess edges and burn with the help of matches or a lighter so that they do not fluff.  Now you can take the backing and attach to the envelope.  This is done using double-sided tape, or a gun with glue. </p><p>  The envelope is completely ready. </p><h2>  Gift envelope for girlfriend money </h2><p>  I always want to congratulate a good girlfriend on her birthday as original as possible and present a beautiful gift with a twist.  This is exactly what an envelope with money that is made with your own hands will become.  Money, as mentioned above, is considered a classic of the genre, but if you present them in an exclusive box made using the scrapbooking technique, then such a birthday gift will be remembered for many years. </p><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  In order to make an original envelope for banknotes intended for a girlfriend, you will need: </p><ul><li>  big white paper; </li><li>  scrapbooking paper that has a thematic print; </li><li>  printed retro-style picture of a girl; </li><li>  felling in the form of butterflies, flowers, the Eiffel Tower; </li><li>  stamps with inscriptions; </li><li>  cardboard frame; </li><li>  satin ribbon, which will serve as an additional decorative element; </li><li>  fabric or paper flowers; </li><li>  pearl half beads; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  decorative hole punch. </li></ul><h2>  Manufacture </h2><p>  First you need to make a blank.  On a sheet of paper, draw a template for the selected sizes (usually 19 by 30 cm).  We make strips at a distance of 8, 19, 25 cm from the bottom.  We make bends along the lines.  The first and second begin to bend inward, and the third outward.  We get a closing base.  All notes are carried out with an ordinary pencil, so that later it can be erased with an eraser. </p><p>  We take scrap paper, on the wrong side we draw a template for the back and front sides of the envelope.  On the front and back, we fasten sections of double-sided tape, onto which we put scrap paper with the necessary pattern.  So that the congratulatory envelope has a very neat appearance, we sew the edge, front and back on a sewing machine. </p><p>  We decorate the place where the money is placed with a lace napkin or a funny picture with wishes. </p><p>  We begin to decorate the <span>envelope.</span>  <span>We</span> cut out the <span>printed</span> image with the girl and glue it under a cardboard curly frame.  Separately put a stamp with congratulatory words.  We process the edges with the help of a figured hole punch to get a beautiful openwork. </p><p>  First, we put a picture in a frame on the envelope, then an inscription.  We sew each element on a sewing machine.  The finishing touch will be decorating the envelope with half beads, butterflies and a miniature paper Eiffel tower. </p><p>  The envelope for money is completely ready.  Such a festive decoration will be remembered for a long time, and sincere wishes will express the best feelings of the donor. </p><p>  Using the same principle, you can make an envelope for money "Happy Birthday". </p><h2>  Wedding envelope </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY envelope for money" class="if uuid-2259230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69791/2259230.jpg"></div><p>  Newlyweds are also customary to give a certain amount in a beautiful wrapper.  You can also make such an envelope for money with your own hands.  To present the gift as effectively as possible, it is necessary to make a very exclusive and beautiful little thing.  To work, you need only a good mood, as well as watercolor paper, scrap paper, a stamp with a congratulation, some decorative materials that can be selected for every taste.  But it is necessary to emphasize the wedding theme. </p><h2>  Manufacture </h2><p>  We use thick paper and cut the blank for the envelope, the size of the template should be 19 by 30 cm. We bend the folding lines well.  This can be done using a ruler.  We draw three strips at a distance of 9, 18 and 25 cm. We begin to bend the first and second inward, and the third outward.  The edges of the third part of the additional are treated with a figured hole punch, on the cover of the envelope we make a small corner.  The openwork edge with the processed corner should appear subsequently from the inside. </p><p>  We fold the envelope, and begin to glue it around the edges using double-sided tape.  To make the product as beautiful as possible, we process the edges with an ink pad.  If such a thing was not at hand, then simply rub the lead of a brown pencil along the edges and begin to rub it into the slices with your fingers. </p><p>  We take scrap paper and cut out a rectangular blank.  We tint a little edge and glue to the back side.  On the inside we place wishes for the newlyweds, we decorate the inscription with the help of a golden monogram. </p><p>  Since the envelope will be quite narrow, it will be difficult for him to keep in shape, especially if you put a large amount of money inside.  That is why it is necessary to fix the satin ribbon on the sides, with the help of it the product can be tied.  We glue the inner pocket with scrap paper. </p><p>  Next, you can proceed to decorate the front.  At the very edge we fasten a lace ribbon, decorate everything with artificial flowers, add cuttings in the form of hearts, angels or rings.  You can add a few beads or rhinestones.  A luxurious wedding envelope for money is ready and made by yourself. </p><h2>  Total </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Envelope for money to a friend" class="if uuid-2259246" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69791/2259246.jpg"></div><p>  Decoration, shape and style of the envelope can be chosen individually, to your taste.
