    <p>  <span>Military action developed with varying success.</span>  <span>In 1458, the rebellious Richard almost died after he was abandoned by his supporters, who sided with Henry VI, who announced at the time of one of rare intellectual enlightenments that he had amnesty for everyone who had voluntarily laid down their arms.</span>  <span>Thus, the White Rose army temporarily lost its combat capability, but two years later a close associate of York ‚îÄ Earl of Warwick, gathered disparate forces, and, defeating the royal army, captured London.</span>  <span>The unfortunate king Henry VI was captured and was jailed.</span> </p><h2>  Law Above All </h2><p>  <span>Surprisingly, the representatives of the White Rose party seized the capital in battle, arrested the king, and became full masters of the situation, could not enthrone their leader Richard York.</span>  <span>It turns out that in addition to military force, there is also a law, and he did not allow the rebellious duke to be crowned without the consent of the parliament, that is, a constitutionally elected legislative body.</span>  <span>Venerable men refused him, and the only thing York managed to achieve was the right to inherit the throne in the event of the death of its rightful owner, King Henry VI.</span> </p><h2>  Warlike queen </h2><p>  <span>Such a decision of the parliament deprived the right to the throne of the son of <span>Margarita of Anjou.</span></span>  <span>And she, having shown truly non-feminine energy and firmness, managed to gather an army in the northern counties of the country at the head of which she moved to London.</span>  <span>In February 1461, a major battle took place near the city of Wakefield, in which its main opponent, Richard York, was killed.</span>  <span>Then Margarita managed to free her husband from imprisonment, with whom she took refuge in the north of the country.</span> </p>
