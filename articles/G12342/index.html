They delight not only avid gardeners who gather a rich harvest of pumpkins, carrots, potatoes and other goods, but also handicraftsmen.  What you will not find in the forest: cones, and hazelnuts, and acorns, and even chestnuts.  But what can be done with them to spend time with pleasure and gain some knowledge?  This will help our article, where you will find <span>what you can do from chestnuts</span> and acorns, not forgetting about cones, leaves and twigs. </p><h2>  Straight from the branch </h2><p>  The best place to start is from the very process of collecting <span>natural material:</span> this is not a quick matter and certainly does not endure haste and fuss.  When you are just going to the forest, do not forget to bring along the boxes and containers in which you can put the "wealth" you have collected.  If you also plan to collect leaves, then the old big book or shoe box may be useful to you: during transportation, the materials will not be remembered and will remain in their original form. </p><p>  When you enter the forest, carefully look under your feet, since it is there that acorns and cones usually lie.  If the first time with the "booty" no luck, then you can look for oak trees, large spruce or maples, if you need leaves.  As soon as the desired material falls into your hands, immediately put it in a box so as not to drop it by carelessness. </p><h2>  First cleaning </h2><p>  If the already collected natural materials have moved to your home, then wash them thoroughly with soapy water, and then dry them on a paper or ordinary towel.  By following this simple step, you can avoid getting rubbish in your hands and at your work.  If the leaves are wrinkled during transportation, put them under the load, evenly distributing the weight over the entire surface. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, it is worthwhile to carefully inspect the collected objects for bugs and other forest insects. </p><h2>  Connecting component </h2>

    <p>  What can be made of acorns and cones if they lie in front of you?  So far, nothing, since besides themselves, we will need some more materials that you can easily find in any office supply store or in a creative store. </p><p>  Glue is the main element of all future crafts, ensuring their strength and durability.  There are so many choices that it is very difficult to choose for a while.  But if you think about it, the best option would be glue-gel.  It is with such a consistency of the adhesive part that we can fasten two cones, while maintaining confidence that nothing superfluous will leak out. </p><p>  In addition, it hardens quickly enough, forming a dense film, which is very difficult to tear.  An ideal option is also the recently-styled glue gun, which heats the glue from electricity, so that everything grasps in seconds. </p><h2>  Flexible assistant </h2><p>  If the use of glue is impossible or simply not suitable for your situation, then ordinary plasticine comes to the rescue.  He has become so familiar to everyone that he is almost never used in various crafts.  Although in vain, since it has many advantages for which it is valued: bright colors, the ability to mix them together, plasticity, strong adhesion of two objects of any shape. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, do not forget that you can simply remove it and create a new shape if, for example, you didn‚Äôt like the old one.  And if we list you what can be made from plasticine and acorns, then the desire to use glue will definitely disappear from you. </p><p>  So, the materials are prepared, we begin to create! </p><h2>  What can be done from oak acorns </h2><p>  When all materials are ready, prepare the work surface.  It is best to cover it with newspaper or put a nylon mat that protects the countertop from hot glue or something else. </p><p>  Having chosen the frame for photographs, we immediately determined for ourselves additional materials: the usual old frame, of course.  These usually lie somewhere in the cabinets, as their appearance leaves much to be desired, but they are ideal for our venture. </p>

    <ol><li>  We clean the surface of the frame, if it is dusty, and protect the glass from glue.  The easiest way to remove it from the base and set aside for a while. </li><li>  Now we select acorns so that their size is approximately the same.  Defects are also not suitable for our creative venture.  There should be about 40 of them, but this is taking into account the size of our frame: the larger it is, the more material will be needed. </li><li>  In our case, the bezel of the frame is thin, so we, stepping back a little from the edge, begin to stick acorns.  They should completely hide the metal part, creating a certain country style. </li><li>  When all the acorns are in place, we put the frame aside, leaving it for several hours, so that everything clings and gets stronger.  Then you can safely insert the glass, put the photo inside and enjoy the finished result. </li></ol><p>  This is one of those crafts that can be made from acorns for the house without spending a lot of money and a huge amount of time, but how many pleasant experiences she deliver when looking at her! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Alone tops </h2><p>  <span>If you look at the acorn, then the look certainly falls on the hat, a wonderful invention of nature.</span>  <span>She sits on the ground so precisely that the question of origin does not arise.</span> <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can be done from acorns crafts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2066685.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There are so many options for using this material that you can make absolutely everything from the caps of acorns, from pendants to various wreaths and compositions.  Our choice again rests on the universal frame, which can be done from acorns, or rather, from their hats. </p><ol><li>  We disconnect the caps from the bases as carefully as possible so as not to damage the necessary material, and set aside.  Prepare the frame. </li><li>  When the caps are already enough for your frame (this can be determined by calculating the parameters of the frame or by trying on the details in advance), you can begin to attach them.  We apply a small amount of glue so that it is evenly distributed on the sides, carefully connected them to the frame, but does not leak out. </li><li>  So, step by step, cover the entire base with hats, then set aside for a while to allow the product to dry.  When everything is dry, feel free to collect the frame back, insert your favorite photos and enjoy the finished work. </li></ol><p>  This frame is just what you can make of acorns with your own hands, and then boldly give it to relatives or friends.  After all, such a gift, complete with a photograph or a card that is significant for a person, can easily not only stand on a par, but also bypass a purchased gift from the store. </p><h2>  What can be made of acorns: crafts, home accessories </h2><p>  Is your box of forest "prey" still full?  Then we will tell you what crafts can be made from acorns so that they are not only a beautiful decoration, but also a useful part of the home interior. </p>

    <p>  Now our idea is a basket - a very useful thing in any household.  Of course, it is not suitable for storing clean linen or dishes, but it will be a great addition to a picnic in nature or a kind of "vase" for a bouquet of beautiful flowers. </p><ol><li>  To create such a basket, first of all, we need a foundation on which we will directly attach acorns.  It may be an old bast basket that has gotten dirty or leaky.  It is best if the outer walls are roughened to increase the adhesion of natural materials.  But if your basket has even smooth walls, then you just need to sand them before gluing acorns. </li><li>  Now we prepare acorns: in this version, any, different-sized, crooked, oblique, and even lonely hats are suitable.  The very idea is not to uniformly and evenly distribute the material with one canvas, but to create a rough texture of acorns sticking out in different directions. </li><li>  So, step by step, we build up acorns on our basket, creating a tuberous surface, unexpected protrusions and holes. </li><li>  When the entire base is full, you can add twigs and the remaining hats.  We leave the handle clean to make it easier to wear a basket.  This is the plus of the basket: it takes all the material without a trace, and the result is absolutely excellent, despite the material and the idea. </li><li>  Let the product dry and only then begin to use. </li></ol><p>  A basket is a great example of what can be made from acorns without spending a lot of time and money.  And at one glance at her, it‚Äôs hard to believe that the craft was made by hand in a couple of hours. </p><h2>  The warmth of home comfort </h2><p>  Candlesticks are also crafts that can be made from acorns.  They turn out very natural and beautiful, so they can independently cope with the role of a gift. </p><p>  To start the manufacturing process, find any unnecessary deep plate with high sides, for example, from under the soup, which will be the basis of our candlestick.  Lay a newspaper or rug on the table and proceed. </p>

    <ol><li>  Turn the plate over so that its bottom edge is facing up.  This part will serve as the basis of the candlestick where the candle is placed. </li><li>  Now, starting from the bottom border of the plate, create the first row of acorns.  Their size should be approximately the same so that the product turns out to be even. </li><li>  The second row is created only at the end of the first so that the base of the plate is as small as possible.  The subsequent rows do the same, carefully gluing the entire structure.  If the glue does not have time to harden, then you should wait for the curing of each element or individual row. </li><li>  When the whole plate is covered with acorns, give it a little time to stand and dry.  After that, you can safely use the candlestick for its intended purpose. </li></ol><p>  Such crafts that can be made from acorns can be a great gift to your loved ones and friends.  For example, this wonderful candlestick in a set, for example, with a handmade scented candle, will be a wonderful gift set for any birthday person. </p><h2>  The holiday comes to us </h2><p>  In a couple of months, a wonderful New Year's time for gifts, Christmas trees and winter decorations will come.  But what crafts can be made from acorns to decorate a Christmas tree with them?  Of course, Christmas balls, the shape of which is ideal for placing oak "hats". </p>

    <p>  To recreate this unusual ball, we need a foam base, which can be found in any creative store.  It is very light, so even with the decor added, the Christmas tree decoration will not pull the branch down much.  In addition, we will use glitter (sparkles) to decorate toys. </p><ol><li>  To get started, we need to prepare the hats and the base itself.  To do this, take each hat, grease its top with glue, evenly distributing it across the entire surface.  When the glue is slightly set, sprinkle abundantly on the hat with glitter, in our case gray.  After that, put off the hat and proceed to the second.  So, step by step, we cover all the hats.  The base itself also needs to be sprinkled with sparkles. </li><li>  To fix the spangles, all parts covered with them can be sprinkled or varnished.  Now moisture will not be scary for a Christmas tree toy. </li><li>  When everything is dry, proceed to the process of relocation.  To do this, with the help of glue, we plant each hat on the base with the shiny side inward.  All this must be done slowly, so that the glue has time to harden. </li><li>  Also, do not forget to glue the accessories for the future pendant: we will take a beautiful chocolate-colored ribbon with a silver border and special fasteners for the balls. </li><li>  We put off the finished ball for several hours, during which you can make several more of these Christmas tree decorations. </li><li>  We insert a ribbon into the fastener eye, tying it with a bow, and twine, folding it with a loop. </li></ol><p>  This Christmas tree decoration is an example of what can be made from acorns and other improvised means.  The balls are truly magical and look wonderful on a branch.  And if you consider that they are created in a small amount of time and from natural materials, then their value increases significantly. </p><h2>  Special care </h2><p>  Like all products made from natural materials, our handicrafts need special care and care with which they can extend their life.  Since glue and paints are found among the materials, it is definitely undesirable to contact the product with water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can be done from the caps of acorns" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2066682.jpg"></div>

    <p>  So, when wet cleaning is left aside, you can use all the cleaning products of home "artillery".  A dry rag or a special cleaning brush for cleaning, which can be found in home stores, can cope perfectly with the task.  Thanks to the special structure, even the most inaccessible places can be cleaned with fibers. </p><p>  In addition, you should not store products from natural materials: cones, acorns and chestnuts - in damp and dark places.  So, no one can give you guarantees that a wonderful frame or candlestick will not be covered with blue-green mold, which will be difficult to remove. </p><p>  The best place to store such a home-made item will be a bright place, a shelf in the closet, a small cupboard or window sill, where a lot of sunlight will be provided.  It is with the help of it that your product will only dry out, which will give it strength. </p><h2>  Endless list </h2><p>  Honestly, all the ideas we described are just a fraction of what can be made from natural materials.  Indeed, in fact, they are real treasures of nature, on which we can rely at any moment. </p><p>  After all, it is they who help the students out in the fall, winter and spring, when you need to create a craft in a couple of hours, and the result fully justifies itself.  Their choice is completely clear: you put acorns on a thread - you get beads, you stick plasticine and matches to chestnuts - a little man or a little animal comes out at all. </p>
