By road, the distance from the capital of Oslo is 478 km.  The distance to Moscow is 1952 km.

Its foundation is attributed to the period between 1066 and 1093 years.  A more accurate date has not been set.  <span>The King of Norway,</span> Olav Kire, visited this famous Viking harbor and proclaimed it a city.  In the thirteenth century, this locality became the capital.  Until the beginning of the twentieth century, it was considered the largest city in the country.  In the fourteenth century, Bergen (Norway) became one of the members of the <span>Hanseatic League,</span> concluded by merchants of the Baltic and European countries. </p><p>  From this moment began the heyday of the economy of this locality.  There was a need for service of navigation and trade, the possibility of marketing craft products.  In the twentieth century, Bergen's architecture was severely damaged, many ancient monuments were destroyed during the fire of 1916, and in 1944 a fascist ship exploded in the harbor, as a result several buildings were destroyed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="norway bergen photo" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/439906.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Bergen: what can be seen </h2><p>  If you are going to Norway, you should think over the route in advance and decide what you want to see when visiting Bergen.  The sights of this city are unique.  We are talking about nature reserves and cultural and historical monuments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Quay Bruggen </h2><p>  First of all, all tourists are brought here.  The embankment has been used by merchants for international trade since the fourteenth century.  Today, this ancient quarter is a world-wide monument, which is protected by UNESCO. </p><p>  Over the entire history of the embankment, fires raged repeatedly on it, ruthlessly destroying unique historical and architectural monuments.  Today it is one of the most popular quarters of the city.  During the year it is visited by more than a million tourists.  Galleries and museums, shops and cafes are concentrated here.  On the territory of the Bergenhus fortress, built in the Middle Ages, there are two more historical monuments that glorified Bergen.  Norway is proud of the medieval residence of the country's rulers, the ancient castle of King Haakon Haakonson (it was built in the thirteenth century) and the Rosencrantz tower (its construction dates back to the sixteenth century). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof bergen" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/440380.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The palace is the largest secular building in the city.  At first, it had three floors.  On the first, provisions were stored, the second was used for living, on the third, solemn ceremonies were held.  After 1299, Oslo became the capital of Norway, and the castle was no longer used for its intended purpose.  At first it was a barn, and during the war with the Nazis - a defensive structure.  Today it houses a museum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Church of St. Mary </h2><p>  The oldest building in the city.  Scientists claim that the church was built in the years 1140-1180.  The construction is made in the Romanesque style.  At first it was Catholic, and now it is Protestant.  In 2014, the church greets its parishioners and tourists, opening after restoration. </p>

    <h2>  What are fjords </h2><p>  This is the name for a winding and narrow, deeply penetrating into the land sea bay.  Its length is usually tens of times greater than its width.  The shores of the fjord are cliffs up to 1000 meters high.  They owe their formation to the movement of tectonic plates, as a result of which huge cracks and faults appear. </p><h2>  Bergen Fjords </h2><p>  Historical and architectural monuments throughout the world glorified Bergen.  Norway is rightfully proud of them and carefully preserves.  Along with them, Norway's fame and the city itself brought the famous fjords.  Two of the three largest education in the world are located here.  The Gulf Stream has a favorable effect on the climate of the fjords in Norway.  It is soft, the water practically does not freeze.  Hundred fjord is the deepest.  Its depth reaches 1308 meters.  Nerei Fjord and Gerangerfjord are protected by UNESCO. </p>
