Is it possible to guess the lucky combination?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There is no doubt that at least once in a lifetime everyone asked himself a question: how to win 6 out of 45 in the lottery?  Indeed, because a winning ticket is a real chance to improve your financial situation and fulfill your cherished desires, and at the same time invest as little as possible in it.  But practice shows: there are very few lucky winners who have won large sums of money.  I wonder what it depends on.  Is there any pattern or is it a matter of a happy accident? </p>

    <h2>  How to guess the numbers? </h2><p>  The principle of the lottery is that the player must choose 6 numbers from 45 on the playing field.  Anyone who guesses the combination completely will receive a super prize.  As a rule, it amounts to more than one million rubles in Russia.  Someone puts the numbers ‚Äúat random‚Äù, others use some kind of strategy, still others use the same combination from time to time, in the hope that sooner or later it will be a winner.  In general, the way how to win in the lottery is 6 out of 45, each has its own. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are also methods for determining winning numbers using magic attributes.  One such method is called dowsing.  So, how to win the lottery 6 out of 45 using a pendulum?  In fact, the method is quite simple and affordable, not requiring special knowledge and skills.  For the ritual you will need a piece of paper on which you need to write all 45 digits.  Next, you need to take some kind of pendant and hold it one by one over each number, if it begins to swing over one or several of them, then perhaps this figure should be noted.  The method, of course, at first glance does not inspire confidence, but clairvoyants often use pendulums, which means that it can also be considered for this purpose. </p><h2>  Statistics </h2><p>  In each game, the organizers keep statistics, in this case we are talking about the frequency of the loss of certain numbers.  This information is widely available for players, and you can see it on the official site of the lottery, if it is of course there is.  Regular purchasers of lottery tickets use this method for the game, while others, by the way, on the contrary, bet on those numbers that are less often statistically. </p><p>  Also, many players believe that the lottery organizers pre-calculate the combinations in order to have as few winning tickets as possible.  In fact, it is extremely difficult to do this, if, of course, we are not talking about playing online, and the computer program automatically chooses the winning numbers. </p>
