    <p>  In different countries and in certain regions, hotels have certain features.  Crete in this sense is no exception.  Those who have become accustomed to the luxury of Thai, Egyptian, Turkish, etc. 5 * hotels are often disappointed with the service and even the view of the hotels in Crete.  Those who visited 2-3 * hotels in Portugal or France are pleasantly surprised by the incredible price-quality ratio in local hotels of low categories, which include Galini Anisaras 3 *. </p><h2>  About the features of Cretan hotels and apartments 3 * </h2><p>  Most 3-star hotels in Crete belong to the same family for many years.  Mostly the owners of such establishments are engaged in hotel business professionally. </p><p>  Buildings and territory in such hotels (the same can be said of Galini Anisaras 3 *) are usually roomy.  Pool is required.  But the design of the internal surroundings can be much more modest than in an institution of category 1 *.  The reason is that the owners of such hotels have less opportunities for financing, and taxes have to be paid much more.  In any case, as many reviews assure, mainly in 3 * hotels, including Galini Anisaras 3 *, vacationers get more opportunities than in premium establishments.  Owners, for example, may be condescending to the fact that guests bathe in the pool during off-hours.  The bar will begin to prepare for closing when the guests have already begun to gather home.  And employees (the bartender and often the boss himself) can keep company with guests during the evening. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About contingent </h2><p>  In Crete, tours to 3-star hotels, including Galini Anisaras 3 *, are mainly bought by the middle class.  Mostly these are people who do not want to spend big money on vacation, and the little-star options are either not familiar to them or they are scared.  In 3 * hotels, the chance of getting tourists from the backwoods of the former Soviet Union, who first went abroad and have a truly ‚Äúwide‚Äù vacation is almost ruled out. </p><h2>  Galini Anisaras 3 * (Crete, Heraklion): Acquaintance </h2><p>  The hotel complex Galini Anisaras 3 * (Crete) is located in Anissaras (northern coast of the island of Crete), about 800 m from the wonderful beach.  According to reviews, the road to the beach, if you walk, takes only 6 minutes.  The hotel is located on the 2nd line. </p><p>  <span>Heraklion</span> International <span>Airport</span> is 20 km away.  To go for about half an hour, the cost of a taxi is about 2400 rubles.  Hersonissos, with its rich nightlife, is 4 km away.  Near the hotel there is parking (free). </p><ul><li>  Heraklion N. Kazantzakis (airport) is 20 km away. </li><li>  Anisaras Beach is 800 meters away. </li><li>  The center of Anissaras is 270 meters away. </li></ul>

According to reviews, local Greek cuisine is always on top, with a slightly smaller assortment than in the premium class.  The guests rate the cleaning and staff at 5 points.  In general, everything is not bad, according to vacationers.  If you take a car and travel, rather than staying in a hotel, you may not notice any flaws at all.  The hotel is very good at its 3 *, tourists say.  And some even believe that the quality of services here exceeds the cost of the permit. </p><p>  Hotel Galini Anisaras 3 * belongs to the low price category, but is quite decent, the guests are divided, small, out-of-date and very homely.  The Internet is available in the bar, there are usually no problems with it.  The pool on the territory is very small, residents share it, clean it daily, the water is clear and clean.  There is a swing at the playground.  There is a bar by the pool.  Whether there is a sauna in the hotel, the authors of the reviews do not mention. </p><p>  The hotel is located in a village, say the authors of reviews, where there are almost no shops.  Mostly buildings in the village are hotels and private houses.  Entertainment centers are completely absent.  There is no promenade in the resort village, there is no central pedestrian street.  The nearest town with shops and discos is 40 minutes on foot.  If you want to have fun or buy something, guests need to go to Hersonissos, but this road is not easy - there are no sidewalks, you will have to get on the side of the road for half an hour.  You‚Äôll have to go back uphill.  The hotel should be chosen by people who like to walk, the authors of reviews say. </p><p>  Taxi costs 7 euros (450 rubles), travel by bus, which runs from the hotel once a day, -1.8 euros (115 rubles).  To a stop where intercity buses stop more often, go uphill for 20-30 minutes.  Tourists are advised to rent bicycles and ride around, along the sea you can drive to the neighboring village. </p>

    <h2>  What guests say about the rooms </h2><p>  Check-in occurs immediately upon arrival.  Guests call the hotel a cozy hotel, but when you first get to know the rooms, many are somewhat shocked.  The apartments on the first floor lack windows, poor lighting, ants run around the bed and in the bathroom, the faucet flows.  Air conditioning in the room is working properly.  The premises have a double door, one of them is wooden, the second is glazed.  If, if they want to breathe fresh air or let in sunlight, the tenants open the door, they will be practically in the courtyard, people will walk by and drive cars.  Vacationers do not recommend lodging in rooms on the ground floor.  It is better to choose accommodation on the 2nd or 3rd floor. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are very basic, even Spartan, shared by guests.  They are cleaned and changed daily.  The rooms are clean, tidy, with wooden furniture.  If vacationers get a room with a sea view, the modesty of the room immediately ceases to notice.  Rooms feature balconies.  Often the shower in the room is not very comfortable, consisting of a tray and a curtain, when using it, water floods the floor, so it is always damp in the bathroom.  There is no hairdryer in the room.  A fridge and air conditioning are available at an additional cost. </p><p>  According to numerous reviews, the bathroom is often in disrepair: the toilet is constantly flowing, noisy, not picking up water.  For the hotel employees, fixing it, vacationers share it, can be a problem. </p><p>  Those hoping to use the hotel for overnight stays may be disappointed.  Sleeping in a room may not succeed, because audibility is phenomenal, snoring and conversations of guests in the next room are clearly audible.  A separate topic is the doors that slam so loudly that the sound travels throughout the hotel.  Guests sometimes wake up at night from this rumble if someone leaves their room. </p><h2>  How to speak about staff </h2><p>  The staff at the Galini Anisaras Hotel 3 * guests are called responsive, very welcoming, welcoming and friendly.  Employees are always ready to help, listen, advise.  Many vacationers here have the impression that they came to visit good friends.  But only one of the employees speaks Russian there, so for those who are going to communicate in Russian, the authors of the reviews recommend taking a phrase book. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  For those who are going to stay at the Galini Hotel, reviews recommend being prepared for the fact that you should not expect a special variety of dishes here, but the food is delicious.  Fresh vegetables and meat are always served.  Of the fruits, there are usually watermelons and melons.  Once a week a barbecue is prepared by the pool (4 types of meat).  The assortment of products also contains cheese, for dinner fish, meat (lamb, turkey), fruits, a main dish served daily different (from national cuisine). </p><p>  Guests are also offered wine, beer, crayfish, cola, water.  From 14 to 16 you can buy ice cream.  Drinks are poured into glass dishes here, which pleasantly distinguishes the hotel from many other "three rubles", vacationers share it, where only plastic dishes are used. </p><p>  Dishes change every day.  For a meat or fish dish served as a side dish pasta, potatoes + boiled and raw vegetables (in salad), olive oil, olives, delicious fresh bread. </p><p>  There are never any queues during meals, and even if you arrive 10 minutes before closing time, the products will not end, everything will be served fresh and delicious, vacationers share. </p><h2>  About the beach </h2><p>  The beach is beautiful, the authors of reviews share, but it is far to go.  The road is not annoying, there are no steep climbs and descents.  There are no sidewalks, you just have to go along the road, the movement, however, is not too busy. </p><p>  On the beach there are paid sunbeds, inexpensive: 4-7 euros (250-450 rubles), as well as areas where you can lie down with your umbrella.  The sea here is just wonderful, vacationers say.  Emerald water, small coves - all this pleases the eye!  Swimming is a pleasure. </p><p>  The beach - the right, the better, tourists say.  If you go down from the side of shops - there is a very nice beach, pebble, white, very beautiful, with a wonderful sunset.  The sea is good, clean, warm. </p><h2>  About entertainment </h2><p>  Animation, according to guests, no, the hotel is intended solely for a relaxing holiday.  Hotel Galini Anisaras 3 * is very quiet.  At 10 pm there is already a hang up. </p><p>  According to the residents, there is no full-fledged playground here: there is a swing across the road for children, nothing else.  The authors of the reviews recommend that tourists who plan to travel with their children think carefully before choosing this hotel. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Among the advantages of the hotel, guests note good food, friendly staff, quick check-in.  Of the minuses: modest dilapidated rooms, location away from places of entertainment, lack of windows in the rooms on the ground floor.  This hotel is recommended for those who are going to take a car or plan to come here without small children.  Those who are used to chic rooms, a varied table and entertainment right at the hotel should not consider this option. </p><p>  In general, according to many, the quality of the services provided at the Galini Anisaras 3 * hotel is fully consistent with their value. </p>
