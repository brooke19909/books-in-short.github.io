Before you go to the store for a new microwave, you need to consider in detail what the Bosch microwave is. </p><h2>  Types of microwave </h2><p>  Each <span>microwave oven is</span> characterized by a set of specific functions that depend on the configuration.  Options: </p><ul><li>  microwave; </li><li>  microwaves / grill; </li><li>  microwaves / grill / convection. </li></ul><p>  The first type of ovens has a standard set of functions - heating, defrosting and cooking simple dishes.  However, in order to cook in a more sophisticated way, manufacturers decided to incorporate a grill in the oven - this is the second type of microwave oven. </p>

    <p>  But all of its potential can be shown only by microwave with convection function.  The main advantage of such devices is not so much the possibility of cooking using the grill as the presence of the cooking function, the mechanism of which is based on the circulation of hot air.  A device with this function will be an excellent assistant for people who want to eat tasty food and not suffer from a terrible fever when cooking in ovens, which is especially true in the summer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Grill types </h2><p>  Of course, one of the most reliable manufacturers of household appliances and electronics is Bosch.  <span>A microwave oven</span> (built-in) with a grill is produced by this company in two versions: </p><ul><li>  with quartz grill; </li><li>  with TEN grill. </li></ul><p>  The heating coil in the furnace is located on top, but can also be duplicated in the lower part of the microwave.  With two heating elements, the device will cost much more, but it will allow you to warm the dish from different sides.  In addition, during the preparation of, for example, chicken, its skin will become golden in color and becomes crispy.  This microwave with one TEN cannot brag. </p>

    <p>  Quartz grill saves space inside the oven and is located at the top.  At the same time, he does not need special care and is gaining power faster than his TEN new counterpart.  The conclusion follows: a microwave oven with a quartz grill is much more expensive than with a TEN. </p><h2>  The internal volume of the device </h2><p>  This is one of the most important criteria to rely on when choosing a Bosch microwave.  <span>A microwave oven (built-in)</span> must meet all the requirements for it, including this one.  The fact is that each buyer in this case is guided not only by the size of the kitchen, but also by how many people will prepare the food. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, for one person it will be enough to purchase a device with a 9 liter volume.  And for a family of three, this will not be enough.  They should opt for a larger oven with an internal volume of 21 liters. </p>

    <p>  But the microwave, the price of which will be higher than the previous two options, has a volume of up to 42 liters and is suitable for people who often receive guests.  Such a microwave can cook a large piece of meat, a large turkey or cook a huge pot of soup. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Bosch range of built-in microwave ovens is dominated by models with dimensions 38x60x32 cm and a power of 900 W, which is varied by a five-step regulator.  This is due to the great demand of the consumer for a furnace with such a volume. </p><h2>  Device management </h2><p>  The most popular Bosch built-in models have touch control, and cooking in them is almost automatic.  Due to the simplicity of programming, the Bosch microwave oven collects positive reviews around the Internet, because housewives note both the operation of the device and the ease of care for it. </p>

    <p>  By the way, Bosch microwaves already have programs that allow you to cook a specific dish with one click.  You just need to look at the instructions, select the dish you like, put the ingredients in the oven and press the button. </p><h2>  Popular models </h2><p>  There are a lot of models of built-in microwave ovens.  We list the most popular among consumers. </p><ul><li>  Bosch HMT 85ML23. </li><li>  Bosch BFL 634GB1. </li><li>  Bosch BEL 634GS1. </li></ul><p>  The first Bosch microwave has 2 standard colors: black / white.  The other two models are available only in dark colors, but with metal inserts, which gives them a more modern look.  The internal volume of each furnace is 21 liters.  This is one of the main criteria that you should pay attention to when choosing a microwave.  A camera of this size is ideal for a large family, and for two people you can use more modest models - a volume of 15 liters. </p><p>  Bosch (built-in microwave oven), the inner coating of which is made of stainless steel, can withstand fairly high temperature extremes.  In addition, stainless steel is a very shock-resistant and wear-resistant material, which will not be difficult to clean. </p>

    <p>  Management of all three models is touch-sensitive, which makes it easy to control the process of preparing your favorite dishes.  By the way, Bosch microwave ovens already have 7 automatic cooking programs. </p><p>  In addition, all models of Bosch microwaves presented are equipped with defrosting, delayed start, grill and automatic defrosting. </p><h2>  What else can please this device? </h2><p>  Bosch (built-in microwave oven) has a number of advantages over equipment from other manufacturers.  For example, the model HMT 85ML23 is equipped with a multi-level grill, which allows you to cook several dishes at once, while saving time and energy.  This device also has a backlight, and the timer can be configured as a clock - this is a big plus for some buyers. </p><p>  The microwave oven Bosch BFL 634GB1 has the function of supplying hot steam, which allows it not to overdry products during cooking.  In addition, this program can improve the taste of food and can provide heating 2 times faster. </p><p>  Another model - BEL 634GS1, is equipped with a fan that ventilates the microwave after each preparation or heating of the dish.  Such <span>a Bosch</span> microwave <span>oven,</span> whose <span>instructions</span> describe in detail the algorithm of the fan, can eliminate even persistent odors of spices.  Therefore, nothing will affect the taste of the next warmed dish. </p><p>  As an addition to the microwave, the manufacturer advises you to buy a plate of "Crisp", which will be a great purchase for lovers of fried products.  The peculiarity of this subject is that it is able to quickly warm up and maintain a temperature of 200 degrees for a rather long time.  Moreover, the plate material is so strong that it can withstand even severe temperature extremes. </p><h2>  The cost of the device </h2><p>  The cost of the microwave depends entirely on a number of built-in functions and programs.  So, the Bosch BFL 634GB1 furnace costs from 30 to 35 thousand rubles.  And the price of the BEL 634GS1 model ranges from 48-50 thousand.  Therefore, before choosing a kitchen device, you need to think about what programs you need.  If you only plan to heat food, then a microwave, the price of which exceeds 30 thousand rubles, will be useless in the kitchen.  In this case, it is worth choosing a simpler and less expensive option.  If you want to see in your device a full range of various functions, then in less than 50 thousand you will not be able to purchase such a device. </p>
