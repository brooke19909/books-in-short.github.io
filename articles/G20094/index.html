In some sources, it can be found under the name paraoxyphenylaminoacetic acid - the well-known substance used to develop photographs.  It belongs to the group of simple <span>aliphatic amino acids,</span> has the following chemical formula: NH2-CH2-COOH. </p><p>  The effect of this acid on the body. </p><p>  It is no secret that aminoacetic acid is found in many proteins and biologically active compounds.  Thanks to it, the process of synthesis of profirins and purine compounds occurs.  In addition, the substance in question is <span>a neurotransmitter</span> amino acid.  Glycine receptors located in the areas of the brain and spinal cord inhibit the effect on neurons, increase GABA excretion, and also reduce the so-called excretion from neurons, which contribute to the excitation of amino acids, which include <span>glutamic acid.</span> </p><p>  Chemical properties </p><p>  It is important to know that in a substance such as aminoacetic <span>acid, the chemical properties are</span> as follows: glinergic, GABAergic effect, in addition, antioxidant and antitoxic properties are expressed.  And most importantly, glycine is able to regulate glutamate receptors.  Apply this acid to reduce vegetative-vascular and cerebral disorders, it significantly reduces the toxic effect of alcohol.  There is a noticeable decrease in psychoemotional stress and aggressiveness, which in turn leads to increased social adaptation.  In addition, improves mood and normalizes sleep, increases mental performance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pharmacological analysis </p><p>  As for the pharmacological action, aminoacetic acid can easily penetrate into a large number of fluids and tissues, for example, into the brain.  This substance is metabolized to a combination of water and carbon dioxide, which does not accumulate in the tissues. </p><p>  What body signals should this substance be used for? </p><p>  In case of often observed stressful situations, reduced working capacity, with deviant forms of behavior, various diseases of the nervous system, it is recommended to use this drug.  Glycine fights against neurosis and vegetative-vascular dystonia, and is also useful after craniocerebral trauma and ischemic stroke. </p><p>  The use of glycine by athletes </p><p>  Aminoethanoic acid is included in the diet as a dietary supplement E640. </p><p>  The list of useful properties possessed by aminoacetic acid - the polypeptide is inexhaustible.  So, it slows down the process of degeneration of muscle tissue, due to the fact that this acid is a source of creatine.  You can not do without it in the synthesis of nucleic and <span>bile acids.</span> </p><p>  This substance was included in a number of antacid preparations that are used for gastrointestinal diseases.  Everything else, this acid is used when it is necessary to repair damaged tissue. </p><p>  We can not say about the importance of glycine for the central nervous system and prostate gland.  Due to the fact that it is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, epileptic convulsions are prevented. </p><p>  Aminoacetic acid has also found its application in the treatment of <span>manic-depressive psychosis.</span>  She copes quite effectively and with such an ailment as hyperactivity. </p><p>  The fact is known that with an excess of this substance, a person often experiences a feeling of fatigue, however, its use in reasonable quantities can solve this problem, giving the body a huge supply of energy.  It should be remembered that in everything you need to know the measure. </p>
