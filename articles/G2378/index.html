Both parties to the transaction perceive the service as a way to earn money.  And to achieve significant success in this market segment, it is necessary to make a lot of effort.  Some do it.  For example, PPF Life Insurance.  Customer reviews about services, quality and nuances of service, read further in this article. </p><h2>  History of creation and development </h2><p>  The fund was founded in 2002 by the foreign Generali PPF LLC.  Life Insurance, Home Credit Insurance and Insurance in Russia were all part of the same structure.  In 2013 there was a redistribution of shares.  PPF Group, a key player in the international holding of investment companies, acquired 25% of the shares in 2013, and then another 24%. </p><p>  Over the 13 years of its existence in Russia, dozens of <span>customer service</span> programs have been developed that are implemented through its own agent and banking networks.  The achieved results are evidenced by the rating of Expert RA A ++ rating agency, membership in the Anti-Fraud Committee of PPF Life Insurance LLC, and customer reviews. </p>

    <h2>  Optim </h2><p>  The program is aimed at the accumulation of funds, focused primarily on the elderly.  The tariff allows you to connect additional options.  The main advantage of the program is cash indexation. </p><h2>  "Family option" </h2><p>  A new program from PPF “Life Insurance”, which appeared only in May 2015.  5 family members can become parties to the agreement at the same time: two adults (18-70 years old) and three children (1-17 years old).  The policy provides for payment in the event of a burn or fracture, disability, or death as a result of the National Assembly.  The policy is for 1 year. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="generali ppf life insurance" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/791183.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The most popular fare is the Sun.  In theory, the program allows you to get compensation even for small scratches and cuts on the body of the child.  To do this, you need to provide an extract from the clinic and the results of the analyzes in the PPF "Life Insurance".  Payment is due up to 2 weeks.  This is evidenced by customer reviews on the forums.  However, the timing of payment of compensation depends largely on the specific insured event.  If we are talking about a person getting a disability as a result of <span>an accident</span> or illness, then the waiting time may increase up to 1 month.  In general, most customers are satisfied with the cooperation with the company.  There are, of course, negative reviews.  But they relate either to the disrespectful attitude of the company’s employees towards customers, or problems arising due to the insured person’s ignorance of the rules for processing an application for compensation.  In order to reduce the risk of receiving a refusal to pay, it is necessary to treat the purchase of the policy with due attention in advance. </p><h2>  5 Common Beginner Mistakes </h2><p>  <em>Life insurance is unreliable.</em> </p><p>  It is possible to reduce risks in long-term financing if you choose a company that adheres to a conservative approach to investments: it invests reserves in government securities and corporate bonds. </p><p>  <em>Life insurance is an investment, and only then protection.</em> </p><p>  This service aims to reduce risks in case of health problems.  Although endowment insurance allows you to generate some capital, but making a profit is not the main goal.  This service is financially attractive due to tax deduction and income indexation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ppf life insurance payment" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/791227.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  <em>The only thing you should focus on is the amount of the <span>insurance premium.</span></em>

    <p>  When choosing a program, several factors must be taken into account: the purpose of the investment (protection or accumulation), a set of risks, and the duration of the contract.  Depending on these parameters, the optimal product is selected. <br><br>  <em>It is better to buy an insurance program with a minimum set of risks.</em> </p><p>  Such products provide for the payment of reimbursement as a result of death or in the event that the client has lived to the end of the term of the policy.  They cannot demonstrate all the benefits of the service or financially protect a person in the event of injury, disability. </p><p>  <em>Outdated information.</em> </p><p>  Once a year, you need to revise the contract to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the data.  If life circumstances have changed (marriage, divorce, childbirth, increased income), then you need to adjust the program so that the <span>insurance amount</span> can cover the financial needs of families.  By the way, untimely updating of data very often serves as a legitimate refusal to pay compensation.  This is especially true in cases where the beneficiary has not been changed (for example, as a result of divorce of spouses). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ppf life insurance rating" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/791188.jpg" width="565"></div>
