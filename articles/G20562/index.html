You can read a lot, view photos, but it is better to go on a trip yourself to see the Golden Ring of Russia with your own eyes.  Tours on this route are now available to everyone. </p><p>  Someone considers Moscow to the cities of this group, someone believes that according to certain parameters it does not fit this definition.  We will not discuss this issue.  Our task is to introduce you (at least very briefly) to the ancient Russian cities.  Which of these make up this magnificent Ring?

    <p>  The city has a huge number of very valuable monuments.  For example, the Golden Gate is protected by UNESCO.  They were built in the XII century, in the XVII-XVIII centuries.  they were rebuilt.  There were seven entrance gates in the fortress, but only one survived to our time - the main ones.  Initially, they were covered with sheets of gilded copper.  Very powerful, with perfectly proportioned proportions, with a small church upstairs.  They were the main entrance to the princely part of Vladimir. </p><p>  Not in vain this city is included in the Golden Ring of Russia.  Vladimir delights everyone with his white-stone cathedrals.  The five-domed Assumption Cathedral contains frescoes by Andrei Rublev and Daniil Cherny, which were painted in 1408.  At the end of the XII century the Dmitrievsky one-domed cathedral was erected, which is known for its exquisite carvings on the facades.

The governor's house of the 17th century has been preserved in Vladimir.  Now here is the Center for Fine Arts. </p><h2>  Pereslavl-Zalessky </h2><p>  In ancient times, <span>the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãof Pereslavl was located on <span>the Trubezh River</span> .  When the Russian pioneers began to develop territories located near the Volga River, another city with the same name appeared.

The founder of the city is considered Yuri Dolgoruky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cities in the golden ring of Russia" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/869202.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Well, we are going to Rostov the Great, which is located in the Yaroslavl region.  In The Tale of Bygone Years, one of the oldest Russian chronicles, there is a record about this city dating back to 862.  It says that the city was owned by Rurik. </p><p>  Experts unite ancient cities in the central part of our country in the Golden Ring of Russia.  Rostov the Great, in their opinion, is a "precious stone" in it.  Many lovers of antiquity know the architectural monuments of this amazing city.  First of all, this, of course, the famous Rostov Kremlin with its Bishops' Chambers, the belfry, which is famous for its thirteen domes of different weights.  For more than three centuries, people have been heard by the sound of these bells. </p><h2>  Rostov Kremlin </h2>

    <p>  It is located in the very center of the city.  The Kremlin was erected in 1683 under Metropolitan Ion Sysoevich and became his residence.  At that time, the era of such structures was already ending.  After the residence was transferred to <span>Yaroslavl, the Kremlin</span> lost its significance and dilapidated.  In the XIX century, the local merchants raised funds and restored the temples. </p><p>  For anyone interested in the Golden Ring of Russia, Rostov with its extraordinary sights is especially important. </p><p>  The Rostov Kremlin has many architectural monuments, but the most significant of them is the Assumption Cathedral.  It very much resembles the Moscow Assumption Cathedral of the same name.  This is a monumental five-domed structure.  Its height (with a cross) is 60 m. It is made of brick, and the base is made of white stone.  The building is distinguished by numerous decorative elements: arcature-columnar belts, <span>horizontal rods,</span> panels, etc. All this gives the appearance of the temple an unusual plastic expressiveness, stability and beauty today. </p><h2>  Ivanovo </h2><p>  Before the revolution of 1917, this city was called Ivanovo-Voznesensky.  Weaving factories that were built in the nineteenth century still work here.  Ivanovo-Ascension weavers became famous for their revolutionary moods.  Therefore, there are many monuments dedicated to this time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ivanovo gold ring of Russia" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/869200.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is worthy of the Ivanovo Golden Ring of Russia.  The city has many long-standing buildings.  In its historical center are merchant houses of the XIX century.  Of great interest to tourists is the <span>Shchudrovskaya tent,</span> built in the 17th century, as well as the Holy Vvedensky monastery, which dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. </p>
