Life without loans in the bank is sometimes impossible: a young family wants to arrange their life, but there are no savings yet.  And where to get the money to pay for expensive treatment if a disease suddenly occurs?  A VTB 24 consumer loan can help.  About how convenient conditions and attractive interest rates are offered today to customers by this financial institution, we will discuss further. </p><h2>  Basic concepts and conditions of this product of the bank </h2><p>  Since January 2018, VTB 24 has been merged with VTB Bank with the liquidation of the legal entity and brand. </p><p>  This institution is today one of the largest in Russia.  In its development, it competes with Sberbank, is considered the second in the country in terms of assets, and in addition, in terms of equity.  In the line of consumer loans in cash, today he has several varieties of services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ysia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cash loan in vtb 24" class="if uuid-3167843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3167843.jpg"></div><p>  Citizens who have permanent registration in the region in which the bank has a branch, that is, virtually absolutely throughout Russia, will be able to get loans from this bank.  Currently, this organization does not impose strict requirements on age, as well as on the working experience of borrowers.  Nevertheless, this is taken into account in the consideration of the application and bidding.  So, for example, individuals who work without a job or contract can only submit cash applications for a limited amount of up to half a million rubles.  If you apply above this figure, you must officially receive a confirmation of employment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A statement of income is provided indicating salaries for the last six months.  In the event that the experience in the current place is less than six months, then a certificate is provided for the actual period of employment.  And entrepreneurs do not receive VTB consumer credit at all. </p><p>  Let us further consider on what terms, and in addition, at what rates today you can take cash loans in the bank in question. </p><p>  A cash loan is credited to VTB 24 to an account or to a credit card.  There are two ways to get borrowed funds in Russia: by withdrawing cash and by crediting directly to the card.  When crediting money to the card, the bank's client receives additional benefits: it can use the allocated credit limit for up to 50 days without paying interest and only after exceeding this period he will be charged interest on the outstanding balance;  receives bonuses in stores when paying by card, which are then transferred to money and credited to the client‚Äôs account. </p><h2>  Programs: loan for individuals </h2><p>  A cash loan at VTB 24 involves receiving cash at minimum rates.  This is the basic conditions on which funds in the bank can literally get "customers from the street."  The conditions are as follows: the period is up to five years, and the amount ranges from one hundred thousand to three million rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.realdetroitweekly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB 24 physical cash loan" class="if uuid-3167847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3167847.jpg"></div><p>  As for interest rates, they are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  From one hundred thousand to half a million rubles with insurance - we are talking about 11.7%, and without it - from 1 3% to 19.9%. </li><li>  From half a million to three with insurance - 10.9%, without it, as in the previous case. </li></ul><p>  It is planned to lower the rate to 7.9% in relation to those who use actively credit "Multicard" with the option called "Borrower". </p><h2>  Program for payroll clients and interest rates </h2><p>  This cash loan at VTB 24 is issued to individuals who receive salaries in their account.  The holders of plastic of this financial organization do not get much interest in interest today, but they can take a loan for a large amount.  The conditions will be as follows: term - up to seven years, and the amount - from one hundred thousand to five million.  Interest rate: </p><ul><li>  With a sum of one hundred thousand to half a million with insurance, we are talking about 11.7%, and without it, from 13% to 19.9%. </li><li>  From half a million to five with insurance - 10.9%, without it, as in the previous case. </li></ul><p>  In this case, similar to loans for individuals, a rate reduction to 7.9% is provided for those who actively use a credit "Multicard" with an option called "Borrower". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hrpayrollsystems.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB 24 to take a cash loan" class="if uuid-3167850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3167850.jpg"></div><h2>  How can I lower the loan interest rate to 7.9%? </h2><p>  Today, customers of the bank in question have the opportunity to reduce interest on consumer loans in cash.  To do this, you need to issue a "Multicard" and spend a certain amount per month on it.  Make it simple: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Getting a credit "Multicard" with an interest-free period equal to 101 days. </li><li>  Connecting an option called ‚ÄúBorrower‚Äù on the Internet or by phone. </li><li>  Calculation of plastic and savings on loan payments. </li></ul><p>  This works according to this principle: for example, a month a person spends 75 thousand rubles on purchases on the "Multicard".  As a result, the loan rate is reduced by three percentage points, that is, directly to 7.9% per annum.  Accordingly, the size of the monthly payment is also reduced. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  The amount of purchases per month on the card at the expense of credit money </p></td><td><p>  Loan rate discount provided </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  From five to fifteen thousand rubles </p></td><td><p>  0.5% </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Fifteen to seventy five thousand </p></td><td><p>  1 % </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  From seventy five thousand rubles </p></td><td><p>  3% </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  In this case, the payment schedule for the loan does not change.  The client pays with a card, and the financial institution recounts the rate every month.  And then returns the difference to the plastic until the end of the next month.  The discount can reach three percent, but not more than five thousand rubles a month. </p><h2>  Cash loan for senior citizens: interest rates and conditions </h2><p>  In the beginning of 2019 even pensioners can get a cash loan at VTB 24 for individuals in the beginning of 2019.  The main thing is that their age at the time of loan repayment is no more than seventy years.  But it is worth saying that, unlike Sberbank, unfortunately did not provide for concessions in the rates for pensioners in this organization.  This year, older people receive money on a common basis. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.executivechronicles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB 24 individuals cash loan" class="if uuid-3167846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3167846.jpg"></div><p>  Let‚Äôs figure out how to get a cash loan at VTB 24. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instructions and applying for a loan at this bank </h2><p>  Cash loans for individuals at VTB are issued in just one visit.  To do this, you must first submit an application in a manner convenient for the client: </p><ul><li>  Online notification of intention to take a loan on the bank's website. </li><li>  Call managers at the Call Center and apply by phone. </li><li>  Applying for a cash loan to any VTB branch with all the necessary documentation and obtaining prior consent. </li></ul><p>  Filling out a cash loan application at VTB 24 is quite simple.  The decision on the provision of loans to individuals is usually made within one to three business days: </p><ul><li>  In the event that the application was filed remotely (on the official website or by phone), then to transfer money you must contact the bank office with all the documents after receiving the appropriate notice (SMS or call) about the availability of a positive decision. </li><li>  When an application is submitted at the bank‚Äôs office, the funds are transferred automatically to the client‚Äôs account on the third business day, subject to a positive final decision. </li></ul><p>  As for salary clients, the decision with the issue of a loan to them can be carried out immediately as part of a visit to the bank office. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.loansolutions.ph" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB 24 apply for cash loan" class="if uuid-3167845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3167845.jpg"></div><h2>  Who will be able to get a loan for individuals? </h2><p>  Who can apply for a loan at VTB 24 in cash? </p><p>  The Bank has fairly simple requirements for all potential borrowers: </p><ul><li>  The presence of citizenship of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  The fact of permanent registration in any region where the relevant financial institution is located. </li><li>  Proof of permanent source of income </li><li>  The average monthly yield of at least fifteen thousand rubles. </li></ul><h2>  Passport loan processing </h2><p>  In order to get cash consumer credit in this bank, you must provide the following documentation: </p><ul><li>  Presentation of a passport. </li><li>  Providing a certificate that will confirm the official income for six months. </li><li>  Copy of SNILS. </li><li>  Presentation of the work book for the requested amount of half a million rubles. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that SNILS is also required for salary clients to obtain a cash loan at VTB 24.  Those customers who work without labor or contract will be able to apply for a loan.  However, as already noted earlier, the amount in this case will be limited to a maximum of five hundred thousand rubles.  For applications above this figure, official confirmation of the fact of employment will be required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nerdwallet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB 24 conditions" class="if uuid-3167849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3167849.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  The terms of the cash loan at VTB 24 are simple and understandable to everyone. </p><p>  In the event that the borrower has difficulty repaying the loan at this financial institution, he will be able to lower the amount or move the date to make the next payment.  For these purposes, you just need to connect additional services as part of the design. </p><h2>  Preferential payment </h2><p>  It is worth connecting this service when applying for a loan.  This will certainly allow to reduce the size of the first payments, which will consist solely of interest on the loan without the main debt.  The service is provided free of charge as part of a loan. </p><h2>  Credit vacation </h2><p>  Bank employees recommend using a service called ‚ÄúCredit Vacations‚Äù.  It allows you to skip one planned payment every six months (no earlier than six months from the date of loan issuance and no later than three months before the loan is completed) for the duration of the contract.  Missed payment is shifted to the next period with a simultaneous increase in the loan term. </p><p>  The service is connected for free at registration.  But to activate it (to skip the payment), you need to contact the call center or the VTB office at any time, except for the date of the monthly payment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hlb.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB 24 cash loan application" class="if uuid-3167844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3167844.jpg"></div><h2>  Cash loans at VTB 24 without references </h2><p>  The conditions for lending without a certificate, which are currently in force at this financial institution, are designed only for participants in the military mortgage and salary projects who can receive loans in cash only by passport.  Other categories of customers without fail confirm their actual income. </p><h2>  Features of cash loans </h2><p>  A cash loan is very convenient for individuals at VTB 24.  Cash is transferred to customer accounts that are tied to plastic cards.  With the help of plastic, all calculations are carried out, from receipt of finance to replenishment on payment days.  You can spend a credit resource for any purpose; confirmation of the targeted use of money is not required.  Now we will figure out how the loan debt is repaid. </p><h2>  How can I pay off a debt? </h2><p>  Contributions as part of the payment of the principal and interest on loans are transferred each month, which is carried out in equal installments, directly on the day of payment, and preferably two or three days before it.  The translation methods are as follows: </p><ul><li>  You can pay money to the cashier. </li><li>  By using ATMs with cash-in function. </li><li>  By transferring from a payroll card. </li><li>  Through an online bank without writing off a commission. </li></ul><p>  In that case, if you make a transfer from plastic to another bank or pay through a terminal of a system that is not related to VTB, then a fee is charged.  If necessary, you can skip the next payment using the previously mentioned service called ‚Äúcredit vacation‚Äù.  Next, we will get acquainted with the comments of the clients of the bank in question who share their opinions about it. </p><h2>  Cash loan reviews at VTB 24 </h2><p>  Today, many people prefer to issue a loan not at Sberbank, but at VTB.  Customers like the loan programs offered by this financial institution.  In particular, salary clients are satisfied, as in relation to their service is executed without unnecessary documents and on more favorable terms. </p><p>  As for interest rates, people write about them that they are far from the most profitable in comparison with other competing companies.  But many note the reliability of this bank and therefore it is VTB 24 that is preferred.  Cash loan is popular here. </p>
