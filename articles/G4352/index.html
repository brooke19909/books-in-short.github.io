    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  As noted above, the city of Aachen (Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands) is located on the border of the three European states.  On its outskirts there is even a symbolic column belonging simultaneously to these three countries.  The first settlement on this site appeared in the Roman era.  About two thousand years ago, mineral springs located here were attracted to people.  Currently, the local population is just over 260 thousand inhabitants.  It should be noted that here is the center of the coal basin.  Aachen is usually divided into the old inner and the new outer city.  Local attractions annually attract millions of tourists from all over the world.  About them in more detail and will be discussed later. </p><h2>  First treasure </h2><p>  Although Aachen (Germany) never wore the status of the capital of the state, it still played a very important role, especially under Charlemagne.  When he became emperor, the construction of a huge palace complex, the area of ​​which was more than twenty hectares, was completed here.  It is considered one of the oldest pilgrimage sites in Aachen.  Karl played a very important role in the history of the city and performed many glorious deeds for his good, so the locals greatly honor him.  Here, in the chapel, he is buried.  Starting from 936, all German rulers were crowned precisely in the territory of this complex.  A person who did not go through this procedure here did not have the right to receive the imperial crown from the hands of the Pope. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aachen Attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/912173.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Chapel </h2><p>  The chapel in Aachen began to be erected according to the idea of ​​Charlemagne in 796 by the architect Odon Metz.  Eight years later, she was consecrated by Pope Leo the Third.  Later, the temple repeatedly expanded and changed.  This process lasted until the eighteenth century.  In its lower part there is a square, which is a symbol of the material circle and meaning the number 4. The round part of the chapel symbolizes the Holy Trinity and the number 3. Thus, a magical “seven” is formed in the bag, which provides a good spiritual and material life.  In the upper part there is also an octagon, which inverted form symbolizes infinity and spiritual harmony.  Due to the fact that the temple was completed after the Romanesque period, its external style is Gothic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chapel in aachen" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/912176.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  She-wolf </h2><p>  It is believed that the bronze she-wolf at the entrance to the temple was brought by Charles to his residence from Rome.  Along with this, in historical documents she is remembered only in 1414.  The hole on the beast’s chest suggests that the she-wolf was once used as part of the fountain.  In addition, in the nineteenth century, under unknown circumstances, the left paw was damaged, which was replaced by local sculptors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Aachen cone </h2><p>  The next interesting attraction that the city of Aachen boasts is a bronze cone, whose age exceeds the mark of one millennium.  It is cast as a separate solid item and has an alloy base.  On a cone in nine rows, 129 metal flakes are located.  On each of them there are small holes, therefore, most likely, it was created as a fountain.  It should be noted that in antiquity, as well as in the Middle Ages, such sculptures were common decorations in Byzantine cities. </p><h2>  Town Hall </h2><p>  Not far from the Chapel is the Town Hall, built at the beginning of the fourteenth century.  Its northern facade is decorated with statues of 50 rulers of the country, as well as emperors who came to the coronation in the city of Aachen.  Germany, as already noted above, owes much to Karl the Great, therefore it is not surprising that in front of the building in 1620 his monument was erected.  In the history of its existence, the Town Hall burned several times, but it was constantly rebuilt.  The last time this happened was at the end of the nineteenth century.  Now a museum is functioning on the territory of the building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aachen city" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/913759.jpg" width="516"></div>

    <h2>  Completion </h2><p>  These are just some of the famous historical monuments that German Aachen boasts.  Sights of this city attract pilgrims from all over the world.  In addition to the above-mentioned interesting places, it is also worth noting the church of Peter and Mary, Panikadilo Barbarossa, Cancer of Charlemagne, Cancer of the Virgin Mary and many others.  Be that as it may, the city is also famous for its thermal healing springs, first discovered by the Celts a century before the birth of Christ.  They are the hottest in all of Western Europe, and the temperature here ranges from 37 to 77 degrees Celsius. </p><p>  To summarize, we can confidently call Aachen an ideal place to relax.  If in the area of ​​the Town Hall and the Chapel the tourist life is boiling, then in the quiet, deserted streets you can enjoy incredible silence accompanied by a glass of German beer and see the real life of this city. </p>
