In addition to our hero, the parents of the future chemist had seventeen more children.  However, eight of them died at an early age.  Dima began his studies at the gymnasium of his native city.  After her graduation, he enters St. Petersburg University at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics.  At twenty-one, the young man graduates from university, having been awarded a <span>gold medal</span> for academic excellence.

    <h3>  Biography of Mendeleev: the beginning of a career </h3><p>  After graduation, Mendeleev did not immediately begin to study chemistry closely.  For some time the young man is trying to prove himself in literary work.  Actually, this was facilitated by the golden era of Russian poetry itself, in which he happened to live.  In parallel, he was engaged in private teaching.  But soon, due to problems with his own health, Dmitry Ivanovich had to move to Odessa.  In this southern city, he takes a job as a teacher in a gymnasium, held at the Richelieu Lyceum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  However, a year later, Mendeleev returned to the capital, where he defended his master's thesis, which gave him the right to take a course in organic chemistry at Alma mater.  In 1859, a young scientist was sent for a two-year internship in the German city of Heidelberg.  Upon his return to Russia, Dmitry Ivanovich wrote the first <span>ever domestic</span> textbook on organic chemistry. </p><h3>  Mendeleev's biography: heyday of activity and recognition </h3><p>  A fairly young scientist at that time in 1865 defended <span>his doctoral dissertation.</span>  In this work, the foundations of a new approach to the study of organic solutions were already laid.  After defense, he holds the position of professor at St. Petersburg University.  At the same time gives lectures in several other metropolitan universities.  In the same 1865, Mendeleev acquired the estate in the small settlement of Boblovo, located in the Moscow province.  There he is very enthusiastic about undertaking research in the field of agricultural chemistry and agriculture. </p>

    <p>  In 1869, Dmitry Ivanovich made the same scientific discovery, thanks to which he is known today in Russia and in the rest of the world - for the first time he was able to formulate and organize a periodic table of chemical elements.  Two years later, in 1871, the monograph ‚ÄúFundamentals of Chemistry‚Äù later became a classic monograph.  In subsequent years, Dmitry Ivanovich was engaged in teaching and scientific research, which is so rich in his biography.  In 1880, Mendeleev was nominated to the academics, but the candidacy did not pass.  This event caused a storm of indignation in society.  Dmitry Ivanovich left the scientific department of the university, where he worked for more than thirty years, in 1890 in protest against the massive oppression of students' rights and freedoms. </p><h3>  Dmitry Mendeleev.  Biography: recent years </h3><p>  At sunset, a recognized scientist worked for some time as a consultant in the Ministry of the Sea.  Later, he even became the organizer of the first chamber of measures and weights in the history of Russia, as well as its first director.  It was here that he worked until his death.  The famous Russian scientist died on February 2, 1907. </p>
