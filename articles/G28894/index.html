Therefore, quite often, buyers are interested in reviews about a particular device model.  And now we will find out what LG Magna is.  Everyone can leave feedback on this model.  But opinions about the device, to be honest, have developed quite mixed.  It‚Äôs quite difficult to say so directly whether a smartphone is of high quality or not.  Let's try to deal with the task. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg magna review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116188.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Manufacturer </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth paying attention to such a moment as the production of a gadget.  It‚Äôs no secret that some companies create good phones, and some do not.  Therefore, <span>LG Magna, the reviews</span> of which are presented in the article, in this regard is considered not the best option for purchase. </p><p>  Why is this happening?  The fact is that LG produces excellent household appliances and equipment.  But if we talk about smartphones, then here the quality is much inferior.  Button models were still considered very good.  But modern smartphones - not really.  And it repels some.  However, if you prefer to trust LG, you can buy a model without remorse.  Judging a device by manufacturer only is <span>a stereotype.</span>  And rely on him is not particularly worth it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen sizes </h2><p>  The rest is to evaluate the gadget by its characteristics.  Let's start with a rather important point for any smartphone - this is <span>the screen size.</span>  LG Magna Gold reviews in this regard are earning pretty good.  After all, the screen resolution of the device is 1280 by 720 pixels.  This is an extremely high rate. </p><p>  But the diagonal is not entirely happy.  She is 5 inches.  In principle, this is enough for games, and for reading books, and for Internet surfing.  But if you only need a gaming gadget, then LG Magna will not work.  In general, buyers have no complaints about the size of the screen and its diagonal.  This is an average for most phones. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The LG H502F Magna is also gaining positive reviews for its operating system.  It's no secret that this moment plays an important role when buying a modern smartphone.  Depending on the operating system, you may or may not be able to run a variety of games, programs and applications.  So, this moment should be given special attention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg magna gold reviews" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116189.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What do we get with LG Magna?  Modern smartphone based on the Android OS.  By the way, the version is almost the newest - 5.0.  Some buyers still express their dissatisfaction with this phenomenon.  For Android 5.0, so far there haven‚Äôt been so many different games and applications.  You need to be patient to wait for really useful software.  Therefore, as practice shows, some try to choose models of smartphones with Android 4.4.  But those who are used to keeping up with the times assure: LG Magna is a great choice for work, study and entertainment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  LG Magna Gold receives feedback on its quality of work for its processor.  To be honest, here there are no special complaints.  We can say that the model of the phone meets modern specifications.  In our case, we will be dealing with a smartphone equipped with a processor with a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz.  For games and powerful applications, this is enough. </p><p>  Do not forget about such a point as the number of cores.  In our case, there are 4. In total, a processor with a capacity of 5.2 GHz is obtained.  This fact causes joy from buyers.  Modern smartphones just fall under these figures. </p><p>  If we talk about the quality of the processor, then you can compare LG Magna, the reviews of which are useful to study before buying, with the Samsung Galaxy S5.  In some cases, <span>"JG"</span> is faster and better than Samsung.  So, you can trust this device. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The next important characteristic that excites buyers is memory.  We are talking about operational and built-in.  Depending on these indicators, a decision is often made to purchase a model.  How are things with our gadget today? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg h502f magna gold reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116190.jpg"></div>

    <p>  LG H502F Magna Gold reviews earns average for RAM.  Not too good, but not terrible.  The thing is that the device has only 1 GB of RAM.  By modern standards, this is not enough.  Especially if you are going to use the gadget as a gaming device.  But, given the processor power, you can close your eyes to this drawback. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Judging by the built-in memory, the LG Magna H502 Titan gets good reviews.  After all, the device has 8 GB of space.  As a rule, 1.5 of them are occupied by the operating system.  At the disposal of the user is about 6.5 GB.  Not very much, but enough for system requests. </p><p>  After all, LG Magna has the opportunity that they are trying to clean up in modern smartphones.  It's about connecting an additional memory card.  The maximum allowable capacity is 128 GB.  And with all this, the card format should be microSD.  For this, LG Magna gets pretty good customer reviews.  After all, you can not worry about the fact that you do not have enough space for personal data or some documents.  However, it is better not to fill all 128 GB of memory completely.  Customers are advised to leave at least 2 GB empty.  Otherwise, the device starts to get out of control. </p><h2>  Dimensions and Weight </h2><p>  For some, the size of the gadget, as well as its weight, play an important role.  And in this sense, the LG Magna Y90 H502 reviews are positive.  It should immediately be said that this smartphone is not compact.  But bulky too. </p><p>  The size of the gadget is 140x70x10.1 mm.  It turns out that this phone will also be quite thick.  Slightly smaller than the same Sony Experia.  But this is not so critical.  The gadget weighs 136 grams.  By modern standards, it is believed that this is a pretty weighty smartphone.  Nevertheless, this does not deter buyers.  As some say, LG Magna is not a "shovel", but it is felt in your pocket.  Losing such a phone in a bag or pocket is difficult.  This is a significant advantage over analogues.  You will always know what gadget you have with you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg magna h502 titan reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116191.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Of course, now it‚Äôs hard to imagine a phone in which there is no camera.  And this gadget is used very often as a camera.  So it‚Äôs worthwhile to figure out which LG Magna H502F phone reviews from consumers earn in this sense.  Maybe this is a great device for shooting? </p><p>  Indeed, it is.  Buyers repeatedly emphasize the quality of the camera on the LG Magna gadget.  By the way, there are two of them.  There is a rear and front.  The first shoots with a quality of 8 megapixels.  And the second takes pictures of 5 megapixels.  These are high rates. </p><p>  All images and videos are sharp, vibrant and vibrant.  The phone has a flash (including automatic) and autofocus.  Customers also say that when shooting, you can turn on face recognition.  A very useful feature that allows you to get high quality pictures.  Just what modern buyers need so much. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Do not forget about such a component as the phone‚Äôs battery.  Most modern smartphones repel buyers with just a short battery life.  And it is really very unpleasant.  Fortunately, the LG Magna H502 phone gets good reviews about its work in this regard. </p><p>  Firstly, when buying this smartphone, we get a removable battery.  This allows for the slightest breakdown or quickly replace a component or repair an old one.  You will not need to give your gadget to a service center for repairs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="g magna customer reviews" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116192.jpg" width="600"></div>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  Secondly, the battery power is 2540 mAh.  This is more than modern manufacturers can offer.  In addition, the average battery life of a phone is about a week.  This is subject to daily active use.  If the smartphone is in standby mode, then it can lie about one and a half months. </p><p>  Thirdly, it takes only 1.5 hours to fully charge the LG Magna battery.  If you recharge the smartphone before the indicator drops to 0%, the battery will not deteriorate.  That's what they say for those who have been using this gadget for a long time. </p><h2>  Test Drive </h2><p>  Phone LG Magna H502F also receives reviews for its "indestructibility."  Most modern smartphones pass the so-called test drive.  Or, as it can still be interpreted, a survivability test.  What do people say in this sense about our current device? </p><p>  Everything is not so bad as it might seem at first glance.  LG Magna is a phone that does not crash when dropped even from a great height.  If you drop the gadget from approximately the 5th-6th floor onto the asphalt, you will only have small scratches on the case.  But no more than that. </p><p>  But the smartphone is more sensitive to moisture.  With a high degree of probability, after LG Magna falls into the bathroom or when a large amount of water gets on it, you will have to take the device to a service center.  Or at least quickly dry all the components of the gadget yourself.  Indeed, otherwise you will not only be unable to control your phone anymore, but the speakers will work terribly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg magna y90 h502 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116193.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In the cold, working with LG Magna is not recommended.  The sensor refuses to work with large frosts.  You should not be surprised at this: it is quite normal for a modern phone.  In general, we can say that "Al Magna" is a fairly high-quality model of the smartphone, ideal for work and study. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The price tag on the product also directly affects its rating.  Especially when it comes to phones.  Smartphone LG Magna H502F White gets pretty positive reviews for its price.  On average, this gadget will cost the buyer 12,000 rubles.  Not very expensive, given the characteristics of the device. </p><p>  Yes, budget LG Magna can not be called.  Nevertheless, this is a great gaming device, as well as a technique that allows you to work and learn without any problems.  Compared to peers, the differences between "Al J" are small.  On average, a similar smartphone costs from 11 to 15 thousand rubles, depending on the manufacturer.  As you can see, the difference is not so critical.  You can be sure that you do not overpay for the phone. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  But the device also has drawbacks.  In addition to those that have already been listed.  They are not critical, but some buyers are indignant.  What you should pay attention to? </p><p>  For example, LG Magna quite often encounters a marriage of GRS.  If you are actively using interactive cards, then use this smartphone with caution.  In every tenth case, consumers suffer from numerous malfunctions and failures. </p><p>  In addition, reviews emphasize the enormous cost of original phone accessories.  Not critical, but still not very happy.  Have to either give a lot of money for original accessories, or use a fake. </p><p>  Wireless connectivity at LG Magna works, according to customers, through time.  That is, it is worth turning on Wi-Fi, as it starts to turn on and off on its own with some frequency.  It‚Äôs almost impossible to work this way on the Internet.  This failure is observed in many, but inconsistently.  And there is no way to get rid of it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone lg magna h502 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116194.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If you work in silent mode, you will hear some creaking sound from the speakers.  The manufacturer explains this phenomenon as a feature of LG Magna.  No need to be scared. </p><p>  If you do not turn off your smartphone at least once a week, it will ‚Äúglitch‚Äù and ‚Äúslow down‚Äù.  Some of these behavior scare. </p><p>  As you can see, LG Magna is generally a good solution for people who keep up with the times.  Of course, with its shortcomings.  But ideal smartphones have not yet been invented. </p>
