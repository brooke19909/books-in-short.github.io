Island Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Russky Island <span>in the Primorsky Territory</span> has long been a favorite destination for tourists from Vladivostok and other cities.  It is located in the Gulf of Peter the Great and is part of the archipelago of Empress Eugenia.  About rest on the Russian island in the Primorsky Territory is described in this article. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="42.9985805" data-lng="131.84358700000007" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/6/8/8/7688.png"></div><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  The Russian island of the Primorsky Territory became part of Russia in the second half of the 19th century.  The name was given to him by Count Muravyov-Amursky.  There is another version according to which the island is named after Russian researchers. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  In the sixties of the XIX century, both military and civilians lived on the island.  The latter were mainly engaged in truck farming.  By the end of the century, the number of inhabitants reached three thousand. </p><p>  In 1897, a wooden church was built on the island, which, of course, has not survived to this day.  At the beginning of the XX century a cemetery appeared here.  And a year before the revolution, a post office was already operating on the Russky Island in the Primorsky Territory. </p><p>  After the Russo-Japanese War, large-scale construction of fortifications began in Vladivostok and its environs.  Six forts and more than twenty coastal batteries appeared on the island.  Some buildings have been preserved.  Today they are the sights of the Russian island in the Primorsky Territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ribalych.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian coastal region" class="if uuid-2735884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2735884.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the fortress was completed in 1922.  And then an agreement was concluded between the Soviet Union and Japan.  As a result of this agreement, the Japanese left Primorye, and the fortress was closed. </p><p>  In 1908, an observation station appeared here, designed to protect residents of Vladivostok from cholera, plague and other diseases.  On the Russian island in the Primorsky Territory during the First World War, there was a disciplinary battalion. </p><p>  In the Soviet years, there were several military camps.  For a long time the island was a closed zone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ribalych.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian island Vladivostok" class="if uuid-2735885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2735885.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In the thirties on the island they installed a coastal battery named after Voroshilov.  This is one of the local attractions.  Where military camps were located in the Soviet years, today there are the most popular <span>recreation centers in the Primorsky Territory.</span>  From Vladivostok to Russky Island only 45 km.  Since this is a popular tourist destination, today you can see not only the remains of the military past. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="topwar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Voroshilov battery" class="if uuid-2735887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2735887.jpg"></div><p>  In 2016, an oceanarium was opened on the island.  It is located at: Academician Kasyanov Street, 25. The building in which it is located resembles a huge sea shell.  On its territory more than 130 aquariums of various sizes.  The cost of a ticket to the Primorsky Oceanarium for an adult is 1000 rubles.  For a child - 500 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turist-dv.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Island Russian Aquarium" class="if uuid-2735888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2735888.jpg"></div><p>  Every year, the island hosts a festival of contemporary art.  It is attended by artists, sculptors, musicians, artists of the Primorsky Territory.  This festival is called "Russian Island Labyrinths". </p><p>  Skrypleva Lighthouse is the oldest of such structures in Primorye.  It is named after the commander of the corvette Novik.  The first lighthouse appeared here in 1877.  But he was made of wood.  A more solid structure was erected in 1880.  The height of the lighthouse is 52 meters.  It is located on a hill in the rocky part of the island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="batona.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Island Russian lighthouse" class="if uuid-2735886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2735886.jpg"></div><p>  The village of Pospelovo is located in the eastern part of the Russian.  In Soviet times, ammunition and artillery equipment were stored here. </p><p>  The largest river in the Primorsky Territory is the Russian.  Its length is five kilometers.  The river originates in the mountainous part of the island and flows into the Voevoda Bay. </p><p>  The influx of tourists to Russky Island increased significantly in 2012.  It was then that the bridge connecting it with Vladivostok was commissioned.  Today, from the city to the island can be reached in just twenty minutes.  Previously, the island was accessible only by ferry, and this method took much more time. </p><p>  Holy Seraphim Monastery was founded in 2001.  This is the only monastery in the Far East.  In 2006, a refectory and several utility rooms were built on the territory of the monastery. </p><p>  Russian Fort is another of the island's attractions.  The construction is located on the highest mountain.  Once this fort played a key role in the defense of Vladivostok.  Today it is one of the most visited places - it offers excellent views of the island. </p><h2>  Recreation facilities </h2><p>  Almost every year new hotels appear on the island.  These places are suitable for fans of an active lifestyle, and those who prefer a quiet family vacation. </p><p>  "Fisherman's Rest House" is a recreation center located in Rynda Bay.  It offers small wooden houses near the beach.  The recreation center is open only in summer. </p><p>  The White Swan is open year round.  On the territory of the recreation center are a mud bath, massage room, banquet hall.  There is a parking lot. </p><p>  Other <span>recreation centers on Russky Island:</span> "At Cape Ivantseva", "American", "Surf", "Renaissance". </p><div class="photo" data-original="shamora.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation centers in Russian" class="if uuid-2736047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2736047.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Almost everyone who visited the Russian island, left a positive impression.  According to reviews, you can swim here from June to the end of September.  Especially a lot of vacationers in August.  The only drawback of relaxing on Russky Island is the large number of tourists. </p>
