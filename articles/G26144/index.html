    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Each of the payment systems has a series of gold or platinum cards.  In Europe and the USA, their owners are wealthy and successful people, because registration is carried out only with proof of income of a sufficient level.  Card service really costs a pretty penny, but at the same time, services are provided that are very useful to a businessman.  In Russia, any interested citizen can issue a debit MasterCard Gold.  Sometimes they purchase this <span>banking product</span> not only for work or travel, but also to emphasize their status.  Any premium card is a kind of part of the image of a successful person. </p><p>  What is so enticing "golden" credit cards?  Gold type product of any payment system guarantees high quality service and maximum useful services.  The user will find pleasant bonuses and discounts, participation in discount programs, an increased limit on cash withdrawals, free medical insurance in foreign countries.  In each bank, the premium card holder will be a privileged customer. </p><h2>  Types of Plastic Cards </h2><p>  There are a lot of payment systems, as well as the products they offer, but the main difference between them is the type of bank card: debit, credit or overdraft.  Let's consider each of them separately. </p><p>  <span>A debit card</span> allows the holder to manage funds held in a bank account tied to it.  Money can be transferred to it by third parties or by the holder.  For example, most organizations transfer salaries to a bank account.  The employee draws up a debit card, with which he receives the calculation.  Service fee is charged once a year.  Its size depends on the type of card and the issuing bank.  An adult citizen can apply for a card upon presentation of a passport.  At the same time, it is possible to link an existing bank account to it or create a new one.  The owner can dispose of the funds already on the day of the application for opening an account / issuing a card.  And getting the latter takes about a week or two. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__5c2"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__5c2"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__5c2"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__5c2"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__5c2"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A credit card allows you to use bank funds by loan on certain conditions.  It can only store borrowed money.  Getting a credit card is a bit more complicated than a debit card.  To do this, it is necessary to confirm the solvency of the applicant by providing relevant certificates (about income, from the place of work, about pension contributions).  This is a very convenient way of lending: you do not need to constantly run to the bank and wait for the execution of the contract for a particular purchase.  Having issued it once, you can use the funds until the end of the limit. </p><p>  There is also a combined plastic card with overdraft, which is also called credit in Russian banking practice.  However, it is debit, but with the possibility of using borrowed funds.  Initially, the user's money is stored on the card.  If there is not enough money for the holder when making a purchase, the missing amount will automatically be withdrawn from the bank account.  Overdraft has a limit. </p><p>  A MasterCard Gold card can be issued in any of the above types.  Moreover, the limit on cash withdrawals and loan use for it is much higher than other banking products (Maestro, Standard). </p><h2>  MasterCard Products </h2><p>  To appreciate the offers on the MasterCard Gold card, you should familiarize yourself with other products of the payment system.  Among them are common: </p><ul><li>  Maestro, Electronic - the simplest cards, cheapest to maintain (150-300 rubles).  In this case, the surname and name of the owner are written, but not squeezed out on plastic.  With this card you can make any payments, except for Internet operations.  Often they are intended for beginners. </li><li>  Standard is one of the most common cards of the MasterCard system.  This is the best combination of services and cost of service.  Both debit and credit are issued.  There are Internet payments, a system of bonuses and discounts. </li><li>  World is a godsend for avid travelers.  A special service program provides for an insurance system, bonuses and discounts when paying for various services. </li><li>  World Black Edition - provides a special level of comfort.  Access to a private travelers club is provided to help organize trips to any country.  Concierge service is available. </li></ul><p>  Thus, MasterCard Gold is a cross between standard and high-end cards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  MasterCard Gold: Benefits </h2><p>  With MasterCard Gold, the user receives many privileges.  For example, a credit limit may be more than 300,000 p.  with a grace period (use of the amount without interest) 50 days.  The annual interest rate has also been reduced.
