A large territory of the city is located on the right elevated coast of the Volga, in the region of the <span>Cheboksary reservoir.</span>  It was formed during the construction of the hydroelectric power station, when some sections of the city were flooded.  As a result of this, a bay appeared - the favorite place of the urban population.  The left bank is covered with <span>pine forest.</span>  This area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city is used mainly for recreation.  Two shores are connected by five bridges.  In addition, there are many <span>interesting places.</span>  <span>Sights of</span> Cheboksary are cultural monuments, of which there are more than 90 items, 23 of them are of federal importance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of cheboksary" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/220271.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Cheboksary are one of the most comfortable cities in Russia.  Driving through the city, one cannot but notice that it is spacious, bright and clean.  Wide avenues, clean sidewalks and neat brand new buses are striking.  The central part of the city is decorated in a European style.  Moscow Avenue separates the modern part of the city from the historical.  The first is spread among the hills located around the bay.  The sights of Cheboksary in this part of the city include the presidential palace, the building of the Supreme Court that looks like a theater.  You can supplement the list with the building of the Chuvash Treasury, which is hidden under a <span>green roof.</span>  The building of the Government House does not particularly attract attention.  Even the fountains built in this part of the city have a strict shape and certain sizes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The sights of Cheboksary look completely different in the historical part of the city.  There are all kinds of attractions for both adults and children, bars and cafes, tents with souvenirs.  The main building is considered the monument of the Mother Patroness.  It is set on an ancient hill in the western part of the <span>Cheboksary Bay.</span>  The sculpture was made in the form of a woman in a national <span>Chuvash costume</span> with arms spread out to the side, this pose means hugs and blessings.  The opening of the monument took place in 2003.  Nearby is the Holy Trinity Monastery, founded in 1566. </p>

    <p>  The sights of Cheboksary in the historical part of the city can be supplemented with an equally interesting structure - the Church of the Assumption.  This is a three-altar church, the construction of which was carried out with the money of the Moscow merchant Dryablov.  Initially, the complex consisted of a main building, a bell tower, a porch, a stone chapel and a number of office rooms.  In 1930, all buildings were demolished.  Only the bell tower and the main building survived, which was subsequently converted into a museum of local lore. </p><p>  But this is not all the constructions for which Cheboksary is famous.  Attractions include such a magnificent structure as the Vvedensky Cathedral.  This is the oldest temple in Chuvashia, where the very first icon of the republic with the image of the Virgin of Our Lady is stored.  In the cathedral, you can now see unique murals.  Another value of this building is the iconostasis dated to the 17-18th century.  Among other interesting places of the city, Victory Park, located in the highest part of the city, can be noted.  In addition, in Cheboksary there are many monumental monuments and museums that deserve attention. </p>

    <p>  If someone thinks that after reading about the city and its most interesting places it can be considered quite studied - he is deeply mistaken.  No words can convey the true beauty that distinguishes Cheboksary.  Sights, photos of which are presented, cannot fully reflect the grandeur and beauty that every tourist feels, being in close proximity to these unique structures. </p>
