Among all the states located on the Indochina peninsula, the Khmer country is distinguished by its originality.  The history of Cambodia is the centuries-old stages of suffering and power, colonial enslavement and wealth, the horrors of revolution and famine.  How many trials, ups and downs have the Khmer suffered!  This people, without exaggeration, knows what grief and happiness are. </p><h2>  The beginning of the story </h2><p>  It is difficult to say from what moment the chronicle of the events of this state begins.  Briefly, the history of Cambodia, which has existed for more than ten millennia, cannot be retold.  But still try to consider the most significant events. </p><p>  So, the first mention of settlements on the territory of the modern Cambodian state dates back to the IV century BC.  According to various sources, the ancient Khmers engaged in agriculture, later learned to smel copper and bronze, and among the crafts, weaving was the most developed. </p><p>  In the first centuries of our era, Cambodia began to establish trade relations with India.  It was this country that played an important role in shaping the worldview of the Cambodians, their culture and religiosity.  The history of Cambodia of ancient times indicates that Hinduism first came here, and the inhabitants themselves spoke Sanskrit.  By the way, the name "Cambodia" has ancient Indian roots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sinhcafetravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="history of cambodia in the 20th century" class="if uuid-2466747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2466747.jpg"></div><h2>  Great state </h2><p>  The administrative-territorial structure of the Khmer state implied the presence of many small principalities, which began to unite only at the beginning of the 9th century.  Gradually, a single power was formed, the capital of which was the city of Angkor.  According to historians, the state had many names, among which the most often found in the sources are ‚ÄúCambujadesa‚Äù and ‚ÄúAngkor Kingdom‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over the next four centuries, the country developed steadily, and became the most powerful in Southeast Asia.  At that time, Cambodia included not only the lands of modern Khmers, but also the territories of Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, several regions of present-day Vietnam and Malaysia.  Then in the capital lived more than one million people.  For comparison, it is worth noting that in European cities the population hardly reached 50 thousand souls. </p><p>  The prosperity period of Cambodia is considered IX-XV centuries.  The inhabitants of a powerful, rich and happy country could not even imagine what fate was destined for their descendants.  The rapid rise and flowering gave way to no less rapid decline and centuries-old wanderings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cosianatour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="angkor wat cambodia history" class="if uuid-2466745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2466745.jpg"></div><h2>  Angkor Wat Temple </h2><p>  One of Cambodia's most famous attractions is Angkor Wat.  The history of this temple complex dedicated to the god Vishnu dates back to the first half of the 12th century.  Similarity with the name of the capital of the ancient state indicates the location of this religious structure.  The temple is located in the northern region of the Khmer city. </p><p>  Today the complex is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, but Angkor Wat in the history of Cambodia has not always been of value to Cambodians.  So, in the Middle Ages, the temple was practically not used, and later it was completely abandoned.  And only in the middle of the XIX century Angkor Wat was again opened by the French.  Today, the temple is not just a popular tourist attraction, but also a real symbol of the history of Cambodia.  Angkor is depicted on the national flag and coat of arms of the Khmers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="cambodiaflag.facts.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the history of the origin of money in cambodia" class="if uuid-2466746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2466746.jpg"></div><h2>  How it all started </h2><p>  The first security threat and the ‚Äúbells‚Äù of the war rang out for Cambodians back in the 14th century.  Then the Ayutthais, residents of the neighboring Thai state, began to encroach on the Khmer lands.  Ayutthaya confidently selected the land of the peaceful Cambodians, and in the 50s of the same century completely captured the capital of Angkor, partially destroying it.  Since then, for more than a hundred years, the "heart" of Cambodia has passed from one conqueror to another.  This went on until the final victory of the Thais, which forced the Khmers to move the capital to another city - Phnom Penh. </p><p>  But the problems of the Cambodians did not end there, but rather only began.  The Siamese (the so-called inhabitants of modern Thailand) still attacked peaceful settlements, taking away territories and expanding their borders.  In addition to the Thais, Vietnam began to take a closer look at the lands of Cambodia. </p><h2>  Cambodia - French colony </h2><p>  From the middle of the last millennium, blood did not stop shedding in these territories until the 19th century.  The former glory and power of the Angkor kingdom was forgotten.  From a huge, densely populated developing country, Cambodia has turned into a seedy province, whose inhabitants were on the verge of survival. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.matthewwilliams-ellis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cambodia country history" class="if uuid-2466754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2466754.jpg"></div><p>  A new stage in the history of Cambodia begins in 1863, when the <span>Cambodian king</span> Norod enlisted the support of Europeans.  In particular, the French provided weapons and soldiers, which made it possible to quickly push back the poorly equipped Siamese troops.  The French returned to the Khmer rule Ankor.  The history of Cambodia with centuries-old wars and battles, it would seem, has ended.  But if King Norod only knew what price Cambodia would have to pay for French help ... </p><p>  Victory cost too much.  In exchange for protection from the Siamese, the king had to sign an agreement according to which Cambodia lost its sovereignty and acquired the status of a French colony.  Establishing its rules on the new land, the metropolis carried out several fundamentally important reforms that establish restrictions on the rule of the king.  Now the Cambodian monarch was becoming just a controlled power unit, a kind of puppet, because he had to coordinate the adoption of a number of decisions with the ministers. </p><h2>  The benefits of coming France </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the French protectorate concentrated the main power in its hands, and this provoked waves of discontent and uprisings throughout the country, it should be noted that this period was very successful for colonial Cambodia.  Briefly about the history of the country and the benefits for its inhabitants we can say this: </p><ul><li>  territories conquered from the Siamese; </li><li>  lifelong slavery abolished; </li><li>  there has been an improvement in infrastructure, education and health systems. </li></ul><p>  Nevertheless, the Khmers were not ready to live under someone else's dictation.  Since the 30s of the last century, uprisings began to take place, mainly the proletarians fought for the independence of their country.  The protest movement turned out to be so strong that the French bourgeoisie had to make concessions.  So, for example, the Khmers achieved the right to be elected to the parliamentary chamber.  Previously, the French administration sent here only those managers whom they considered to be the most suitable from their point of view. </p><p>  During World War II, Cambodia was ruled by Japan, but after the surrender of the latter, the Angkor kingdom again came under the guardianship of France. </p><h2>  Long awaited independence </h2><p>  The colony government has implemented a number of effective reforms, the purpose of which was the speedy development of the economy.  The French established the National Bank in Cambodia.  The French also played an important role in the history of the origin of money: they introduced the first national currency.  In the mid-1950s, diplomatic relations were concluded with the Soviet Union. </p><p>  In 1966, a long-overdue indignation of the population degenerated into focal uprisings throughout Cambodia, as a result of which it moved to the right-wing organizations.  At the head of the protest movement was a general led by General Lon Nol.  The opposition was right-wing communists, who began to call themselves "Khmer Rouge" and form military units.  Looking ahead, it is worth noting that they will lead the country into decline and cause the greatest suffering of Cambodia in the history of the 20th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theculturetrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="history of cambodia since ancient times" class="if uuid-2466752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2466752.jpg"></div><h2>  America's role in the civil revolution </h2><p>  In the spring of 1970, a coup d'etat occurred, as a result of which the reigning prince Sihanouk was overthrown.  Power seized Lon Nol.  During the reign of General Cambodia, it became known as the Khmer Republic. </p><p>  However, the Communists, represented by members of the Khmer Rouge organization, did their utmost to return the monarch to the throne.  They quickly secured popular support, proclaiming ideas of equality and justice, promising to expel foreigners and create a Cambodian state only for the Khmers. </p><p>  To fight the partisan movement, Lon Nol asked the United States for help.  At that time, <span>America fought with Vietnam.</span>  Troops invaded Cambodia, supporting government operations on land and in the air.  But, despite the military assistance of the Americans, the Khmer Rouge won and in April 1975 occupied Phnom Penh. </p><h2>  Pol Pot Mode </h2><p>  People greeted the Khmer Rouge with sincere warmth and hope for a brighter future.  But all of a sudden, an order was announced on the loudspeakers to all residents of the capital to leave the city.  The people were deceived. </p><p>  This was the real policy of Pol Pot - the leader of the rebels.  He considered building ‚Äúagrarian socialism‚Äù his main goal.  Ostensibly, the ideas of communism and equality are alien to all cities; therefore, Cambodians were obliged to move to villages, villages.  These are far from all points of the new country governance program.  <span>Khmer Rouge</span> canceled any commodity-money relations, religion was also banned.  Scientists, doctors, intellectuals, qualified specialists were subjected to mass repressions and killings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.irpinianews.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cambodia country history briefly" class="if uuid-2466749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2466749.jpg"></div><p>  According to <span>Pol Pot,</span> only young, healthy, and strong people were to live in ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù Cambodia.  The tyrant dictator planned to leave in the country only one million residents out of six million living in the country.  According to some reports, during the Pol Pot regime, about two million people were destroyed. </p><h2>  Democratic Kampuchea dominated by Khmer Rouge </h2><p>  This is the new name of the country that appealed to the new bloodthirsty ruler.  In the four years spent in power, Pol Pot threw the country away almost in the Middle Ages.  Since ancient times, the history of Cambodia did not know such a genocide: </p><ul><li>  The inhabitants, driven into agricultural communes, were obliged to work almost 20 hours a day in rice fields. </li><li>  Pol Pot forbade Khmers from using any medicinal products except medicinal plants.  Thus, many died due to diseases that could not be cured by ‚Äúherbs‚Äù alone. </li><li>  Khmer Rouge imposed a ban on education.  The execution threatened even for reading and writing. </li><li>  Any rebellion was bloodyly suppressed. </li></ul><h2>  The overthrow of the tyrant </h2><p>  Three years after the beginning of Pol Pot's reign, Kampuchea was devastated, the economy was in decline.  The country was thrown back half a millennium ago.  But despite the fact that money, poverty and disease reigned all around, the Khmer Rouge did not intend to moderate their ambitions and decided to conquer Vietnam.  Actually, this was the biggest mistake for them.  In support of the Vietnamese army, thousands of Cambodians who managed to escape from the bloody regime, as well as former polpotsev, disappointed in the policies of their leader, crossed over. </p><p>  In 1979, the history of Cambodia takes a new turn.  The country was finally freed from dictatorship.  Pol Pot and his associates fled the capital.  To hide from the violence, they went on the run. </p><h2>  Cambodia today </h2><p>  The country is still recovering from the consequences of total genocide.  Slow and cautious, but very confident steps, Kampuchea is gradually overcoming the economic crisis.  Now schools are again working in the cities of Cambodia, universities have appeared.  Literacy of the population exceeds 80%, the health system was restored, which served as a factor in increasing the average life expectancy (up to 65 years) and reducing the level of child mortality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.adb.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cambodia history briefly" class="if uuid-2466753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2466753.jpg"></div><p>  Cambodia is developing economically.  This country is an exporter of textiles, shoes, wood, rubber, fish, tobacco, rice.  Since the 2000s, tourism has begun to develop here, which contributes most of the revenue to the budget.  Cambodia and its hospitable residents have something to offer tourists.  In addition to historical sights and distinctive traditions, cultural and architectural monuments, Khmers can boast beautiful beaches and resorts.  Modern Cambodia, in the history of which there have been many difficult trials, inspires even experienced travelers. </p>
