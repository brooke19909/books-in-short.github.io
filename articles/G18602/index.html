And there are some devices that clearly outperform their “colleagues” in terms of price criteria and show performance a level higher than expected from them, based on the cost of the model. </p><p>  The device, which we will consider today, belongs precisely to the category of such devices.  This is the Google Nexus 7 tablet, which, thanks to its accessibility and a host of wide opportunities, has gained quite a lot of popularity in the world of technology.  We’ll talk about him. </p>

    <h2>  Two generations </h2><p>  To begin with, for the entire time the Nexus line has existed (which, recall, began with the <span>Nexus</span> 5 mobile <span>phone</span> ), two generations of tablets of the 7th model were released.  This is most likely due to the mass of flaws in the first model, which were corrected in the second version.  The most noticeable differences are the dimensions of the case (the “Asus Nexus 7” of 2013 became slightly thinner than its predecessor), the quality of the display and its density, processor power, the presence of the main camera and so on.  And since the first generation is considered relatively outdated, in the article we will probably characterize the device released by the last (in 2013).  This is how we can appreciate the advantages of this tablet more worthily. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  As for the image that the developers created for this gadget, the Asus Nexus 7 tablet is presented as one of the most powerful devices on the Android operating system.  At least, that was in 2013, at the time of the release of the device, and even now the tablet continues to be successfully sold, is in demand.  In addition to the power (and hence the stable operation of the gadget), its simplicity can also be noted.  You can notice this both externally and at the price of the tablet.  Anyway, in the “Nexus 7” there is nothing superfluous, precisely due to this, most likely, the device attracts attention. </p>

    <p>  Other options, too, seem to be created in order to validate this image of “functional, but affordable”.  Here, a 5-megapixel camera that takes good pictures, a powerful dual-core processor, a colorful screen with a very high pixel density, due to which the picture quality here is higher than on real paper. </p><p>  However, we will not get ahead of ourselves and reveal all the cards of this model.  We’ll start the “Asus Nexus 7” with the device’s case, of which materials it is made of. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Housing and materials </h2><p>  Unlike the next generation Nexus (model number 9), the “seven” is not made of metal, but of ordinary plastic.  Perhaps due to this, a more affordable price for this model is provided.  If you take it in hand, the tablet lies comfortably: this material has a matte surface, which ultimately creates a pleasant tactile sensation. </p><p>  The tablet case is made integral, due to which no backlashes or creaks, of course, are observed.  The screen unlock keys and volume keys are located on the side panel at the top of the screen.  Due to the fact that the tablet in the frontal projection looks symmetrical about the central axis (roughly speaking, both the top and bottom of the device look the same), it can be difficult to determine how to take the tablet to get your finger along the side keys.  Gradually, as you work with the device, it becomes a habit to pay attention to the peephole of the front camera - navigation is located directly opposite it.  This arrangement of buttons suggests that the tablet “Nexus 7” is designed for use in an upright position.  When reading books or articles, this is really convenient, but not in the case of surfing in the browser.  The fact is that the pages in the same Google Chrome are too narrow, which sometimes interferes with reading.  However, this is not a problem - you can simply turn the tablet horizontally. </p><p>  Regarding the strength of the case and how successfully the tablet undergoes various “tests” (damage, impacts, etc.), it should be noted that the “Nexus” is not so positive in this matter.  For example, we managed to find a video in which a gadget crash test is conducted.  Literally at the first stage - falling onto asphalt from a height of 1.2-1.5 meters (onto the back cover) - the device failed, despite the fact that the casing remained practically unscathed.  And the reviews of those who own the tablet confirm that the model does not tolerate physical damage, which is why the plastic case begins to break, chips, cracks and so on appear.  Perhaps, with a metal finish, the “seven” would be much stronger and unpretentious in maintenance.  And so, obviously, you need to buy additional accessories in order to protect both the glass and the hardware of the device in the event of falls or bumps. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  On the “Asus Nexus 7” (the characteristics fully confirm this), the developers installed a 7-inch display that uses IPS technology, capable of transmitting images in Full HD format.  The screen resolution of the device is 1920 by 1200 pixels.  In practice, this means a high density of dots (as mentioned above, about 323 ppi) and, as a result, accuracy, image sharpness, image clarity. </p><p>  However, on 7 inches of the screen, it is hardly possible to fully appreciate the advantages of the graphic component of the tablet, since these are excessively small sizes in order to distinguish pixels even on devices with lower resolution.  Therefore, simply put, you will enjoy the picture on your “Nexus 7” in any situation - tablets of this series have no problems with the screen. </p><p>  A plus is a special <span>oleophobic coating,</span> which reduces the degree of contamination of the display with the fingerprints of its owner. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  It's no secret that, in principle, the processor is installed, in principle, the speed of the device and its performance depend.  As already noted, the “Nexus 7” with this all is well - there is a quad-core Quallcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro with a frequency of 1.5 GHz.  It should be noted that this is an improved version compared to the filling, which could be observed on the 2012 model. </p><p>  The RAM “Nexus 7” (the characteristics confirm this) is increased to 2 GB, due to which there are no delays in the process of the gadget (even when loading it with bulky processes, such as launching some colorful game and the like) observed.  The reviews of those who happened to deal with the tablet in everyday life confirm that the device works quite dynamically, immediately responding to the touch of the owner. </p><h2>  operating system </h2>

    <p>  With what shell is installed on the “Nexus 7” (32 GB), there are also no problems, because the device was released together with Google.  This fact alone can guarantee that the latest updates will be installed on the tablet first.  According to the recommendations, sometimes it can be useful, although fresh versions are most often less stable. </p><p>  In the entire history that the Nexus 7 tablet exists, he was indeed one of the first to receive updates from Google's Android operating system.  Now, for example, version 5.1 is relevant.  Reviews note that the modification is stable, and it can be characterized only on the positive side due to the fact that it is colorful and quite convenient from the point of view of further interaction.  As for previous releases, for example, immediately after downloading version 5.0, users complained about multiple errors, such as unauthorized closing of windows and the like. </p><h2>  Additional options </h2><p>  The device is offered on the market in two versions - with a 3G module and exclusively with the ability to connect via Wi-Fi.  The amount of memory that is available on the models also varies: for example, there are 16- and 32-gigabyte tablets on sale, and the version with 3G implies the ability to work only with the 32 GB version.  This amount is enough for downloading videos, as well as for working with other documents, books and photographs. </p><p>  In this regard, it should be noted that such a device (“Nexus 7” 32 GB) will cost, logically, more expensive than the 16-gigabyte version.  The same applies to the 3G module, the presence of which adds another 25 percent to the cost of the device.  And, again, the choice is yours - whether you will use it or prefer to work with stationary Wi-Fi networks.  In extreme cases, an alternative can be a portable router that distributes a signal from a SIM card (3G connection) directly to your tablet.  Perhaps this will be more profitable than purchasing a version with a wireless mobile Internet module. </p>

    <p>  In addition, we could not find any other, more “radical” options that customers were not used to in <span>Nexus 7</span> .  Probably, these include the possibility of contactless charging, but, again, you need to buy a special docking station equipped with similar technology for it. </p><h2>  Comparison with iPad Mini </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the tablet has good technical parameters (and in all key issues), they often try to compare it with the iPad.  This is done in various reviews, on specialized forums for communicating about gadgets, in blogs.  People often say: here is a device that surpasses the iPad Mini in pixel density (or in some other parameter), and costs a lot cheaper (about half).  Like, why not buy the Asus Nexus 7 tablet? </p><p>  In this regard, I want to say that such a comparison is most likely inappropriate.  If we are talking about the processor clock speed or pixel density, then yes, indeed, these data can be compared with each other and understand which model wins. </p><p>  But users are trying to compare different products.  And this is a completely different matter.  After all, “Asus Google Nexus 7” clearly falls into the category of budget devices due to the plastic case, simplified design, and the lack of proper glass protection, finally.  What can not be said about the iPad Mini, made of aluminum in the corporate identity of Apple, which combines a host of similar functions. </p><p>  Comparisons are not adequate, since “Nexus 7” refers to a completely different type of gadgets, and people using the iPad will not pay attention to it, just like the other way around - owners of Android devices will not (in most cases) buy an iPad. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, if you see that somewhere draw parallels between these tablets, do not get fooled.  Apple technology has always been what it is now, and therefore it makes no sense to argue about this. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  In fact, there is a lot of information about the tablet on various technical sites and forums.  Most of it relates to what the device is in constant use - for how long does the battery last, how much the screen cover is scratched and the like.  All this is known to the buyers of the tablet - those who interacted with it for a fairly long time. </p><p>  So, in general, the reviews are quite positive.  Owners of the “Nexus 7” are quite satisfied with the technical characteristics of the model.  People emphasize that the gadget is simple, affordable and multi-functional.  Indeed, you can buy it as a “toy” for working with colorful (“top”) games on Google Play, and for conducting some kind of business activity - reading office documents, books, surfing in a browser. </p><p>  And as for the battery and scratches (our questions are given as an example), the first one really doesn’t seem so rosy, since the model has a 3500 mAh battery.  Of course, this is dictated by the small size, but with active use this is only enough for a day. </p><p>  It is difficult to say anything about glass, since everything depends primarily on the intensity of work with the device, on the presence of a protective film, a cover, and so on. </p><h2>  Market price </h2>

    <p>  At the moment, the “Nexus 7” (technical specifications, the photo of which you see in this article) is considered a clearly obsolete model, since the flagship devices overtake it according to their data.  Therefore, you can buy it for 150-200 dollars, depending on where to order a tablet. </p><p>  Regarding the price at the time of launch, yes, it was slightly higher and reached $ 250.  Imagine, for this amount, the buyer received such a powerful device, suitable for such a large number of tasks. </p><h2>  Assignee </h2><p>  In fact, <span>Google</span> continues to release products under its brand, equipped with the best software.  Another such model was the Nexus 9, which was developed by HTC. </p><p>  If our review of the “Nexus 7” review shows that this tablet is clearly a budget class, then with the “nine” the opposite is true - it is a typical flagship both in terms of performance and implementation, and in terms of price.  Everything that is necessary for “top-end” versions is present here - an aluminum case, an enlarged colorful display, an attractive design.  Its price, however, is 2-2.5 times higher than the cost of the Nexus 7 gadget.  Specifications, reviews of the new version, of course, demonstrate its clear superiority, but even despite this, the device is clearly the successor to the 7th generation version. </p>
