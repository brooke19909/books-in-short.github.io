At the place of work, an employee can receive a loan only in rubles.  In the event that the interest rate is not specified in the contract, on the basis of Article 809 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, by default it is taken equal to the refinancing rate.  If an employee is granted an interest-free loan, this must be indicated in the contract. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reflection of lending operations </h2>

Postings can be made on account 58 or 73. Financial investments are recorded on account 58.  One of the conditions for classifying the amount as financial investment is the possibility of obtaining future income.  It is clear that an interest-free loan in this account cannot be taken into account.  Therefore, there are two possible ways to reflect this operation:

It is based on article 137 of the Labor Code, which lists all types of possible deductions.  The list is closed.  Other federal laws provide some additional justification for certain deductions from wages, but loan repayments are not mentioned anywhere.  The issue is controversial, perhaps the State Labor Inspectorate will find violations in such retention.  If, nevertheless, the organization decided to repay the debt by withholding part of the salary, it is imperative to add this to the contract and take a statement of consent from the employee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Features of a loan to the founder of the organization </h2>

Until 2016, loans were granted to the founders interest-free and practically non-repayable, the agreements on them were extended again and again, it had no consequences. </p><h2>  What is the material benefit of the borrower from savings on interest </h2><p>  In connection with the issuance of loans without interest or at a very low rate, the concept of the material benefit of the borrower arises from savings on interest payments.  According to the definition of the Tax Code, a borrower receives material benefit if the interest on his loan is less than 2/3 of the Central Bank refinancing rate.  Today it is 7.75%, and 2/3 of it is 5.16%.  If the borrower took a loan below this rate, for example, at 3% per annum, then the difference between 5.16% and 3% will be considered a material benefit.  An <span>employee who</span> receives an <span>interest-free loan</span> will receive a benefit of 5.16% per annum.  It withholds income tax at a rate of 35%. </p><p>  Until 2016, material benefits were calculated at maturity.  On the day when the employee returned the last part of the money and fully fulfilled the obligations, the accountant had to calculate how much interest he would pay based on 2/3 of the refinancing rate, subtract the amount of actually paid interest from it and keep 35% of personal income tax from the difference.  Since the founders did not pay loans, the moment of repayment did not come, the tax was not charged. </p><p>  Since 2016, material benefits, according to the amendments made to the Tax Code, are calculated monthly.  If you do not repay the interest-free loan for a long time, you will have to pay a tax on material benefits on a monthly basis.  For founders, this way of withdrawing money is now becoming less attractive. </p><h2>  When you can not pay personal income tax </h2>

In this case, the purpose of the loan will be spent on the loan agreement.  After the acquisition of housing, it is necessary to provide the employer with documents confirming the intended use of the funds.  If an employee with a mortgage loan takes out a loan at a more favorable interest rate in order to pay off the mortgage at the bank, personal income tax must be withheld because housing was purchased earlier than the borrowed funds.
