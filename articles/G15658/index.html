And the time for its charging was sorely lacking.  It is not surprising that the question of how to charge the phone very quickly worries every second owner of a mobile device.  Fortunately, an effective answer still exists.  That's what we‚Äôll talk about today.  It should be noted right away that one should not expect any miracles. </p>

    <h2>  Change power supply </h2><p>  Every mobile phone comes with a charger.  Its task is extremely simple: to convert an alternating mains voltage of 220 Volts to constant and lower it to a value determined by the features of the model of the device used.  If you carefully study the data provided on the charging case, then you can see Input / Output.  For the owner who is interested in how to charge the phone very quickly, the data presented in the second line is the most valuable.  For example, it could be ‚Äú5 V / 300 mA.‚Äù  What does this mean?  The first number indicates the output voltage.  In the vast majority of charges from modern mobile phones, it is always equal to five volts.  This is done for compatibility with the <span>USB</span> computer standard <span>,</span> which provides exactly the same 5 V. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now everyone knows how to charge the phone without charging - just connect it to the appropriate port on the system unit or laptop.  But the second number is the <span>current</span> generated by the charger on the phone per unit of time.  Depending on the model of the charger, this value can range from 300 mA to 1.2 A. Those who do not want to read further how to charge the phone faster can be advised to simply replace the charger with one in which the current is greater than in " native ". </p><h2>  Amps and battery </h2>

    <p>  One of the characteristics of any battery is its <span>electric capacity,</span> indicating the amount of accumulated <span>electrical energy.</span>  For example, a battery with a capacity of 1 Ampere after a complete discharge will be able to recover to its original state in 1 hour, provided that the charger supplies a current of 1 A to it. Accordingly, a charge of 300 mA will charge such a battery in about 3 hours.  In this case, the capacitance is usually indicated in watts, not milliamps.  You can find out the battery current by simply dividing the power by voltage.  It would seem that it is enough to replace low-current charging with a more powerful one - and you can not think about how to charge the phone faster.  However, this does not give its results in all cases. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Charging Replacement Features </h2>

    <p>  Sometimes, from people who once studied how to quickly charge an ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù (phone), you can hear that if you change the ‚Äúnative‚Äù low-current charger to a more powerful model, then you can disable your mobile phone.  This statement is only partially true.  In modern mobile communication devices, a special microcontroller is used that regulates the current supplied to the battery.  That is, if the ‚Äúnative‚Äù charging produces 300 mA, and it was replaced with a model with 1 A, then you may encounter a situation where the controller will limit the incoming current to 300 mA.  The difference in this case is dissipated as heat.  From the foregoing, the conclusion follows: if, after <span>replacing the charger, the</span> phone began to get very hot, then this simple method should be abandoned. </p><h2>  Use the updated version </h2>

    <p>  Those who are interested in how to quickly charge the phone should be aware that in the world of <span>computer technology</span> there are two universal serial bus standards - USB 2.0 and 3.0 (older versions are almost never found).  One of the differences is the amount of current that can be transmitted through the corresponding port.  In the second version, its value reaches 500 mA.  But in the newer revision 3.0, not only the data exchange speeds, but also the power circuit underwent a change, so it became possible to transfer as many as 900 mA through such a USB port.  Thus, one of the effective and safe options for how to charge the phone without charging is to connect the mobile phone to a computer USB 3.0 connector and observe the process of filling the battery.  Since the port itself is the same in the standards, it is recommended to use the instructions for the motherboard or laptop to determine where it is.  Some manufacturers of the nests of the newer, third version are highlighted in color, but this is rather an exception.  In principle, this method is similar to replacing a charger with a more powerful one. </p><h2>  Take advantage of the software feature </h2>

    <p>  Those who are looking for an effective way to charge the phone faster can be advised to look through the instructions for the computer board.  In many modern solutions, manufacturers provide for the possibility of accelerated charging of the battery of a mobile phone.  For example, Asus offers proprietary technology, proudly called AiCharger.  Although there is nothing revolutionary in it, it still works.  It is enough to just install the application of the same name and connect the phone to the port.  In this case, the current passing through the connector increases to 1-1.2 A. A similar mechanism is proposed by Gigabyte.  On the boards of this manufacturer, the function of increasing the current to the port is called On / Off Charge (sometimes 3x USB power boost).  True, the phone will have to be connected to certain connectors, which are indicated in the instructions.  These features nevertheless lose in ease of use by simply replacing the charger. </p><h2>  Buy a special USB cable </h2><p>  Everyone knows what a standard universal serial bus wire looks like.  However, owners of external hard drives and drives are aware of modified USB cords made in the form of the letter Y. On one side of this wire is a plug that connects to the device (phone, CD-drive), and on the other, two connectors that connect to free USB connectors on the computer.  Here is a kind of ‚Äútee‚Äù.  When used, the output current is almost doubled.  That is, for USB 3.0, theoretically, you can get 1800 mA.  The disadvantage of this charging method is that not everyone has a Y-wire on hand. </p><h2>  Turn off the device </h2><p>  There is a very effective solution on how to charge the phone faster.  Many owners of mobile phones do not charge their electronic assistant quite correctly.  You can speed up this process by simply turning off the phone‚Äôs power while charging the battery.  Sometimes this gives an almost twofold reduction in the time spent. </p>
