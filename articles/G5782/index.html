    <h2>  Petroff Palace: history </h2><p>  The construction of the Petrovsky Travel Palace was begun in 1776 by order of Empress Catherine the Second, who wished to have a comfortable residence on the way from St. Petersburg to Moscow, where she could relax before the ceremonial entrance to Zlatoglavaya.  The construction lasted four cities, and although in the summer of 1780 the architect Matvey Kazakov already reported the completion of the work to the Moscow mayor, the first eminent customer honored the new traveling palace with his presence only seven years later.  Moreover, according to legend, Catherine said that during her stay in this residence she feels protected by the people and does not need bodyguards.  The next royal guest, Pavel the First, spent several days there before his coronation in 1797, thereby laying the foundation for the centuries-old tradition according to which Russian monarchs rested in that then residence near Moscow, before marrying the kingdom in the Moscow Kremlin.  In 1812, the Petrovsky Palace for four days became the headquarters of the Emperor Napoleon, and in 1896, on the day of the bloody tragedy on the Khodynka field, a gala dinner was organized in honor of the coronation of Nicholas II.  In the Soviet period (since 1923), the building was transferred to the VF Academy.  N.E. Zhukovsky and was used as the main administrative building of this educational institution until 1997. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petrovsky Travel Palace marriage registration" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/450011.jpg" width="600"></div>
