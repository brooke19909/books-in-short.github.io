    <p>  Non-ferrous metallurgy refers to the heavy industry.  It is engaged in the extraction, processing and concentration of only <span>non-ferrous metal ores.</span>  Here we can distinguish three main areas: aluminum, copper and nickel industry.  This industry has its own characteristics - economic, geographical and others.  Let's consider it in more detail both within the country and on a global scale. </p><p>  A feature that this industry possesses is the unprofitability of transporting non-ferrous metal ores for the purpose of their processing and enrichment.  Therefore, non-ferrous metallurgy enterprises are located as close as possible to the place of their extraction.  Mined ore contains a small portion of <span>non-ferrous metals.</span>  <span>This</span> determines the location of processing plants.  It is impractical to transport a large amount of "empty" ore.  This is a territorial feature that non-ferrous metallurgy has. </p><p>  This industry has a significant impact on the industrial power of the country.  These metals are necessary in the field of engineering and other areas of the economy.  Non-ferrous metallurgy is a factor that ensures the development of <span>scientific and technological progress.</span> </p><p>  In addition to the main industries, it is divided into lead-zinc, tungsten-molybdenum, titanium-magnesium, nickel-cobalt industries.  Also included is the production of rare metals, hard alloys and noble metals. </p><p>  There are three main stages of the process of obtaining non-ferrous metals: </p><p>  1. Extraction of raw materials and its enrichment. </p><p>  2. Redistribution of ore at metallurgical plants. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  3. Processing of non-ferrous metals. </p><p>  The development of modern science requires non-ferrous metallurgy to increase its volumes.  New developments require more resistant and durable alloys.  They are based mainly on titanium and aluminum.  The resulting alloys are used in the rocket, aviation industry, in the field of space innovation, shipbuilding and other fields of engineering. </p><p>  Copper is used both in pure form and in the form of alloys with other components.  For example, when it is combined with tin, bronze is obtained, with zinc - brass, with aluminum - duralumin, with nickel - cupronickel. </p><p>  Noble metals are used in jewelry and in the production of various equipment.  Non-ferrous metallurgy is widely developed in Russia. </p><p>  The copper industry is characterized by a combination of mining and processing enterprises.  This is due to the low concentration of copper in the mined ore.  A lot of enterprises and complexes for the extraction and processing of copper ore are located in the Urals.  There are also enterprises producing cobalt, tin and other metals. </p><p>  Copper and nickel are produced in Norilsk in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Tanakh deposit. </p><p>  On <span>gold mining</span> Russia ranks 6th in the world, and in proven reserves is second only to South Africa.  There are friable, ore and complex deposits.  Loose deposits are most favorable for mining, but their reserves are running out.  Therefore, recently, other ore mines have been developed. </p><p>  The main place for gold mining is considered Bodaibo.  There are developing mines together with Australian companies.  About two thirds of all gold is mined in the Far East, about 5% in the Urals, and one fourth in Eastern Siberia. </p><p>  In diamond mining, Russia also occupies one of the leading places.  Their main deposits are in Yakutia.  There are also deposits in the Arkhangelsk, Irkutsk region and Krasnoyarsk Territory. </p><p>  Non-ferrous metallurgy of the world is also rich and diverse.  Here, the main role is played by the occurrence places of the rock, features of the deposits, ore mining conditions and the environment.  The main deposits of colored ore are located in Australia, South Africa, Guinea, India, Chile, Peru, Venezuela and other countries.  Many countries collaborate in this area to improve the efficiency and quality of developments in non-ferrous metallurgy. </p>
