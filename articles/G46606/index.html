Creating paper crafts is a work that is hundreds of years old.  Japan is considered to be the birthplace of origami, into which many centuries ago, Chinese monks brought paper.  And only in the mid-nineteenth century did the art of folding paper figures come to Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peacock from origami modules diagram" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1629771.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Modular origami </h2><p>  One of the most popular areas of origami is considered modular.  The first mention of <span>modular origami</span> dates back to 1710.  Learning this skill is not as problematic as it seems at first glance.  The main thing here is to understand the technique of adding one module.  And then to make an unusual flower, graceful bird or animal from separate paper units will not be so difficult. </p><p>  If in ordinary origami a figure is made up of only one leaflet, then in a modular ‚Äúmany‚Äù multi-colored or plain sheets ‚Äútake part‚Äù folded in a special way. </p><p>  We offer you to stock up a bit of patience and master this technique.  The theme today is ‚ÄúPeacock from modules‚Äù.  The master class will consist of training in the technique of folding a single module and a scheme that will help to assemble a beautiful bright bird.  We will offer several photo options, which color gamut and technology to adhere to - each will already decide for himself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peacock from modules diagram" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1629770.jpg" width="600"></div>

Any figure in origami consists of them, the peacock will also be composed of modules.  A step-by-step instruction is presented in the photo, but also in words we add a little explanation. </p><p>  To make a beautiful figure using the modular origami technique, you need a piece of paper.  Aspect ratio must be one to two.  That is, one side should be exactly two times longer than the other.  Depending on the size of the sheet, the size of the module and the craft as a whole will change. </p><p>  The first thing to do is fold the leaf in half.  Then, outlining the center line, fold the corners of the paper toward the center.  We turn over our workpiece and also lower the edges to the base of the module.  Now bend the bottom up completely.  The last stage - we add the triangle in half - and you're done.  Now, in the formed "pockets" we will insert one triangle into another.  And in this way we will get a beautiful peacock from origami modules, the scheme of which is clear and simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make peacock modules" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1629772.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  How many triangles with pockets need to be made?  How many blanks are needed?  A peacock <span>from origami modules, a</span> diagram of which will be presented a little later, can include up to a thousand or more such blanks.  It remains to determine the color scheme and prepare as many modules of a certain color that are necessary for each row of origami. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tip: when deciding on the color scheme, then make a little more blanks of each color.  Sometimes in the process, modules can tear or deform, and then they are no longer usable.  The stock should always be.  We make more triangles so that without problems and time costs we get a beautiful peacock from origami modules (a scheme to help you). </p><h2>  What is needed </h2><p>  We will offer you our color scheme, but it can be absolutely any.  If you plan that the peacock from the triangular origami modules will "settle" in your living room or the nursery, then the color scheme can also be chosen so that the craft becomes worthy of the elements that successfully fit into the interior of the room.  If you make it as a gift, then you can choose any color schemes that are just ‚Äúto taste‚Äù and ‚Äúto your liking‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peacock from modules assembly diagram" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1629775.jpg" width="556"></div>

    <ul><li>  856 yellow blanks; </li><li>  465 - green; </li><li>  114 little white modules; </li><li>  one <span>red triangle</span> for the nose; </li><li>  one black triangle; </li><li>  glue. </li></ul><p>  Let's make a reservation right away.  We proposed the simplest set of colors to make it convenient to talk about how to make a peacock from modules.  But you try to make the color scheme even richer, especially in the place where the tail is located.  Then the bird will turn out truly elegant and bright. </p><h2>  First circles </h2><p>  We determine the size and make the first circle, inserting one triangle into the pocket of the "neighbor".  Thus, in yellow we will form three circles.  Our initial circle will consist of the 31st triangle.  In the fourth round we will add other shades of ‚Äúfeathers‚Äù.  We do as follows: the first is green, the next is yellow, then white, five yellow, one white, one green, the remaining yellow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peacock made of triangular modules" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1629776.jpg" width="334"></div>

    <h2>  We make the decrease </h2><p>  We will say right away that everyone has different ideas of how a peacock from origami modules should look like.  The scheme can be borrowed from the Internet or drawn by you personally.  Therefore, make reductions in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe tummy as shown in your diagram.  We will do this after the fourth row and up to the eighth. </p><p>  To do this, we turn the model over and insert the triangles so that in the next rows it becomes one blank less.  Do not forget to observe the order of colors specified in the fourth row.  The body is ready. </p><h2>  Breast </h2><p>  Now it's the turn of the breast.  <span>The peacock from the origami modules, the</span> scheme of which is proposed by us, has the same color in the chest area as in the tummy area.  Therefore, we make the first row like this: the first triangle is green, three yellow, one green, three yellow and one final green module.  Now you will need to do eight more rows, making reductions in the neck. </p><h2>  Neck </h2><p>  The neck is one of the most elegant parts of which any peacock consists of origami modules.  The neck design and construction of all models is similar to each other.  With us, it will consist of seventeen rows.  We divide them in this way: even rows and odd.  All evens will consist only of white triangles, there will be two of them.  But the odd rows are made up of three triangles: yellow - first, then green, final - yellow.  The last row is only white modules. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peacock from modules step by step instructions" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1629765.jpg" width="559"></div>

    <h2>  Head </h2><p>  The first three rows are made in exactly the same order as they were done on the neck.  The 4th consists of two green blanks, the fifth - from one green triangle.  Now it remains to fix the nose, that is, add black and white modules at the end of the neck. </p><h2>  Tail and wings </h2><p>  As for the tail and wings, here we would advise you to make a combined model.  Take a few options and connect them together.  The tail begins with eight to nine modules and then increases.  Try to add workpieces gradually so that the structure is symmetrical. </p><p>  As for the wings, here the matter will be even simpler.  They begin, as a rule, with one of two triangles, then joining goes two or three in one row.  The upper, most furry part of the wing, can include up to fifteen modules.  So our peacock is ready from the modules.  The assembly diagram is simple, hopefully described clearly.  Everyone will cope with the task, even a beginner who decides to exercise his patience. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peacock from modules master class" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1629764.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Stand </h2><p>  It remains to make an elegant stand on which the peacock from the modules will be located.  The scheme for creating such a stand resembles the first rows of a peacock's body.  That is, we make a circle of thirty modules, then add a few more rows.  Insert the first rows of the body into the last rows of the stand. </p>
