It is believed that it was she who first appeared from clothes.  In museums you can see pictures of primitive people, who wore a certain <span>loincloth</span> made of fur.  Both men and women wore skirts then.  Although today it is in some countries a national dress for men.  All heard about the famous Scottish woman.  Modern women have in their wardrobe a lot of skirts, and all of a different style.  It can be business, classical, romantic, strict, but the bell skirt is the most fashionable today.  She is magnificent and sits well on any female figure.  Each hostess will be able to make a <span>pattern of a bell skirt</span> .  It takes only a few minutes of free time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bell skirt pattern" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/444045.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Building a pattern of a bell skirt </h2><p>  There are several different ways to build a drawing.  Such a skirt fits the figure at the waist and is expanded downward.  The length can be absolutely any.  To build a drawing, you need only two main measures - this is the waist circumference and length.  Then you need to take a sheet of paper, a pencil, and you can build a pattern of a bell skirt.  In order to make it clearer, for example, take the following measurements: From (waist circumference) - 60 cm, and Du (skirt length) - 70 cm. And now we need to calculate two radii to build the drawing.  The first formula: P1 = half From - 4 cm = 60 / 2-4 = 26. The first radius was obtained.  It will be the waistline.  The second formula: P2 = Du + P1 = 70 + 26 = 96.  So we got the second radius. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pleated bell skirt pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/444054.jpg" width="327"></div>

We will draw circles from it.  First by the value of the first radius, and then by the value of the second.  Ultimately, you should get a cone with a sharp acute angle.  The pattern of the bell skirt can be cut and cut to fabric. </p><h2>  Other ways to build a drawing </h2><p>  Such a skirt can be modeled if there is a ready-made base on hand.  Tucks for the back and front are always drawn on it.  So they are needed.  To begin with, from the end of each tuck (and this is a point of an acute angle), you need to draw a vertical line in the drawing to the bottom.  Then cut along these lines and close the tucks.  The result should be the following: the tucks will close, and empty triangles should form below them.  Then you need to circle the resulting drawing.  If you wish, you can reduce or increase the length, it can be a <span>bell skirt on the floor, the pattern is</span> redone very easily.  It is only necessary to extend the bottom line. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="building pattern skirts bell" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/444055.jpg" width="379"></div>

    <h2>  Modeling bell skirts </h2><p>  When you have at hand a base drawing, you can make anything from it in a matter of minutes.  Such a skirt can be on a yoke, with frills, with wedges, with frills, with pleats.  The pattern of a bell skirt with pleats is simple.  If the drawing is built and the planned tucks (of which the vertical lines were drawn) remain on it, it will only be necessary to cut along this line again and push the two parts from the resulting drawing to the desired width in different directions.  This is the future crease.  There are several such folds.  Only in this case it will be necessary to draw several vertical lines.  It is not difficult to make such a skirt with a yoke.  To do this, in the finished drawing, it is necessary to note the future coquette.  On the side line from the top line of the drawing, descend 5 cm and put the point K1.  On the fold line (center of the skirt), go down from the top line of the drawing by 8-10 cm and put a point K2.  Then, draw a slanting line along them, this will be the coquette.  It will only be cut and cut into fabric.  It is easy to make a pattern of a bell skirt, you just need to know the basic measurements or have a base drawing on hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="skirt bell to the floor pattern" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/444058.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Fancy skirts </h2><p>  Female fantasy has no limits.  And any woman can always create an outfit from any fabric.  If there is a basic drawing, then the pattern of a bell skirt can be made with wedges.  There is nothing complicated, you just have to draw another triangle to the main pattern.  To build, you need two measurements, this is the height of the blade and its width.  Having measured the required height in the drawing (from the bottom of the skirt), put point B. Then the line from the bottom of the skirt to this point will need to be cut.  And the wedge itself can be built right on the drawing, or it can be done separately, that is, there will be another detail.  To build it, you need to draw a vertical line from point B1 down, it is equal to the height of the wedge, and put point B2.  From point B2 draw a horizontal line to the right, the length of which is equal to the width of the wedge, and put B3.  Then from point B1 draw an oblique line to point B3 again.  And make the bottom line a little semicircular.  Everything, the wedge is ready. </p><p>  Thus, it is very simple to build a pattern of a bell skirt.  You just need to know your measurements, take a sheet of paper, a pencil and scissors.  The task can be simplified if there is a drawing of the base-skirt.  Then you can simulate it even faster, and no additional mathematical calculations are required. </p><p>  Wear this skirt with pleasure and be charming! </p>
