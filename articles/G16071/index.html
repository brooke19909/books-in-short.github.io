    <p>  But is it possible to benefit from the storage of funds?  Everyone chooses the appropriate option: one puts money on a deposit, others open a metal account, and still others play in the foreign exchange market.  Sovcombank may provide its funds temporarily.  Therefore, the Halva installment card was created. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Card concept </h2><p>  Visually, the Halva installment card from Sovcombank is an ordinary bank card with a chip, but it differs in its characteristics.  It has a credit limit, which is set individually for each client.  Its size is determined based on the analysis of the solvency of the borrower.  For registration need a certificate of income. </p><p>  You cannot cash out funds.  The card account is replenished as debt is paid in this way.  The card works in partner stores and only with registered interest-free installments.  Many are interested in what is the catch of the Halva installment card?  In fact, Sovcombank works with trusted companies from which customers can purchase goods.  Partners pay commissions to the bank, and the bank receives new customers.  And users can purchase goods under optimal conditions.  Such cooperation is beneficial to everyone. </p><h2>  Installment plan </h2><p>  You can only buy goods and services from Sovcombank partners.  The card has its own website where you can find information about such organizations, as well as installment conditions for each.  The limit can only be spent on operations performed by partners; in other stores, you cannot pay. </p>
