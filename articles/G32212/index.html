They have become a truly new calling card of the whole of Greater Sochi, where many tourists, not only from Russia itself, have drawn with new force. </p><p>  A large number of both hotels and places of leisure makes Adler a very attractive place to relax for tourists of completely different ages.  It will be good for young couples, families with children, and people aged.  And the waters of the Black Sea make holidays here even more desirable. </p><h2>  Where is Nizhneimeretinskaya Bay </h2><p>  The place, which has become the main square for numerous Olympic venues, is located in Adler, between the rivers Psou and Mzymta.  From here it is very close to the border with Abkhazia, so many vacationers in this part of Greater Sochi easily visit this country with excursions. </p><h2>  History of Nizhneimeretinskaya Bay </h2><p>  Once Nizhneimeretinskaya Bay was the place where the Old Believers founded their village.  As far back as the 18th century, when there was a lot of religious persecution, the Old Believers who lived in the lower reaches of the Don River moved to Turkey.  However, a wave of persecution soon began in this country, and they had to ask Nicholas II for permission to return.  The king assisted them and even allocated land that the Old Believers could use forever.  So on the site of today's Nizhneimeretinskaya Bay, a settlement was formed, which in pre-revolutionary times was called Morlinsky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  During the Soviet Union, the Old Believers created their own collective farm.  And on the eve of the Olympics, when the construction of the necessary facilities had already begun, almost all the inhabitants of this area were resettled.  The fact is that the lands and houses belonging to the Old Believers were seized in connection with the need to prepare Olympic facilities. </p><h2>  Recreation and Entertainment in Nizhneimeretinskaya Bay </h2><p>  Today, between the two rivers of Adler, there is the <span>Olympic Park</span> with all its sports arenas, a track designed for Formula 1 racing, a magnificent Sochi Park amusement park and all kinds of newly built hotels. </p><p>  Tourists who want to not only spend a vacation near the sea, but also see the buildings built for the Olympics, are sure to choose Adler for their holidays.  The first coastline here is represented by various guest houses and hotels, which welcome guests from all over Russia and the world. </p><p>  On the landscaped promenade of this place is nice to walk at any time of the day.  And the beaches of the bay are considered the cleanest in all of Sochi.  There are no berths and breakwaters, the water is clean and beautiful turquoise color.  The beaches themselves are pebble, so this is a great place for those who like to bask on pebbles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Anna Maria" in Adler </h2><p>  Among the variety of hotels presented in the Nizhneimeretinskaya Bay, one can distinguish a small but very comfortable hotel "Anna Maria" (Adler).
