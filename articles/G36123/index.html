    <h2>  How much is the rest </h2><p>  The quality of service and relaxation at this hotel far exceeds its price.  And the cost of a standard room here is from 3.5 to 7 thousand rubles for two.  The rest of the money tourists usually spend outside the hotel.  From the hotel to the center of Naama Bay, a taxi will cost about 50 pounds.  But back can be much more expensive.  But this is if you do not know how to bargain.  And you can go there by minibus - it costs only 1 pound per person.  Excursions on the beach sell half the price than the operators in Sol Y Mar Naama Bay 4 *.  Reviews recommend buying them there, and not at the hotel.  Service is no different, and money will be saved.  Parachuting over the sea costs from 50 to 70 dollars.  And in order to buy a real papyrus (and not a fake) at the famous Oriental Bazaar, you will have to pay about 500 pounds. </p><h2>  What else to see? </h2><p>  Well, of course, Naama Bay.  From the hotel Sol Y Mar Naama Bay <span>Hotel 4 * (Sharm)</span> go there "for two", but if it is too hot or late, feel free to take a taxi or take the minibus.  The club with the most beautiful girls - ‚ÄúLe Pasha‚Äù - traditionally attracts visitors.  And Hard Rock Cafe will always find how to surprise the most sophisticated tourist.  The local Black House disco is also good.  She was "sheltered" by the hotel "Tropicana Resort".  The parties where the local DJ lights up are audible for miles across the beach.  Swimming and traveling - that's why vacationers come to Sol Y Mar Naama Bay 4 *.  Egypt is a place that can fully satisfy all your wishes.  Therefore, the hotel also rides to famous sights.

    <h2>  Sol Y Mar Naama <span>Bay (Naama Bay,</span> Arab Republic of Egypt): reviews </h2><p>  Everything that is said good in travel companies about this place, according to tourists, is fully true.  Here, great drinks, great ice cream, amazing animation, day trips to the beach, and in the evenings to night clubs.  There is a heated pool.  Restaurant dishes delight in quality and variety, providing guests with a real belly celebration.  If you are tired of everyday life and the hustle and bustle of big cities and you want to swim, sunbathe, eat deliciously and with pleasure, in general, relax very calmly and measuredly, then this hotel is just for you.  Here tourists can plunge into the atmosphere of friendly hospitality, exquisite architecture, in the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãflowers and positive entertainment.  And the presence of many locals with families among vacationers only means that the staff gives all the best for one hundred percent. </p><h2>  Sol Y Mar Sharks Bay 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt) </h2><p>  The hotel complex, similar in style, location and services, belonging to the same chain, is located near the airport itself.  Its beach is located in the so-called Shark Bay.  The hotel is a large white building with one hundred and thirty rooms and twelve cottages with suites.  In principle, this hotel resembles Salt and Maar in Naama Bay, with the only difference being that it is further from the sea, and the bus goes there less often.  Of course, the distance to the city is also sufficient - you won‚Äôt get there on foot, only on a special minibus for thirty-eight pounds.  There is a massage room.  There is a shallow entrance to the beach on the beach, there is a pontoon, but there are no fish.  But there is a bar where you can eat burgers and salads and you do not need to pay extra.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis hotel is smaller than Naama Bay. </p>
