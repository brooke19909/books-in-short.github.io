It is common throughout the country.  It has branches in various cities of Russia.  Not a scammer, as some citizens think.  Nevertheless, it is not particularly popular among the population. </p>

    <p>  TransCapitalBank receives various reviews.  There are good ones among them, and not so much.  What features should you pay attention to when working together?  Are there any dubious or negative points regarding the provision of services?  How can TransCapitalBank help at all? </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  The range of services the company has no features.  It is standard for all financial organizations whose main area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity is the provision of banking services.  So, TransCapitalBank offers its customers: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Internet banking services; </li><li>  lending; </li><li>  mortgage </li><li>  opening accounts and deposits; </li><li>  Money transfers; </li><li>  currency operations. </li></ul><p>  Nothing special or specific.  And it pleases some citizens.  This is due to the fact that TransCapitalBank is the most common, albeit not quite a large bank.  More precisely, a network of banks.  You can apply here for standard services provided by financial institutions. </p>

    <h2>  Deposits </h2><p>  Special attention is paid to deposits.  It is they who are most interested in the population.  For them, Transcapitalbank receives mixed reviews.  Although most of them are mostly positive opinions. </p><p>  The organization has a lot of contributions.  You can choose the one that suits a particular person.  Conditions are not always favorable, but they are better than many competitors.  Interest rates are on average from 8 to 10% per annum.  A little, but stable and reliable. </p><p>  Today, among the contributions, the following programs can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  "Growth time. Autumn" - 10% per annum in rubles; </li><li>  Pension - 8.8% per annum for a period of 368 days; </li><li>  "Contribution to the future"; </li><li>  <span>"Savings Certificate"</span> - 10.05% per annum; </li><li>  "Universal"; </li><li>  "Poste restante"; </li><li>  "Universal Premium" - up to 8.55%. </li></ul><p>  There is plenty to choose from.  But, as clients say, it is worth contacting the organization‚Äôs departments directly for more detailed information on deposits.  They will provide complete information about each of the available programs and explain the terms of cooperation with the bank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mortgage </h2><p>  Many people today take loans: both consumer and mortgage.  By the way, the rates on the first may be different, depending on the program.  So, pensioners can take a loan with a rate of 19% per annum, and existing customers of the bank - from 17%. </p><p>  Mortgage lending in Russia has also become extremely popular.  Therefore, many are interested in what TransCapitalBank receives mortgage reviews.  Should such a responsibility be taken? </p>

    <p>  There is no unequivocal opinion here either.  The organization receives a variety of reviews about its mortgage.  Some say that it was TransCapitalBank that helped them easily acquire housing.  And cooperation with a financial organization does not cause any trouble - there are no constant reminders of payments, no debts, no mysteriously appearing delays. </p><p>  Along with this, some complain that TransCapitalBank is not a completely bona fide financial organization.  At the slightest arrears, the management turns to collectors who beat out even the smallest debts, and by all means.  Overpayments on the mortgage are huge, and the paperwork ahead when processing paperwork is not for everyone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What to believe?  Rather, it‚Äôs better to be neutral.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that TransCapitalBank receives positive customer reviews mainly for issuing loans and mortgages in cases when people get rejected in other financial institutions. </p><p>  In general, in practice, the rejection of a loan or mortgage at TransCapitalBank is a rarity.  But they also happen.  Mainly due to an incomplete set of documents or due to the low income of the client.  Nevertheless, the bank still receives claims regarding the mortgage.  Exactly the same as most similar companies.  But in general, TransCapitalBank is suitable for concluding a mortgage agreement. </p><h2>  Customer service </h2><p>  What about <span>customer service?</span>  Another extremely important nuance.  Reviews about TransCapitalBank in this area are also ambiguous - someone is satisfied with the service, someone is not very happy. </p>

    <p>  The main complaints expressed by visitors are slow and unfriendly employees who are not able to give answers to specific questions.  They don‚Äôt like to communicate with debtors here, one may also encounter some rudeness. </p><p>  But there are also positive opinions, where people speak of TransCapitalBank as honest and conscientious employees.  They try to answer customer questions to the maximum, pay attention to each.  Although the speed of service still leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  It should be noted at the same time that both the negative expressed to the company and the positive reviews are not supported by anything.  So, we recommend just to take into account that the service at TransCapitalBank is not too fast, and also that not all employees will always be able to answer certain questions.  However, as in any other bank. </p><h2>  Customer help </h2><p>  Quite often, TransCapitalBank receives positive reviews for helping customers with the processing of certain documents.  This is an extremely important nuance that stands out separately in servicing visitors. </p><p>  Some emphasize that if you have difficulty filling out applications and receipts, you can ask the bank to do this for you.  Then it remains only to verify the correctness of the data and put your signature on the document. </p><p>  This can not but rejoice, especially when it comes to elderly or inexperienced people who have never had business with banks before.  TransCapitalBank is trying to do everything for its visitors.  And it is commendable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transcapitalbank customer reviews" class="if" height="171" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1508010.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Claims and their solution </h2><p>  As already mentioned, TransCapitalBank receives various reviews.  Some people complain that when applying for a loan or a mortgage it turns out that you will have to pay more than they originally promised.  Fortunately, such situations are rare.  They should not be afraid.  Why?  Management quickly solves problems and apologizes to its customers. </p><p>  It is recommended that you simply carefully study all the terms of the contract, as well as clarify any nuances before concluding the relevant agreement with the bank employees.  Then no negative moments will arise.  Especially when it comes to conscientious customers.  And debtors and defaulters will have claims against anyone, even an ideal bank. </p><h2>  License revocation </h2><p>  There are rumors in the media that the organization called Transcapitalbank is threatening to revoke the license.  Is it a myth or a real threat?  There is nothing to be afraid of.  The bank does not have and will not have any license withdrawal.  Anyway soon.  Such news is a real deception, which is not supported by anything.  Especially taking into account the fact that the population is mainly working with TransCapitalBank and does not have any serious complaints against it. </p><h2>  From employees </h2><p>  But as an employer, the bank has not proved itself too well.  Unfortunately, Transcapitalbank does not earn the best reviews from employees.  The main complaints are low earnings, hard work, a constant flow of visitors and the need to stay overtime. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bank reviews transcapitalbank" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1507832.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Nevertheless, Transcapitalbank as an employer also has positive aspects.  It: </p><ul><li>  comfortable working conditions; </li><li>  full benefits package; </li><li>  Fixed salary; </li><li>  white salary; </li><li>  career; </li><li>  self-development; </li><li>  preferential terms for bank services. </li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  As can be seen from the above, Transcapitalbank receives various reviews.  In general, this is a good bank that offers standard services.  Claims made to the financial institution are, as a rule, stereotyped. </p><p>  As an employer, this is also a good company.  True, with its shortcomings.  You can safely contact here for employment, and to receive certain services.  Just not recommended to work with large amounts of money.  Indeed, with the possible closure of the bank (and no one is safe from this), it will be difficult to return the funds. </p>
