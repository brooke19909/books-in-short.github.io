    <p>  Car DVR is a necessary and useful device that allows the driver to record the situation on the road in front of the windshield.  And if you use two cameras, you can also see what happens behind the machine.  There are practically no such drivers who did not get into traffic accidents, and there are a lot of controversial and difficult situations on the road.  An independent witness, a car DVR, will be able to help solve such unpleasant issues. </p><p>  The gadget appeared quite recently, but its benefits are very obvious.  So, let's take a closer look at what a DVR is. </p><p>  This is a simple <span>surveillance camera</span> that saves frames tied to the time of their creation.  The gadget is installed directly in the car interior to record everything that happens around.  With it, the driver has the opportunity to prove his case.  The device allows you to look at the situation that has developed on the road, through the eyes of the driver.  And it is simply unrealistic to challenge such facts. </p><p>  If you decide to purchase the device, here are some tips on how to make the right choice in accordance with your budget. </p><p>  Speaking about what a DVR is, it should be said that these devices are conditionally divided into three classes.  So, the following types are distinguished: </p><p>  1. Budget - these are digital video recorders that do not have a display, they simply perform the recording function.  Such devices shoot in low quality with low resolution and, accordingly, without sound.  The main advantage is a rather low price. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. The middle price category includes devices with a display, as well as functionality for recording and reproducing information.  They have a standard recording resolution of 640x480.  Compared to budget ones, here the quality of the recorded video is, of course, better, and already with sound.  The advantage of devices belonging to the middle price category is the combination of an acceptable price and good quality. </p><p>  3. Premium - the class of the most functional and progressive DVRs of all of the above.  Video resolution - high quality (from 960 √ó 720 to 1280 √ó 720).  Footage can be stored on a memory card.  The DVR, the choice of which will not disappoint you, is a premium device that can rotate, which expands the horizon of its inspection.  The device has a built-in GPS / GPRS-module that determines the location of the car, sending a warning message to a cell phone if an unplanned situation occurs. </p><ol></ol><p>  It is also worth noting the useful functions of the device when it comes to what a DVR is: </p><p>  - when moving objects appear in the lens, automatic video recording is activated; </p><p>  - the recording function "in a circle" allows you to automatically delete older material, instead of it, recording a new one; </p><p>  - varying the quality of shooting - this is the ability to determine the size of video files; </p><p>  - setting the date and time; </p><p>  - support for various removable media; </p><p>  - search for the necessary moments in the record. </p><p>  DVR mounts are of the following types: </p><p>  a) adhesive - great if you use the device in one car; </p><p>  b) mount-suction cup - a great option for people changing the location of the device on the glass. </p><p>  Any driver can easily install the DVR in the car himself, as the power to the device comes from the cigarette lighter.  Although it is worth noting that there are such models that turn on when the ignition is started and are connected to the car wiring, but they must be installed by the master in a car service. </p><p>  The most popular brands now are the following: Palmann, Gazer, Vision Drive, Pioneer, Globex, Atlas, Tenex, DOD, Shuttle and others. </p><p>  I hope, based on the foregoing, you understand what a DVR is and how not to make a mistake when choosing it. </p>
