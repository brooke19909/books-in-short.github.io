    <p>  However, in order not to lose subscribers, but, on the contrary, to increase their mass, it is necessary on behalf of the community to write comments on photos of other accounts that correspond to its theme, actively advertise the community on other social networks, and carry out mutual subscriptions with similar accounts. </p><p>  With a serious approach, you can earn significant money with a minimum of investment.  Very popular instagram users and media people charge over sixty thousand for a photo in an ad in their account.  Lesser-known persons are limited to ten thousand.  But ordinary users should not despair.  It is quite possible to receive gifts from advertisers in the form of their goods, as well as enter into such a transaction as interest on sales.  Therefore, in communities and their promotion makes sense. </p><h2>  Pay for likes </h2><p>  Putting likes to the photos you need is the most minimal way to earn money on Instagram.  However, it is the easiest.  For its implementation you just need to register on special exchanges of subscribers.  Different exchanges have different rates for one like.  On average, the price tag is limited to five cents.  It is logical to assume that you need to have several accounts in order to earn something.  And like the necessary photos intensely. </p><h2>  Collaboration with large firms </h2><p>  Nowadays, there has been a trend in the use of ordinary amateur photos in commercials of large companies.  What if not instagram can serve as an excellent source of such photos?  For iPhone there is a special application SnapMyAd, with which you can earn on your photos.  The earning method is as follows: you need to photograph the products of a certain company and place it in this application.  If the photos suit the company, then it will pay a reward.  Everything is very simple. </p><h2>  Earnings on printing photos from instagram </h2><p>  If you have the ability to take high-quality and interesting photos, then why not print them for future sale?  The beauty of instagram is that you can make these photos with the help of filters very attractive and unusual.  Such photos can even be printed on things such as mugs, pillows, clothes and so on.  The Instagram brand itself is very popular, therefore, things with such photos will be sold out very quickly. </p>
