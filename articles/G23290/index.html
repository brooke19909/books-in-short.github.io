However, not everyone can afford the purchase of expensive equipment, so many manufacturers of photographic equipment have gone a little trick - they created inexpensive mirror devices, simplifying their functionality and technical characteristics.  The focus of this article is a wonderful entry-level SLR camera Nikon 5200. Overview, specifications and feedback from owners will allow a potential buyer to get to know the leader in sales in the market of photographic equipment. </p>

    <h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  Many sellers assure that it is impossible to distinguish the new product from the previous generation camera (we are talking about the D5100 model) by external signs.  The same high-strength plastic in the manufacture of the case, with a pleasant roughness on the outside, and the shape with the control panel does not stand out much from the Nikon 5200 modification. The price of an entry-level SLR camera is in the range of 30-35 thousand rubles and, judging by customer reviews, is quite attractive. </p><p>  With a complete set, the brand has always been in full order.  The enthusiast‚Äôs standard set, in addition to the equipment and instructions, has a set of adapters and cables for professional work with footage.  The strap, battery and charger are also considered to be a standard kit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design and ergonomics </h2><p>  <span>The Nikon</span> 5200 <span>camera</span> is presented to the world community in three colors - black, bronze and red.  In our country, judging by the numerous reviews of the owners, the classic black color is more popular.  From an ergonomic point of view, a half-kilogram SLR camera perfectly lies even in one hand.  The device owes such convenience to a convenient handle located on the right side of the gadget. </p>

    <p>  Directly on the handle is an infrared receiver for controlling the camera using the remote control.  Next to it there is a bright lamp for highlighting autofocus.  The manufacturer notes that the lamp has an additional function - the elimination of red-eye.  There are many buttons on the device control panel, but many owners claim that it is quite easy to deal with them.  And if you take into account that in automatic mode you do not need to make any presses other than releasing the shutter, then for many users the problem of learning additional functionality will be eliminated. </p><h2>  Connectors and Interfaces </h2><p>  From the eyes of the owner of the <span>Nikon D</span> 5200 SLR camera, under the dozen plugs, almost all the functionality of the mirror device is hidden.  Probably, it‚Äôs worth starting with a bayonet mount - it does not have a built-in motor (screwdriver), respectively, only expensive lenses with a built-in ultrasonic mechanism that can automatically focus on shooting objects are suitable for the camera.  At the top of the camera, the company's technologists placed audio devices.  There are two microphone holes and a stereo speaker under the plug. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  On the left side of the case, under the plugs, there was an interface for displaying images on a TV screen (HDMI).  Next to it there is one USB port for synchronizing the camera with a personal computer.  The third strange view is for installing a GPS module, which is sold separately.  Turning the device over, the owner will find a plug on the bottom of the case that hides the battery compartment.  This is the only stub in the device that experts recommend careful handling. </p><h2>  Camera Specifications </h2><p>  The <span>Nikon D</span> 5200 CMOS sensor has a size of 23.5 x 15.6 mm (exactly half the size of all professional SLRs).  The manufacturer announced that the camera supports 24 megapixels, but the number of pixels does not play a special role for such a camera (6-8 is quite enough for professional shooting).  The sensitivity of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã100-6400 ISO units. </p>

    <p>  The device uses an electronically controlled shutter, which has a vertical stroke of the curtains.  Shutter speed can be set from 1/4000 to 30 seconds in steps of 1/3 or 1/2.  A longer shutter opening is realized by manual mode.  There is the possibility of serial shooting - 3 or 5 frames per second.  The image storage format is standard: RAW, JPEG or combined RAW + JPEG.  The camera can record video in FullHD format (1920x1080) with stereo sound. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Standard lenses for the camera </h2><p>  The Nikon 5200 Kit 18-55 is considered the best-selling camera modification.  As practice shows, this arrangement of the device with a lens has the most attractive cost on the market among all similar Nikon products.  Also on the market, a potential buyer may find this camera with a rangefinder lens 18-105 or even without optics in the BODY configuration.  In their reviews, professional photographers recommend that all beginners give preference to an inexpensive 18-55 lens. </p><p>  With standard DX optics, the Nikon 5200 works flawlessly.  Autofocus control is carried out using a silent ultrasonic mechanism, and also allows the user to make manual adjustments.  The owners of the camera claim that the focus of the camera practically does not miss, and this can not but rejoice.  And if you take into account that the exposure is measured using a 2016-pixel RGB sensor, then you do not have to worry about the quality of the final image. </p><h2>  Mirror Performance </h2><p>  Gone are the days when the mirror representatives of the budget class hung tight while saving photos obtained as a result of serial shooting.  The Nikon 5200 Kit is very fast.  The first is inclusion.  Literally, when you press the power button, you can take a series of shots at a glance, as is the case with all professional devices. </p>

    <p>  With a burst of 5 frames each, the user will not notice any device freezes even when saving photos in the combined mode (RAW + JEPG).  This functionality is possible due to the voluminous memory buffer, which communicates quickly enough with the drive.  Finally, many users will be able to afford to work in LiveView mode.  Again, no braking in the process of viewing images in real time can be detected. </p><h2>  Screen and viewfinder </h2><p>  Definitely the presence of a three-inch swivel screen in the camera will appeal to all lovers of creating high-quality videos.  It's one thing to shoot with your hands, having a <span>portrait lens</span> in hand <span>,</span> and quite another to shoot a family in the lap of nature with a Nikon 5200 18-105 camera.  At the request of the user, you can install the screen in any position and at any angle, because a reliable hinged mechanism provides complete mobility to the liquid crystal screen. </p><p>  The viewfinder is also equipped with a transparent LCD display.  Focus points are constantly displayed on it, as well as a compositional grid.  At the moment the autofocus is triggered, the focus points are highlighted in red.  In their reviews, many owners note that the viewfinder does not have a backlight, and it is rather inconvenient to use it in the room. </p>

    <h2>  Digital Laboratory Control Panel </h2><p>  But the menu on the Nikon 5200 camera is completely identical to the more expensive devices on the professional photography market.  Many experts note that the manufacturer deliberately took such a step so as not to mislead fans of Nikon products.  When switching from an entry-level SLR camera to professional equipment, the user should not feel discomfort. </p><p>  In general, the menu leaves positive emotions - the screen is large, all settings are grouped by functionality, management is Russified.  It is clear that without a user manual, it will be difficult for a beginner to understand the settings, however, to use the camera in automatic mode, the control panel is quite informative.  In their reviews, many photographers recommend that beginners immediately turn on the autofocus information panel, which is provided to the owner in the form of a graphic image.  The user will be able to compare the settings that the camera makes during the exposure selection process and make its own conclusions. </p><h2>  Canon vs Nikon </h2><p>  All users have long been accustomed to the struggle of the giants of the computer industry (we are talking about Intel vs AMD and Radeon vs Nvidia).  In the world of SLR cameras, there is an equivalent struggle between Canon and Nikon products.  The Nikon 5200 has a direct competitor in the price category - the Canon 650D.  As practice shows and many tests conducted by experts and enthusiasts, they do not have much difference in the quality of creating photos.  Mirror devices differ from each other in appearance and ease of use. </p>

    <p>  Uniquely on the Nikon 5200 camera, reviews of a positive nature will be written by fans of Nikon products, and Canon will be praised by owners of equipment with the corresponding name.  And there will be no end to this struggle, because in 2000 two world giants signed a contract on interaction in the world market and settled prices for their products (a kind of monopoly). </p><h2>  There is always an alternative </h2><p>  The desire to possess semi-professional equipment for many potential buyers is clouded by the mind, and the user thinks about a perfect mistake already after 2-3 weeks of operating the SLR camera.  The whole problem is that many buyers do not know how to analyze the data and compare the advantages and disadvantages of products.  For example, all SLR cameras have a huge weight (compared to the same "soap dishes").  It's one thing to keep the device in the store for several minutes, and a completely different situation when conducting hours of photography in the lap of nature.  And they also have inherent abstruse management, rich and many users do not need the functionality at all (after all, 99% of owners use the "Auto" mode).  Not to mention the low protection of the lens from shock and many negative factors that reduce the interest of the buyer.  Experts in their reviews recommend using an effective technique for <span>choosing a camera</span> on the market - pick up a mirror device and a compact Nikon Coolpix 5200. Take 20 frames, 5 minutes of video and compare the results. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Presented in a budget class, Nikon SLR cameras definitely deserve the attention of a potential buyer.  And we are talking about those users who need a digital device more for work or creativity than for entertainment.  After all, the ‚Äúcrop‚Äù matrix was invented to reduce the cost of professional equipment, and not in order to push portable digital cameras out of the market. </p><p>  The Nikon 5200 product, like its predecessors in the market of photographic equipment (and maybe followers), has all the existing functionality that a photographer might need during the shooting process.  If we are talking about the convenience of work, the quality of the images and the service, then there is nothing to complain about even the most demanding buyer.  However, before purchasing expensive equipment, you still need to think about whether this camera is practical in everyday life. </p>
