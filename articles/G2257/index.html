    <p>  The heyday of the city can be attributed to the XIX century.  It has become a center for trade in food and textiles.  Many sights of Myshkin date from this period. </p><h2>  The secret of popularity, or How a provincial town has become a tourist center </h2><p>  Everything is very simple, such an atmosphere can never be found in large cities.  This is the bewitching charm of antiquity.  It should be noted that people here also live special, real enthusiasts and patriots.  They have collected unique collections of the most ordinary things, and now tourists visit their city, bringing considerable income.  Especially when you consider that there is practically no industry here.  Of course, it plays a role where the city of Myshkin is located.  The distance from Moscow is only 250 km, so the influx of people tired of the bustle of the metropolis is ensured all year round. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Wood is the main building material of Russian masters.  Huts were built from it, various household appliances, furniture, dishes, and decorations were made.  Fine examples of carpentry art exhibited here reveal the true talent of the masters of their time. </p><p>  The guide will also tell you about the arts of art: cooper and oil mill, weaving and carving. </p><h2>  St. Nicholas Cathedral </h2><p>  The city has many old, wooden buildings, with intricate carvings and outbuildings on the roof.  But this cathedral is made in stone.  It was built in the XVIII century, namely in 1766, in the village from which 10 years later the city of Myshkin grew.  The sights of many large cities fade before its greatness.  The very realization that the building is more than two hundred years old, and services are still being conducted there, fills with trepidation. </p><h2>  Museum dedicated to Russian Vodka </h2><p>  More precisely, to its creator, P. A. Smirnov.  This is a simple peasant who was born and raised here, but thanks to his invention he ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù an entire nation and became a millionaire.  His small house-museum tells the story of the greatest entrepreneur, reveals the life and secrets of success. </p><h2>  Museum of Living Crafts </h2><p>  Have you ever wanted to personally witness the work of a blacksmith or a carpenter, inhale the smell of fresh wood or hot metal?  And to take mastery lessons from them and, perhaps, craft something useful for the home together?  The creators of the fabulous center of masters set this goal.  It is located just 5 km from the city of Myshkin. </p><p>  Three workshops work: forge, pottery and carpentry.  Crowds of tourists are going to see how a piece of clay or metal comes to life, listen to the secrets of the master and try yourself as a craftsman.  All hand-made souvenirs can be taken with you. </p><h2>  Technical Museum </h2><p>  The entire period of a person‚Äôs life on Earth is the invention of various mechanisms and devices to facilitate his life.  The museum includes the most diverse equipment produced in the 19th century.  Will your son enjoy looking at an old locomotive?  And lemonade and sausage machines of the end of the 18th century will surely bring a smile. </p><p>  Later samples include agricultural and military vehicles, there are even river vessels.  Some instances still work, they are allowed to sit behind others, imagining themselves in the thick of events of the past. </p><h2>  Assumption Cathedral </h2><p>  Back in 1777, when the city of Myshkin was formed in the Yaroslavl region, this architectural monument was already listed in the construction plans.  At the beginning of the 19th century, it was built, and by 1830 the wall painting was completed.  The five-domed temple with a three-tiered bell tower in a tiny city impressed with its grandeur.  Today, the painting has been preserved only partially, but still this magnificent building is worthy of the highest praise. </p>
