This is a push-button telephone, which is ideal as an apparatus for calls and other actions.  It went on sale in December 2015. However, one must understand that Nokia 230 will not be able to completely replace a modern smartphone.  That is why, before purchasing, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the detailed characteristics of the gadget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 230" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1186147.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  So, what awaits us upon arrival at the store?  I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Nokia 230 phone belongs to the line of budget phones.  That is why you should not expect much from a complete set.  The box is made of ordinary cardboard in white.  On its upper faces is a telephone from different angles.  Opening the package, you can immediately see the phone.  Its screen is protected by a film.  There is also a battery and charger.  At the very bottom is the manual and warranty card.  A headset, a USB cable, and a program CD are missing. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  "Nokia 230" has a monoblock type case.  Dimensions of the device: 142.6 x 53.4 x 10.9 mm.  Light weight - 91.8 g.  The screen is medium in size, the keyboard is quite comfortable.  Immediately below the display there is a large joystick button with which you can work with the menu and use the quick access function. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The shape of the apparatus is rectangular, with rounded edges of a small radius.  This design solution allows you to assign the phone the title of "universal."  In his hand he lies comfortable enough, does not slip out.  Available mainly in white, gray and black.  On the side of the case there are two connectors: for a charger and a headset.  On the back there is a camera with a flash, a flashlight, and, of course, the traditional Nokia logo.  This cover is made of aluminum, the rest of the body is made of plastic. </p><p>  When reviewing this device, it is worth paying attention to the fact that the manufacturer has released two modifications: Nokia 230 Dual Sim for two SIM cards and a simplified model designed to work with one mobile operator.  In the design, they are practically no different. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 230 dual sim" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1186141.jpg" width="464"></div>
