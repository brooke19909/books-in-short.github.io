It is worth noting that it is in Thailand that the most suitable for recreation are the winter months - from November to April.  Every day the sun will shine here, and the air temperature will not drop below 25. The sea here is also very warm due to the vast shallow waters.  This is an ideal place for a <span>honeymoon,</span> and for relaxing with children, and for celebrating the New Year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to fly in winter where is warm" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/291012.jpg" width="600"></div>

Any tourist will be pleased with the warm ocean, the snow-white islands, and the sky-high architecture that was born here recently.  This is a place <span>where it is warm in winter</span> and very hot in summer, so if you decide to explore all the possessions of this metropolis, then go here in January-February. </p><p>  The undoubted leader in attendance during the winter months is Mexico and all those tiny powers that surround it in the <span>Caribbean.</span>  A flight to any point in Central America will cost about the same, but the color in different countries, although similar, but still has certain differences.  In the most famous paradise of Mexico, Cancun, you can feel the freedom on deserted beaches or, conversely, find the noisiest parties and have fun on them.  There is also a unique underwater museum, which is visited annually by millions of tourists.  Nearby places where it is warm in the winter are Jamaica, Costa Rica, Panama, the Dominican Republic and many others.  They speak mainly Spanish in these countries, but everyone understands English.  And do not forget, visiting these colorful places, learn to dance salsa and bachata. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is warmer in winter in egypt" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/291013.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you are looking for a more extraordinary place, where to fly in the winter, where it is warm and happy with the surf, then go to India.  This country did not leave anyone indifferent due to its unique culture and rich nature.  In India, with great respect for local traditions, there are a lot of beliefs and rituals.  You can join some of them, or you can just watch aside everything that is happening.  But in spite of everything, you can always swim here in the warm ocean, wander through the tropical green alleys and see the amazing structures left here by former peoples. </p><p>  Of course, due to its economic availability and developed infrastructure, Egypt is popular.  Russian tourists constantly come here, and many resorts are more like our colonies.  If you still do not know where it is warmer in the winter in Egypt, then go to Sharm El Sheikh.  It is always hot here, and this area has a minimal amount of rainfall. </p>
