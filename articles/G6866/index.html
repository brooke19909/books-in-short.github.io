It is clear that this mess does not decorate the home at all.  A newspaper shop made with improvised materials can help to deal with the problem. </p><p>  This is not just an interior decoration, it will be an excellent assistant in cleaning and maintaining order.  All newspapers will be in a specific place. </p><p>  Stores offer a huge selection of newsstands - for every taste, color and income, but this is just the case when a hand-made thing is better than purchased.  The advantages are obvious: </p><ul><li>  you choose the design yourself, based on your own preferences; </li><li>  this option is much more economical; </li><li>  the creative process will bring joy and satisfaction from the result. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="hanging newspaper rack" class="if uuid-3018436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3018436.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of Newspapers </h2><p>  They are divided into several directions.  By the methods of application in the interior design of the room: </p><ul><li>  Desktop view. </li><li>  Floor. </li><li>  Suspension. </li><li>  Universal - this type is suitable for installation on the floor and on the table. </li></ul><p>  The floor-standing newspaper rack is remarkable in that when you place it, you do not need to drill walls in the house, so wallpaper and tile do not deteriorate.  There are many models.  Different sizes, and decor, and design style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second, no less common variety is the wall-mounted newspaper rack.  They are more applicable in small apartments.  A wall always has more free space than a floor.  Differ from flooring in smaller dimensions.  Mounted at any level on the walls.  They are made of any material - metal, fabric, wood, plastic, etc. </p><p>  Suspended "vaults" are usually the lightest; they are made of fabric or yarn. </p><p>  The range is extremely wide, but here's how to make a newsstand with your own hands, we will tell you in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homedit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="outdoor newspaper rack" class="if uuid-3018394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3018394.jpg"></div><h2>  What you may need to make </h2><p>  To create a newspaper rack with your own hands, you can choose any toolkit and material: </p><ul><li>  Wooden bars. </li><li>  Pieces of plywood. </li><li>  Metal rods. </li><li>  Willow stems are twigs. </li><li>  Matter. </li><li>  Yarn for knitting. </li><li>  Clothesline and twine trim. </li></ul><p>  Surface treatments are also diverse.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Painting by any kinds of dyes. </li><li>  Varnishing or using stain. </li><li>  Technique of decoupage, craquelure, patchwork, etc. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wooden frame magazine rack" class="if uuid-3018392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3018392.jpg"></div><h2>  Do-it-yourself newspaper stand </h2><p>  The option, assembled from thin wood bars and leather strips, looks very interesting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To work, you need: </p><ul><li>  A block of wood of circular cross section and having a diameter of 1.5 cm, a length of 72 cm. </li><li>  Rectangular beam - 1.5x4 cm, length 164 cm. </li><li>  Leather belts or a rectangular leather flap - for making bags for newspapers. </li><li>  Strong threads. </li><li>  Screws with a diameter of 2.5 mm and a length of 3 cm. </li><li>  Rectangular wire or finished rings. </li></ul><p>  Do not forget about the tools: </p><ul><li>  Drills and a hacksaw. </li><li>  A thick needle for stitching the skin. </li></ul><p>  So, we do the newsstand with our own hands. </p><p>  The procedure is not very complicated, just stick to the algorithm: </p><ul><li>  We divide the bar (round) in half - 36 cm each, and the square - into 4 parts 41 cm each. </li><li>  In all square segments, we drill holes to the middle (not through), retreating 2.5 cm from the edge. </li><li>  Next, we fasten 2 bars with a square section with screws, laying them on the wide side together.  Here we wrap with wire or put on a ring. </li><li>  Spread these structures with a cross and connect them with round bars. </li><li>  It remains to align the legs for stability.  You can finish in any way - paint or finish with a layer of varnish. </li><li>  With the wooden frame finished, let's take care of the skin. </li><li>  We will need 6 belts 62 cm long and about 4-5 cm wide. At the ends, make loops through which to pass round bars on both sides. </li></ul><p>  Everything, the design is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="making a cardboard magazine rack" class="if uuid-3018432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3018432.jpg"></div><h2>  Do-it-yourself cardboard box </h2><p>  Sometimes, buying a thing, we regretlessly part with a cardboard container.  And we don‚Äôt even know how to use it.  But corrugated cardboard is very easy to assemble a beautiful newsstand with your own hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Prepare such materials and tools: </p><ul><li>  A pack of white paper napkins. </li><li>  Cardboard box or corrugated cardboard sheets. </li><li>  Paint brush. </li><li>  Bowl for the preparation of adhesive solution. </li><li>  Hot melt adhesive and gun. </li><li>  PVA. </li><li>  White paint - acrylic. </li><li>  Paint in spray cans. </li><li>  Foam sponge. </li><li>  The varnish is colorless. </li></ul><p>  At the very beginning of the work, mark the place of the cut with a pencil and a ruler.  We cut off the unnecessary part.  For the manufacture of internal compartments, the box is laid sideways on a sheet of cardboard and circled.  Then, reducing 2 mm along the entire perimeter, cut with sharp scissors. </p><p>  Carefully coat the sides and bottom of the workpiece with glue and insert it into the box at the right place.  Almost everything, the newsstand is ready.  It remains to decorate it. </p><p>  To do this, take a napkin and tear it into pieces.  In a bowl, we dilute PVA with water (1 to 1).  Now with a brush moistened in a solution, we coat a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãcardboard and apply a napkin - loosely, forming folds.  Thus, we glue the entire surface. </p><p>  At the end of the work, you can spray paint your newspaper rack or leave it white.  Then we apply varnish and dry.  A wonderful container for periodicals is ready - use it with pleasure! </p><h2>  Textile newsstand </h2><p>  This is probably the easiest way to create!  It‚Äôs easy to sew a newspaper box with your own hands from fabric! </p><p>  You will need a piece of fabric measuring 27 by 62 cm. The denser it is, the better.  If this is not available on the farm, you can glue nonwoven soft matter from the inside out. </p><p>  Also need a block of wood - 31 cm, thread and needle, scissors, braid or lace (length 35 cm). </p><p>  A rectangular piece of matter must be processed along the edge using any convenient method - sheathed with an oblique trim or simply bent over the edges. </p><p>  Now we fold this blank in half with the wrong side inward and sew together the free edges.  Insert into the bar and sew the seam, fixing it.  We tie the cord to the ends of the sticks, thereby fixing the fabric. </p><p>  That's all, a huge number of options for decorating such a product. </p><h2>  High-tech table mirror newspaper rack </h2><p>  And to create the next original little thing will have to work hard, but the result is worth it.  Tools required for work: </p><ul><li>  MDF panels (30x30 cm) - 4 pcs. </li><li>  Acrylic mirrors (30x30 cm) - 2 pcs. </li><li>  Wood screws. </li><li>  Glue "Liquid nails". </li><li>  Drill. </li><li>  Acrylic paint in light gray. </li><li>  Screwdriver. </li></ul><p>  First, we‚Äôll assemble the frame of our newspaper rack.  To do this, you need to screw the panels to each other with screws, forming a square. </p><p>  Acrylic paint all wood surfaces except the sides. </p><p>  Coat the sides with plenty of glue and attach mirrors.  Leave to set and dry completely. </p><p>  So - very quickly and simply - a wonderful "keeper" of newspapers and magazines is done!  And the mirror surface will give it additional charm! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yarn magazine rack" class="if uuid-3018400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3018400.jpg"></div><h2>  Hanging knitted magazine rack </h2><p>  Yes, there are a lot of ways to make it.  Here is another one of them - a wall-mounted newspaper rack, hand-knitted from yarn. </p><p>  For her, the remains of the thread from the previous knitting are suitable.  Hook, wooden stick, having a length equal to the width of the future product and 5 cm on top. </p><p>  How to act in this case?  To tie a rectangle with any pattern you like, fold it in half and tie the free edges, connecting them together. </p><p>  Then attach the stick and tie the cord, which then tie to its ends.  Fringes, knitted flowers, beads, etc. are suitable as decorations here. </p><p>  This option is remarkable in that you can independently choose the texture of the threads, the knitting pattern and the size of your product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="houseimg.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt newsstand" class="if uuid-3018407" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3018407.jpg"></div><h2>  Making a felt magazine rack </h2><p>  Perhaps one of the most successful materials for needlework is felt.  Its main characteristics are beauty, ductility, ductility, strength, lack of need for additional processing of edges.  To work with this material, you do not need to have special sewing skills. </p><p>  To create a newspaper basket, prepare a hard felt in brown sheets, thick cardboard, yellow sewing threads, and a needle. </p><p>  First, on a piece of paper we form a pattern of the bottom of the basket, measure its length in a circle (we get 46 cm).  Cut 2 parts from the material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="the bottom of the felt basket" class="if uuid-3018342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3018342.jpg"></div><p>  Now we cut out 7 long strips of felt (49 cm for free laying and do not forget about allowances for the seam of 0.5 cm) for weaving the sides and 20 short widths of 3 cm. Each detail should be in duplicate. </p><p>  To seal the newspaper rack, you can add cardboard pads, cutting them out according to the same patterns. </p><p>  Sew all the strip parts in two, inserting cardboard between them.  Gently stitch the seams with yellow thread around the edge. </p><p>  One felt blank must be glued to the cardboard and short strips should be attached to them at an equal distance, laying in a circle.  Cover with a second felt part from above and stitch along the edge. </p><p>  Now, taking long strips, also stitched with a cardboard pad, sew them into a ring, departing from the edge by 0.5 cm. Weave with short ones, and sew the upper ones along the edge.  The handle of such a basket is optional, but everything is to your taste. </p><p>  Done, it remains to decorate the newspaper rack - to sew with your own hands from the same felt various flowers, leaves, fruits and attach to the basket. </p>
