Translation Methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Quite often, people have to think about how <span>to transfer money</span> from phone to phone.  This technique helps to share balance and greatly simplifies life.  But not everyone knows the existing options that can be used to complete this operation.  Therefore, further we will try to figure out how to behave under certain circumstances.  What do you need to remember?  How to make a mobile money transfer between phones?  We will certainly try to answer all this further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.komando.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money on the phone" class="if uuid-2414728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/2414728.jpg"></div><h2>  Possible ways </h2><p>  How to transfer money via phone?  Today this issue will be studied from several sides.  For example, topping up a device‚Äôs account from a bank card or from a SIM of another number.  We will study both approaches.  The first is on the example of Sberbank. </p><p>  In general, this procedure can be carried out: </p><ul><li>  via SMS requests; </li><li>  by USSD commands; </li><li>  through specialized websites of mobile operators; </li><li>  by working with special programs and options. </li></ul><p>  The latter option is almost never found in practice.  If we talk about transferring funds to mobile from a Sberbank credit card, it can be noted that such an operation is more often carried out: </p><ul><li>  through an ATM; </li><li>  mobile banking; </li><li>  using Sberbank Online. </li></ul><p>  All this will be discussed later.  All this is not as difficult as it seems initially. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="net3g.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline logo" class="if uuid-2414730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/2414730.jpg"></div><h2>  Help messages </h2><p>  How to transfer money from phone to phone?  For example, you can use a technique such as working with SMS requests.  He is in great demand. </p><p>  The message format will vary depending on the mobile operator.  Here are some striking examples from the most popular cellular providers: </p><ol><li>  Type a message like "# Transfer replenishment amount".  Send a letter to the recipient's number.  This technique is relevant for MTS. </li><li>  Type in SMS "recipient_plastic_number_number".  If you send a message to the number 7878, you can share the balance on Beeline. </li><li>  A message like ‚Äúpayee number payment_size‚Äù sent to short combination 3116 helps transfer funds to MegaFon. </li></ol><p>  But this is only the beginning.  How else is it proposed to replenish the mobile phone?  What will the sender need to do for this? </p><h2>  USSD Commands and Transactions </h2><p>  Need to transfer money from phone to phone?  Beeline and other mobile operators often offer their customers USSD-requests for the implementation of the task. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russia-banki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Translation to 900" class="if uuid-2414740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/2414740.jpg"></div><p>  To use them, you just need to type the appropriate commands in dialing mode.  After that, the team ‚Äúcalls‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the moment, the following combinations are popular: </p><ul><li>  * 145 * recipient_number * amount # - "Beeline"; </li><li>  * 133 * amount * person_number # - "MegaFon"; </li><li>  * 145 * subscriber_number * payment_size # - "Tele2". </li></ul><p>  MTS does not have a USSD request.  But this operator has many other approaches to solving the problem. </p><h2>  Online </h2><p>  How to transfer money from phone to phone?  We have already said that it is possible to cope with this kind of task in different ways.  For example, by working with the official pages of operators. </p><p>  In general, the algorithm of actions will be approximately the same.  The client will: </p><ol><li>  Go to the page of your mobile network operator. </li><li>  Log in to the page.  This step is optional. </li><li>  Select the option "Payments" - "Transfer to phone". </li><li>  Specify transaction parameters.  For example, sender and receiver numbers, amount. </li><li>  Confirm. </li></ol><p>  Within a few minutes, the subscriber will cope with the task.  Money will be transferred to the specified phone. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that on the official pages of mobile operators it is possible to recharge phones using bank cards.  Simply select the appropriate setting in "Payments" and enter the details of the plastic.  It is very comfortable! </p><div class="photo" data-original="atbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dialing a number" class="if uuid-2414745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/2414745.jpg"></div><h2>  MTS and Easy Payment </h2><p>  MTS has an option called Easy Payment.  By activating it, a person can no longer think about how to transfer money from phone to phone. </p><p>  It is proposed to act in this way: </p><ol><li>  Download the official Easy Payment application for mobile devices from MTS.  For example, through the Play Market. </li><li>  Run the appropriate software. </li><li>  Open the "Payment" tab. </li><li>  Click on the line "Mobile Phone". </li><li>  Prescribe recipient data.  Do not forget about the size of the upcoming payment. </li><li>  Confirm the operation by clicking on the "Pay" button. </li></ol><p>  It remains only to wait.  After the actions taken, the person will share the balance without much difficulty.  But what other ways to "help" are found in practice? </p><div class="photo" data-original="platezhy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS sending" class="if uuid-2414750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/2414750.jpg"></div><h2>  Sberbank and recharge SIM </h2><p>  How to transfer money to the phone?  Sberbank offers many different ways to share finances.  We have already reviewed their list.  Next, consider a few tricks in more detail. </p><p>  To begin with, for the implementation of mobile transactions, you first need to connect the Mobile Bank.  This can be done using an ATM or in any branch of Sberbank.  The payee must also have this feature activated. </p><p>  How to manage your phone account using funds from Sberbank?  It is proposed to do this as follows: </p><ol><li>  Send a message with the payment amount to 900. The combination will help transfer funds to your phone from the card. </li><li>  Generate SMS of type "payment_late last_4_plots_plastics" and send to 900. The message allows you to recharge your mobile phone with a specific card. </li><li>  The SMS form "Tel Number Amount" offers to debit funds from the sender card to the SIM of the specified subscriber.  If after the payment amount, write the last 4 digits of the card with a space, you can transfer money from a specific card. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Now it‚Äôs clear how it is proposed to transfer money to the phone from the phone.  900 is the main number that customers who have connected mobile banking have to interact with. </p><h2>  ATMs and transactions </h2><p>  The next trick is not to recharge from another phone, but it is in great demand.  Transferring money from a customer‚Äôs card to a SIM card from a bank account is one of the most convenient ways, since you don‚Äôt have to think about the balance on another number. </p><p>  To do this, you need: </p><ol><li>  Insert the card into the ATM and start working with it. </li><li>  Select "Recharge Phone". </li><li>  Indicate your mobile operator. </li><li>  Enter the recipient number and the transfer amount. </li><li>  Confirm. </li></ol><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how to share finances and more with another mobile phone user.  This is a fairly simple operation. </p>
