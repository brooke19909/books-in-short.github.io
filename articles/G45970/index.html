  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is an aphrodisiac and how does it work?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There is a wonderful feeling - love.  In some, it arises instantly, like a <span>flash of light</span> during lightning, while in others it develops smoothly and gradually.  One way or another, the love that arose between a guy and a girl leads to a relationship, and as you know, we need to work on them.  If this is not done, then the fervor gradually begins to fade, passion disappears, life and routine catch up with boredom, crowding out all good things and leaving only the habit of people to each other.  However, few people want their feelings to "come to naught," and therefore try to improve their personal lives.  There are many ways to do this.  One of them is the use of aphrodisiacs. </p><p>  Some may ask, in general, what is an aphrodisiac?  The history of the name itself is very simple: it was invented in honor of the goddess of love - Aphrodite.  Thus, aphrodisiacs are substances that stimulate <span>sexual desire.</span>  These include some spices and seasonings, as well as natural products of both animal and vegetable origin. </p><p>  If you are interested in what an aphrodisiac is, you can find out that it can be used not only inside.  So, in addition to food, there are also synthetic substances that increase sexual desire.  They can be inhaled (smoking stimulating mixtures), rubbed into the skin (massage creams, essential oils) or sniffed <span>(scented candles</span> and sticks). </p><p>  For a very long time people have been wondering what is an aphrodisiac?  The instigators of love at all times deserved attention and honor.  Today, their use is especially relevant.  Constant stresses, overwork, accumulated fatigue, poor ecology, unhealthy diet and a "frantic" rhythm of life - all this contributes to the deterioration of sexual life.  A person‚Äôs modern lifestyle deprives him of both strength and desire for sex.  That is why such high expectations are placed on products that stimulate erotic inspiration. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When it becomes clear what an aphrodisiac is, I want to know the way it works.  Many scientists have devoted a lot of time to studying this issue.  As a result, it was found that the composition of aphrodisiacs contains substances that trigger a series of biochemical reactions in the human body, as a result of which excitement increases, sexual fantasies appear, sensory and erogenous perception increases, sexual abilities and powers resume, sensations become more acute.  Thanks to these substances, a person begins to feel more relaxed, shows the full breadth of his erotic potential and receives much more pleasure.  The fact is known that aphrodisiacs can help even with frigidity, weak potency and rapid ejaculation (affect the duration of sexual intercourse). </p><p>  The main effect of erotic substances is to stimulate the production of sexual hormones in the body.  In addition, they have a rich vitamin and mineral complex and normalize metabolism, which is good for the work of the entire body. </p><p>  Substances that provoke sexual arousal, not only relax, but also have a rejuvenating, restorative and restorative effect.  However, one should know that not all ‚Äúproducts of love‚Äù affect different people in the same way.  They are even divided into female and male.  So, the most famous female aphrodisiacs are vanilla, red wine, melon, cinnamon, mango, avocado, sage, lemon balm, honey.  There are many others, there are about 70 species in total.  Male aphrodisiacs, of course, prevail.  It is difficult to count all the products that cause sexual desire in the stronger sex.  The most common among them are bananas, mussels, oysters, nutmeg and basil.  There are rumors about the beneficial effects of absinthe on the sex drive of men.  However, this statement is very controversial, because  this drink is very harmful.  In general, the choice is yours.  Experiment and enjoy each other! </p>
