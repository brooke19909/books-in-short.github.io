    <p>  The opening of <span>Moscow University</span> in 1755 was made possible thanks to the active work of an outstanding scientist, the first academician in Russia, Mikhail Lomonosov.  This institution is considered the oldest institution of higher education in the country.  The name of Lomonosov was assigned in 1940, when the institution turned 185 years old. </p><p>  In 1724, a gymnasium and a university were created on the basis of the <span>Academy of Sciences</span> in Petersburg.  Their task included the training of scientific personnel in Russia.  However, these institutions could not cope with their functions.  Lomonosov has repeatedly proposed the creation of Moscow University.  Formulated in a letter to Shuvalov, the scientist's proposals were taken as the basis for the <span>project of the educational</span> institution.  As you know, Shuvalov was among the favorites of the Empress Elizabeth, he supported the development of Russian culture and science, patronized many of Mikhail Lomonosov's undertakings. </p><p>  After reviewing the submitted draft of the new educational institution, <span>Elizaveta Petrovna</span> on January 25, 1755, a decree was signed on its foundation.  The opening of Moscow University took place on May 7, 1755.  On the same day, Elizabeth celebrated the anniversary of her coronation.  Since then, these days have firmly entered the history of the institution.  The opening of Moscow University is celebrated by student celebrations.  The days of scientific student creativity and the annual Lomonosov Readings conference are also timed to coincide with this event. </p><p>  According to the plan of its creator, the opening of Moscow State University began with the formation of three faculties: medical, legal and philosophical.  Started training for all students at the Faculty of Philosophy.  They received basic training in the humanities and natural sciences.  Further, young people could continue their education by specializing in the same faculty or by switching to legal or medical.  At the Moscow University there was no faculty of theology, unlike <span>European universities.</span>  This is due to the special preparatory system of Orthodox ministers used in Russia, which involved lecturing in both Latin and Russian. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Moscow State University was distinguished by a democratic student and faculty.  This fact has largely contributed to the widespread dissemination among them of advanced ideas in the field of science and society.  Anyone except serfs could enter the university.  In this case <span>, the education system</span> was built on the example of Western European educational institutions, in which the principle of estate was over long ago. </p><p>  The opening of Moscow University required certain costs.  Government appropriations only partially covered the costs.  In addition, at the beginning of the development of the institution, students were not charged, and subsequently, poor students were saved from it.  Management was forced to look for various sources of additional income, even resorting to commercial activities.  The philanthropists (Stroganovs, Demidovs, Dashkova) made a great contribution to the development of the University.  They handed over the acquired devices, books, collections for the needs of the institution, and announced student scholarships.  The University established a tradition by which professors bequeathed their personal collections to the library. </p><p>  <span>Moscow University</span> held a leading position in the promotion and dissemination of scientific knowledge.  Teacher lectures and student disputes were open to the public.  In the year following the foundation of the institution, a bookstore and printing house were opened at its base.  Thus, domestic book publishing began.  At the same time, the first non-governmental newspaper Moskovskiye Vedomosti saw the light of day.  From January 1760 a literary magazine (the first in the capital) ‚ÄúUseful Amusement‚Äù began to be published. </p>
