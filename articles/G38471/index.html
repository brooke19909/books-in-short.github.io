A loyal customs regime between our country and neighboring states allows visiting the latter with minimal restrictions.  Therefore, you can go, for example, to Abkhazia by car and see with your own eyes ancient temples, magnificent waterfalls and ancient fortresses. </p><h2>  Which resorts are best to go to? </h2><p>  Regardless of whether you go to Abkhazia by car, by train or by bus, you need to decide on a place to relax.  Despite the outdated infrastructure, it is full of beaches, restaurants and entertainment facilities, so it will be much cheaper to relax in this country than in Egypt or Turkey.  Do you like to soak up the sun?  Pay your attention to Gagra, where the warm season begins in mid-April and ends in October.  This resort will also appeal to dance lovers until the morning - local clubs hold parties every day for everyone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="to Abkhazia by car" class="if uuid-2377267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2377267.jpg"></div><p>  Interested in history and architecture?  Then it is best to stay in New Athos, where the oldest buildings peacefully coexist with unearthly beauty in their landscapes.  Near the architectural monuments are large plantations of southern fruits and access is open to all comers.  There are also beaches that are mostly artificial and composed of pebbles, which makes them safer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you are traveling to Abkhazia by car with young children, it is best to relax in Pitsunda - a small urban-type village located near Gagra.  A quiet place with pebble beaches will appeal to those who prefer a peaceful vacation and are not ready to spend time on excursions. </p><h2>  How to get directions from the capital? </h2><p>  If you compare among themselves all the possible vehicles suitable for international travel, it is easiest to leave <span>Moscow to Abkhazia</span> by car.  On your way will lie: Voronezh, <span>Rostov, Krasnodar,</span> Sochi, Adler and other settlements.  On average, the journey takes about 18-20 hours, the amount of time will depend on the selected speed limit, stop for the night, the presence of a second driver and other factors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Abkhazia by car" class="if uuid-2377268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2377268.jpg"></div><p>  Most of the route will run along the federal highway ‚ÄúDon‚Äù (M4), it is mainly two-lane and abounds with a large number of hotels, roadside cafes and gas stations, the services of which you can use at any time of the day.  Another advantage of the highway is a high-quality roadway on which you can ride without fear of damaging the wheels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One of the main drawbacks of traveling from Moscow to Abkhazia by car is the paid sections into which this highway is divided.  In order not to waste time and not pay each time at local payment points, you can purchase a conveyor in the capital for 1,000‚Äì1,500 rubles, and use it for calculations on absolutely all toll sections of the road. </p><h2>  Can I drive for free? </h2><p>  Under existing law, the state is obliged to provide an alternative to toll roads.  That is why you can save on a trip to Abkhazia by car, bypassing the commercial sections of the M4 Don highway.  One of the alternatives is the ‚ÄúM2‚Äù highway, which connects Moscow and Simferopol with each other, with its help you can go around several paid sites and go for free in the Yelets area. </p><p>  On the "M4" itself there are always signs that indicate that a paid site starts in front.  They also inform drivers of a free detour and point to another highway.  After 633 kilometers of the Don, the paid segments end and no one needs to pay for the fare, however, it is planned to introduce new sections in the Voronezh and Rostov regions, so be careful and careful. </p><h2>  How to prepare a car for travel? </h2><p>  A trip to Abkhazia by car will require serious preparation, because you will have to overcome almost 3,000 kilometers, taking into account the return road.  That is why you need to conduct a full check of your vehicle, the easiest way to do this is by going to the nearest car service.  Of course, such an examination may require financial investments from you, but you will receive a lot of free time that you can spend on more important matters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Check all <span>technical fluids</span> in your vehicle and top up or replace if necessary.  We are talking about the oil levels in the automatic transmission and engine, brake fluid, as well as the amount of antifreeze.  You can make some checks on your own, but for some you have to go to the workshop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ktas.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what you need by car to Abkhazia" class="if uuid-2377272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2377272.jpg"></div><p>  Be sure to check the pressure in the wheels before setting off to Abkhazia by car.  What should I pay special attention to?  On tires: they should not be pumped, only in this case you can safely drive your vehicle.  Be sure to check the operation of all lighting devices: brake lights, turn signals, dipped and main beam bulbs, etc. </p><p>  Prepare spare tools: wheel, jack, set of keys.  Bring a pump along with everything you need to repair a <span>punctured wheel.</span>  It is also recommended to prepare fuses, bulbs and several wires of various sections, clamps and adhesive tape, resistant to high temperatures.  Candles, filters, a cable, a shovel, crocodiles, sets of keys and tools may also be necessary for you on the road, so put them in the trunk in advance. </p><h2>  What documents may border guards require? </h2><p>  A driver‚Äôs license, a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and a certificate of registration of a vehicle - that‚Äôs all you need when traveling to Abkhazia, it is not difficult to cross the border by car with these documents.  The appropriate terminal of the checkpoint is designed for passengers, and they pass through passport control and screening separately from the driver.  Customs officers search the car fairly quickly, usually it takes about 30 minutes. </p><p>  If you are traveling with children who are not yet 14 years old, you will need to bring their birth certificates or a passport, if any, with you.  Adolescents aged 14 to 18 years can go through customs according to the passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation or a foreign passport.  Are you traveling with children, but without your soulmate?  It's okay, her consent is not required in this case. </p><p>  At customs, you will need to fill out a special declaration for your car, as well as pay a small fee of 150 rubles.  Here it is necessary to clarify that when traveling to Abkhazia by car, there is no OSAGO policy there.  Local insurance cannot be bought, which is why it is necessary to drive as carefully and carefully as possible. </p><p>  Please note - if you do not own the vehicle, you will need to have a <span>general power of attorney for the car</span> to cross the border <span>.</span>  This document must be officially certified by a notary, otherwise you will not be able to get into the territory of the state.  If you have any other situation, you can contact the Embassy of Abkhazia in the Russian Federation for clarification by phone 6501145, Moscow code - 495. </p><h2>  How to behave on local roads? </h2><p>  Even if you know how much to go to Abkhazia by car, this is not enough to ensure that your vacation goes flawlessly.  Drivers here behave quite freely and constantly violate traffic rules, but they should not be likened to them, since local traffic safety inspectors are quite strict about violations.  Be as prudent as possible, because there are quite a lot of reckless people who like to fit into sharp turns at high speeds and even drive into the oncoming lane. </p><p>  Those motorists who have been to Gagra and Pitsunda say that local traffic inspectors rarely stop vehicles with Russian license plates.  However, there are cases when they try to provoke drivers to a conflict, it is not recommended to respond to this.  If you are sure that you haven‚Äôt violated anything, prove yourself right to victory, this can be useful for you in advance bought and read the rules of the road, as well as a DVR. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.urbanghostsmedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="going to Abkhazia by car" class="if uuid-2377269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2377269.jpg"></div><p>  If you suddenly find yourself in any unpleasant situation, you can contact the official embassy of our country on the territory of Abkhazia.  It is located in Sukhum, at the address - st.  Lakoba, 103, it is there that you can get the most detailed consultation on all issues, including finding consensus for the problem. </p><p>  However, do not think for a long time about whether it is possible to feel comfortable in Abkhazia by car.  Most of the Russians who visited this country were satisfied with local roads and communication with local law enforcement officials.  The hospitality of the Abkhazians, magnificent nature and smooth highways will make your trip a pleasant one. </p><h2>  What attracts tourists from Russia here? </h2><p>  Freedom of movement is one of the main advantages of traveling to Abkhazia by car; in reviews of this country, travelers quite often note this fact.  And in fact, you can visit a lot more cities, historical places and beaches, if you do not depend on the schedule of buses, trains and taxis. </p><p>  Another major advantage of this state is low prices.  For example, the cost of camping overnight is only 500 rubles.  For a thousand rubles you can visit a couple of excursions and get a lot of pleasure.  Products here are also much cheaper, especially fruits, which are abundant here. </p><p>  Significant saving of money on the way is another reason why you should go to Abkhazia by car, according to the reviews of guests of this country, traveling in this way allows you to save up to 5 thousand rubles per passenger.  This budget reduction is achieved due to the fact that you yourself decide on those services that you would like to receive, and do not use offers from travel companies, where the price is initially overpriced. </p><p>  Negative reviews about the rest in this country are primarily associated with the crony behavior of its population and the constant attempts to ‚Äúbreed‚Äù tourists for money.  On the other hand, the responsiveness, hospitality and generosity of the Abkhazians can pleasantly surprise and convince you that it was not in vain that you arrived in this small paradise with the azure shores. </p><h2>  How much are housing and food? </h2><p>  The cost of food and accommodation is an important factor that must be budgeted for your trip to Abkhazia by car.  With limited money, it is easier to check into a house with one of the local residents who rent.  More than 1000 rubles per day are unlikely to be taken from one person, and often meals are also included in the price. </p><p>  There is another option - to live in a car throughout the trip.  Sleeping in this case will be somewhat problematic, but you will save quite a large amount.  Products here can be purchased in stores or in numerous markets where anyone will be happy to bargain with you.  Since Abkhazia has certain eastern roots, haggling on the market here is considered a tribute to the seller, but everything has its own facet, which is better not to go over. </p><div class="photo" data-original="roadsandkingdoms.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://roadsandkingdoms.com/2012/the-year-in-food/"><img itemprop="image" alt="market in Abkhazia" class="if uuid-2377273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2377273.jpg"></div><p>  Bread here costs about 20 rubles, a pack of milk - about 60, a kilogram of sausages can be purchased for 250-300.  However, it is better to pay attention to fresh fruits and vegetables filled with vitamins and minerals.  In particular, fresh tangerines can be purchased here at a price of 40-50 rubles per kilogram, and watermelons - for 20. </p><p>  Tourists quite often buy food as souvenirs, first of all, we are talking about the famous chacha, the prices for it here vary from 200 to 500 rubles per liter.  1.5 liters of homemade wine can be purchased for 200-250, and a liter of delicious mountain honey - for only 200 rubles.  However, these reserves do not always ‚Äúlive out‚Äù to the Russian-Abkhaz border, because the temptation to drink all the delicious drinks at once is very great and not everyone is able to resist. </p><p>  You can also eat in cafes, which are abundant in Abkhazia.  Lunch in a standard catering establishment will cost about 300 rubles per person, and if you go to a restaurant of national cuisine, then the average check is higher - from 500. A standard portion of barbecue (100 grams) can be purchased here for 150-200 rubles, main dishes cost about the same, the cost of salads varies from 50 to 300. </p><h2>  And if you travel not from Moscow? </h2><p>  To calculate how many kilometers you will have to drive to Abkhazia by car, you need to determine the locality to start.  However, it should be borne in mind that in any case you will have to go to the Don highway, since only it leads to the border points where customs clearance takes place. </p><p>  If you are coming from the eastern part of Russia, it will be easiest to drive through Yekaterinburg, Ufa, Samara, Volgograd and Belorechensk.  The M5 highway (Ural), along which you have to go, periodically needs to be repaired, therefore it is necessary to observe the high-speed mode when driving along it.  In addition, pay attention to the large number of cameras and traffic police inspectors in the Saratov and Volgograd regions, this will help you save your nerves and money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skyscrapercity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how many km to Abkhazia by car" class="if uuid-2377270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2377270.jpg"></div><p>  When traveling to Abkhazia, the route by car needs to be laid in such a way that a large number of gas stations and roadside cafes come across on your way.  If you are traveling south from <span>Khabarovsk, Vladivostok</span> and other Far Eastern cities, you can significantly cut the path, for this you need to turn in the direction of Astana outside Novosibirsk and enter Kazakhstan.  In Kyzylorda it will be necessary to turn onto Aktobe, and from there - to Atyrau, and then to Astrakhan and Volgograd, respectively. </p><p>  Try to stick only to federal highways or highways marked with the ‚ÄúMain Road‚Äù sign.  This is especially true when you are traveling in adverse road conditions.  Get a navigator that will help you choose the right direction at the fork or indicate the right path if you suddenly get lost. </p><h2>  How to save on fuel? </h2><p>  The high cost of gasoline often becomes the factor due to which drivers refuse to go to Abkhazia by car, and the advice of experienced travelers can come to your rescue here.  If you don‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money on fuel, use the paid sections of the M4 highway, where the maximum permitted speed is 110 kilometers per hour, which means that you don‚Äôt have to often spend gas on acceleration and braking. </p><p>  Another saving option is to use fuel at gas stations under a less hyped sign.  Motorists know that at such stations gas prices are slightly lower, and at the same time it is not inferior in quality.  However, if you are used to using fuel from the same manufacturer, it is not recommended to experiment on a long journey, as the engine may not react at all as it would be desirable. </p><p>  Gas prices in Abkhazia itself are slightly lower than in Russia, however, service stations for the usual oil companies may not be there, so it is recommended that you refuel before crossing the border for a short trip.  If you have any doubts about the quality of the proposed fuel, do not take risks and use the services of Rosneft gas stations, which are located next to Gagra and Sukhumi, respectively. </p><h2>  Should I go in the winter? </h2><p> Are you afraid of the distance to Abkhazia by car?  Then you can become one of the few daredevils who go there in the winter season.  Over the past few years, the number of such tourists has grown significantly due to the mild climate - in January, air temperature can reach up to +17 degrees.  Locals go in windbreakers and warm sweaters, so you can not take a lot of warm clothes with you. </p><p>  In winter, it is recommended to undergo treatment in hydrogen sulfide springs, you can also go to the Black Sea coast and enjoy air baths.  In addition, in the cold season, much less tourists rest here, and housing prices are much cheaper.  For example, a room for one person without food can cost only 700 rubles, while it will include a TV, refrigerator, bathroom and other amenities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripinrussia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia routes by car" class="if uuid-2377288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2377288.jpg"></div><p>  It is obviously not possible to go skiing here, since the holiday season in Abkhazia sometimes extends until the beginning of November.  The Caucasus Mountains reliably protect a small state from the winds, so it is characterized by a very warm winter.  On the shores of the sea it is unlikely to see snow, but on the mountain peaks it is more than enough. </p><p>  If you are planning a winter vacation in Abkhazia, you will have to move as carefully as possible by car.  Choose a safe high-speed mode, pay attention to road signs and pay attention to how well the highways are cleared.  With snowfalls and other weather troubles, it is best to stay in some roadside hotel and wait out. </p>
