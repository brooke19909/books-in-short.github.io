But now this system has won the hearts of many.  We have to deal with all its features.  What is Android Pay?  And how to use it? </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Android Pay in Russia is nothing more than a service for making contactless payments.  It works easily and simply.  A citizen binds a bank card to a mobile device through a special application.  After that, a person has the opportunity to pay for goods and services using the phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="android pay in Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2116910.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The main thing is that the Android operating system is installed on the device.  Otherwise, the reception will not work.  In fact, we are dealing with an application that replaces bank plastic.  But what should every modern resident know about Android Pay in Russia? </p><h2>  Bank support </h2><p>  For example, it is important to understand which banks the system under study works with.  Unfortunately, today the list of financial organizations is very limited.  It includes only 13 banks. </p><p>  Which ones?  Android Pay in Russia works with the following financial companies: </p><ul><li>  VTB 24; </li><li>  Sberbank </li><li>  "Yandex money"; </li><li>  "Alfa Bank"; </li><li>  "Opening"; </li><li>  Tinkoff </li><li>  Binbank; </li><li>  MTS Bank; </li><li>  Russian Agricultural Bank; </li><li>  Promsvyazbank; </li><li>  Ak Bars Bank; </li><li>  Raiffeisenbank. </li></ul><p>  In the future, this list will be updated.  But for now, ‚ÄúAndroid Pay‚Äù supports only the plastic of the listed organizations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use android pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2116909.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Phone support </h2><p>  But that is far from all.  Find out which devices support Android Pay.  After all, this system will not work on all phones. </p><p>  In total, there are 2 conditions that must be observed.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  the presence of an NFC chip; </li><li>  operating system Android 4.4 and later. </li></ul><p>  Also, sometimes among the requirements distinguish the ability to emulate cards (HCE).  Android Pay works even with older phones. </p><p>  For example, we can distinguish 2013 models: </p><ul><li>  "Sony Xperia X-1"; </li><li>  "Samsung Galaxy Es 5"; </li><li>  HRC Van. </li></ul><p>  It is advisable to see the characteristics of your phone.  Only in this way will it be possible to understand whether it will be possible to use the studied system of electronic payments.  The bulk of modern smartphones allows you to bring the idea to life. </p><h2>  About root rights </h2><p>  Another nuance.  Android Pay application will not work on hacked smartphones.  That is, the opportunity under study is offered only to bona fide phone owners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="android pay sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2116908.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Fans of digging into the Android system will either have to refuse contactless payments via phone or purchase a new gadget.  As long as there are no root rights, everything will work fine.  But it‚Äôs worth hacking the device, as ‚ÄúAndroid Pei‚Äù will cease to fulfill its functions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Installation </h2><p>  Now consider the process of working with the application.  How to use Android Pay?  In fact, everything is simpler than it seems.  The hardest part is linking a bank card.  This will be discussed later. </p><p>  First, install the appropriate application.  It is done like this: </p><ol><li>  Open Google Play. </li><li>  Pass authorization in the application. </li><li>  Type in search Android Pay. </li><li>  Select the proposed result. </li><li>  Download the corresponding application. </li><li>  Run the received document. </li><li>  Follow the on-screen instructions to complete initialization. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Android Pay electronic payment system is sometimes tried to fake.  It is worth paying attention to the developer of the program.  The original application will have the signature "Google Inc."  It is advisable to avoid downloading the utility from third-party sites. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which devices support android pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2116912.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Customization </h2><p>  At the above steps, the preparation for the use of contactless payments via phones is not downloaded.  Now that Android Pay is installed on your smartphone, you need to properly configure the program. </p><p>  The setup guide will look something like this: </p><ol><li>  Launch Android Pay. </li><li>  In the menu that appears, enter the bank card details (validity period, number, CVV). </li><li>  Provide information about the owner of the plastic. </li><li>  Enter the address of the place of residence. </li><li>  Prescribe a mobile phone number. </li><li>  Enter the operation confirmation code.  He will come to mobile in the form of SMS. </li><li>  Click on the "Allow" button.  It will automatically be displayed after entering the code to add a card. </li></ol><p>  It is done.  Now you can use Android Pay.  Sberbank, like any of the banks listed above, will allow you to pay by phone for purchases in stores or online after completing the steps. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Other cards </h2><p>  Android Pay has support for additional cards, discount plastics and gift certificates.  They can be added to the program menu if desired.  Then there will be no need to always carry the listed cards with you. </p><p>  How to cope with the task?  You will need to follow the manual of the following type: </p><ol><li>  Open Android Pay. </li><li>  Press the round plus button. </li><li>  Select the type of plastic to be added. </li><li>  Scan a barcode or manually dial a card number. </li><li>  Save changes. </li></ol><p>  Quick, easy, convenient.  In reality, everything is much simpler than it seems.  The studied option is not supported by all banks.  Android Pay appeared in Russia in early 2017.  And therefore, so far the list of financial organizations is limited.  But discount and gift cards can be added to the program any.  After all, contactless payments by phone are theoretically possible at all retail outlets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="android pay banks" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2116913.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About use </h2><p>  We got acquainted with the main stages of preparation for using Android Pei.  Now what? </p><p>  You can pay using your mobile device.  To do this, you need only 2 actions.  Namely: </p><ol><li>  Unlock phone. </li><li>  Bring the smartphone to the payment terminal. </li></ol><p>  In just a few seconds, data will be read from a mobile phone.  Money will be debited from the added bank plastic.  Everything is very simple. </p><h2>  Without unlock </h2><p>  In some cases, Android Pay <span>(Sberbank, VTB or</span> another financial institution - it doesn‚Äôt matter who accepts the funds) uses only one action.  It is allowed to bypass the requirement to unlock a mobile device. </p><p>  In other words, in certain cases, a citizen simply has to get a telephone and attach it to a special reader.  This arrangement is allowed if the payment is more than 1,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Multiple cards </h2><p>  What should I do if a user has several cards added to the Android Pay program?  What plastic will be debited from? </p><p>  This parameter is set by the user.  When linking several cards to Android Pay, you will have to open the application and select the necessary plastic there.  It will not work otherwise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="android pay application" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2116914.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Not all stores </h2><p>  It is also important to remember that Android Pay in Russia does not work in all retail outlets.  Although theoretically, the application should function equally well in every store. </p><p>  Firstly, the studied opportunity cannot be implemented in retail outlets without the support of bank transfer. </p><p>  Secondly, the reader must have a chip for contactless payments.  Fortunately, almost all modern non-cash machines are equipped with this part. </p><p>  It is advisable to look at the entrance to the store (or at the checkout) support for "Android Pay".  Then the user will be able to accurately answer whether he will be able to use the studied program or not. </p><h2>  Watch and Android Pay </h2><p>  Surprisingly, modern citizens can make contactless payments using special watches.  They are manufactured by mobile phone manufacturers.  Not all gadget models have support for Android Pay. </p><p>  Today, this option is available on Huawei Watch 2 and on AlGi Watch Sport.  How to act in such circumstances? </p><p>  There is no difference between the phone and the clock in our case.  The user will have to download Android Pay for the gadget, install the program and attach the plastic to the device.  To pay with the help of the listed devices, simply turn them on and bring them to the reader. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We found out what Android Pay can do.  Banks in Russia support the studied option.  But so far, there are few financial organizations that accept contactless electronic payments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic pay system android pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2116911.jpg"></div>
