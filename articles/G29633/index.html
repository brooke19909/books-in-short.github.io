    <p>  It is immediately worth noting that traveling with this travel agency is not just a bus ride and several excursions.  "Accord Tour" offers to explore the most colorful cities in Europe.  And in each of them an exciting excursion program awaits you. </p><p>  In each country and city, the company has its own guide, which helps tourists get acquainted with the traditions and customs of the state.  Here they will tell you about the secrets of ancient cities, take them for wine tasting, offer a walk along the picturesque streets, give you the opportunity to watch various shows and concerts, and even, if possible, take them to a festival or a national holiday. </p><p>  Prague, Paris, Berlin, Luxembourg, Brussels, Dresden, Bucharest, Brasov, Karlovy Vary, Sofia, Belgrade - nothing is impossible with the Accord Tour travel company. </p><p>  Now it’s worth talking about some technical points.  The company offers different tours - it can be either a two-day weekend or an exciting two-week trip.  Prices, by the way, depend on exactly when you book a tour - the closer to the departure date, the more expensive the trip will be.  There are routes that include night crossings between cities - they are cheaper, but, on the other hand, not every tourist can tolerate nights on a bus well. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The most popular tours for lovers </h2>

    <p>  Traveling in Ukraine is another interesting offer from Accord Tour.  Lviv, for example, is an amazing tourist city with a rich history and traditions.  You will have the opportunity to travel almost the whole country in a short time.  Tourists can see the Tustan defense complex in Truskavets, visit the Carpathians, see the Shipot waterfall, see how a real cheese factory works, etc. After all, your own country is no less rich in miracles than the rest of Europe. </p><h2>  Search for a travel companion </h2><p>  There is another interesting opportunity offered by the travel agency Accord Tour.  Bus tours and beach vacations are, of course, an incredible adventure.  On the other hand, a vacation alone can be less fun.  That is why the travel company has organized a search system for travel companions.  Perhaps someone wants to go to the same countries as you - here they will help you meet, pick up a tour and discuss the details of the trip.  And, in addition to a fabulous tour, you will have the opportunity to make new friends. </p><h2>  Travel company "Accord Tour": customer reviews </h2>
