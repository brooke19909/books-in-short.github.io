    <h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, they generally liked this hotel.  So, according to our compatriots, Club Koggala Village 3 * (Sri Lanka) is a very comfortable hotel with its own green territory, where you can take a pleasant walk and relax in the shade of sprawling trees and palm trees.  Also, guests can swim in the pool and sunbathe, sitting on comfortable sun loungers. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The vast majority of travelers staying at Club Koggal knew that the hotel was located quite far from the airport and from many attractions.  However, all these disadvantages are outweighed by the fact that the hotel is located right on a gorgeous beach on the ocean.  Therefore, the need to spend several hours traveling to interesting places is more than compensated by the proximity of the stunning water element. </p>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The housing stock of the hotel in question includes apartments in buildings, as well as one-story bungalows.  According to our compatriots, the latter often only populate tourists from Western Europe.  The bungalows are located on the beach itself, and even splashes of water reach them.  A very good option, according to many guests, are the rooms on the second floor of the main building.  They offer a magnificent view of the azure water surface.  The beach can be reached in just a minute. </p><p>  As for the equipment of the rooms, then, as most travelers note, the atmosphere in them has been updated for quite some time.  Nevertheless, tourists claim that the apartments here are very comfortable and clean.  Furniture and appliances, though not new, are in good working condition.  If any breakdowns occur, then the hotel staff will quickly eliminate them immediately after the guests contact the reception. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  When booking accommodation in Club Koggala Village 3 * (Sri Lanka), you can choose one of the food options: only breakfast or half board.  Many travelers recommend staying on the second option, as there are not many places near the hotel where you can eat.  In addition, eating here will be somewhat cheaper. </p><p>  The restaurant at the hotel is located on the second floor of one of the buildings.  Its room is equipped with large panoramic windows with a magnificent view of the Indian Ocean.  For breakfast, you will be offered a standard set consisting of eggs cooked in different variations, sausages, bacon, pastries, cheese, as well as a wide variety of fresh fruits - pineapples, mangoes, papaya, apples, etc. During dinner, visitors to the restaurant will be offered Try a variety of dishes, both local and international.  Moreover, some of them are very sharp, and some are suitable for European tourists who are not used to such cuisine. </p><p>  Near the hotel there are also shops and a market where you can always buy the necessary products. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  The issue of having free Wi-Fi access at the hotel is of concern to most tourists from many different countries today.

So here you can have a good time chatting with family and friends staying at home. </p>

    <h2>  Service, staff </h2><p>  In general, our compatriots have no complaints about the service in this hotel.  So, the rooms are cleaned carefully enough every day.  Maids do not forget to add personal hygiene products on time, change towels and bed linen.  In addition, all hotel staff are always smiling and friendly towards guests.  The only negative for some of our compatriots was the fact that the hotel staff did not speak Russian.  Therefore, you will have to explain here only in English. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  This item, judging by the reviews, left the guests of Club Koggala Village 3 * (Sri Lanka) the most unforgettable experience.  So, our compatriots claim that a beach holiday here simply can not fail!  After all, the hotel is located on the most stunning beach of Sri Lanka - Koggale.  It has a length of five kilometers.  Here you can have a great time with different categories of tourists - families with children, and young people who love noisy parties, and couples in love who seek solitude, and those who just want to relax and take a break from city everyday life, comfortably sitting in a sunbed, taking sunny baths and admiring the ocean. </p><p>  According to tourists, it‚Äôs not recommended to swim right next to the hotel, as strong waves are often observed here.  However, you can walk aside a few hundred meters to the lagoon.  It is already safe to swim in it. </p><h2>  The best time to relax, weather </h2><p>  Sri Lanka has two main seasons - rainy and dry.  So, almost 95% of the total annual rainfall falls in the months from May to October.  However, if you decide to go to a place like Sri Lanka in July, you will not be disappointed either.  So, the air temperature during the day at this time is about 28 degrees Celsius.  Precipitation falls mainly at night.  Therefore, those who come to this country in the summer season, as a rule, do not complain at all.  After all, during the holidays they, as a rule, do not have to adjust their plans very often because of the rain.  In addition, during the day they are mostly strong, but short-lived.  So Sri Lanka in July will definitely not disappoint you.  Therefore, if your vacation falls on the summer, do not hesitate to go to this wonderful country.  The weather in Sri Lanka is also warm in other months.  But in winter there is practically no rainfall.  The air temperature is about 28-30 degrees, as well as in the summer season.  The only exceptions are mountainous areas.  Here, the air temperature can drop even up to +10 degrees. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Since the Koggala Village Hotel is located in a quiet place far from the bustle of the city, you will have to get to all the entertainment in a tuk-tuk.  In general, many experienced travelers, based on their own experience, are advised not to plan many long trips.  Especially if they are designed for one day.  Indeed, in this case, you will leave the hotel in the early morning or even at night, and the journey in only one direction will take 6-7 hours.  Thus, having arrived, for example, on a safari, you most likely want not to ride in the heat on a typewriter without air conditioning, but to relax in the shade and coolness. </p><p>  As for routes nearby, tourists are advised to visit <span>tea plantations.</span>  It will also be interesting to go to Lake Koggala and take a boat ride on it.  Halle, with an ancient fort, is 12 kilometers from the hotel.  Also be sure to visit the turtle farm.  In addition, in the vicinity of the hotel there are several Buddhist temples. </p><p>  With regard to movement around the island, it is most convenient to use the services of the so-called tuk-tuker - tuk-tuk drivers for this purpose.  You are likely to meet them right at the entrance to the hotel.  They will be happy to take you to a store or market, and organize an individual excursion for you.  They can also order fresh seafood, which they even prepare for you on their own. </p><p>  Guests can rent a bicycle to explore the area.  However, it is unlikely that it will be convenient for you to transport on it, for example, products purchased at the supermarket. </p>
