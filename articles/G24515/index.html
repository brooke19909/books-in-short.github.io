    <p>  After completing military service, he continued his military education at the Higher Tank Command School in Chelyabinsk.  At that time, the situation in the Chechen Republic became aggravated.  Igor Andreyevich Grigorashenko, whose biography was associated only with military service, himself expressed a desire to go to a hot spot. </p><p>  First, he was transferred to Kabardino-Balkaria.  There Igor received distribution in the military unit of the city of Prokhladny.  In the rank of senior lieutenant, Grigorashenko was commander of a motorized rifle platoon, and later commander of a reconnaissance company. </p><h2>  Chechen campaign </h2><p>  In December 1994, Lieutenant Grigorashenko went on a business trip to Mozdok.  Once in this city, he wrote a petition to be transferred to the front line. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grigorashenko Igor Andreevich Grave" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/1932331.jpg" width="388"></div>

During the battle for the city, the tank commanded by Grigorashenko was shot down.  The hero himself received a concussion, for a while he even lost his sight.  Grigorashenko was taken to a medical unit with wounds. </p><p>  Igor so much wanted to fight and did not want to leave his unit without a leader.  Having rested only one day, he refused to be transferred to the hospital, saying that he wanted to avenge his own, so he refused to leave the front line.  Grigorashenko received a new tank. </p><h2>  Second wound </h2><p>  The new tank under the leadership of Grigorashenko was again knocked out in just two days.  This happened during the assault on the positions of Chechen fighters, commanded by the unrecognized president of the Chechen Republic, Dzhokhar Dudayev. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grigorashenko igor callsign" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35697/1932398.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Igor again managed to survive, the wounded got to his own.  At the same time, he managed to remove a driver and a gunner from a burning car.  The tank was put out, but in order to remain in service, he needed serious repairs.  Grigorashenko moved to a third car. </p><h2>  Meeting with Nevzorov </h2><p>  It was on these days that the officer met with the famous journalist Alexander Nevzorov, who at that time was a deputy of the State Duma.  Nevzorov was just filming a documentary about the battles for Grozny, which was called "Hell." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="participation in the first Chechen war" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/1932328.jpg"></div>

He was remembered by many viewers of the picture, because in concise and strong terms he outlined the reasons for which he was fighting.  Igor noted that he is fighting here for his country, for his children and his land.  He proudly declared that he was a hereditary Cossack and was ready to lay his head for his land.  After all, if you give Chechnya, then soon all of Russia will collapse, Grigorashenko said. </p><h2>  Hero's death </h2><p>  Igor Grigorashenko, whose call sign, or rather a child‚Äôs nickname - Captain, was mortally wounded the very next day after this interview.  On the way, he came under intense mortar fire, was taken to the hospital with multiple shrapnel wounds.  Three days later, Igor Andreevich died in the arms of doctors. </p><p>  Posthumously he was awarded the rank of senior lieutenant.  Valor and courage Grigorashenko noted not only his fellow soldiers, but also the command.  Therefore, it was marked by military leadership.  He was awarded the Order of Courage posthumously. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grigorashenko Igor Andreevich biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35697/1932392.jpg" width="542"></div>

    <p>  Grigorashenko received the award for the excellent performance of special tasks of the leadership.  The corresponding decree was signed by the president of Russia.  From the Cossacks he was awarded a posthumously silver cross. </p><p>  The hero‚Äôs family was helped not only by numerous acquaintances and colleagues, but also by media people.  For example, Yuri Shevchuk sent money to his relatives.  The musician met with Igor in Chechnya.  Grigorashenko became one of the Russian symbols of that campaign.  Captively and accurately, he reflected everything that many who felt on the front line felt and worried in those days.  Grigorashenko Igor Andreevich, the awards for which have always not been the main thing in this life, remained in the memory of many who served in Chechnya. </p><p>  Having finished his documentary "Hell", Nevzorov sent a videotape to the widow.  On it, Igor sends greetings to his family and friends, saying that everything is fine with him.  At home he had a daughter, who at that time was not even one year old. </p><p>  Grigorashenko Igor Andreevich, whose grave is located in Prokhladny, became one of the most recognizable heroes of that war. </p><h2>  "Purgatory" </h2><p>  Grigorashenko is not only one of the characters in the documentary "Hell", but also a prototype of the hero of the war film "Purgatory", which was filmed in 1997. </p><p>  In the film, the character's name is recognizable - Igor Grigorashchenko.  The picture is dedicated to fierce battles for the corps of the city hospital, located in the Chechen capital.  At that time, it was occupied by Russian troops, led by Colonel Suvorov, who lost his eye during the next shelling (his role was played by <span>Viktor Stepanov).</span> </p><p>  The film shows in detail the events of January 4, 1995, when the hero of our article was mortally wounded.  On this day, the Chechen field commander Dukuz Israpilov (performed by Dmitry Nagiyev) surrounded the hospital with a detachment and launched a massive assault.  Not only local volunteers fought for the Chechens, but also mercenaries who came to the war to earn money.  Among them are Arabs, Ukrainian nationalists and even Baltic snipers. </p><p>  The Russian detachment that held the hospital buildings was in a difficult position.  Communication with the headquarters was completely absent; there was no way to contact other units of the federal forces that could provide support.  Because of this, their own artillery bombarded them, not figuring out where their own, and where strangers. </p><h2>  The image in the movie </h2><p>  In Purgatory, the role of Grigorashenko is played by Roman Zhilkin.  This was his first work on the big screen.  After that, the actor was noted in the series "Streets of Broken Lights", "Agent of National Security", "Black Raven", "Foundry". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grigorashenko Igor Andreevich Awards" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/1932336.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Roman also played many roles in feature films, mostly also related to military or bandit themes.  This is Sergey Bodrov‚Äôs dramatic action movie ‚ÄúSisters‚Äù, Yegor Konchalovsky‚Äôs action movie ‚ÄúAntikiller‚Äù, Vladimir Zaikin‚Äôs comedy ‚ÄúOn a Turn‚Äù. </p><h2>  Feat Grigorashenko in the film </h2><p>  The picture shows how, during fierce battles for the corps of a medical institution, a tank led by Lieutenant Grigorashchenko is surrounded by enemies.  The reason for this is a rupture of the right track. </p><p>  Chechen fighters blocked everyone in the car.  On the same day, the tankers met with the separatist commander Dukuz Israpilov, who invited them, first of all Grigorashchenko, to join and fight for the forces of the Chechen Republic.  For this they were promised not only to save their lives, but also a generous salary - about five thousand dollars a month.  At that time, it was serious money, and much more than what the Russian soldiers could earn. </p><p>  The Chechen commander gave the Russian military personnel only five minutes to consider this proposal.  He tried to persuade a brave and experienced tanker to his side.  He obviously lacked such people.  Israpilov began to spread extensively about the futility and low prestige of service in the ranks of the Russian army.  He greatly belittled the role and importance of the domestic armed forces, trying to convince others of his innocence. </p><p>  At the same time, Israpilov pressed that the Russian troops were actually fighting on Chechen territory, he was fighting here for every patch of land and sky, and the Russian soldiers were strangers who, moreover, did not receive their small salaries for six months. </p><h2>  Death in the movie </h2><p>  The prototype of the hero of our article dies in the film a terrible death.  He categorically refuses to obey Israpilov and go over to the side of the militants.  And he does it in a pointed manner, showing his independence.  He uses the five minutes that he is given to reflect on his future in order to open cannon fire at the positions of the militants and provide powerful fire support to break through his fellow soldiers who are striving for one of the hospital buildings. </p><p>  In response, the militants open fire from grenade launchers.  Grigorashchenkova captured.  They are publicly crucified on the cross.  Thus ends his glorious and fearless war. </p>
