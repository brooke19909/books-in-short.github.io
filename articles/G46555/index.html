Many go here for an unforgettable experience.  And this hotel is considered one of the best options for a vacation in Paphos. </p><p>  The hotel's private beach is awarded the EU Blue Flag for cleanliness.  It is located in the immediate vicinity of the complex.  Paphos Harbor and the city center are also nearby. </p><p>  The hotel has excellent restaurants, two swimming pools, a SPA center, a golf course, a fitness center and much more.  VIP services are also provided (besides the usual ones).  By the way, local restaurants have a great reputation.  And that is why they make demands on the appearance of customers.  Guests must comply with the dress code - evening wear and, of course, no beach dresses.  But in return they find themselves in a real gastronomic paradise.  After all, the hotel has not only a restaurant with international cuisine, but also an institution offering Japanese cuisine, Italian and Mediterranean.  There is also a cozy tavern. </p><p>  The hotel has rooms of various categories.  There are budget, for 1-2 guests.  There are so-called Superior Cabana rooms.  Even the spacious, luxurious two-bedroom penthouse suites can be booked. </p><p>  All in all, this hotel is also noteworthy.  But in which particular variant of the same name it is better to relax - it is up to potential guests to decide.  The decision depends on individual preferences. </p>
