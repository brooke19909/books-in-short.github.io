Such fabric is made from linen or cotton fibers.  The optimal density indicator is in the range of 140 - 150 g / m <sup>2</sup> .  What is teak fabric, we already understood, but what is made of it? </p><h2>  Fabric use </h2><p>  Teak is considered a very strong and durable material, which allows you to produce a huge range of products.  Basically, things are made of fabric that create life and comfort around a person.  This material is used for: </p><ul><li>  Production of furniture upholstery and covers. </li><li>  Sewing curtains and bedspreads. </li><li>  Making summer shoes. </li><li>  Tailoring. </li><li>  Production of blankets, feather-beds and pillows. <div class="photo" data-original="cadieuxinteriors.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Teak bedding." class="if uuid-3198683" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/138011/3198683.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  In the age of modern technology, the material, when properly processed, is used for the manufacture of blinds and roller blinds.  In addition, theater curtains, blackout curtains are made of teak, and furniture is upholstered.  Work clothes are also sewn from this fabric. </p><p>  Everyone has known striped mattresses since childhood.  They were in kindergarten, and in the house, and in dormitories of educational institutions.  Soft pillows and warm blankets were also sewn using teak.  Most recently, this material began to be used for the manufacture of sportswear and special equipment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Composition and characteristics </h2><p>  What is teak fabric, what does it consist of?  The main advantage of the material is its composition.  For the manufacture of fabric, only natural fibers, such as cotton, linen and hemp, are taken.  It can be monophonic, one-colored and with a printed pattern.  As already mentioned, only natural fibers are part of the teak fabric.  That is why it has a number of positive qualities: </p><ul><li>  The fabric is durable. </li><li>  It has good breathability. </li><li>  Color is not washed out. </li><li>  The material is soft and pleasant to the touch. </li><li>  Eco-friendly and hypoallergenic material. </li><li>  Low creasing of the fabric and low extensibility. <div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="teak upholstery" class="if uuid-3198694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/138011/3198694.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  The increased density of the fabric also has a downside: reliable products and certain sewing skills are required to make products from this material. </p><h2>  Types of fabric </h2><p>  What kind of fabric is teak, we have already examined.  We distinguish the following types of it: </p><ul><li>  <em>Pillowcase.</em>  It has a low density.  Bedding is made from such material. </li><li>  <em>The curtain fabric</em> has an average degree of density.  From the name you can understand that in this case they sew curtains or use fabric to make home textiles. </li><li>  <em>The mattress fabric</em> has a high degree of density.  Used for the manufacture of mattresses, since the service life of the material is very long. <div class="photo" data-original="cloud9fabrics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fabric for bedding." class="if uuid-3198681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/138011/3198681.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  According to reviews, teak fabric has only positive recommendations.  She was loved for wear resistance and strength.  Bed linens made of such material take first place in demand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to care for fabric </h2><p>  Teak fabrics and their products are easy to care for.  You do not need any additional knowledge or special preparations for caring for the canvas.  You should know only some nuances regarding what the tick does not like.  Firstly, hot water can damage the material.  Secondly, textiles do not like soaking.  Thirdly, do not use potent household chemicals.  If you adhere to these rules, then the material and products from it will last a long time. </p><p>  We already learned that teak is a moisture-loving material.  Damp air can harm textiles, so you need to store it in a ventilated area. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  In the late Middle Ages, teak was used by both the poor and rich and wealthy people.  Fashionistas sewed themselves corsets from this canvas and shone at social events in such dresses.  The lower layers loved this fabric for strength and longevity, which in their life situation was opportune. </p><p>  The word teak itself has Dutch roots.  Dutch tijk or English tick can be translated as "cover".  This is a very symbolic definition of material in our time.  Indeed, from teak, tents and backpacks are sewn, furniture is upholstered in them, sewing covers and many other products that serve for a long time. </p><p>  In the 70s, teak dresses with lots of pockets, shoulder straps and a wide belt were at the very peak of fashion.  Homemade needlewomen were inundated with orders from fashionistas.  Every girl dreamed of having such an outfit in her wardrobe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Different teak colors." class="if uuid-3198697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/138011/3198697.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see in the photo, the teak fabric has mostly light colors.  But its color scheme depends on the production method.  A smoothly dyed canvas is obtained by dyeing a white fabric.  The print on the surface of the matter is obtained by ornamental coloring.  By weaving the dyed threads, a multi-colored teak comes out. </p><p>  In this article, teak fabric was examined: what it is, where it is used and how to care for it.  This material can be attributed to the most durable and strong fabrics.  Skillful seamstresses like to use it for sewing bed linen, kitchen towels, curtains and many other household products.  If you properly care for and keep the teak, it will last for many years and will not lose its appearance. </p>
