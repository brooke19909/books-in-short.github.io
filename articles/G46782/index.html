The master class is specially selected for beginner needlewomen.  You will learn how to make not only flat, but also three-dimensional panels.  In the latest version, quilling flowers can be used as a decorative bouquet. </p><h2>  The basics of needlework </h2><p>  Quilling is the twisting of paper strips into certain elements from which the paintings are “assembled”.  For this needlework, special paper is sold, cut into narrow strips.  It differs from other types of density, which affects the stability of the shape of the elements.  A special <span>quilling tool</span> can be replaced with a toothpick and a ruler with different circles. </p><p>  What elements are used for creating quilling pictures for beginners? </p><ul><li>  "Tight roll."  Round the edge of the strip, insert it into the toothpick, wind it into a ball.  Glue the other end to PVA and remove from the toothpick.  Cores of flowers are made from such a roll.  And if you push its middle, forming a "cone", then you can get a berry. </li><li>  "Free roll."  Also spin the paper on a toothpick.  Remove the resulting roll and put it in the circle of the ruler.  So the element takes the size of the circle.  Glue the second end of the roll.  From it and form different shapes. </li><li>  "Curl."  Bend the strip in half.  From each edge you make a roll.  Glue the end. </li></ul>

Free roll slightly squeeze into an oval, press the edge, getting a petal.  Rounded flowers are created from these elements.  If the “drop” is bent on one side along the length, an element with an inclination is obtained. </li><li>  "Eye".  Squeeze the roll from two sides - you get a sharp sheet. </li><li>  "Sheet".  If the ends of the "eyes" are bent in opposite directions, then a curved sheet can be made. </li><li>  "Rhombus".  The corners of the "eyes" squeeze in opposite directions, forming a square. </li><li>  "Triangle".  The rounded part of the drop must be flattened in the shape of a triangle.  Squeezing the "free roll" in three places, you can get an equilateral figure. </li><li>  The sunken petal.  Take the “triangle” by the top, pushing its base inward.  From these petals are obtained bells. </li><li>  "Semicircle".  The base of the “free roll” is made even, clamping the opposite corners. </li><li>  "Arrow".  If you make a “triangle” from a “drop”, and then squeeze the base in half, forming sharp corners, you get petals for cornflowers. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quilling pictures photo" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/812652.jpg" width="328"></div></li></ul><h2>  Quilling Secrets </h2><p>  Each master has his own secrets for the manufacture of elements, patterns and figures.  Some needlewomen use a comb to form a multilayer flower or <span>butterfly wing</span> when weaving stripes <span>.</span>  Or, needles are stuck into the polystyrene according to the pattern and braided with stripes, creating interesting bends and patterns.  So you can create "zigzag" leaves like roses, grapes, maple. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Unusual quilling paintings can be made from simple petals of different colors.  With a pencil, draw the borders of the grass, trunk, crown and fill the sheet with "petals", "curlicues", "eyes", "leaves". </p><p>  If you combine several colors in one element, you can make a brighter picture.  Mixing colors allows you to make the picture more realistic.  To keep the elements in shape, they can be glued along the edge with a strip.  This technique allows you to fix the desired bend.  Many craftsmen do butterflies, <span>oak leaves.</span> </p><p>  Lush flowers can be obtained from elements made of paper plastic.  For example, a wide strip is wound to a “tight roll”, one edge of which is cut into thin petals.  The end is glued, the workpiece is removed, and the petals are straightened. </p>

    <h2>  Quilling paintings: a master class on lilacs </h2><p>  Three-dimensional image will attract attention at a glance.  Volumetric work can be created from improvised materials using several layers.  We will get acquainted with a master class on making lilacs. </p><p>  From the lilac paper, make the petals an eye element.  Glue the part into flowers of three and four parts.  The other half is suitable for plot correction.  Use several shades of lilac, and decorate the middle with yellow beads.  So the flower will turn out more colorful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On cardboard, draw small and large sheets of lilacs.  Make crescents (bend the “eye” from two sides into a semicircle).  Place the elements on the template, connect them together.  Glue the edges of the sheet with a strip passing into the trunk. </p><p>  Mark the location of the lilac branches.  Glue the skewers or wire.  First work on the bottom layer, and then fill out the foreground.  If you want to create a composition, then draw a background or glue a vase.  Try to make the flowers small, then the lilac will look like a real one. </p><p>  Using a color print, "natural" quilling paintings are created.  You can see the photo of the finished master class below. </p>

    <h2>  Play of color </h2><p>  The print allows you to create not just a panel, but a real picture.  If you can draw, then you can make a background yourself.  Choose paper from the photo, then the plot will completely convey natural colors.  For example, you want to depict autumn rowan.  Buy paper in green, swamp, brown, yellow, red, orange. </p><p>  Place dark shapes in the background or on the shadow side.  Place light shades in front, on a <span>lighter background.</span>  If there should be a white spot on the parts, we recommend resorting to one of the following techniques (this is how many quilling paintings are created).  The master class involves three options for solving the problem. </p><ul><li>  Connect a shape from several elements.  For example, glue a rowan leaf on a strip (branch) of seven "eyes" of different shades. </li><li>  Make an element of different colors.  For example, the same <span>rowan leaf is</span> completely made of green paper, and only in the middle of some elements is a light shade. </li><li>  The whole picture is made of white paper, and then painted with paints. </li></ul><p>  Rhinestones and microbeads are glued to some elements.  In order for volumetric details to keep their shape (flowers, leaves, animals), you can apply transparent glue to the wrong side or paint the top layer with special glue-paint. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quilling paintings flowers" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/812657.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Quilling paintings: a master class for beginners </h2><ol><li>  Mark with a pencil the arrangement of the vase and flowers. </li><li>  Cut the shape of the vase from the foam, tighten with a cloth, decorate with braid. </li><li>  Glue to the sheet. </li><li>  Twigs need leaves from the elements of the "eye" and "leaf", as well as flowers from the "cones", which are made using a "tight roll". </li><li>  Glue the flowers on the stem with a convex side, like a lupine. </li><li>  Arrange the leaves. </li><li>  Make a few long branches that you insert into the foam.  From these flowers you get a magnificent bouquet, and not just quilling paintings (photo with a blue lupine). </li><li>  Glue short stems and “grow” flowers with leaves on top. </li><li>  Then insert the finished flowers into the foam base.  Frame the work. </li></ol><p>  This is how quilling paintings are simply made.  Almost any flowers can be made according to this plan.  For example, stick a cone-shaped sepal onto a stalk.  Put petals in a circle in it, and decorate the middle with a “tight roll”. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quilling paintings master class for beginners" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/812651.jpg" width="512"></div>

    <h2>  Ideas for panels or postcards from cones </h2><p>  The vine is made of "convex rolls" (push the taut ball a little, forming the shape of a bowl).  Stick the berries in several layers.  You form a branch and antennae from a spiral.  Leaves are simply cut out of paper, crushing in places of veins. </p><p>  Acorns are made of two cones.  One forms the fetus, and the pericarp is made from the "calyx".  Inside, stick-wires are glued.  Leaves are collected according to the oak leaf pattern.  That is, you connect the "eyes" together, and glue the edges with a strip of paper, adjusting the shape of the sheet. </p><p>  Rosehip is also made of two long cones.  Insert a bundle of thin wire or strips from one edge, and attach the stem from the other.  Leaves cut out of paper or form from the "eyes". </p><p>  Spherical flowers are collected from long cones.  Glue the first row in a circle, put a new layer on it.  When the ball is formed, the middle becomes convex.  In the last row, insert the cones, forming half the figure.  From hemispheres you make floral quilling paintings.  The master class on the formation of the whole ball needs to be repeated.  That is, turn the hemisphere over and glue it in rows of cones. </p>

    <h2>  Brief Summary </h2><p>  Quilling is convenient in that the same image can be represented in different ways.  For example, willow is collected from white "eyes" and swampy sunken petals.  The branch is represented by a strip of paper.  And you can experiment with cones and build volumetric "bunnies". </p>
