Often, military clashes were an integral element of the foreign policy of many countries.  Today we will talk about relations between Turkey and Greece. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greek Turkish war" class="if uuid-2867867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2867867.jpg"></div><h2>  First <span>Greek-Turkish War of</span> 1897 </h2><p>  This military clash is known in history as the Thirty Day War or the "Black 97th."  At that time, Turkey was called the Ottoman Empire, whose ruler sought to subjugate the territory of the Mediterranean. </p><p>  The reason for the first Greek-Turkish war was the discontent of the Christian population about.  Crete.  Turks spread their influence over vast territories.  The Christians in Crete rebelled against the Turkish yoke. </p><h2>  The main outcome of the conflict </h2><p>  In 1897, on about.  Crete was established autonomy, patronized by which Europe.  In April of the same year, ships of six countries approached the island: France, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Germany, Russia, Great Britain.  3,000 soldiers and officers landed on Crete. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greco-Turkish war of 1897" class="if uuid-2867887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2867887.jpg"></div><p>  I must say that the Greek-Turkish war can be called conditionally.  The fact is that on behalf of Greece, at the conclusion of the ceasefire, mediating countries spoke.  The Ottoman Empire initially demanded: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Concessions of Thessaly. </li><li>  Payments of the amount of 10 million Turkish pounds. </li><li>  The abolition of surrender, i.e., the special legal privileges of the Greeks in Turkey. </li></ol><p>  However, after lengthy negotiations, new armistice terms were formulated.  As a result, Turkey received: </p><ol><li>  Northern ways to the Larissa valley. </li><li>  A reward of 4 million Turkish pounds. </li><li>  Small compensation to Turkish nationals affected by the conflict. </li></ol><p>  In addition, the contract imposed on the Greeks the obligation to host the international financial management commission of Greece. </p><div class="photo" data-original="europe-greece.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greco-Turkish war of 1897" class="if uuid-2867870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2867870.jpg"></div><h2>  The fate of Crete </h2><p>  It must be said that the military significance of the first Greek-Turkish war was insignificant.  As for the political role of the conflict, the signing of a peace treaty significantly increased the credibility of the Turkish Sultan. </p><p>  After some time, Turkish units left Crete, over which an international protectorate was established.  An autonomous government was created on the island.  The final transfer of Crete to Greece took place under the London Agreement in 1913. </p><p>  It should be noted that the first Greek-Turkish war became the only armed conflict of the 19th century, as a result of which Greece had to cede its territories.  The success of the Turks is largely due to the military reforms of Baron von der Goltz.  In addition, the Ottoman army had significant numerical superiority. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Greek-Turkish war of 1919-1922 </h2><p>  In their historiography, the Greeks call this military conflict the Asia Minor Campaign or the Asia Minor Campaign, and the Turks - the Western Front in the War of Independence. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that, despite the fact that this war corresponded to the plans of Greece and was called the war of liberation, the landing of the Greeks in Asia Minor was initiated by the allies of the country, and not by its government.  Initially, their actions were successful.  By 1921, the Greeks were able to occupy almost the entire western territory of Asia Minor.  However, the second Greek-Turkish war ended in their complete defeat. </p><p>  According to some experts, the success of the Turks was made possible thanks to financial and military-technical assistance from Bolshevik Russia in the fall of 1920 and over the next 2 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greco-Turkish war 1974" class="if uuid-2867872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2867872.jpg"></div><h2>  The course of hostilities (briefly) </h2><p>  The first landing of the Greek troops was made as part of the Greek-Turkish war in 1919. In accordance with Art.  7 Mudros truce, Greek troops in mid-May landed in Smyrna.  The reason for this was the desire of Italy to include this territory in the zone of its influence.  England and France opposed this.  After 4 days in the riots provoked by the Italians, more than 70 Turks and Greek soldiers died.  Turkish citizens, outraged by this incident, began to form partisan detachments. </p><p>  By March 1920, the allies of Greece managed to occupy Constantinople.  During the summer, during three campaigns, several more important Turkish cities were captured. </p><p>  The war was complicated by the unstable situation in Greece.  There was a confrontation between supporters of the head of government and the king.  It was so acute that the war in Asia Minor at some point receded into the background. </p><p>  In early August 1920, the Turkish government and representatives of the Entente countries concluded the Treaty of Sevres.  However, the signing of the document did not contribute to the resolution of the conflict.  After this, several bloody battles took place, as well as the massacre in Smyrna.  As a result, the Turks managed to turn the tide of the war in their favor. </p><p>  In 1923, finally, the allies of Greece on the one hand and the Turkish government on the other signed the Lausanne Treaty.  In accordance with it, the Entente countries and Greece refused all claims to Eastern Thrace and Western Anatolia.  From Turkey, in turn, 1.5 million Greeks were expelled.  During the war, more than 40 thousand Greek soldiers died.  Huge losses were among the civilian population. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greco-Turkish war 1919 1922" class="if uuid-2867873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2867873.jpg"></div><h2>  Conflict on about.  Cyprus </h2><p>  After the end of the second war, the relationship between the Turks and Greeks remained calm for more than 40 years.  In 1964, on about.  Cyprus broke out the first interethnic conflict in such a long time.  After 3 years, the situation repeated.  From that moment on, the situation on the island remained extremely tense. </p><p>  A new military clash occurred in 1974. The Greek-Turkish war began this time with the overthrow of the President of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios.  Power passed to a group of radicals led by Nikos Sampson.  He was a member of an underground organization that advocated joining Fr.  Cyprus to Greece. </p><p>  Turkey, in response to what was happening, sent a 10,000-strong army to the island.  As a result, the battle took place on the beach of Pentemili.  In mid-July, a major battle was initiated between Turkish aviation and the Turkish fleet.  On July 23, active skirmishes stopped.  Until the end of August, however, minor clashes were noted. </p><p>  Compared to previous wars, tanks, powerful aircraft, and armored personnel carriers were used.  Toward the end of the war, mainly tank battles took place.  Opponents in turn lost and lost equipment.  At the same time, as experts say, the Greeks used enemy tanks with greater efficiency.  So, in the battle of Skillura, one Greek crew managed to stop two companies of Turkish tanks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kickassfacts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Second Greek Turkish War" class="if uuid-2867884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2867884.jpg"></div><h2>  The results of the last war </h2><p>  The Turkish government justified its actions by the provisions of the Agreement on guarantees of independence about.  Cyprus from 1960. According to the document, the guarantors were Greece, Great Britain and Turkey.  According to the Turks, other parties have not fulfilled their obligations. </p><p>  As a result of the war, Cyprus was divided into North and South.  The northern territories were controlled by the Turkish Cypriots, i.e., actually Turkey.  The southern part remained under the rule of the Greek Cypriots, but in reality Greece. </p>
