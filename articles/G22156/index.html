Everyone who is tired of the bustle of the city comes here to relax.  In these places there are cozy houses, as well as places for tents. </p><h2>  Description of the lake </h2><p>  Kopanskoe is a lake in the Leningrad region that belongs to Kingisepp district.  The reservoir stretched from north to south for almost seven kilometers, becoming wider, now narrower.  The average width is approximately 1.4 km.  The lake is deep enough, in some places it reaches 24 meters.  But this is at the deepest points, since closer to the coast the distance to the bottom is 4 m. In places where a person‚Äôs foot reaches, the bottom is sandy, but silt starts a little further. </p><p>  The lake is picturesque because it is surrounded by neat hills on which pines, aspen, oaks and birches grow.  The Crane Spit stretches from the western side; it is distinguished by white sand and tall pines.  The rest of the shores also have sandy beaches.  Such a landscape can not but like, so many people choose Kopanskoe for relaxation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="copan lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1091670.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The lake is connected to the Gulf of Finland by the flowing Peypei River.  It greatly affects the number and species composition of fish that lives in Kopansky.  If the west wind begins to blow, a reverse flow occurs, brackish water from the bay enters the lake.  But, besides this, many small streams flow into it.  Also from the Suma river to Kopansky there is a channel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rest on the lake </h2><p>  The northern side of the reservoir placed on its shore the sanatorium-sanatorium "Lake Kopanskoe", and there is also a recreation center "Blue" and "Kopan".  But you can stop not only at the base, but in your own tent: every summer, lovers of wild relaxation choose Kopan Lake. </p><p>  The recreation center "Kopan", in addition to cozy houses and cottages, has a campsite on its territory.  This is where many lay out their tent.  But there are tourists who do not have their own camping equipment, so the base has rental equipment: sleeping bags, tents and other things. </p>

    <h2>  Fishing on the lake </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that a fee is charged for fishing on the lake.  The reservoir is replete with many fish: there is perch, pike, ide, bream, pike perch, roach, some come across eel.  The fact is that from the bay along the river, fish go to spawn and often swim in Kopanskoe.  The lake at these moments is rich in large sea roach (about 500 g).  It is also fortunate that this species of fish is well caught on a bunch of maggots or a large larva of a burdock. </p><p>  But you can come to fishing at any time, as perch, pikeperch and pike always live here.  In the summer, it‚Äôs good to catch them on vents, mugs, artificial baits.  If fishing takes place on a boat using an <span>onboard fishing rod, the</span> perch can be caught on the fry, a small perch reacts to the mormyshka. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kopan Lake how to get there by car" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1091669.jpg" width="600"></div>

With the advent of winter, pike, pike perch and perch are caught near <span>reed beds</span> .  To do this, use vertical spinners.  Roach can take mormyshka with a bloodworm. </p><h2>  Silent hunt </h2><p>  But on the lake you can relax in another way.  If you are on the southern shore of a reservoir, head west toward the third sand pit.  There is an unshaded tall <span>spruce forest,</span> as well as birch undergrowths.  It is in these places that you can successfully pick up mushrooms.  For example, as the reviews of mushroom pickers show, in three hours of walking you can pick up about two buckets of chanterelles, about 30 butter and a few other species.  In these places you can find boletus, boletus, birch porcini mushrooms.  There are also berries, such as lingonberries.  Therefore, many, to diversify the rest, choose Kopanskoe. </p><h2>  Lake: how to get there by car </h2>

Both routes depart from Kalischa.  But you can also come to Kopan Lake under your own power.  How to get there by car and what road do you need to go?  Take the Tallinn Highway first.  Having reached the village.  Runners, turn right at Koporye.  When approaching <span>the T-</span> junction in Karlovo, turn left.  After driving through Sista-Palkino, begin to look closely at the shields.  The first will indicate the sanatorium, it must be skipped.  After passing another 3.3 km, after the bridge there will be a shield recreation center "Kopanskoe / fishing-rest", it is here that you need to turn and go to the shield "fishing-rest", which will appear after a kilometer. Here again turn left. When driving along the lake, select convenient parking for relaxation.

    <h2>  Curious story </h2><p>  An unusual story is associated with this lake.  At one time it was considered a secret object.  At the dawn of the 20th century, torpedoes were tested in this place.  After that, here on the lake they were installed on warships.  By the 30s, a military settlement had formed here, various tests were carried out.  But in the war during the retreat, this place was cleared, and all structures were demolished.  Since that period, silence remains on the lake. </p>
