This material is convenient for creating products in that it does not spill, keeps its shape, is very pleasant and obedient in work. </p><h2>  Interesting craft </h2><p>  A goat made of felt, which is very easy to manufacture, can be a toy or a bookmark for a child.  She is a cartoon heroine, a little awkward, but very bright in her earrings and bows - such a fashionista.  So, you need felt of different colors, black threads, needles, glue, paper, pen.  First, we draw a goat on paper, cut the body and head together, legs, arms, horns - separately.  From beige felt, cut the torso with the head, after circling the handle.  Now we will separate the skirt from the paper pattern and cut it out on a light green felt, glue it to the base, decorate with peas. </p>

    <p>  We take the paper base again and cut off the head.  We will do the same procedure with her as with the skirt, we only use beige felt.  We cut out two circles on the white material - these will be the eyes, on them we sew the pupils with black threads, glue them.  From brown felt we prepare a fringe, glue it.  Add the pink nose.  Black threads denote the contours of the nose and mouth.  Now you need to glue the raspberry bow, the threads on it will indicate the folds.  On ears "hang" earrings of light green color.  We proceed to the manufacture of legs and pens - beige felt, horns - yellow felt.  Glue these details to the body.  Now we paste strips of felt of different colors, starting from the neck and ending with the line of the skirt.  Align the edge with the base.  On the legs and handles add the hooves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Craft "Goat" </h2>

    <p>  For the manufacture we use multi-colored felt, holofiber, thread and a needle, four buttons, a bell.  First, we cut out the details of the future goat on paper.  Then, from a brown felt folded in half, we cut the trunk according to the pattern.  Sew on the back from the tail to the crown with a seam.  Next, we sew in the blue horns.  Then we continue to overcast to the tail, leaving a small hole for stuffing.  We stuff it with holofiber, insert the tail and sew it up.  Using this technology, we make legs in light brown and brown.  Sew to the body with buttons. </p><p>  Cut two ears, sew to the head, embroider eyes with black thread.  It remains to hang the bell by the string.  Here is such an original goat made of felt.  It can be a wonderful decoration of the interior. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts for the year of the goat" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/1014651.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  Muzzle </h2><p>  Crafts for the <span>year Goats,</span> made by hand, can decorate the Christmas tree.  The cute face of this horned beauty is made from pieces of beige, yellow and white felt.  Performing it is very simple.  Cut a muzzle from beige felt.  We pass the edge in small stitches.

Based on the previous crafts, you can make a New Year's carnival mask.  Only in this case the size of the face of the goat should be larger.  And accordingly, we will not embroider the eyes, but we will make accurate cuts. </p><h2>  Doll </h2><p>  And how is a goat doll made of felt?  Now we will tell.  We will prepare yellow felt, two beads, a needle, threads, scissors.  First, according to the pattern, we cut out the details of the future toy: the back, the trunk and the muzzle - 2 pieces.  We muzzle details of the muzzle along the front edge.  Next, deploy and sew to the body.  Now we sew the back and front, excluding the head.  Through the top we stuff the goat with synthetic winterizer and sew it up.  After the beads denote the eyes.  Horns can be sewn to a boy-boy, and a flower can be sewn to a girl. </p><h2>  Beauty goat </h2><p>  And here is another cute goat from felt.  To make it, you will need a felt of white and pink color, a synthetic winterizer, scissors, a piece of scarlet ribbon, fluffy white yarn, threads, a needle, glue, a bead, eyes.  First, on a piece of paper we will prepare the details of the pattern, then we will cut out the future goat on them.  The body is cut out of pink felt.  Two such details are needed.  We cut the ears and horns in pairs from white felt.  We attach ears and horns to one part of the body.  Sew body parts to the head.  Then we stuff with a synthetic winterizer, we sew on the head further, also fill with a synthetic winterizer and sew up to the end.  Now we decorate the head.  From fluffy threads we make a bang, fasten with glue, fasten a ribbon on the neck with a bead.  Black thread embroider the mouth.  Glue the eyes.  And our goat is ready.  She will decorate any holiday table.  And if you sew a loop, then you can hang it on a Christmas tree. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts goat" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/1014650.jpg" width="554"></div></h2><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know how to please relatives in the Year of the Goat.
