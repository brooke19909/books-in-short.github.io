    <h2>  The largest outlet in Rome - Castel Romano </h2><p>  This is one of the most important and largest outlets in Italy, owned by McArthurGlen Group, whose similar facilities are available in almost all European countries.  The emphasis is placed on the things of famous fashion designers and designers, but, thanks to its purpose, all products here are sold at very substantial discounts - from 30 to 70 percent.  As you can see, the benefits are unequivocal.  The size of the discount itself depends on whether the item is from the last collection or from the latest.  The tax-free feature also works, which allows you to return another part of the money upon returning home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This outlet was opened in Rome in 2003, it is located at a distance of 25 kilometers from the city center, occupies 25,000 square meters of space, and parking is designed for 2,000 parking spaces.  Nevertheless, the main advantage of Castel Romano is its 113 boutiques of leading Italian and world brands such as Calvin Klein, Reebok, Puma, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Roberto Cavalli, Diesel, Patrizia Pepe, Nike, Pal Zileri, Ermenegildo Zegna, La Perla and many others.  Here people of all ages and both sexes will find their thing.  The choice is really huge, and the product is no different from what is sold in boutiques in the city center, only here it is half the price.  You can buy everything: clothes, electronics, accessories, leather products, cosmetics and perfumes, gifts, household goods and so on.  The only problems are with finding shoes of a specific size.  Discounts in season can reach fantastic 90%. </p>

It is located at Via della Pace - Localit√† Pascolaro.  The mode of its operation is the same as the previous one we are considering.  The products here are represented by approximately 150 brands and, which is typical, most of them are Italian.  The choice of shoes, women's and men's clothing, accessories and other branded items is huge, as in other similar shopping centers.  You just need to keep in mind that in Valmontone, tax-free, unfortunately, do not issue.  You can get in the following ways: </p><ol><li>  The Fashion Bus - a special shuttle bus that leaves on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays from Via Marsala, 29 from Terracaf√® at 10 a.m.  Ticket for an adult - 7 euros, for a child - 5 euros.  There are many who wish, so it is recommended to worry about the ticket in advance. </li><li>  Near the place where this outlet in Rome is located, there is the Rainbow Mandicland amusement park, so there is the opportunity to get a free shuttle bus. </li><li>  By electric train to the railway station Valmontone from Termini, ticket - 3 euros.  It takes about 40 minutes to go, trains run every hour.  Next take a taxi.  The distance is 5 km. </li></ol><h2>  Outlets in the center of Ryma </h2>

    <p>  Most of these shopping centers are located at some distance from the capital of Italy.  The question arises: "Are there outlets in Rome, how to get to them?"  As we well understand, in the centers of big cities you rarely see a huge shopping center due to competition.  They can become an insurmountable obstacle for small expensive boutiques, so they try to prevent them from going to such places.  Nevertheless, in the center of the Italian capital there are several outlets that are able to please their customers with prices and choices. </p><p>  One of these is the Techer Outlet.  In Rome, he occupies a special position.  Few people can offer, for example, Gigli, Armani, Fendi, RoccoBarocc, D&amp;G, Versace and other brands with a 50-60% discount all year round.  For comparison, several prices: blouses and shirts from Armani can be bought from 45 euros, jeans - from 50 euros.  There was even a cocktail dress for 25 euros from Sandro Ferrone.  In the city center there is a couple of profitable outlets - Antonella and Moda Stock, where a 70% discount is considered <span>to be the order of things.</span>  A big plus of these objects of trade - they can be reached without problems by public transport. </p><h2>  Assortment of Roman Outlets - Lucky or Not? </h2>

    <p>  What can be said here?  Everyone who goes shopping in these shopping centers should remember that luck is the case here, like a mushroom picker when going to the forest.  The fact that you visited an outlet in Rome does not guarantee that you will return from there happy.  The more shopaholics there will be with you there, the more likely it is that the assortment of a certain product of the right size can be both large and small.  So if you want to have a good choice, then go to a little-known outlet where there will not be such an influx of buyers.  In addition to the assortment, you will also guess at prices. </p><h2>  Some tips for shopaholics </h2><p>  Many of our compatriots over the years have visited outlets in Rome.  Reviews are very diverse: both enthusiastic and negative.  After listening to them, smart travelers made their conclusions on how not to miscalculate and leave the shopping center as satisfied as possible.  First, choose outlets unknown to the general public.  Secondly, try to arrive in Rome when there are fewer tourists there - not during the holiday season.  Third, set aside more time for shopping.  Fourth, try to shop with consultants who already know everything here.  Enjoy the shopping! </p>
