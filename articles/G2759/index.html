    <p>  There are many techniques that you may not be familiar with, but with their help you can easily make birthday gifts for a guy with your own hands.  For example, scrapbooking.  This very popular hobby allows you to create handmade cards and other DIY gifts from paper.  It can be an album about your happy vacation abroad or a cover for a wedding disc.  There are many master classes at which you will be taught to correctly position the elements on the sheet, add various decorations and photographs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The next type of creativity is decoupage.  This technique allows you to transform things beyond recognition.  For example, you can decorate your boyfriend‚Äôs favorite chair, decorate his leather cover with a passport or give him a box with pleasant wishes.  <span>Decoupage technique</span> will help you with this.  Its essence lies in the fact that a very thin napkin is glued to PVA glue and varnished.  As a result, the picture simply merges with the thing.  Using simple decorating techniques, you can turn an ordinary iron can into a beautiful stand for pens, pasted over with coffee beans.  This is also a good gift.  You can also decorate homemade wall clocks.  And in <span>the quilling technique,</span> you can beautifully decorate the frame with your joint photo.

    <p>  <strong>For fun</strong> <strong><br></strong> </p><p>  If we talk about frivolous gifts, it can be comic panels, a pillow tied in the form of a woman‚Äôs chest, or cubes with indecent pictures, which, incidentally, are very fun to play together.  Such gifts for the guy‚Äôs birthday, made with his own hands, will be surely appreciated by unmarried cheerful people, but do not try to give them to serious clerks.  You can draw a cheerful cartoon into a glass frame or put a large bill under a glass, and tie a hammer on a string next to it, add a funny inscription - and an excellent present is ready.  With your own hands you can make a cute gift in the form of a large decorated box in which you yourself will be in exotic underwear.  If only he would not open it with his mother.  And you can put another one in this box, and then also and so on until the smallest box in which the main gift will be - the key from your heart. </p><p>  <strong>A couple more options</strong> </p><p>  The best gift made by yourself should reflect the hobby and personality of the person to whom you give it.  If your half is a programmer, make him a clock from floppy disks or a declaration of love on a <span>binary code.</span>  A calendar of keyboard keys is also suitable.  If he likes to skate, then make him a felt souvenir in the form of little skates.  This is a good non-standard gift, which is sure to be remembered.  With your own hands you can make a pendant for good luck, and soft slippers.  You can sculpt his portrait from mastic, he will even be edible.  Or give him a <span>collage that</span> you personally <span>created</span> in Photoshop, you can just cut the photos.  And if finances do not limit you, then print a real magazine about him.  Gather an interview with all your friends, add photo material, give it to the printing house, and you will get a masterpiece.  All guests, including your boyfriend, will just gasp from such a gift.  How do you like these options?  We hope there is at least one suitable!  Give gifts to each other and enjoy life together. </p>
