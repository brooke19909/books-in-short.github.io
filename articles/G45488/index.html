Signal Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Trying to understand the question: "The system that Vadim Ozerov offers is a divorce or not?", Consider the proposal itself.  According to the author of the system, with its help you can quickly and legally earn a fairly large amount of money.  The exchange is precisely the place where large capital is concentrated today.  Possessing information about the upcoming event, one can safely claim superprofits.  Ozerov focuses on the fact that $ 1,000 can easily be turned into 2,000 in 20 minutes.  To convince people with an example, the author of a new signal talks about a deal to buy a currency, the information about the movement of quotes of which is known in advance.  When transferring the theory to numbers, a deal worth $ 1,000 is considered, bringing at least $ 750 profit.  But is it all in reality and what do people who had to deal with the author‚Äôs signals in reality say. </p><h2>  What is the basis of signals? </h2>

    <p>  ‚ÄúWe had to go a long way to get a universal system for making a profit‚Äù - these are the words that Vadim Ozerov constantly repeats.  Reviews of the signals under his authorship on the Internet are far from ideal, but quite satisfied people are also found.  Let's try to figure out what is the basis of the strategy.  The author is guided by the fact that history is constantly repeated.  In certain situations, the same price pattern is triggered.  The program itself is based on the analysis of price charts using the <span>neural network of a</span> cluster computing center.  The computer independently converts the story into a descriptive meta-format that overlaps with current price charts.  When a program captures a situation that has repeatedly repeated on the market, it gives a signal.  This provides at least 91% accuracy when opening intraday deals.  Vadim openly says that his signals can give up to 560% of the initial amount of investment.  So, for every $ 1,000 you can get at least $ 5,600. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is the author of the system guided by? </h2>

    <p>  The system that Vadim Ozerov offers, divorce or not, is difficult to determine.  The author‚Äôs speeches about his desire to help the working people sound very sincere.  According to him, in his work he is guided by <span>moral principles</span> and simple enrichment is of little interest to him.  Protesting against the concentration of money in the hands of a small group of people in the world, he intends to give everyone the opportunity to make money.  According to the author, if all the <span>world money were</span> distributed equally <span>,</span> one person would have had at least $ 30,000,000. </p><h2>  What is alarming when you first get acquainted with the Ozerov site? </h2><p>  Many users who are only getting acquainted with the offer on the Vadim-Ozerov.com website leave reviews alarming.  Potential users of the system focus on the fact that Vadim strongly recommends and even insists on cooperation with one specific broker in some places.  Despite the fact that the recommended company has a good reputation, strong recommendations give rise to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa trick and indicate the personal interest of the author.  Ozerov also says that you can start working with the system only after registering with the company and after replenishing the deposit there.  Some users, responding to the author‚Äôs proposal, opened accounts with the company, but what a surprise it was when it was not possible to cash out after collecting the minimum amount for withdrawal!  Perhaps <span>this is a slap,</span> and perhaps, indeed, only the fact of the availability of this information is reliable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Preliminary check of statistics on transactions </h2>

They note that after a full connection to the signal ‚Äúapparatus‚Äù, users gain access to two completely different signals based on different strategies.  One of them was able to view very interesting statistics.  Using the option that allows you to view the history of operations, to evaluate the quality of the signal without making trade transactions, it was not possible The introductory statistics make it clear that the site Vadim-Ozerov.com is no more than a way to make money for the author of the system. </p><h2>  What does testing indicate? </h2>

    <p>  The results of statistical analysis are not as good as written on the main page of the project.  Bidders concluded that the method of Ozerov not only does not allow you to earn, but also significantly speeds up the process of lowering funds from the account.  These are not just words, but numerical calculations that make it clear what Vadim Ozerov offers.  Divorce or not, this strategy - everyone will decide for himself.  If you trade in volume of $ 25 in accordance with the Mainline strategy, the loss will be $ 312 50 cents.  The Uberprofit strategy would bring a profit of minus 152 dollars 50 cents.  So, if you trade on the system in accordance with the signals during the week, you can lose $ 465. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Conclusions of qualified traders </h2><p>  Qualified traders independently checked, and evaluated what the offer that Vadim Ozerov makes.  Whether it is a divorce or not, everyone will appreciate it himself, but it‚Äôs problematic to understand where the author of the strategy takes the percentage ratio of profit from.  Instead of the promised hundreds of percent, only negative trading results could be seen in the terminal.  According to traders who decided to check the offer, the strategy is designed to attract beginners who are just looking for their way and believe in all offers.  It is the naivety of many people, the belief in easy money that helps to enrich the "pseudo-authors" of profitable strategies.  On the other hand, such detailed calculations may turn out to be just black PR and anti-advertising.  Talking about the veracity of the information is very problematic. </p><h2>  What do people write? </h2>

    <p>  The fact that Vadim Ozerov offers signals for high profitability in trading on the exchange is known throughout the Internet.  The PR project is professional enough, which attracts many participants in the foreign exchange market.  In parallel with the popularization of the trading system on the Internet, numerous reviews began to appear.  In particular, the following question was considered: "Is the system proposed on the Vadim-Ozerov.com project a divorce or not?"  The vast majority of comments indicate that the offer is 100% deceitful.  Other people draw attention to the fact that no successful trader will ever sell his strategy, which really makes a profit.  There is a category of users who write that advertising on a project in itself indicates the pathos of the project and its bombast.  There are people who write about their unsuccessful cooperation with a number of other projects, and therefore have concerns about this. </p><h2>  The site itself is already suspicious </h2><p>  The relevant question is whether it can be considered effective proposal that makes Vadim Ozerov.  <span>Whether it is a divorce</span> or not, only the design of the site itself makes you think.  According to experienced users, it is very poor quality.  When compared with the resources of experienced and trusted brokers, the difference is very noticeable.  Suspicion is caused by the fact that the author of the strategy, which makes millions, could not allocate only a few hundred dollars to create a good Internet resource.  The first page is filled with very poor quality, except for "water", it does not provide any specific information.  The only thing that focuses on is the ability to make good money with the system, even without experience and devoting to trading no more than 3-4 hours a day.  Experienced traders repel the relative youth of the project from cooperation.  As practice has shown, only truly profitable projects can work for a very long time.  So it will be possible to talk about the effectiveness of the strategy as the site grows older.  If Vadim Ozerov really offers very effective signals, many positive reviews will soon appear about this.  After all, as you know, negative reviews may well be ordered by competitors of the strategy. </p><h2>  The essence of the strategy: minimum effort - maximum earnings </h2>

    <p>  The author of the strategy has also attracted attention by the fact that he offers the most simplified system of earnings.  All that is required of the trader is to purchase an option in strict accordance with the indicator signals.  The amount of investment should be calculated based on the percentage of traffic.  For example, if the system proposed by Vadim Ozerov gives signals with a cross-country ability of 300%, and the standard lot is $ 50, you need to enter the purchase in the amount of $ 150.  When cross-country indicates 100%, the purchase of an option should correspond to 50 dollars.  The expiration period of an option is determined by the signal itself.  It is described in detail in the indicator manual.  <span>Trading rules are</span> very simple.  By switching the tabs, you can change the type of input signal.  The Mainline Strategy delivers about 15 signals per day.  But the Uberprofit strategy speaks of at least 40 signals per day. </p><h2>  What is hidden behind the word "hedging"? </h2>

    <p>  Very ambiguous can be found about the project "Vadim-Ozerov.com" reviews.  Divorce or not this strategy, they do not help to understand, but the word "hedging", often used by the author, leads to certain thoughts.  The classic story suggests that if the transaction was opened in the wrong direction, you can reduce the loss by opening a similar transaction, but in a different direction.  The profit from the second purchase or sale will partially block the results of the incorrect decision.  ‚ÄúHedging‚Äù according to Ozerov‚Äôs methodology is not described by anyone on the project, which makes us think that this word hides nothing more than the concept of ‚Äúloss‚Äù. </p><h2>  The results of the analysis of many traders, or What to look for a beginner </h2><p>  The statistics presented on the site are very impressive, which explains the popularity of the proposal.  At the same time, qualified traders focus on the fact that it is very difficult to achieve such indicators, especially with automatic trading.  It is precisely such numerous nuances that cause suspicion and make us leave negative reviews for the Vadim-Ozerov.com project.  Divorce or not these miracle signals, everyone already decides independently, given the risks.  In any case, it is before accepting the proposal to study it in detail. </p>
