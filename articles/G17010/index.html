    <p>  The film, which brought the American officer an American award, was directed by Delbert Mann.  It is called in the English version of "Separate tables."  The plot is based on the play of the same name by Terence Rettigen. </p><p>  According to the plot of the picture, the action takes place in the seaside hotel "Beauregard", which is located in Bournemouth.  The manager in it is Pat Cooper, played by Wendy Hiller.  The advantage of the hotel are separate tables for each guest. </p><p>  List of guests: </p><ul><li>  David Pollock is a major. </li><li>  Sybil Railton Bell - a lady in love with a major, suffering from nervous breakdowns. </li><li>  Mrs. Maud is an elderly, strict and domineering woman, the mother of Sybil. </li><li>  Lady Gladys Matheson is Mrs. Maud's girlfriend. </li><li>  Charles is a surgeon preparing for an exam. </li><li>  Gene is Charles's companion. </li><li>  Fowler is an elderly man, a teacher of literature. </li><li>  Mrs. Michem is a detective detective, Fowler's rival in billiards. </li><li>  John Malcolm is a drinking journalist. </li><li>  Anne Shankland is a newly arrived lady. </li></ul><p>  The relationship between the guests captivates the audience.  Major Pollock is played by David Niven.  Films featuring an English actor are very diverse.  However, he often happened to play the role of a British aristocrat with a rose in his buttonhole. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Films that have brought recognition to the actor and famous world awards do not belong to standard films.  So, the creation of 1953, "The Blue Moon" was banned for viewing due to censorship.  The plot of the tape is about two wealthy men who want to seduce the same woman.  But the lady does not plan to lose her innocence before marriage.  Their task is to achieve their goal without tying themselves together. </p><p>  The Oscar-winning ribbon of 1959 was recognized by the world community without restrictions.  An interesting fact is another.  The fact is that Niven David received an Oscar for playing in it, although he was in the frame for a total of sixteen minutes. </p>
