    <h2>  Directions </h2><p>  From Moscow, along the Yaroslavl highway, you need to get to Yaroslavl, then to Rybinsk, and then turn left to get on the district highway.  On the descent of the bridge, having passed a traffic light, you need to turn left again.  Then you should go on the road to Glebov.  After that you need to turn right and go along Larionov to the yacht club.  After that, drive past the signs for Koprino Bay.  So you get to the sign "houses for rent."  In 200 m from it there will be Koprino - a recreation center where you will have a great time! </p>
