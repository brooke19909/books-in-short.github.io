Her popularity increased after she became a pedestal for the giant sculpture of Jesus, considered one of the seven world wonders of the world. </p><p>  Mount Corcovado is a local attraction, visible from anywhere in the city, from which an amazing panorama of colorful Rio de Janeiro opens. </p><h2>  Creed of the Brazilians </h2><p>  The huge peak with a height of 704 meters is located in the largest park in the world - Tizhuka.  This is a wonderful place for families for all locals and tourists.  And above this mountain splendor rises the majestic statue of Christ the Redeemer.  Brazil considers it its symbol of faith, because outstretched hands seem to embrace and protect the former capital of the country and its inhabitants. </p><h2>  Statue Installation History </h2><p>  The history of the installation of the <span>monument to Jesus Christ is</span> very interesting and deserves a detailed story. </p><p>  In 1922, at a holiday dedicated to the centenary of Brazil's independence, local authorities decided to erect a giant Columbus monument in Rio de Janeiro.  However, residents felt that it would be more symbolic to establish a statue of Jesus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Corcovado Mountain" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1231463.jpg" width="416"></div>

Several mountain ranges were considered, but in the end Mount Corcovado was won as the highest city point.  Then at the base was laid the first stone of the future grandiose monument. </p><h2>  Winning project </h2><p>  A year later, a project that everyone liked liked won the competition.  The local artist portrayed Jesus with open arms, and from afar his figure resembled a huge cross.  It was originally planned that the base of the sculpture would be a pedestal in the form of the globe, but later this idea was abandoned. </p><h2>  Problems with finances and craftsmen </h2><p>  After the approval of the project, the Brazilians faced the problem of a lack of funds for the implementation of the monument.  A collection of donations was announced, and soon the money in the amount of more than two million reais was directed so that a statue of Christ the Redeemer would be made as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountain in brazil" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1231452.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Brazil, as an agrarian country, experienced great difficulties.  There were no highly skilled craftsmen who could cast a huge statue, so all the parts were ordered in France.  Local sculptors and engineers also worked to create a statue-protecting frame. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Grand opening </h2><p>  In 1924, the first details were made of gypsum, and a seven-meter pedestal was installed on the mountain.  The Brazilian builders were very much helped by the oldest railway operating at that time, along which all parts of the statue and the necessary materials were transported upstairs. </p><p>  Work ended in 1931.  It was then that the grand opening of a unique monument took place - a creed of not only the city, but the whole country.  Until now, residents recall how, in the light of day on October 12, a statue weighing more than a thousand tons was hidden under a sheet enveloping it.  Mount Corcovado was filled with excited people, and many prayed right on the streets of their hometown, hoping for an early discovery. </p><h2>  Hovering figure in the air </h2><p>  The statue appeared before the amazed gaze of the inhabitants in complete darkness when night descended on the city.  Thousands of people prayed in a single rush, and when spotlights flashed on the mountain, illuminating an almost 40-meter sculpture, it seemed to everyone that Christ was floating in the air, hugging humanity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Corcovado Mountain South America" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1231454.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For many years, every evening, when a mountain in Brazil plunges into darkness, powerful lighting devices are directed at it, and the statue of Jesus appears as a grandiose figure torn off the Earth.  To contemplate the amazing action, millions of people come to Rio every year, admitting that they did not see anything more magnificent. </p><p>  In 1973, the statue of Christ was included in the list of national symbols of the country. </p><h2>  Steep climb up </h2><p>  Mount Corcovado (South America), which is reached in 20 minutes by a train designed for a steep climb, is waiting for its visitors daily.  And in order to climb to the top, you need to climb the 223-step staircase or take a special elevator. </p><h2>  Extreme mountain climbing </h2><p>  This route is very fond of extreme people coming from all over the globe to Mount Corcovado.  Rio de Janeiro is rightfully considered to be the climbing center of Brazil, and the surroundings of Tijuca Park is a favorite place not only for tourists walking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Corcovado Rio de Janeiro" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1231453.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <p>  Conquering the heights of national attractions is a very interesting ascent, requiring good equipment and sufficient physical preparation. </p><p>  Climbers cover a distance of 710 meters along specially laid routes. </p><h2>  Tourist Pilgrimage Center </h2><p>  Every year, pilgrims from all over the world go a long way to admire the grandeur and beauty of the symbol of the liberation and rebirth of the country.  Surprisingly, for so many years, the statue has not been damaged. </p><p>  Even the terrible storm that raged in 2008, remembered by the destructive actions in the country, did not harm the gigantic monument.  And the lightning striking the statue of Christ left no trace.  Scientists attribute this to the properties of the material from which the sculpture is made, and Catholics give the amazing fact a sacred meaning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="statue of christ the redeemer brazil" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1231455.jpg" width="600"></div>
