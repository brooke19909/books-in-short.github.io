  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Zolotoye Village, Crimea: description, attractions, history and interesting facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Crimea, on the southern <span>coast of the Sea of ​​Azov,</span> in the eastern part of the Kazantip Bay, a small resort village Zolotoe is located.  It is easy to get to it, it is only 14 km from the famous city of Kerch. </p><p>  It may seem that the village of Zolotoye in the Leninsky <span>district of Crimea is</span> absolutely no different from all the other small coastal settlements.  However, this is not so, its location makes the neighborhood of the village one of the most memorable places in the Crimea - next to it is the Karalar Natural Park.  In addition, the road begins from it along the largest bay of the Sea of ​​Azov - the Kazantip Bay.  It is more than 25 km of sandy beaches and the gentle sea. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.42782500000001" data-lng="36.07716479999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/5/1/7/4517.png"></div><h2>  Where to stay in Golden </h2><p>  The village is really not very big, but it has several cozy mini-hotels and pensions, the largest and most popular of them is called AzovLend. </p><p>  For lovers of relaxation with a claim to luxury <span>, La Grace Hotel</span> is located in a separate small bay with its own beach. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelinka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach in the pension village" class="if uuid-2552352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2552352.jpg"></div><p>  I would also like to say about the beaches of the village of Zolotoe in the Crimea - the name of the village was not in vain.  The sand on the coast is shallow and pleasant, really golden in color.  There is enough space near the water for everyone, just keep in mind that the beaches of Zolotoy, except for the territory of private hotels, are not equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Attract the surroundings of the village and fans of camping, because in the warm season in the shady beams grow real camps for tourists. </p><h2>  General beaches </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The coastline of General's beaches" class="if uuid-2552327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2552327.jpg"></div><p>  Outdoor enthusiasts who came to the village of Zolotoye in eastern Crimea have the opportunity to visit the most beautiful part of the Karalar Nature Reserve - General's beaches.  This area is often called the “Coast of a Thousand Bays”, and this name is fully justified. </p><p>  For almost 20 km, the coast of the Sea of ​​Azov is indented with small bays, through grottoes, and bizarre piles of rocks.  Tourists who visit these places for the first time may get the impression that this is not Crimea at all. </p><p>  A <span>dirt road</span> winds along serpentine <span>roads</span> along all General's beaches <span>.</span>  It is quite packed, but motorists need to consider that the exits to some attractive bays are very steep and broken.  Sometimes it is better to check the condition of the road in advance. </p><p>  The road ends near the village of Kurortnoye, where you can visit the famous <span>Chokrakskoe Lake,</span> whose mud is considered healing. </p><h2>  Stone Sphinx Head </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Stone Sphinx Head" class="if uuid-2552336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2552336.jpg"></div><p>  Around the middle of <span>General's beaches</span> there is a unique beautiful place.  On one side, the road descends to a long sandy beach surrounded by chaotic rock fragments.  On the other hand, a stone rises to which the natural weathering processes have given an unusual shape.  Most tourists who have seen this stone believe that it resembles the head of a sphinx.  But there are romantics who discerned in him the profile of the ancient beauty Nefertiti. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The sea off the coast of the village of Zolotoye in Crimea is shallow, sometimes you need to walk a few tens of meters to reach the depth.  But due to this, the water warms up quickly, you can swim comfortably already in mid-May. </p><p>  Due to the relative inaccessibility of a large crowd of people here does not happen even in high season.  You can stop at a cove that has attracted attention, set up a tent and enjoy the untouched nature.  And you can ride along the beautiful coast for several days, each time stopping for the night on a new beach. </p><h2>  Archaeological sites </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Excavations of the ancient general site" class="if uuid-2552329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2552329.jpg"></div><p>  Near the village of Zolotoe in the Crimea there are several interesting archaeological sites.  One of them, Syuyrtash settlement (it is also called East) is considered the largest on the coast of the Sea of ​​Azov.  Research on this site began as early as the middle of the 20th century and has since been repeatedly resumed. </p><p>  The area of ​​the settlement is slightly more than 2 hectares.  Archaeologists dated the settlement around the III-I centuries.  BC  e.  Most likely, its population was farmers who grow cereals.  After all, Crimean wheat in ancient times was valued far beyond the peninsula. </p><p>  Another ancient settlement is located in a beautiful place of the village of Golden in Crimea.  On one side of the ruins there is a beautiful bay with a rock, similar to an arch, and on the other, the stone of the Sphinx’s Head rises. </p><p>  These excavations were called the General's site.  They are well studied, the remains of one and two-story residential buildings and a winery and an ancient sanctuary were excavated.  Archaeologists believe that in this place in the IV-III centuries BC there was a fortified settlement surrounded by a high wall with quadrangular towers about 16 meters high.  Most likely, in case of danger, residents of neighboring small settlements hid behind its walls. </p><h2>  Location of the film "Scythian" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The scenery for the movie Skiff" class="if uuid-2552324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2552324.jpg"></div><p>  The surroundings of the village of Zolotoe in the Crimea are often used as natural scenery in the creation of various films.  More recently, large-scale shooting of the film "Scythian" took place.  He was filmed in one of the bays of General's beaches, masterfully using the unusual exotic beauty of this place. </p><p>  After the filming, several interesting buildings remained, which are now often visited by curious tourists.  A wooden imitation of a watchtower rises above the entrance to the bay.  It is built of thick, roughly processed logs and consists of several floors.  If you go up the wooden stairs, you will find a fantastically beautiful panorama of the surrounding coast. </p><p>  After filming, a large stable built of local stones and logs remained.  From it begins a rather steep descent to several secluded bays.  Near one of them, in the sea, an interesting rock rises, the top of which resembles the head of a predatory fairy dragon. </p><p>  After the shooting, the remaining buildings are used during fascinating quests along the Crimean coast. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The surroundings of the village of Golden" class="if uuid-2552345" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2552345.jpg"></div><p>  Traveling around the Crimea by car and having a small margin of time, it is better to devote several days to exploring the surroundings of the village of Zolotoye.  Of course, you can drive this short distance quickly, but then the bulk of the natural wonders will go unnoticed. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that after rains, dirt roads, which are not in the best condition, become almost impassable for cars with low ground clearance.  Yes, and descents to some bays and, especially, steep climbs from them are only possible with a car with all-wheel drive. </p><p>  On the road, it is better to take a supply of drinking water and food.  You also need to stock up on warm things, nights on the coast are cold, and, of course, take a camera or camera with you. </p><p>  Sometimes, due to the similar sounding of the names, the village of Zolotoye is sometimes confused with the village of Zolotoye Pole in the Kirov region of Crimea, but these are completely different settlements. </p>
