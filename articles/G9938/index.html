    <p>  To the west of Alanya is the famous sandy <span>beach "Cleopatra",</span> which has a length of three kilometers.  But the recreation areas located in the city itself are practically not inferior to it.  Everywhere tourists are offered a wide selection of diverse water sports and extreme entertainment.  But most importantly, the beaches of Alanya are very popular because of the ‚ÄúIncekum" - fine yellow sand. </p><p>  The swimming season in the region begins in late April and lasts until mid-November.  To this day, many <span>historical monuments,</span> such as defensive towers, Byzantine churches and the walls of the city fortress, have been perfectly preserved in the city.  Alanya's cheerful nightlife is concentrated not only in the city center, where many excellent hotels are built, but also on the outskirts, including where the Eftalia Splash Resort is located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  general information </h2>

    <p>  Professional animators who work both day and evening do not let tourists get bored.  Many Russians liked its thought-out territory, however, some were unhappy that the construction took place nearby.  But this, as you know, is a temporary phenomenon. </p><p>  Many positive reviews and well-decorated rooms.  As for nutrition, as evidenced by residents, food was always served in abundance, so no one was left hungry.  A small minus is that you need to go to the beach via an underpass.  Some did not like it. </p>
