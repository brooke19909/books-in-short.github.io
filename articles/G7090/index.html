Historians believe that it was from this monster that Kemer got its name.  It is not known whether this amazing creature actually existed, but not far from this Turkish resort there really is a mountain called Chimera, the slopes of which are closed by burning gas coming out from the ground.  Kemer has become famous among tourists relatively recently.  The resort with developed infrastructure appeared only some two and a half decades ago.  And in the sixties here, between the azure sea and the mountains, there was a very small fishing village.  They say that even by car it was very difficult to come here, because there were simply no roads. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Himeros Life Hotel 4" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1050241.jpg" width="600"></div>
