  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Butyric acid: properties and applications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Carboxylic acids are organic bio compounds that contain one or more carboxyl groups in the structure of their molecules.  The class of <span>carboxylic acids</span> combines a huge amount of organic substances that contain them in the structure.  In addition to these groups, other functional groups may be present in carboxylic acid molecules, which determine properties that are not characteristic of compounds with only carboxyl groups. </p><p>  Monobasic saturated carboxylic acids are derivatives of alkanes in the molecule of which the hydrogen atom is replaced by COOH.  Such compounds are sometimes called aliphatic or fatty acids, since some of them are isolated from the products of fat hydrolysis. </p><p>  Carboxylic acids in nature are in free (for example, formic - in insect secretions, in the urine and sweat of animals, nettles, some fruits and vegetables) and bound (for example, higher fatty acids in the form of triacyl glycerols).  Higher fatty acids are obtained by hydrolysis of <span>neutral fats</span> and oils.  Most organic acids are obtained by organic synthesis methods. </p><p>  Isobutyric acid is obtained during the oxidation of isobutyl alcohol.  For the oxidation of isobutanol, an alkaline solution of potassium permanganate is used.  In laboratory conditions, this acid can also be obtained by oxidation of isobutyric aldehyde.  Under natural conditions, it is found in oil and arnica roots.  The specified acid is used in the process of manufacturing perfumes, the production of plasticizers for varnishes, emulsifiers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first homologues (formic, acetate, propionic and butyric acids) of monobasic saturated carboxylic acids have a pungent odor, mix well with H2O in different ratios.  The next three representatives are acids with an unpleasant odor, all the rest are solids. </p><p>  Butyric acid - a liquid with a pungent unpleasant odor, boils at a temperature of 163.5 C. It occurs in a free state (sweat) and in the form of esters (glycerides of cow's oil). </p><p>  Butyric acid: formula - C3H7COOH </p><p>  Since this compound has one carboxyl group in its structure, it is referred to as monobasic <span>saturated fatty acids.</span>  Butyric acid is formed due to butyric acid fermentation of carbohydrates, in industry - the oxidation of n-butane or butyric aldehyde.  This acid is used in the production of aromatic substances, the synthesis of medicines, the production of plasticizers, cellulose acetyl butyrate, etc. </p><p>  Low molecular weight acids can also form during bacterial synthesis in the large intestine.  One of the most important low molecular weight acids that are synthesized in the intestines is butyric acid.  The correlation between the deficiency of low molecular weight acids and the frequency of development and exacerbation of diseases of the large intestine (ulcerative colitis, malignant neoplasms) is scientifically proven.  Butyric acid is the main energy material for epithelial cells, it supports intestinal homeostasis.  The specified acid exhibits anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory effects, affects appetite, prevents the development of oxidative stress. </p><p>  Doctors use this acid for therapeutic purposes to treat certain diseases.  Initially, the indicated acid was introduced into the body rectally, because when administered orally, it was rapidly hydrolyzed in the stomach.  The therapeutic effect in this case was negligible.  Foreign experts have developed a new dosage form of a bioactive substance for oral use.  The structure of the drug included sodium butyrate and a polymer shell.  However, this drug also showed low efficiency.  The best therapeutic effect was obtained when using drugs, which include calcium butyrate and a prebiotic (Zakofalk means). </p>
