    <p>  The diameter of the lake reaches one kilometer, and its maximum depth is 17 m, which is 10 m more than the Tara River, which flows nearby.  It is easy to conclude that in this region this body of water is the deepest. </p><p>  Danilovo Lake (Omsk Region) has convenient, gentle shores, many of which are covered with reeds and cattail.  A picturesque landscape is created by nearby aspen trees, birches and pines.  Also, the coastal area is distinguished by two low shafts, rising one and a half meters.  From each other they are located 10 m. </p><p>  Many people like to be here, because Danilovo Lake (Omsk Region) is more like a mountain pond.  It is much deeper than the rest, as well as clean, its transparency is up to 5 meters.  It also has very few underwater vegetation.  It is these characteristics that distinguish it from the neighboring lakes of the Omsk and Novosibirsk regions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Legends of the lake </h2><p>  Since Danilovo <span>Lake (Omsk Region)</span> stands out from other bodies of water, legends go about it.  He is credited with healing properties, they say that his waters are able to give an extraordinary burst of strength.  According to legend, it is believed that a meteorite fell in this area and split into five parts, forming five holes.  Over time, they filled with water and entered the system, now known as the “Five Lakes”.  It is believed that due to the meteorite, the water contains a large amount of silver, which is why it is so clean here.  Local residents are sure that this reservoir is healing, and they treat various diseases with it.  But according to scientific research, this theory has no evidence. </p><h2>  Rest on the lake </h2><p>  Although the miraculous properties of the reservoir have not been proven, many people every summer choose Lake Danilovo for relaxation (Omsk region).  The photo shows how wonderful the area is to take a break from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.  Everyone who came here can not only sunbathe in the sun and swim, but take a pleasant walk among the bewitching trees and breathe in the cleanest air. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that there are several similar recreation centers and mini-hotels near the lake.  Some of them have their own baths.  If you prefer to rest with tents, but you don’t have your own, you can rent any one at the rental point for as many places as you need. </p><p>  Near the recreation centers there are cozy cafes where they offer dinners. </p><h2>  Fishing on the lake </h2><p>  Fishing lovers will also be able to throw their fishing rods and enjoy their favorite pastime.  There are pike in the pond, as well as tench and perch. </p><h2>  Human intervention </h2><p>  As the lake gradually began to chalk, in 2002, the authorities decided to make a canal from the Tara River.  The goal of this step was to enrich the lake with fish and waters.  Unfortunately, this action led to the fact that the pond began to clog gradually.  But it is worth noting that the surrounding area, as a rule, is clean, since there are regularly organized activities related to the protection of nature. </p>
