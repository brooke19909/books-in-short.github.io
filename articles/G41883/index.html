    <p>  A variety of interesting places, an unusually colorful atmosphere prevailing in the Old Town area, as well as a riot of colors of the local landscape and exteriors attract many tourists and travelers dreaming to see the famous sights of Samarkand with their own eyes.  A full description of tourist destinations includes more than 20 cultural monuments, architectural ensembles and objects of important historical value. </p><h2>  Gur Emir Mausoleum </h2><p>  The literal translation of the name of the Gur-Emir mausoleum sounds like "the tomb of the king."  According to its purpose, Gur Emir is a magnificent tomb for all men from the Timurid dynasty.  The construction of the mausoleum continued for a long time. </p><p>  Scientists attribute this building to the period of the XIV-XV centuries.  It is known for certain that the complex was originally created for Sultan Muhammad - the grandson of the famous Tamerlane.  Most travelers who visited the mausoleum and left a review of the sights of Samarkand Gur Emir, first of all note the unprecedented beauty of the Blue Dome of the tomb and its delightful interior decoration.  This fact is really true, since the interior of the tomb of El Emir has no analogues throughout the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ulugbek Observatory </h2><p>  Among all the objects that make up the sights of Samarkand, <span>the Ulugbek Observatory</span> is considered one of the most interesting and popular among tourists.  It was built in the XI century on the elevation of Chupan-Ata for Ulugbek, the grandson of Tamerlan.  Watching the celestial bodies for hours, he compiled an incredibly accurate catalog for his time, numbering 1,118 stars. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samarkand sights reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/742002.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Archaeologists were able to discover the underground part of the sextant and the foundation of a three-story observatory.  Tourists who visited these sites are enthusiastic about the grandeur of the structure. </p><h2>  Ancient settlement Afrasiab </h2><p>  This is another cult place for which Samarkand is famous.  The description of the attraction would not be complete without mentioning the legend existing in these parts, according to which the hero of the folk epos, King Afrasiab, erected on the banks of the Siab river the beautiful capital of Sogdiana. </p><p>  The ancient settlement is located away from modern Samarkand.  To get to Afrasiab, you must take a course to the north-east from the city to the spurs of Chupon-ata. </p><p>  From the middle of the 20th century to the present, there are ongoing archaeological and <span>scientific works.</span>  However, despite the excavations, these objects can be visited by tourists as part of an excursion program covering this and other attractions of Samarkand.  People who have already visited these places say that they have unforgettable impressions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The shrine of the three religions - the burial place of St. Daniel </h2><p>  This is a unique place uniting the followers of the three largest world religions - Christianity, Islam and Judaism.  A unique burial place is located in the northern part of the Afrasiab fortification.  Serving at the court of King Nebuchadnezzar, a descendant of King Solomon Daniel was born in Jerusalem in the VI century <span>BC.</span>  He possessed the gift of clairvoyance and was a very revered man in his own country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of samarkand full description" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/742004.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Today, the burial on the banks of the Siab River, where St. Daniel lies (Khoji Daniyar - for the adherents of Islam or the prophet Daniel - for the supporters of Judaism), is a place of worship for Muslims, Christians and Jews around the world. </p><h2>  Mausoleum of Ruhabad </h2><p>  The mausoleum of Rukhabad, like all the sights of Samarkand, is distinguished by its original decoration and originality.  This is one of the earliest structures of Samarkand, erected at the end of the XIV century.  In those days, the mausoleum of Ruhabad was connected to the tomb of Amir Temur with a thick shady alley and a path made of marble slabs laid between them. </p><h2>  Khazryt Khizr </h2><p>  The Khazryt Khizr mosque, built in 1823, is located on a small hill opposite the Mazar of Kusam ibn Abbas, with which the mosque in ancient times was connected by a road and made up a single spiritual complex. </p><p>  Architecturally, the mosque is of great value due to the fact that it is a classic embodiment of the aivan style, which is very characteristic of the East of the 19th century. </p><h2>  Place of worship Maturidi </h2><p>  Maturidi, or rather Abu Mansur al-Maturidi, was one of the founders of the theoretical ideas of the Islamic religion, who created the doctrine of the philosophy of Islam "Maturidia". </p><p>  The place of worship of this iconic Muslim personality is located in the old part of Samarkand and is accessible for pilgrims and tourists. </p>
