    <p>  But the referendum in Catalonia still took place.  The autonomy government said that more than two million 200 thousand people out of five million 300 thousand inhabitants of Catalonia were able to express their citizenship.  Thus, the turnout at polling stations was 43%. </p><p>  A little more than two million people cast their votes for independence, which amounted to more than 90% of the number of voters.  Against there were 177 thousand people.  This is less than 8% of the number of voters who came to the polls. </p><h2>  The consequences of the referendum </h2><p>  The head of Catalonia, Puigdemon, the day after the referendum, announced that in order to cope with the differences, the participation of third forces is necessary.  Only they are able to resolve the conflict between Madrid and Barcelona. </p><p>  Opponents of the separation insist that independence would mean an automatic exit from the European Union and a rejection of the euro.  And because of this, serious economic problems will arise. </p><p>  On October 10, 2017, an official speech was held in the Parliament of Carles Puchdemon.  On the same day, he signed a document of independence.  Later, his action was suspended to resume negotiations with Madrid. </p><p>  How the situation will develop in the future is not yet clear.  For example, the head of the press service of the chairman of the Spanish government, <span>Mariano Rajoy,</span> threatened Puigdemona that he would end up the same way as the Catalan leader Luis Companis.  He was killed by the Francoists in 1940. </p>
