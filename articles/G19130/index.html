    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The village was founded a very long time ago.  The first mention of him as a village dates back to 1708.  In the old registers of settlements of the Russian Empire, he is marked as Zhirkov (by the name of a local merchant).  The village received its current name after the revolution - in 1929.  During the Second World War, fierce battles were fought in the vicinity of this settlement. </p><p>  Kholm-Zhirkovsky received the status of urban settlement in 1971.  In 2008, celebrations dedicated to the 300th anniversary of the foundation took place here.  Currently, the village is the administrative center of Kholm-Zhirkovsky district. </p><h2>  Village enterprises </h2><p>  The village of Kholm-Zhirkovsky is quite large.  A lot of people live here (about 3305 people).  The villagers have the opportunity to work on: </p><ul><li><p>  cheese factory; </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div></li><li><p>  bakery. </p></li></ul><p>  There is also a flax processing plant in the town.
