    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  If you approach any person with the question ‚Äúname the capital of Bavaria‚Äù, he will give the correct answer.  But what about the story?  Few can tell you some interesting facts about this city.  And there are a lot of them. </p><p>  So, for example, in the VIII century on the territory where Munich was built in the future, the monks of the Tegernsee monastery lived.  Thanks to them, the city got the name that it has now.  After all, ‚ÄúMunich‚Äù in translation from the ancient High German means ‚Äúmonk‚Äù. </p><p>  It is also interesting that the current capital of Bavaria was previously called Villa Munichen.  This name was later transformed.  The fact that this city became the capital in 1507, when the <span>land of Bavaria was</span> united, is also little known <span>.</span>  Before that, Munich was the residence of the Wittelsbach. </p><h2>  Oktoberfest </h2><p>  The capital of Bavaria is known for this celebration.  Oktoberfest is such a folklore festival, which is the biggest festivities not only in Germany, but throughout the world.  Every year, the capital of Bavaria receives about six million guests.  In addition to locals, people come here from other cities of Germany, as well as citizens of other countries and even continents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The celebration begins in mid-September.  And it lasts about 16 days.  The main feature of the holiday is a huge number of beer tents and a variety of attractions.  The celebration is organized by the city administration.  Munich - the capital of Bavaria - allows only local brewing companies to participate in the festival.  That is, those that are in Munich.  These companies brew exceptional beer for the festival.  It is called in German Oktoberfestbier.  It contains about 5.8-6.3 percent of alcohol.  At other times of the year it is called Vienna or March. </p><p>  By the way, the festival was first held in 1810, on October 12.  And it was organized on the occasion of the wedding of Crown Prince Ludwig. </p>
