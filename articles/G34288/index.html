After the establishment of Soviet power, he became a prominent diplomat.  Vorovsky was killed in Switzerland during his trip to the next international conference. </p><h2>  early years </h2><p>  The future revolutionary Vorovsky Vatslav Vatslavovich was born on October 27, 1871 in Moscow.  He was a native of a Russified family of Polish nobles.  The boy was left without a father early.  Like many Poles, he received his primary education at a school attached to the church.  Already in his teens, he showed the makings of a revolutionary.  The student wrote poems in which he criticized the tsarist government, and participated in illegal gatherings of peers. </p><p>  In 1890, Vorovsky Vatslav Vatslavovich entered the Moscow State University, but a year later he decided to continue his education at the Imperial Moscow Technical School.  The student took part in the activities of Polish national circles. </p>

    <h2>  Links and emigration </h2><p>  It was the national question that prompted the young man to connect his life with revolutionaries.  His studies at the school were cut short exactly in the middle, when in 1894 a radical student was expelled to Vologda due to the approaching coronation of Nicholas II and the celebrations connected with her in Moscow.  Education Vorovsky nevertheless received.  In 1897 he graduated from college, and two years later he was arrested and sent into exile in the <span>Vyatka province.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having served his due time, Vorovsky Vatslav Vatslavovich decided to emigrate.  For the revolutionary, this decision was the most logical.  All the leaders of the extreme left parties at that time lived in Western Europe, expecting a social explosion in their homeland.  Thieves settled in Geneva.  There he joined the Bolsheviks. </p>

    <h2>  Publicist </h2><p>  In the party, the newspaper ‚ÄúIskra‚Äù became the place of work of Wenceslas.  He was one of her most active and prolific employees.  Advances in journalism made Vorovsky a prominent figure among the Bolsheviks.  In 1903, he received a responsible party task - to organize underground work in Odessa.  The emigrant arrived there illegally.  In the city, the Iskra newspaper began to appear in increased circulation.  The revolutionaries aimed in the right direction.  In multinational and bustling Odessa, there was a good environment for growing discontent. </p><p>  Due to its ethnicity, Vorovsky Vatslav Vatslavovich effectively performed another function, being a person who carried out the connection between the left Polish organizations and the Bolsheviks.  When the <span>first Russian revolution</span> began in 1905 <span>,</span> he moved to St. Petersburg.  In the capital, Vorovsky again proved to be an effective organizer.  He bought weapons for military units that fought with government forces in the most stressful days of the crisis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Work in Scandinavia </h2><p>  When Lenin rode back to Russia in a sealed carriage after a long absence from his homeland, he decided to make Vorovsky a member of the Foreign Bureau of the Party Central Committee.  This organization was based in Stockholm.  She was supposed to establish relations with foreign supporters and contain part of the party‚Äôs cash desk.  In addition to Vorovsky, other bolshevik revolutionaries ‚Äî Yakov Ganetsky and Karl Radek ‚Äî also entered this bureau. </p><p>  For the Bolshevik, this was an important experience that influenced his entire subsequent party and life path.  He was not yet a diplomat, but performed many similar functions.  Vorovsky‚Äôs work in Stockholm was not in vain.  When in October 1917 his party came to power in Russia, he was appointed its authorized representative in Scandinavia. </p><p>  However, the revolutionary managed to stay in Sweden for a short while.  In March 1918, Lenin signed a <span>separate peace</span> with Germany.  After this, the Entente terminated diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia and began its international blockade.  Vorovsky Wenceslas Wenceslas got under her blow.  The biography of this person is an example of a constantly moving party executor.  So now he had to leave Sweden in order not to be arrested. </p>

    <h2>  Plenipotentiary in Italy </h2><p>  During the Civil War, Vorovsky remained in Russia.  He again took up the familiar publishing business, taking the post of head of the State Publishing House.  Lenin again needed his abilities and talents when the Bolsheviks began to take the first steps to get out of international isolation.  In 1921, Soviet Russia had an envoy in Italy.  They became Vaclav Vorovsky.  A monument to one of the first Soviet diplomats stands at the former building of the People‚Äôs Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.  And this is not surprising.  Thieves became a prominent representative of the cohort of the first Soviet diplomats. </p><p>  The post of plenipotentiary in Italy was also important because in 1922 a famous conference was held in Genoa with the participation of delegates from the RSFSR and the countries of the Entente.  The head of the mission was appointed George Chicherin, who replaced the sick and remaining Lenin in Russia.  Vaclav Vorovsky was his right hand.  At the <span>Genoa Conference</span> , the first economic ties were established between the RSFSR (the USSR was not yet formed) and the countries of Europe.  By that time, it became clear that the Bolsheviks had won the civil war.  Now the governments of the Entente had no choice but to negotiate with the new Kremlin inhabitants.  Thieves at the conference was one of the most prominent Soviet diplomats.  Thanks to his efforts (and the efforts of other members of the delegation), the Soviet government managed to achieve the long-awaited diplomatic victory. </p>

    <h2>  Murder </h2><p>  In the new 1923, Vorovsky went to Lausanne in Switzerland to take part in the next international conference.  On May 10, a diplomat was shot dead in a restaurant at a local hotel.  The killer turned out to be a Swiss citizen and former White Guard officer Maurice Conradi.  He lost his family during the civil war in Russia and with his whole being he hated the Bolsheviks. </p><p>  The shooter began trial, but the jury acquitted him.  The lawyers used documented facts of atrocities during the Civil War as a defense.  After an acquittal, the Swiss authorities limited themselves to deporting the killer of Vorovsky.  This did not help relations between the two countries.  Diplomatic contacts between the USSR and Switzerland temporarily ceased.  After the murder, Vaclav Vorovsky was sent to Moscow.  He was buried in Red Square. </p>
