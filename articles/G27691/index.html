Vehicle insurance is now a must for all drivers.  Often this creates certain problems for vehicle owners, because for paperwork it is necessary to go to the other end of the city, sit in queues - and all this during working hours.  To alleviate the situation, insurance companies provided drivers with the possibility of issuing electronic policies. </p>

    <h2>  Choosing an Insurance </h2><p>  Where can I get electronic CTP?  First of all, only in the <span>insurance company</span> that provides its customers with electronic policies in the region or region where the car owner lives.  Today, only half of the companies across the country have officially begun such work, and each has its own characteristics in servicing policies.  For example, the SOGAZ company provides an <span>MTPL insurance policy</span> within 24 hours from the moment of application, and in some insurance groups this can take up to several days. </p><h2>  Order of registration </h2><p>  The rules for issuing electronic CTP are the same for all insurance companies.  First, the client must register on the official website of the insurance, which has permission to issue electronic policies in the desired region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thereafter: </p><ul><li>  the client receives an electronic form, which must be filled in with reliable data; </li><li>  the entered information is checked on the basis of the SAR; </li><li>  the client is provided with a one-time password to the specified phone number to enter his personal account; </li><li>  the cabinet indicates all the necessary characteristics of the car and driver, affecting the amount of insurance, the result and details for payment are given; </li><li>  the client must pay the indicated amount. </li></ul><p>  After all this, a policy with the official signature of the head of the company in the electronic version that needs to be saved arrives at the previously indicated e-mail, and new data is entered into the PCA database.  What does an insurance policy look like in electronic form?  On the screen, this is a document with wet seals and signatures, but to provide it to the traffic police, the paper can be printed on a regular A4 sheet.  In order for the insurance to be considered valid, you only need to put a signature in the indicated box on the printed version, and you can go. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages of E-CTP </h2><p>  The pros and cons of electronic third-party liability insurance today have been able to evaluate already 200 thousand domestic drivers and among all the characteristics of such insurance, the advantages stand out mainly.  Among them, of course, there is no need to personally go to the office of the company, spend time on the road and queues, money on gasoline and own nerves.  The whole process of registration takes no more than 30 minutes, after which you can immediately print out the document and go about your business with brand new insurance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An important advantage is the fact that company representatives simply do not have the ability to impose additional services and unnecessary services on the client.  Also, the vehicle owner does not need to provide a lot of papers, because all of them are already in the PCA database. </p><p>  Besides: </p><ul><li>  the driver cannot lose bonuses for a trouble-free ride, all information is stored in an electronic database; </li><li>  cost calculation is fully automated; </li><li>  the document itself can be printed as many times as you like if the previous one is lost or damaged. </li></ul><p>  It is also very important that the SOGAZ company provides an electronic OSAGO policy at the same price as conventional insurance.  Many people think that for obvious advantages they will have to pay extra, but the law clearly regulates the cost of policies, so no company has the right to inflate prices for its services.  All insurance companies give their customers the opportunity to calculate the exact amount in just a few minutes, simply by entering the necessary parameters for this. </p>

    <h2>  Features of change </h2><p>  According to federal law, the policyholder must inform the company in writing of all changes to the data entered into the policy, but in practice penalties for ignoring this clause can be avoided, since the deadline for notifying the changes has not been officially established.  Also, the same legislation does not indicate that changes in the insurance policy require a refusal of payments or cancellation of the contract.  Insurers can only invalidate insurance in the case of initially incorrectly entered data. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Only those cases should be considered separately when, due to a change in data, the probability of an insured event changes.  Here, insurers can find fault, because the amount of payments due to new circumstances may differ significantly from those stipulated by the contract before making adjustments. </p><h2>  Alteration </h2><p>  Many are interested in the question of how to add a driver to the CTP insurance policy.  Actually, the possibilities depend on the chosen <span>insurance company.</span>  Some provide their customers with the ability to correct data directly over the Internet in some ways, while most require a personal visit to the office.  The latter option automatically makes the policy non-electronic, because after making changes by an employee of the company, he gives the client the usual insurance.  The procedure is done free of charge for most parameters, with the exception of the need to add another person to the policy.  How much it costs to add a driver to the CTP insurance policy depends on his age, driving experience and the duration of a trouble-free ride. </p><h2>  What can not be changed </h2><p>  Changes to the policy are allowed only for certain parameters.  If it is necessary to replace other information, only the termination of the current contract and the conclusion of a new one are required. </p><p>  So, you have to completely change the insurance if: </p><ul><li>  the term of the policy is changing; </li><li>  need to insure another vehicle; </li><li>  the policyholder changes. </li></ul><p>  In this case, the change of ownership of the car should not provoke the conclusion of a new contract. </p>

    <h2>  Adding a driver </h2><p>  So, how to add a driver to the insurance policy?  To do this, you need to prepare a standard set of documents for making changes, plus a passport and a driver‚Äôs license, which will be added to the policy additionally. </p><p>  Before you enter another driver into CTP, you must correctly calculate the insurance premium. </p><p>  This amount depends on several factors: </p><ul><li>  driver's age and length of service; </li><li>  the term in which the new driver did not get into an accident due to his own fault. </li></ul><p>  Age and driving experience are distinguished by four values, the most expensive of which will be a 22-year-old driver with three years of driving experience. </p><p>  According to the rules, all subsequent payments and the total amount of insurance will be calculated on the basis of the data about the youngest driver. </p>

    <h2>  Minor changes </h2><p>  In addition to adding a driver to the CTP insurance policy, many are interested in information about the rules for making adjustments to other columns. </p><p>  It is necessary to personally come to the office of the company in order to change: </p><ul><li>  period of use of the vehicle; </li><li>  driver license number; </li><li>  registration information; </li><li>  license plate number of the car; </li><li>  Title Number </li><li>  any personal data indicated on the insurance form. </li></ul><p>  To do this, you must have a valid insurance policy and documents confirming the replacement of certain data.  So to change personal information, it is often enough to provide a passport with a new registration.  When changing the name, it is better to first change the passport, title and title, and then go to the insurance. </p><p>  If only rights were replaced, you need to provide employees with a new document.  His number will be entered in the column "notes" in the form of the policy. </p><p>  Replacement of state license plates of a car is not a change of the vehicle itself, therefore it is also only indicated in the old form as a note.  If insurance is issued for a car with temporary numbers or without them at all, then the column is left blank.  The company should be notified of the receipt of the mark within three days, then employees will enter the information received both in the policy and in the electronic database. </p><p>  It is important to know that a change of registration may affect the amount of the insurance premium, since it initially depends on the coefficient of the territory.  Even a change of residence within the same settlement must be recorded by employees of the insurance group, especially since this is in accordance with the law. </p>

    <h2>  Change of ownership </h2><p>  In addition to how to add a driver to the CTP insurance policy, many are interested in how to add a new owner to it.  Oddly enough, it is possible to do this, but on condition that the policyholder does not change.  It is important that only the insured or his agent, whose actions are documented, can apply for a change of ownership. </p><p>  To carry out this procedure, you must have a sales contract and documents confirming the identity of the new owner when you visit the office of the insurance group.  When buying a car in this way, you should not be afraid, because the payment in the insured event is received by the owner, not the insured. </p><p>  By the way, the policyholder is also entitled to terminate the contract on the basis of a change of ownership. </p><h2>  Advice to policyholders </h2><p>  So that in the future there would be no problems with receiving payments or recognizing insured events, customers of the companies should not make any changes to the available policies on their own, even if employees assure that they will make adjustments to the electronic database, and the driver may not come personally and make with a paper document everything you need yourself. </p><p>  Also, do not postpone an insurance notification about changes in information that have appeared.  After employees accept the application for acceptance of the change data, a copy of their signed application should be taken from them. </p><p>  And most importantly, in no case do not agree to the execution of a new contract, if by law it is allowed to make adjustments to the current one. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In most cases, the process of amending the policy is free and very fast.  Supplements require only adding to the insurance less experienced or younger driver.  When filling out documents in electronic form, be careful, and then you will not have any unforeseen problems. </p>
