  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Learning the rules of backgammon</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Backgammon is a game in which 2 people participate.  For her, you need to have a special board, divided into two parts, checkers and cubes (dice).  The goal of the game is to make checkers circle on the board.  To do this, roll dice, on which points are dropped, and depending on the points dropped, checkers are moved around the playing field. </p><p>  People have been playing backgammon for about 5,000 years.  This game came to us from the East a long time ago, and at various times the popularity of this type of leisure activity has constantly changed, experiencing ups and downs.  Backgammon was very popular in the <span>Middle Ages</span> and was called a trick truck.  The rules for playing backgammon (long) remained practically unchanged, but Edmond Hoyle established the rules for playing <span>short backgammon</span> in 1743.  Today they are very popular among Russians and residents <span>of the CIS countries, they</span> love this game in Iran, Syria, Turkey and Israel.  Various tournaments and competitions are held regularly between fans of this game. </p><p>  The rules of backgammon are defined by the following subjects: </p><ul><li>  rectangular board with 24 points, 12 on each side.  A paragraph is a triangle with a base on the side; </li><li>  6 points in a row, located in one of the corners of the board, are called home; </li><li>  the board is divided in half by a vertical line called a bar; </li><li>  each player owns 15 checkers of the same color; </li><li>  In the game they use one pair of <span>dice</span> (zar). </li></ul><p>  Rules for playing backgammon (long and short): </p><ul><li>  each player takes turns; </li><li>  checkers go in a circle, and each player has his own direction of their movement; </li><li>  First, the right of the first move is played using a roll of dice.  Begins the one with the highest number.  With an equal score, the bones are thrown; </li><li>  Each move begins with a roll of dice on one free side of the bar.  If the bones fell outside the bar or on the checker, or stood unevenly, it is necessary to make a second throw; </li><li>  one checker can be made from one to four moves; </li><li>  if the points that have fallen on the bones do not allow making a move to your checker or an empty cell, the move disappears; </li><li>  in case of impossibility to use the number of points of both bones, it is mandatory to use more points of one bone; </li><li>  when all the pieces are in the "house", then the following moves they are removed from the "house". </li></ul><p>  The rules of the game of backgammon are determined by the initial location of the checkers on the board.  The one who first brought the checkers out of the "house" becomes the winner.  The option ‚Äúdraw‚Äù in backgammon is completely excluded.  The winner is always determined in the final.  For winning, the winner can get up to 4 points. </p><p>  The rules of the game of long backgammon mainly consist of the above items.  In addition, you cannot put your checker on the checker of another player;  any number of checkers can be moved;  points on bones are not cumulative;  if there are no permissible moves on the bones, then the move is skipped, since it is not allowed to build an impenetrable barrier.  In addition, the rules of the game of long backgammon are that players must move the checkers in one direction one after another counterclockwise.  The game takes place at a previously determined rate, which is given for points won.  The situation when a player does not have time to take off his checkers, while the second player has already done this, is called "Mars".  In this case, the rate is doubled. </p><p>  Short backgammon rules have the following differences: </p><ul><li>  checkers move towards each other; </li><li>  in short backgammon, you can beat the checkers of another player; </li><li>  the position from which the game begins is more complex; </li><li>  The ‚Äúhouse‚Äù of the player is occupied by 6 and 1 positions and the ‚Äúyard‚Äù of the player is 12 and 7, and his opponent has 19 and 24, 13 and 18. </li></ul><p>  The rules of the game of short backgammon also consist in the fact that the checkers are arranged in such a way: the player has 2 checkers in paragraph 24, 5 in paragraph 13, 3 in the 8th and 5 checkers in paragraph 6. The enemy has the checkers opposite .  Perhaps you will like this fascinating entertainment, especially since the rules for playing backgammon are simple. <strong></strong></p>
