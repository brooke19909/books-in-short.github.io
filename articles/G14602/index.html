But any home cinema should be functional, and therefore, when choosing, see if the model you like meets the following important characteristics: </p><ol><li>  3D support.  Without this feature, it‚Äôs hard to imagine a modern home theater.  Which is the best of today's popular models?  Experts advise choosing those that are equipped with unique 3D-Blu-ray technology.  This is not only the ability to watch videos in the highest quality, but also play the latest games. </li><li>  HDMI inputs  The more of them, the better, because you can connect both a TV and a game console to the cinema at home, and this serves as a guarantee of better and purer sound. </li><li>  Online streaming.  iPlayer is one of the popular features that complement advanced home cinema systems.  Especially convenient is the movie streaming service. </li><li>  Auto sound calibration.  Home 3D-cinema is chosen by many because it has a high-quality picture and the same perfect sound.  Especially good when the sound balance of the speakers can be adjusted using a microphone and save the calibration once. </li><li>  DLNA is a unique system that allows you to watch movies, listen to music that are launched from a computer or stereo. </li><li>  7.1.  This sound system involves the use of additional rear speakers, so you can completely immerse yourself in what is happening on the screen.  Such a powerful home theater in terms of sound will receive only the best reviews. </li></ol><p>  Manufacturers offer a wide selection of expensive and not so models.  We offer you an overview of the most popular options that are attractive both in price and technical characteristics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Samsung HT-E6750W </h2><p>  Home Theater Samsung HT - a classic for centuries.  As a rule, this system is bought for a large TV.  Its features are in many components, due to which the sound in 7.1 format is provided.  True, there are only 6 speakers, so the sound still occurs in the 5.1 system.  What is special about this system? </p><p>  Let's start with the look.  This home theater remembers the front and rear satellites, which are in the form of columns with a height of 1.2 m. This allows you to simply put the speakers on the floor, without thinking about the stands.  The cases are made of plastic, therefore lightweight.  In order not to overload the room with a huge number of wires, and you can‚Äôt do without them, because you need to connect as many as 6 speakers, the brand‚Äôs engineers proposed a simpler solution: the kit has a prefix that is connected to the main part without wires. </p>

Distinctive features include playing 3D Blu-Ray discs, working with Internet services via Wi-Fi, the presence of two HDMI connectors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sony </h2><p>  The home theater Sony BDV-N9100W looks very similar to the previous model.  The front satellites are connected to the main part by wires, and the rear speakers work through a radio channel.  Each speaker has several speakers operating at medium frequencies, which allows you to achieve maximum surround sound.  This Sony home theater is easily calibrated, for this the amplifier has a special input for the tuning microphone, however, you will have to tinker with the settings.  The bulk of the Sony BDV-N9100W deserves attention to functionality.  So, the presence of an optical wire is the guarantee that you can watch disks of almost all formats from any local media.  Easy to configure Wi-Fi access. </p>

Which is better?  Consider the purpose for which you need a system.  So, the Edifier S760D model is a technological and practical multimedia acoustics, which is based on an amplification path, passive radiators and a 10-inch bass speaker.  Thanks to these parameters, the manufacturer managed to achieve a unique sound, and the model does not need to be tuned - everything has already been done in advance. </p>

    <p>  The versatility of the device is that it can be connected not only to the BlueRay player, but also to other sound sources, and this can be done simultaneously without connecting cables.  <span>Connecting a home theater</span> is simple, and changing the sound sources is done with a remote control. </p><p>  <span>Edifier S550</span> Encore is a unique system that is built on the basis of a bass driver of 10 inches.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe radiating surface is increased due to two large passive radiators.  It is noteworthy, but this circuit has no analogues in modern multimedia acoustics and is found only in Hi-Fi speakers.  The home cinema set has cases made entirely of wood, which minimizes acoustic resonances. </p><h2>  Pioneer </h2><p>  The Pioneer BCS-414 Home Cinema is the most economical 3D-capable model with two HDMI inputs.  Nevertheless, competitors' products are much better in technical parameters.  On the other hand, in an affordable price segment it is difficult to find a worthy Pioneer analogue.  When you purchase, you get 4 speakers that look stylish.  The sound is powerful and effective, despite the reduced number of speakers.  The image is also excellent, both in 2D and in 3D. </p>

    <p>  This home theater is not distinguished by ergonomics and thoughtfulness.  Which is better if you want to use space rationally?  This model is swept away immediately, since the vertical columns are too large, and they cannot be disassembled and hung, for example, on a wall.  So if you need a <span>speaker system</span> at an affordable price, but not the most unique technical properties, then you will like Pioneer products. </p><h2>  Panasonic </h2><p>  Panasonic Home Theater SC-BTT775 is quality equipment that is constantly being improved.  This model attracts attention with a memory card slot, numerous connectors and an iPod dock located on the front panel.  This inexpensive home theater is not distinguished by any super-special features, but you get a combination of high quality images with rich sound.  The speakers provide excellent large-scale and weighty sound without imbalance between the front elements and the central part of the system. </p>

    <p>  By connecting the optional SH-FX71 wireless speaker kit, you can make the 7.1 system.  Thus, this system pleases with good sound, excellent price and a lot of connectors, and only weak network capabilities that do not meet modern requirements can be noted among the shortcomings. </p><h2>  LG </h2><p>  Many of us are frightened by the huge selection when we are looking for a high-quality and stylish home theater.  Which is better, it is often difficult to determine until you begin to understand the technical and functional capabilities.  LG HB976TZW is a unique system, as it can be hung on the wall.  The interesting appearance of the system will harmoniously complement any interior without violating its stylistic features.  The design is designed so that the subwoofer and receiver are connected wirelessly, which eliminates cables in the apartment. </p>

    <p>  Built-in Wi-Fi provides high-quality DLNA-streaming and <span>LG Smart TV.</span>  The LG HB976TZW home cinema set pleases not only with good thoughtfulness, but with the true beauty of sound and picture.  By the way, connecting a home theater is also easy.  It is no coincidence that there are a lot of good reviews about this model.  The columns themselves look chic, so you can not be afraid that the appearance of the walls will be spoiled. </p><h2>  What to choose? </h2><p>  As we said, the most imperfect in terms of network capabilities is the Pioneer Cinema.  On the other hand, this is the most inexpensive home cinema (15 000 rubles), which is notable for its high quality.  The LG model (23,000 rubles), which is perfect on all fronts, received more good reviews. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Note that the powerful and high-quality devices are offered by the brands Samsung and Sony.  Their products are always at the hearing, probably, and therefore also is not cheap.  But in terms of picture quality, sound and reasonableness of design, more chic models cannot be found, however, in their price category.  So the choice is yours: either an affordable price, or ideal options to watch movies and listen to music in the highest quality. </p>
