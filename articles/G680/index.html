  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Such a necessary and useful humidifier for a children's room</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the appearance of a child in the family, the question arises of creating the most comfortable conditions in his room.  Parents buy clothes, beautiful toys, but sometimes they forget that for the baby the microclimate in which he grows is more important.  Namely, clean and fairly humid air.  Often, various childhood diseases, such as colds, dysbiosis, an allergic reaction, can be the result of dry, with insufficient <span>humidity, air.</span>  Humidification is especially important during the winter season when heating appliances are working. </p><p>  To ensure the optimum level of humidity, it is necessary to install a humidifier for the nursery in the baby's room.  This device can be bought at household appliances stores, but first it is advisable to study the types and models offered by manufacturers in order to make the right choice.  After all, items that affect the health of the child must be selected with special care.  The principle of operation of an air humidifier is to maintain optimal humidity in the room by cold or hot evaporation.  Humidifiers are convenient and easy to operate. </p><p>  Do not even doubt whether you need a humidifier in your home.  Indeed, low humidity is an unfavorable factor for human health.  Dry air is not only the cause of respiratory and other diseases, but also negatively affects your skin, making it rough and flaky.  Not only people suffer from excessive dryness, but also plants and wood products: furniture, wooden floors, musical instruments. </p><p>  <strong>Humidifier Models</strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are four types of humidifiers on sale today: traditional, steam, ultrasonic and atomizers used in industry.  Some models not only moisturize, but also have the function of purifying the air. </p><p>  Some experts consider the traditional technology of a humidifier for the nursery to be the optimal solution.  It applies the principle of "cold" evaporation.  Dry air drawn inward by a fan passes through a mesh saturated with water.  As a result, it is not only moisturized, but also cleansed.  Such moisturizers consume little energy, are not too noisy and can be used in aromatherapy.  Nice models, priced from 150 to 400 cu: Air-o-Swiss and Duracraft (DH-830, 837E, 836). </p><p>  <span>A steam humidifier is</span> not very suitable for a child‚Äôs room due to the principle of ‚Äúhot‚Äù evaporation.  Devices are inexpensive and with high performance.  They raise the temperature in the room and consume a lot of electricity (up to 400 W), and to control humidity they require an additional device - a hygrostat, the cost of which is almost the same as the humidifier itself.  For children, they can be dangerous with a jet of hot steam, with a temperature of about 60 degrees.  Well-known manufacturers of steam humidifiers - AOS, BONECO, BALLU. </p><p>  The most advanced humidifiers are ultrasonic.  A piezoelectric element, oscillating with high frequency, turns water into a kind of fog.  Passing through a foggy cloud, dry air gains moisture.  The best models have a filter that further purifies the liquid.  <span>Ultrasonic humidifiers</span> have several advantages.  They are able to maintain a user-selected humidity level.  Possible built-in timer.  They are economical (consume about 40 watts) and silent.  A replacement filter cartridge is quite expensive, but using distilled water can reduce the frequency of necessary replacements.  Prices for such humidifiers range from 130 to 190 cu  But the substance released during the operation of the ultrasonic humidifier is similar to an aerosol.  A child with insufficiently formed lungs is not able to breathe such air.  Therefore, experts advise installing these devices in children's rooms, only if the baby is more than four years old. </p><p>  Spraying household humidifiers (atomizers) are used exclusively in industry, therefore, in the context of this topic, they do not interest us. </p><p>  Having bought a humidifier for a nursery, you can worry less about the health of your child.  But for high-quality and long service life of the device, follow the instructions for the user and do not forget that any household appliances require care. </p>
