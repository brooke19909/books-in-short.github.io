    <p>  Huge by those standards - 6000 m <sup>2</sup> , it was carved directly into the limestone rock.  At one time, it accommodated up to 10,000 spectators during gladiatorial battles.  But it was also used for theatrical performances, and in the days of early Christianity for public executions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to the tradition of that time, the amphitheater was divided into several sectors (according to the estates), each of which led its own entrance.  Since the 19th century, it became the property of the capital and is under protection. </p><p>  Today, theatrical performances, festivals and concerts are held here.  All of Sardinia, Cagliari, first of all, comes to fairs held in the ancient walls. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  Many pilgrims know Sardinia, Cagliari (many have seen the photo below, it depicts the church in question) thanks to the Cathedral of St. Mary, founded in the 13th century on the basis of a small church of the same name.  Since that time, it was rebuilt several times, each time giving an increasingly baroque look to the originally strict Romanesque style.  This went on for several centuries, until the next architect ordered to dismantle the baroque jewelry and returned to the cathedral its pristine beauty, which tourists can still admire today. </p>

    <p>  The interior of the temple is very magnificent, and the preserved medieval frescoes, columns and arches convey the atmosphere of humility and faith, characteristic of the people of that time.  Today it is a place of pilgrimage, since the holy relics of the Sicilian martyrs and one of the most important relics of Catholicism - thorns from the crown of thorns of Jesus Christ are in the cathedral. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  The island of Sardinia (Cagliari), planned at the beginning of the 18th century, received the island only 60 years later, after the Palabanda Valley began to belong to the capital's university.  It was students under the guidance of professors who created it with their own hands. </p><p>  Among the ancient Roman water supply systems and grottoes, more than 2000 species of plants from different parts of the planet grow.  The garden is divided into 40 zones, each of which contains certain types of flora.  We should also pay attention to the huge herbarium located in this territory.  Its uniqueness lies in the fact that some of its specimens are plants that no longer grow on the planet. </p><h2>  Beaches of sardinia </h2><p>  On this island you can find a place by the sea for every taste - and where there are people like herrings in a barrel, and where there is practically nobody (you have to get here by transport).  All beaches in Cagliari (Sardinia) are clean and quality sand.  The most popular among guests of the island and the local population is Poetto - a place where you can sunbathe all day, and sit at night in one of the restaurants or a bar, enjoying the local cuisine and the sound of the surf. </p>
