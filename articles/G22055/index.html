  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Flotilla": reviews of residents, location, layout of apartments</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In big cities there are many people.  Many of them still prefer to move for permanent residence from more remote areas with severe climatic conditions.  Everyone needs to live somewhere.  Only a small part of the residents acquire or build housing in the countryside.  Nevertheless, most people prefer not to change conditions and live in the city.  For such buyers, new buildings are suitable.  In many cities of Russia, residential complexes of the same name are being built.  So, for example, Flotilia residential complex was built in Moscow, Krasnodar and Novosibirsk, reviews about which largely depend on the developer in a particular region. </p><h2>  Identical in different cities </h2><p>  All of the above cities are the largest in terms of population in the country.  Developers are not tired of erecting more and more new projects of residential buildings in them.  If land plots are allocated within the city, then, as a rule, residential buildings of comfort class or business class are built.  The available reviews about the Flotilia residential complex in megacities suggest that these buildings are not classified as ordinary metropolitan buildings. </p><h2>  Complex in Moscow </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.8534719" data-lng="37.497635100000025" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/6/8/9/16689.png"></div><p>  At a distance of about 10 minutes walk from the Rechnoy Vokzal metro station (in the Khovrino area, on 7 Flotskaya Street), the first of the described complexes is located in the capital.  These are four towers with a facade in the form of a sail, which seems to send on a journey through the waves.  Sustained in marine style and color, the quarter brings a new breath to the architecture of the capital.  The purchase of an apartment in this particular Flotilia residential complex, according to reviews, allows to fulfill all expectations.  Spread across from the park gives you the opportunity to breathe fresh air, walk and relax in your free time.  The infrastructure of the complex, a closed guarded territory, its own sports and recreation area allow apartment owners to enjoy the benefits of this particular residential complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Flotilla in Moscow" class="if uuid-3192938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3192938.jpg"></div><h2>  "Flotilla" in Krasnodar </h2><p>  The authorities of Krasnodar provided the developer, the construction company SpetsStroyKuban, one of the most promising land plots.  Its location within the city - at a distance of 3.5 kilometers from the center - guarantees the success of the development project.  Justifying the name of the residential complex, the company is building five 19-story houses, choosing the image of an ocean liner for the architectural solution.  During construction, cast-brick technology is used, which makes buildings more stable and durable.  Residents of the complex will not experience almost any inconvenience.  There are many public transport routes in this area, well-developed infrastructure, a city park and a boulevard are within walking distance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Complex view" class="if uuid-3192932" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3192932.jpg"></div><h2>  Complex in Novosibirsk </h2><p>  And in Novosibirsk, reviews about the Flotilia residential complex - after completion of construction and settlement - will be mostly positive.  This complex, represented by three 25-story buildings, is being built almost in the center of the city with a million inhabitants.  Its original architectural solution with a hint of the ship‚Äôs image, modern technologies and used building materials, proper names of residential buildings, a landscaped courtyard - all this makes the housing in the complex the most comfortable and sets it apart from the typical city buildings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful Novosibirsk" class="if uuid-3192933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3192933.jpg"></div><h2>  Layout of apartments </h2><p>  The apartments in all three described complexes are designed by developers to satisfy any requirements of buyers.  You can buy both small - by modern standards - one-room apartments, and spacious three- and four-room apartments.  Due to the peculiarities of the architectural style in the form of a ship, the layout of apartments in some cases is original.  In the Moscow version, in the corner apartments there are beveled corners of the outer rooms and sharp-shaped balconies.  In Novosibirsk, they are, on the contrary, rounded, since the residential building itself has an oval shape.  The Krasnodar developer also offers semicircular and beveled options for the premises.  All of them are spacious, sufficient to embody the most daring ideas of customers in design and repair. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Creation of Novosibirsk" class="if uuid-3192934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3192934.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews about the complex in Moscow </h2><p>  Reviews of those who received the keys in the Flotilia residential complex in the capital are already available on the Internet, since all the houses were built and put into operation in mid-2017.  The owners of apartments in this complex are happy with many circumstances.  Important is the provision of a free parking space.  People like the originality of the facades, panoramic views, transport accessibility of the complex.  The developer did not overstate the cost of housing, although he positioned it as a business-class housing. </p><p>  Many, judging by the reviews of the Flotilia residential complex in Moscow, are satisfied with the location of the complex.  From where you can quickly get to work, as there is a metro station nearby and there are many land transport routes.  But there is also a discontented minority - I do not like the quality of the decoration or any flaws in the maintenance of the management company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Complex in Moscow" class="if uuid-3192935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3192935.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews about the complex in Krasnodar </h2><p>  At present, Flotilia residential complex in Krasnodar is already collecting feedback, as houses are being commissioned and are slowly being populated by residents.  As in the case of the capital's developer, the company ‚ÄúSpetsStroyKuban‚Äù, having chosen a good place for the construction of the complex, provided its perspective and attractiveness.  Being in a busy area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city near the highway, the boulevard and the city park did not slow to affect the start of apartment sales.  Buyers like stained glass, unusual facade design.  This complex is significantly different from typical residential buildings, which adds advantages to the piggy bank reviews. </p><h2>  Complex in Novosibirsk through the eyes of residents </h2><p>  In Novosibirsk, reviews about the Flotilia residential complex can also be found on the forums.  The houses were commissioned, the arrangement of the courtyard area is nearing completion.  Many have already purchased housing here.  So, at a moderate pace, the overall picture of opinions is taking shape.  Unusual, eye-catching facade design, panoramic glazing, partially equipped courtyard area with fountains, playgrounds, security system - for the sake of such benefits, many changed their place of residence to a more comfortable place or decided to start their history of owning real estate from this residential complex. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Flotilla&quot; Novosibirsk" class="if uuid-3192936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3192936.jpg"></div><p>  The shortcomings that have emerged in the form of negative reviews are largely due to the still not debugged work of the management companies, arising minor flaws in the settlement, arrangement in a new place. </p><p>  Summarizing the information about customer reviews in the Flotilia residential complex of apartments, it is worth noting that in rare cases, developers design and implement such original architectural solutions, giving preference to more familiar typical buildings.  But it is the courage of construction companies that makes it possible to diversify the grayness of cities. </p>
