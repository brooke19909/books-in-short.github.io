    <p>  <span>When choosing a</span> Lenovo 7-inch <span>tablet</span> , first you need to sort the devices by the merits of the screen.  Despite the same size, the displays in different devices can vary greatly. </p><p>  First, pay attention to the installed matrix.  Lenovo company most often uses IPS technology, but among the products you can also find lower-quality displays.  For example, the image of a tablet with a TFT matrix will be much worse.  Using IPS technology will allow the device to have not only large viewing angles, but also increase the brightness of the image. </p><p>  When examining a Lenovo 7-inch tablet, you must definitely study the resolution characteristics.  Most of the company's devices have a minimum for this screen size of 1280 by 600 pixels.  It is desirable that this parameter be higher.  Large resolution will greatly improve the image and make the pixels invisible. </p><p>  Pay attention to the protection of the display.  Poor coating will collect scratches and fingerprints.  Reliable protection will allow the screen and its sensor to work as efficiently as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  It is important that the Lenovo 7-inch tablets with a SIM card are properly assembled.  Almost all devices hide card slots behind a special panel.  If the assembly is dishonest, fasteners can become loose quickly.  As a result, Simka will be left without proper protection.  You should thoroughly check the mechanism of fasteners and the quality of the material. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenovo 7 inch tablets with 3G" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39041/1042273.jpg" width="446"></div>

    <p>  Tablets weigh significantly more phones and are more difficult to hold with one hand, so you should pay attention to the cover of the case.  A heavy and slippery device may fall right during a call.  It is advisable to choose a device made of matte plastic or with a corrugated panel. </p><h2>  Communication </h2>

    <p>  Particular attention must be paid to the quality of the antenna of the device.  It depends on her communication and the work of the tablet with cards.  Some manufacturers, unfortunately, do not give a damn about this parameter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By purchasing Lenovo devices, the owner will not worry about the antenna.  The company pays enough attention to this detail.  It should be noted that Lenovo 7-inch tablets with 3G cannot always ring.  On models such as the A3500, this feature is limited.  The user can send and receive messages, but calls are not available. </p><p>  Many representatives of Lenovo have as many as two slots designed for cards.  However, not many devices can boast the presence of several radio modules.  Accordingly, when you call, the second SIM will become inactive. </p><p>  Having chosen the Lenovo 7 inch tablet, the user will also receive many useful functions.  In addition to Wi-Fi, in the company's devices there is a smart GPS.  Also, the owner will have access to GPRS-connection, which will allow you to connect to the Internet anywhere. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2>

    <p>  When buying a Lenovo 7-inch tablet, it‚Äôs important to choose a model with a powerful battery.  Since the device, in addition to the usual tasks, will also fulfill the duties of a smartphone. </p><p>  The representative of the company A3000-H with two SIM cards has a battery of only 3500 maH.  This is enough for the tablet to work, but not enough to act as a phone.  When making calls and using the Internet, the device will last a little more than two hours.  Such an indicator will not especially please the owner, which means that you need to choose a device with a more powerful battery. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  It must be remembered that, in addition to having a SIM card, the 7-inch Lenovo tablet should have a good filling.  Fortunately, among the devices that support cards, there are many advanced devices. </p><p>  The vast majority of Lenovo devices operate under the guidance of an MTK processor.  Only its model and the number of cores differ.  A good solution might be the A3300 tablet.  This device supports SIM cards and has an impressive filling. </p><p>  The Lenovo A3300 has a familiar MTK processor with 4 cores with a frequency of 1.3 GHz each.  Enough and RAM - a whole gigabyte.  In addition to the ability to call, the user will receive a very frisky device that can perform a lot of tasks. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The manufacturer does not particularly shine with a variety of platforms for devices.  In the tablets of the company exclusively ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù is used.  Only the system versions differ, and this is very important for the device.  The new version of the system makes it possible to use the Lenovo 7 inch tablet more efficiently.  In addition to a well-developed and augmented interface, the owner will receive a lot of useful programs and entertainment. </p><h2>  Price </h2>

    <p>  The company can offer both budget and expensive device options that support SIM cards.  The price of the Lenovo 7 inch tablet depends on the filling, functions and communication features. </p><p>  One of the cheapest is the A7 model, its price is approximately six and a half thousand rubles.  This is quite a budget and quite attractive option. </p><p>  The representative of the flagships PB1-770M is much more expensive.  The price of this incredibly powerful device is 24 thousand rubles.  Quite an impressive amount, but this is a tablet and a phone all rolled into one. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The standard set of devices is rather meager.  In addition to the tablet, the user will receive a usb cable, adapter, instructions.  Together with more expensive representatives, a headset sometimes comes.  Having bought a cheap model, the owner, most likely, will have to additionally purchase headphones. </p><p>  A reasonable choice would be to purchase a protective cover for the device.  This will help not only protect the removable panels, but also to avoid unwanted damage and scratches. </p><h2>  Emerging issues </h2><p>  Describing the Lenovo 7-inch tablet, reviews note several significant drawbacks.  One of these problems is the blocked call feature on some 3G models. </p><p>  Also, in budget devices, sometimes there are problems with the light sensor.  <span>Cheap tablets are</span> not able to automatically adjust the screen settings, and this is rather unpleasant. </p><p>  The device system also makes itself felt.  Most tablets with a card have an Android phone interface.  This affects the adaptation of some games and programs.  Applications are difficult to adjust to the size of the display. </p><p>  A very common problem is the battery of the device.  Batteries have enough capacity for the functions of the tablet, but communication support spoils everything.  In the call mode, the devices discharge incredibly quickly, so the battery should be given due attention. </p><h2>  Positive traits </h2>

    <p>  The mass of Lenovo products is able to accommodate two SIM cards.  This affects the work for the better and allows you to abandon the phone altogether. </p><p>  Surprise the user and the price ratio.  The cost of a budget tablet is similar to an inexpensive phone.  At the same time, the tablet has a more advanced filling and a large screen. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  When choosing a device with cards, you should not focus on one characteristic.  The tablet should be versatile with little emphasis on the battery.  It is also important to study the communication features of the device.  However, the rest of the method of <span>choosing a tablet</span> is the same as for smartphones. </p>
