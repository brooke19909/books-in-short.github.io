Why is everyone avoiding 3 star hotels?  What is the difference between these classes, what kind of reviews do vacationers leave about three-star hotels in Kemer?  To find out, you need to familiarize yourself with the basic principles of the spa facilities themselves. </p><h2>  Hotel category 3 stars in foreign resorts </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer 3 star hotels all inclusive" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55974/2028322.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Of course, a tour operator in paints will tell any customer only about the benefits of a 3-star hotel stay, if he has a limited budget.  But how different is reality from stories? </p><p>  All-inclusive hotels in Kemer (3 stars), as well as in other cities in Turkey, offer accommodation, meals, use of sunbeds, animation, swimming in the pool, visiting a restaurant with a particular cuisine, safe and air conditioning. </p><h2>  What is it worth to be prepared if, nevertheless, your choice fell on a 3 * hotel </h2><p>  Firstly, the repair is likely to be old or new, but without any frills: modest wallpaper, paint or plaster. </p><p>  Secondly, furniture and plumbing are also likely to be not the first freshness.  Sometimes they can be broken or have defects. </p><p>  Thirdly, the arrangement of the room itself is not a luxury apartment, but rather a modest corner, where there is a bed for rest, chairs or an armchair, a table or a bedside table, a small wardrobe (often built-in) for 4-5 hangers.  The bathroom is also a small room with a toilet, a washstand and a shower cabin (often imitated and made according to the principle of an ordinary "washbasin"). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Meals here include a buffet.  Although Kemer hotels offer 3 stars all-inclusive, sometimes chefs will put dishes in portions on a plate (while the additive may or may not be).  A not very large selection of dishes, fruits and meat distinguishes this class of hotels from others.  But still there is plenty to choose from and how to diversify your diet for a week. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="HOTELS TURKEY 3 STARS ALL INCLUDED KEMER" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55974/2028324.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Beaches are most often located remotely from hotels.  It so happened that during the development of the tourism business, hotels below the class are being pushed into the city.  But not all.  Despite this situation, every Kemer hotel with 3 stars (‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù) has its own beach or a plot on it, albeit somewhat remote.  For a comfortable holiday by the sea, you can sometimes walk 200-300 m. </p><h2>  Most Popular 3 Star All-Inclusive Hotels in Kemer (Turkey) </h2><p>  Kemer offers tourists several areas for a spa holiday: </p><ul><li>  Camyuva; </li><li>  Finike; </li><li>  Tekirova; </li><li>  Kirish; </li><li>  Kemer; </li><li>  Goynuk; </li><li>  Beldibi. </li></ul><p>  Naturally, most vacationers prefer the first line of hotels with 3 stars in Kemer.  All Inclusive is a popular catering system in the resort, and it is available in many places.  The following most popular hotels are available for vacationers to choose from, judging by the reviews: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Odile Hotel 3 *; </li><li>  Valeri Beach Hotel; </li><li>  Haldun's Beach Club; </li><li>  Britannia Hotel; </li><li>  <span>Belpoint Beach Hotel</span> ; </li><li>  <span>Aybel Inn Hotel</span> ; </li><li>  Hotel Golden Sun; </li><li>  Hotel Intersport; </li><li>  Beach Club Pinara. </li></ul>

Some are being rebuilt (usually 4-5 stars), some are being restored and rebuilt from other buildings, creating small and budget hotels.  As a rule, the staff of such institutions also changes very often.  Therefore, it is impossible to focus on old reviews about this place in order to get a full picture of the condition of the hotels and the quality of service in it.  It is necessary to track information exactly in the year in which the trip is planned. </p><p>  As with everything, there are exceptions, so you should take a look at the rating of the most popular 3-star all-inclusive hotels in Kemer. </p><h2>  Rating of resort hotels ready to receive tourists in Kemer </h2><p>  How is this rating compiled?  It is based on an assessment of the ratio of price and quality of services.  At the same time, it is formed from the reviews of travelers who have already visited a particular place.  If we talk about the rating of Turkish 3 * class hotels in Kemer over the past year, then the following picture develops.  The best hotels were recognized: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Peker Hotel 3 *; </li><li>  Tal Hotel; </li><li>  Aquarius Hotel; </li><li>  Yusuf Pension; </li><li>  Blue Orange </li><li>  Korient Mira Hotel; </li><li>  Rosarium; </li><li>  Idyros; </li><li>  Odile Hotel; </li><li>  Pine house; </li><li>  Club Ares; </li><li>  Kybele Hotel Tekirova; </li><li>  Castle Park Hotel Beldibi; </li><li>  <span>Forest Park Hotel</span> ; </li><li>  Paradise Hotel. </li></ul><p>  This does not mean that all other hotels are terrible, they simply either have more disadvantages, or there is not enough information about them in the form of reviews from vacationers. </p><h2>  Hotel description Tal Hotel </h2><p>  If we talk about the best Kemer hotels in Beldibi with 3 stars and all-inclusive, then you should definitely consider the option of staying at the Tal Hotel. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer 3 star hotels all inclusive reviews" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55974/2028323.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main advantages of the hotel tourists include: the presence of a bar on the hotel and on the beach, free use of sun loungers, umbrellas and towels both near the pool and near the sea, the use of laundry, fitness room, parking, sauna, gym and swimming pools (children's and adults). </p><p>  The rooms are equipped with TV, air conditioning, telephone and hairdryer.  Use of the safe is paid, the safe is located at the reception.  The administrator‚Äôs working hours are around the clock. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel is on the first line, it is separated from the sea by densely planted greens, so a passage through the promenade of 200 meters is used.  The hotel has its own beach, sand and gravel, 27 meters long. </p><h2>  Kemer 3 Star All Inclusive Hotel Reviews </h2><p>  As mentioned above, vacationers in 3-star all-inclusive hotels in Kemer are not satisfied with almost the same moments: monotonous food, poor animation or its complete absence, remoteness from the sea and old repairs. </p><p>  In general, absolutely all hotels are very similar to each other in terms of arrangement of rooms and the provision of services. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer Best 3 Star All Inclusive Hotels" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55974/2028321.jpg" width="600"></div>
