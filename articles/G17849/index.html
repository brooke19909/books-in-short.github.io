    <p>  <em>About the rulers</em> </p><p>  Since the beginning of the <span>reign of Nicholas the First</span> in 1825, the rulers in our country have alternated on the principle of "bald - hairy."  This pattern has survived to this day. </p><p>  <em>About television</em> </p><p>  In 1992, the chiming clock on television on New Year's Eve was delayed for one minute. </p><p>  <em>About money</em> </p><p>  The double-headed eagle on coins is not the emblem of the country, but the emblem of the Bank of Russia. </p><p>  <em>Scientific historical fact</em> </p><p>  The only <span>time traveler</span> in the world lives in Russia <span>.</span>  This person is <span>Sergey Krikalev.</span>  He spent more than 800 hours in space, moving at high speed.  According to the theory of relativity, time slows down at high speeds.  It was estimated that the astronaut returned to Earth 0.02 seconds younger. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em>About laws</em> </p><p>  In 1994, the government passed a law prohibiting dogs from barking from 23.00 to 7.00.  This law is valid now, but only in Moscow.  It is also noteworthy that the legislative act does not spell out what punishment the offender will incur. </p><p>  <em>Facts from Geography</em> </p><p>  The RF is almost twice as large as the United States.  St. Petersburg metro is the deepest in the whole world.  <span>The Trans-Siberian Railway</span> connects the capital and the city of Vladivostok and is the longest railway line in the world.  Siberian taiga - 8% of terrestrial land. </p><p>  <em>Equipment</em> </p><p>  There are much more Kalashnikovs in the world than all other weapon models combined. </p><h2>  On the rulers and laws of tsarist Russia </h2>

They were obliged not to remove it for seven days. </p><p>  Racquetmaking is the agency in charge of petitioning under Peter the Great. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An interesting <span>history of Russia</span> is rich in facts from the life of the tsarist army: Nikolai the First, as punishment for the guilty officers, provided the choice between keeping watch out of turn and listening to the opera. </p><p>  Denbei is the first Japanese to enter Russia.  In 1695 he arrived in Kamchatka, and in 1701 he reached Moscow.  Peter the First ordered him to teach Japanese to Russian children in schools. </p><p>  "Here lies Suvorov" - an inscription on the plate at the monument to the commander. </p><p>  Boris and Gleb are the first Russian saints (1072). </p><h2>  Interesting historical facts in pre-revolutionary Russia </h2>

    <p>  In the village of Baikonur, in the Kazakhstan SSR, a wooden spaceport was built in the 1950s.  This was done in order to mislead enemy states.  The real spaceport is located more than 350 km from this village. </p><p>  During World War II, a flying tank was designed in the USSR on the basis of the design of the A-40 tank, but the project was closed due to a lack of powerful towing vehicles. </p><p>  The laser gun was invented in the Soviet Union in 1984. </p><p>  The Americans proposed that the USSR launch the first into space not dogs but blacks. </p><p>  GAZ-21 has a wide range of models, including a model with a right-hand drive and an automatic transmission. </p><p>  The T-28 tank could overcome "lunar landscapes."  That was the name of the territory that was seriously affected by the hostilities. </p><p>  Scientific and historical fact: the spacecraft, which the Soviet Union wanted to launch into space to explore Mars, during the tests showed that there is no life on Earth.

    <p>  This or that historical fact is not always believable and understandable to a contemporary.  Examples are given below. </p><p>  During the time of Genghis Khan, in Mongolia, everyone who dared to urinate in any body of water was executed.  Because water in the desert was valued more than gold. </p><p>  In England, in the years 1665-1666, the plague devastated entire villages.  It was then that medicine recognized smoking as useful, which supposedly destroyed a deadly infection.  Children and adolescents were punished if they refused to smoke. </p><p>  Ancient Egyptian beauties evenly distributed pieces of fat through their hair.  In the sun, they thawed and evenly covered the hair with a thick shiny layer, which was considered very fashionable. </p><p>  The famous inventor of the sewing machine, Isaac Singer, was simultaneously married to five women at once.  In total, he had 15 children from all women.  All daughters called Mary.  Probably not to be mistaken ... </p><p>  Interesting historical facts of funeral subjects: the English admiral Nelson, who lived from 1758 to 1805, slept in his cabin in a coffin, which was cut down from the mast of an enemy French ship.  His "feat" was repeated by French actress <span>Sarah Bernhardt,</span> who taught her texts while lying in a coffin.  She often took this props on tour, which was very annoying to others.  In the Middle Ages, sailors specifically inserted at least one golden tooth, even sacrificing a healthy one.  What for?  It turns out that on a rainy day, so that in case of death he could be buried with honor away from home. </p><p>  About half of New Yorkers have been speaking several languages ‚Äã‚Äãsince the age of 5, except for native American English. </p><p>  In 2007, about 46 million tourists visited New York and left more than $ 28 billion in the city! </p><p>  <span>The shortest war</span> in history has lasted only 38 minutes.  So many "fought" Zanzibar and England in 1896.  England won. </p><h2>  Some more myths.  Or is it true? </h2>

    <p>  Historians claim that on Cocos Island, located 300 miles south of Costa Rica, pirates hid a $ 2 billion treasure.  The search is carried out by archaeologists. </p><p>  The most incomprehensible secret of mankind is death.  What happens to a person after he dies?  Modern scientists conduct large-scale and multimillion-dollar research in this area.  So far, there is only a 100% conclusion that human consciousness continues to exist after physical death. </p><p>  Official data from the British Admiralty claim that as a result of shipwrecks, an eighth of all gold and silver mined on earth rests on the seabed.  Today on the black market you can buy an old map with the coordinates of the treasures.  Is this true or fraud?  In 1985, on this map, Mel Fischer found the Spanish galleon Nuestra Senora off the coast of Florida, which sank back in 1622.  From the bottom of the vessel he managed to raise valuables by 450 (!) Million dollars. </p><p>  In some countries, every movement of citizens is monitored by special services using Internet tracking programs.  Sensors are built into modern telephones, televisions, computers.  World espionage is booming.  Is it true?  Who knows... </p>
