    <h2>  Anti-crisis innovations </h2><p>  Having figured out how to cash maternity capital up to 3 years, we turn to the issue of using funds.  In 2014, legislation was amended regarding the procedure for obtaining state support.  In particular, from the total amount of 20 thousand rubles.  can be received in cash and used for everyday needs.  Such an anti-crisis plan is valid only for persons who have received the right to MK in the period from 2007 to the end of 2015.  They must submit an application before March 31, 2016 to the FIU or the Multifunctional Center for Public Services (MFC).  The same documents are attached to it: parent's passport, certificate, SNILS, bank details for the transfer of funds.  The application is considered within a month.  After making a positive decision, the money is transferred to a bank account within another 30 days. </p><p>  The second change concerns families with two children.  Such parents can use the money to pay for their education, treatment of a disabled child.  But this item does not apply to couples who have twins.  To receive money, it is enough to provide an application and a certified copy of the contract for the provision of paid services.  Funds can be used to pay for the services of private kindergartens. </p><h2>  Inheritance </h2><p>  One of the ways to use MK funds is to form part of the pension.  If the parent dies within 10 years from the date of application, the income from the investment and the balance of MK will be paid to the second guardian or children.  Without issuing an urgent payment, MK will be sent to the funded part of the pension without the right of inheritance. </p><h2>  Problems of social program development </h2><p>  According to statistics, only a third of families use their right to maternity capital.  Buying a house (up to 3 years old, the baby feels rather well in a 1-room apartment, but over time, as you know, it will be necessary to expand), financing construction, reconstruction is an important decision for young families, which imposes a huge financial burden.  Due to the imperfection of the legislative framework and a short list of possibilities for using MK, even state support funds do not encourage young parents to get long-term loans. </p>

    <h2>  Semi-legal methods </h2><p>  The use of maternity capital up to 3 years is strictly controlled by law.  Therefore, you need to be very careful not to fall for scam schemes.  The most common and often used of them is the exchange of a certificate for cash with a certain discount.  However, it should be remembered that any schemes with the sale of the mentioned document are illegal. </p><p>  However, a semi-legal way still exists.  You can spend maternity capital up to 3 years on the "purchase" of housing.  Some realtors offer a selection of premises in the area with the lowest prices.  By footage, housing should be no less than the one in which the family lives.  Part of the cost is paid in cash, and the remainder - through a certificate.  Upon completion of the transaction, new housing is put up for sale, and cash (net of all fees) is returned to parents.  Here's how to use maternity capital up to 3 years.  This scheme has disadvantages.  Firstly, you need to provide about half a million rubles to pay the advance.  Secondly, you have to wait three months for the pension fund to transfer the rest of the funds to the seller.  Thirdly, the cost of services of realtors and notaries can reach 20-30% of the total transaction amount. </p><p>  There is another option, how to use maternity capital up to 3 years.  You can crank a similar deal with a relative or intermediary.  She will allow a young family to save more money.  But there is a risk that the seller will hide with money, leaving his family with an apartment purchased at an inflated price. </p><p>  On the facts of fraud with MK annually a large number of criminal cases.  Therefore, it is better not to look for risky schemes, but to use legal methods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maternity capital child under 3 years old" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1002102.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  FAQ </h2><p>  Consider the most common questions regarding the use of MK. </p><p>  State support funds can be used to purchase premises under an annuity contract, to complete the building, even if a third person (one of relatives) is then registered in it.  It is also worth noting that the law refers to the reconstruction of a residential building, not an apartment.  It is forbidden to use money to buy movable property.  Although sometimes the need for a car can be higher than for housing.  The same goes for land.  At the expense of MK you can build a house, but you can not buy land. </p><p>  Where can I spend maternity capital up to 3 years remaining after the acquisition of housing?  For the same purpose: </p><ul><li>  improvement of living conditions; </li><li>  getting an education; </li><li>  formation of part of the retirement pension. </li></ul><p>  MK funds are not available to Russian citizens who permanently reside in another country and want to use the capital to buy or remodel a home abroad.  Money can be spent on buying a home in any city in Russia, even different from the place of residence.  Funds are not given to mothers who take custody of a child.  And in the case of the birth of two or more children, a certificate can be issued for a child who was born later in time. </p>

    <p>  Maternity capital for housing up to 3 years does not affect the right to receive other payments.  For example, if a family received a social pension due to the loss of a breadwinner, the emergence of the right to receive MK cannot affect the size of these payments.  Due to the certificate, you can not pay for repairs in an apartment, a house, buy household appliances or furniture. </p><h2>  Loans </h2><p>  State aid funds can be spent on payment of the main debt and interest on loan agreements.  This item does not include transactions for the purchase of real estate on the terms of installment payments from relatives, acquaintances, etc. First, a transaction can only be concluded with a legal entity.  Secondly, a loan agreement and a sales contract are two different documents. </p><p>  Another nuance.  The direction of MK to pay off part of the mortgage debt does not affect further debt payments.  In this case, state aid funds perform a payment function.  If after a few years the borrower's financial situation changes, he will cease to make payments to pay off the debt, the court may decide to evict the family from the apartment, even if a minor child is registered in it.  In the future, it is possible to sell housing purchased at the expense of MK, but only after fulfillment of obligations to the state.  For example, if a family acquired ‚Äúodnushka‚Äù and paid for it with funds from a certificate, and then decided to increase the living space, then first it needs to be ‚Äúregistered‚Äù with parents and all children, and then put up for sale.  To complete the transaction, it will be necessary to obtain the consent of all adult roommates and the guardianship authority.  Shares between owners are distributed by agreement (written application), regardless of how much of the cost of housing was repaid by MK.  If this item is not spelled out in the document, then most likely all owners will receive equal shares. </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  One of the ways to use MK funds is to pay for children's education.  It is important that the educational institution is located on the territory of the Russian Federation.  The child's age at the time of the start of education should be less than 25 years.  This option may be suitable for families in which the second child was born after 2007, and the first is already graduating from school. </p>

    <h2>  Share ownership </h2><p>  A lot of questions are caused by the situation when the certificate of registration of real estate indicates that ¬Ω of the apartment building is registered for the tenant, and the person asks to spend state aid to buy the remaining half.  In this case, it will not work to use maternity capital up to 3 years.  The "Double Home" receives the status of a 2-apartment residential building.  Before contacting the PF for funds, you need to divide the property on paper.  This applies to cases when a person acquires part of someone else‚Äôs home.  If he wants to improve his living conditions by buying out the remaining half of the apartment in which he already lives, there should not be such problems. </p><p>  According to Art.  15, 16 of the RF Housing Code, an isolated room is recognized as residential, which is suitable for citizens.  These include: </p><ul><li>  residential building, its part; </li><li>  apartment, its part; </li><li>  room. </li></ul><p>  A residential building is a building with rooms, in which there is an auxiliary use room.  Part of such a structure should be isolated, with a separate entrance. </p><p>  It is not necessary to register the whole family at a new address right away.  But after the mortgage has been paid off, it must be indicated that the purchased property is in the common ownership of the parents and all children (in shares, by agreement).  Very often, parents refuse to register part of the property for themselves, wanting to distribute it among the heirs.  This is against the terms of the program.  All family members must be included in the new living space.  Property purchased at the expense of MK is not joint; it is not subject to division.  That is, after a divorce, each of the spouses will remain the owner of their share. </p><h2>  Several variants </h2><p>  The duration of the state aid program is limited.  Therefore, persons who already have the right to receive funds, but do not yet know how to dispose of them, should hurry up with a decision.  The legislation provides for the use of all or part of MK‚Äôs funds for improving housing conditions, getting an education, and forming a funded pension.  Suppose the option of using several directions at the same time.  If the certificate holder has decided to spend up to 3 years of maternity capital on the formation of the <span>funded part of the retirement pension,</span> he has the right to change his mind and redirect funds to either of the two remaining directions until retirement age. </p>

    <h2>  Limitations </h2><p>  <span>Maternity capital for construction</span> (up to 3 years) can be obtained by citizens of the Russian Federation, even if they live in other countries, but only once.  That is, if during the period of the state aid program the second and third children reached the age of three, then the certificate can still be issued only for one of the children. </p><p>  For couples who are married, there are limitations.  Men in such families cannot receive a certificate if the acquired property is not subsequently issued for both parents and children. </p><p>  For individuals who have issued a mortgage before the program began to operate, with equity participation (that is, for two or more borrowers), the PF may refuse to issue MK funds.  It is worth trying to contact the bank with a request to renew the contract for one person.  If the credit institution makes a positive decision, you can issue a certificate. </p><h2>  Forecasts </h2><p>  According to preliminary data, the state aid program will be valid until the end of 2016.  Its abolition will affect the demographic situation in the country.  A proposal to extend the program for another 9 years has already been submitted to the State Duma.  The funds allocated to the capital capital deal a severe blow to the territorial budgets.  Alternative fertility options are being considered.  Benefits were proposed for <span>improving housing conditions and</span> expanding the use of funds. </p>
