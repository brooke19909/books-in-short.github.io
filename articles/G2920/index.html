Also, methods for knitting the initial loop, air chain, and single crochet are described in detail here.  That is, even a very inept knitter will get a crocheted monkey.  The master class of work published here is an instruction, as they say, from A to Z. </p><h2>  Crochet Toy Rules </h2><p>  If the needlewoman decided to master this type of art, she must know and observe the important conditions that help to make a quality product. </p><ol><li>  The knitting should be fairly tight, otherwise the filler will come out through the gaps between the threads.  Therefore, in the main, a single crochet is used.  It is also important to choose a hook of the right size and a suitable yarn thickness. </li><li>  In order for the craftswoman to get a beautiful knitted monkey, they usually crochet the parts separately, which are then stuffed with filler and sewn into a common product. </li><li>  The main shape of the parts is ovoid, spherical or ellipsoidal.  Therefore, when we knit a monkey with a crochet, each part begins with the implementation of the so-called "cup".  Finish the part by reducing the number of columns (reducing the length of the rows) - this is the second important point in the work. </li></ol><p>  In fact, the monkey is crocheted quite easily.  The scheme and description of the implementation of each detail will help to cope with the work of even a novice craftswoman. </p>

    <h2>  The beginning of knitting - the first chain </h2><p>  So, the craftswoman made a decision: she will crochet the monkey!  Scheme and description of the process found, materials and tools purchased.  However, you still need to deal with all this, because the hook itself will not knit.  And the icons on the diagram do not know how to speak. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When we <span>crochet a monkey,</span> we read the pattern from the middle.  And there, the initial loop is marked with a red oval.  That is, in order to crochet a monkey, you should learn to perform this very first loop. </p><p>  To do this, put the working thread on the index finger of the left hand, pressing its free tip with a large one.  Then we introduce the working part of the tool from left to right and twist around ourselves so that we get a loop.  Now you should hold the place of twisting with the thumb of your left hand so that the loop does not tighten.  Having again introduced the tool under the thread from left to right, the master grabs them with yarn and drags it through the loop.  That is, they simply hook the thread on the hook, and the loop that was on it is removed.  So a new eyelet should appear on the working tool, which should be tightened to the required density. </p><h2>  Knitting a chain of air loops </h2><p>  People say: ‚ÄúDashing trouble is the beginning!‚Äù  And since the needlewoman coped with the first chain, therefore, she had already begun to create such an craft as a monkey with a crochet.  The diagram and description, most often looking like a drawing, show the craftswoman that you need to connect a chain of six air loops. </p><p>  Having mastered the first loop, the needlewoman will easily cope with the task.  Then she introduces a hook with a loop on it from left to right under the working thread, grabs it and pulls it.  With this action, that loop that was already on it slides, and a new loop, as it were, is pulled through its middle.  In the drawing, the air loop is usually depicted as an empty oval or circle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Even a novice craftswoman will surely be able to create such a craft as a crocheted monkey, a crochet pattern will help her understand this process. </p><h2>  Chain formation </h2><p>  The craftswoman will surely make a wonderful monkey crocheted, but in the event that she learns to read the diagrams.  You should also be able to correctly perform the actions encrypted in the drawings.  And then a wonderful crochet monkey will come out from the hands of the needlewoman.  The description of the reading of the circuit continues. </p><p>  So, we see that the chain in the diagram has the form of a ring.  In descriptions they usually write like this: "Connect the chain in a circle."  It is easy to do. </p><p>  After the chain of six loops is ready, the master enters the hook into the first loop, pulls the thread through it and the last loop of the chain. </p><p>  To go to the first row of knitting, you need to make one air loop.  This should be done every time a row ends and a transition to the next is required.  In our diagram, this lifting loop is represented by a lilac oval. </p><h2>  Single crochet </h2><p>  So that the filler does not crawl through the holes between the loops and rows, you need to crochet the monkey using crochet posts. </p><p>  The principle of knitting is based on the method described above for pulling a thread through the loop, which are on the hook.  Only grab the yarn follows by inserting the tool into the middle of the loop of the previous row.  This process is similar to how a chain is fastened into a ring.  However, the thread is pulled only through the column of the previous row, leaving the loop already on the hook unused. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Thus, the craftswoman formed two loops on the instrument at once.  And they should be knitted together, passing through them crocheted thread.  One loop should remain on the instrument. </p>

    <p>  Of course, in the course of work, you need to monitor the tension of the thread and the density of work, so that a beautiful crocheted knitted monkey turns out.  The scheme will tell you when to make additions in the work to get the ‚Äúcup‚Äù - the initial stage of knitting the head, trunk, lower limbs. </p><h2>  The addition of columns, or knitting "cup" </h2><p>  In the diagram proposed above, the icons show how to proceed if a crocheted monkey is required.  We have already considered the beginning of work - the first loop, a chain of air loops, fastening it into a ring.  And now we go to the first row of crochet the monkey.  The schemes proposed in this article have another icon similar to the English letter V. It means ‚Äúadding a column‚Äù, or knitting two single crochet columns from one loop. </p><p>  That is, in the same loop of the previous row, the hook is inserted twice.  The algorithm of the single crochet process remains the same. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that in the same way not only the beginning of the head of the toy fits.  The lower part of the monkey's limbs is crocheted as well.  The work schemes show their difference: it is that only the rows in these details are smaller.  Therefore, their depth, as well as the diameter, varies at the request of the master in the direction of reduction. </p><h2>  Toy head performance </h2><p>  In fact, all knitted toys are made according to the same algorithm.  First you should tie your head in the shape of a ball.  Therefore, they are suitable for the teddy bear and for the crochet monkey, the schemes laid out here. </p><p>  So, the ‚Äúcup‚Äù turned out to be of sufficient depth and the desired diameter.  According to our scheme, this takes five rows.  But the master, at his own request, can make the addition larger by knitting two columns out of those that were originally selected for this - in the second row. </p><p>  Now we should decide whether our knitted monkey (crochet) will have a spherical or ellipsoidal head.  The description of the work differs only in the number of rows knitted with single crochet without increase. </p><p>  For a spherical head, approximately seven such rows are performed.  If you make them larger, the part will have an elongated shape.  Moreover, the more such rows, the more elongated the head will be. </p>

    <p>  Then the next stage of work begins - decrease.  The diagram shows how the row length decreases.  That is, at certain points, you need to knit one loop not in two traditional columns, but in three.  Although there is an inverted English V on the diagram, but it just indicates that one column is "leaving." </p><p>  When the hole becomes not very large, fill it with filler.  Now the head, which will be ‚Äúthought‚Äù, is almost ready, there are bananas and our smart crochet monkey to build hilarious grimaces. </p><h2>  Description of body tethering </h2><p>  Some masters prefer to tighten the opening of the head completely.  This is done in such a way as to make a ball.  Then the body is tied separately and sewn to the head.  We will also consider the option of "tram" when the body begins to knit directly from the opening of the head.  Get a more practical crochet monkey toy. </p><p>  A master class with step-by-step photographs shows in detail the whole process. </p>

    <p>  By the way, the algorithm for torso knitting differs from the process of creating a head only in the number of rows made without adding (this was mentioned above). </p><h2>  Monkey face knitting pattern </h2><p>  Since these funny animals are distinguished by the fact that the lower part of their muzzle protrudes somewhat, another detail should be made - an oval plate in the shape of a ‚Äúcup‚Äù.  Only then will you get a real crochet monkey. </p>

    <p>  The description of this phase of work is as follows: </p><ol><li>  A chain of five air loops fits.  It does not need to be fastened in a ring! </li><li>  The first row is located on one side of the chain.  Three columns are tied from the last loop of the row. </li><li>  The second row is located on the other side of the chain.  Thus, knitting goes round.  Three columns are also tied from the last loop of the row. </li><li>  In subsequent rows, the addition is carried out according to the scheme - only along the edges of the part. </li></ol><p>  The muzzle is preferably made of lighter yarn.  Before sewing, you can draw or embroider a smiling mouth and nostrils on it. </p><h2>  Product assembly </h2><p>  Craftswomen perform a variety of crocheted crochet monkeys.  With the schemes for the manufacture of the head, torso, limbs, lining for the muzzle, we have already met.  The tail can be braided or knitted from several threads folded together with a large crochet air chain. </p><p>  The ears are knitted in the shape of round pancakes.  This is done in the same way as the ‚Äúcup‚Äù for the head, only the columns need to be added more often, then the part will turn out to be flat rather than convex. </p><p>  When ready-made parts are ready, the master stuffs them with filler.  Then follows the patch on the muzzle to sew to the front of the head, pre-laying under the bulge of a synthetic winterizer.  Eyes are made from buttons or bought ready-made in specialized stores. </p>
