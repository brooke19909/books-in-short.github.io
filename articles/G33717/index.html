Country holidays in the Leningrad region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Despite the grandeur and beauty of St. Petersburg, its residents at least sometimes want to relax outside the city, surrounded by nature, enjoying the summer sun and magnificent landscapes.  Fortunately, in the Leningrad Region there are a huge number of places for realizing this desire, and one of the most famous among them is the Pikhtovoye recreation center, located in the Vyborg district. </p><h2>  Rest in the Leningrad region </h2><p>  Of course, outside of St. Petersburg, you can enjoy a measured and calm pastime at any time of the year, however, the most attractive summer vacation is in the Leningrad Region.  This is primarily due to the fact that in the region there are many picturesque lakes and rivers, nearby which are all kinds of hotels and recreation centers.  But lakes are bathing on hot days, fishing, boating, and just enjoying the magnificent scenery. </p>
