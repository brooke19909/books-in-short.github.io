Types of tax deductions and how to get them</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tax deductions in Russia are very popular.  Their design raises many questions.  Despite this, the population is trying to exercise its right to a tax type deduction.  It helps to stay in the black while making some expenses.  In addition, if you wish, you can release the salary from personal income tax for a certain period.  Next, we study the maximum amount of tax deduction, as well as the features of obtaining thereof.  What should everyone remember about appropriate maintenance?  And what difficulties can a citizen face in the process of exercising his rights?  Answers to all these questions will help if you require deductions from tax authorities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realty.ria.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Return personal income tax in Russia" class="if uuid-3001482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3001482.jpg"></div><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  The maximum amount of tax deduction is important, but it is not fundamental information when requesting it.  The thing is that not everyone understands what he will deal with. </p><p>  A tax deduction is an opportunity to return part of the expenses incurred for certain transactions or the right not to pay personal income tax in one way or another.  In other words, it is customary to call the process of returning money for specific expenses at the expense of income taxes. </p><h2>  Types of Refunds </h2><p>  Tax deductions in the Tax Code are different.  There are a lot of them, each has its own characteristics and limitations on the amounts returned. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the moment, citizens may request the following deductions: </p><ul><li>  mortgage; </li><li>  main property; </li><li>  social (for treatment, training, insurance); </li><li>  professional; </li><li>  standard. </li></ul><p>  We will not focus on the last two.  Professional returns are usually relied upon by entrepreneurs.  Standard deductions are made out either for the presence of children, or for a certain status of a person.  They do not cause any special questions - each employer will be able to give advice on their request. </p><h2>  Total rate </h2><p>  The maximum amount of tax deduction may vary.  It varies depending on the specific situation. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to what tax rate is used in calculating the returned funds.  It makes 13% of the expenses incurred by the citizen.  This point must be remembered under any circumstances. </p><h2>  The main property return - limits </h2><p>  The maximum amount of tax deduction for property (acquisition of real estate without credit) at the moment depends on the value of the corresponding object.  13% should be calculated from the price - this will be the amount of return that a citizen can claim.  A similar principle applies to both mortgage and social deduction. </p><p>  Nevertheless, each of them has its own limiting values.  As soon as a certain level of refundable amounts is reached, the right to a tax type deduction is abolished. </p><p>  When buying real estate, you can return a maximum of 260,000 rubles.  That is 13 percent of 2,000,000. What if the property is more expensive? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Under such circumstances, a citizen will still be able to reimburse himself only 260,000 rubles.  If the property is cheaper, the rest of the deduction can be drawn up in the future.  For example, at the next purchase of real estate. </p><h2>  For a mortgage </h2><p>  It's hard to believe, but a housing loan also allows you to recover part of the costs.  The main thing is to follow a certain algorithm of actions for exercising one's authority.  We will talk about him later.  First, find out how much and when you can return. </p><p>  The tax deduction on a mortgage can be conditionally divided into two parts - the main refund and interest on the loan.  In the first case, the main property reimbursement of funds is made out.  So, it will be possible to request a maximum of 260,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spbguru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dedication tax rate" class="if uuid-3001481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3001481.jpg"></div><p>  But that is not all.  For interest paid on the loan, you can also demand a refund.  But in what sizes?  The tax deduction for the mortgage (its interest) is 390,000 rubles.  This is 13% of 3,000,000 rubles.  Above the specified limits, it will not work to claim under any circumstances. </p><h2>  Social return </h2><p>  Special attention should be paid to social deductions.  The thing is that they are divided into several components.  And the maximum amount of social type deductions will be total. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Over a lifetime, every citizen can regain only 120,000 rubles for the corresponding expenses.  That is, for insurance, treatment and training in total.  But this is far from all that a citizen should know.  Next, we consider each type of social return in more detail. </p><h2>  For study </h2><p>  The maximum tax deduction for tuition in Russia is 120,000 rubles.  And this is provided that no other social returns will be issued. </p><p>  In the Russian Federation, you can return money for your studies, training for children, brothers and sisters.  In each case, it is necessary to focus on different restrictions on the amounts. </p><p>  For example, a person can return 13% of the expenses incurred for himself, but no more than the remaining limit for all social deductions.  In total, up to 120,000. </p><p>  For other people's educational services it is allowed, as in the previous case, a total of one hundred twenty thousand rubles to be returned.  Moreover, for one child, brother or sister for the entire period of study can not be reimbursed more than 50 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Refund for educational services - amounts per year </h2><p>  What else is worth paying attention to?  The thing is that despite the limits set above, educational services provide for special conditions for the return of money.  Some people wonder how much a year can be returned for the study of a brother, child or sister. </p><p>  Based on the foregoing, a simple conclusion can be made - no more than 15,600 rubles.  This amount is 13 percent of 120 thousand rubles.  Accordingly, the entire limit of funds set for someone else‚Äôs training can be spent in about 3 years.  In practice, such an operation often takes more time. </p><h2>  Medical services </h2><p>  The maximum amount of tax deduction for treatment can cause many questions.  But why? </p><p>  The thing is that medical services are divided into conventional and expensive.  In the first case, you can return 13 percent of the costs incurred, but not more than 120,000 rubles.  Otherwise, the service will be denied. </p><p>  In this case, you will have to take into account all the <span>social deductions</span> that the person requested.  It so happens that, for example, the applicant has already used up the established limits for educational services and insurance.  And after that I tried to file a request for a refund for the treatment.  He will be legally rejected. </p><h2>  Expensive treatment </h2><p>  Some medical services are considered expensive treatments.  The Tax Code of the Russian Federation indicates all services that can be attributed to such.  For example, a paid caesarean section. </p><p>  The maximum amount of tax deduction for medical services recognized as expensive has not been established.  The thing is that a citizen can demand from the state 13% of the funds paid. </p><p>  Important: costly treatment is refunded without reducing social deduction.  So, you can return 13 percent of the "expensive medicine" and another 120 thousand for other medical services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.banki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dedication calculator" class="if uuid-3001476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3001476.jpg"></div><h2>  Medical service limits per year </h2><p>  Need a tax deduction for prosthetics?  The maximum amount returned to the citizen is known.  But do not rush - you will have to remember the annual limit. </p><p>  For a year, a person can generally recover 15,600 rubles as a social return.  And not only for educational services.  For insurance and treatment, a similar limit also applies. </p><p>  The exception is only expensive treatment.  It, as already mentioned, will not be connected with social deduction.  Compensation for such services is allowed exactly 13 percent of the amounts specified in the contracts. </p><h2>  PIT dependency </h2><p>  The maximum amount of tax deduction, as already mentioned, depends on many circumstances.  Despite the limits already studied, you need to pay attention to another very important point.  He is able to deliver a lot of trouble and bring a lot of disappointment. </p><p>  By law, a citizen cannot demand more money than he transferred in the form of income tax for a given tax period.  Accordingly, it is far from always that citizens quickly spend the limits established by the amounts. </p><h2>  Conditions for registration </h2><p>  With the limits sorted out.  Now it‚Äôs worth figuring out how to file a tax refund.  This is a rather difficult and long process, forcing citizens to prepare in advance. </p><p>  Not everyone can apply for a tax refund.  It is put only to those who: </p><ul><li>  has an official place of employment; </li><li>  transfers to the state treasury personal income tax in the amount of 13 percent; </li><li>  possesses citizenship of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  has a permanent residence permit in a particular region; </li><li>  made a deal on his own behalf and at his own expense. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, the unemployed, housewives, pensioners and foreigners cannot apply for income tax refunds.  There are exceptions too.  And everyone should remember about them. </p><h2>  For unemployed and senior citizens </h2><p>  The maximum amount of tax deduction for tuition, treatment and other expenses from now on will not cause any problems.  Everyone will be able to understand how much and under what conditions he can demand from the state. </p><p>  Strange as it may seem, pensioners and the unemployed can exercise their right to a tax deduction.  They are allowed to carry out personal income tax transfer for the last three years.  What does it mean? </p><p>  When making a refund, the tax authorities will take into account the income tax transferred by the person for the previous 36 months.  This means that without formal employment, the right to reimbursement of expenses incurred is canceled only after 3 years.  It resumes after a person for three years will not list personal income tax. </p><h2>  For foreigners </h2><p>  Foreign citizens in Russia cannot apply for a tax deduction.  Nevertheless, one can cope with this task if one obtains citizenship of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  In this case, the person will be considered as a "local" resident.  All the above conditions and restrictions will apply to it.  The main thing is to have citizenship of the Russian Federation and income taxed by personal income tax in the amount of 13 percent. </p><h2>  Entrepreneurs and returns </h2><p>  With the amount of tax deduction when buying an apartment sorted out.  As has already been emphasized, a person will be able to reimburse himself no more than 260 thousand rubles.  But what about entrepreneurs? </p><p>  In general, they are entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred.  The main thing is to work on OSNO.  It is this tax regime that provides for personal income tax in the amount of 13%.  When using special modes, an IP deduction cannot be issued.  This is simply not provided for by the current legislation of the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ideiforbiz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much will be returned when buying a home" class="if uuid-3001477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3001477.jpg"></div><h2>  Third-party investments and personal income tax returns </h2><p>  The amount of tax deduction when buying an apartment is registered in the Tax Code of the Russian Federation.  But some situations in life confuse citizens.  The thing is that sometimes people use state aid when purchasing real estate.  For example, maternal capital.  How much money can be returned in such circumstances? </p><p>  All the previously mentioned restrictions and limits will apply.  The principle of calculating the tax base will simply change.  If someone uses state assistance in acquiring real estate, the base from which 13 percent of the deduction is calculated will be reduced by the amount of third-party investments. </p><h2>  When to apply? </h2><p>  Some are interested at what point the right to receive <span>personal income tax returns</span> arises <span>.</span>  Usually the year after the transaction.  If it comes to paying interest on a mortgage - from the moment of the first payments. </p><p>  When can I apply for a tax deduction?  At any time, but no later than 3 years from the date of the transaction.  That is how much the statute of limitations for tax returns in Russia is. </p><p>  Moreover, a person can demand money immediately for 36 months.  Very convenient, especially with a mortgage and educational return.  The main thing is to know how to act in a particular case.  Preparing for deductions is a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, they can either be completely avoided or minimized. </p><h2>  Service locations </h2><p>  Where exactly should I apply <span>for a tax deduction</span> in Russia?  You can cope with this task in different bodies.  The thing is that citizens are able to request returns through: </p><ul><li>  tax authorities; </li><li>  multifunctional centers; </li><li>  My Documents. </li></ul><p>  What tax get tax deduction?  It is necessary to apply to the Federal Tax Service at the place of registration.  For example, in person or by mail.  The main thing is to remember that in another region, income tax refunds are not processed. </p><p>  Important: if you wish, you can apply for a deduction from the employer.  In this case, the citizen‚Äôs earnings will be exempt from income tax for the amount of the return. </p><h2>  Design Instructions </h2><p>  And how to claim tax deductions?  Citizens must adhere to a certain algorithm of action.  With proper preparation, it does not cause any significant problems. </p><p>  To make a personal income tax refund, a person needs: </p><ol><li>  Make a deal on your own behalf and for your money. </li><li>  Form a specific package of papers.  This point will be considered in more detail later. </li><li>  Submit a deduction request. </li><li>  Get a response from an authorized body. </li></ol><p>  If everything is done correctly, then after some time the applicant will be reimbursed cash for certain expenses.  The main difficulties for citizens arise in the formation of a package of documents for the implementation of the task. </p><h2>  Main papers </h2><p>  What documents are needed for tax deduction?  The answer depends on the specific situation. </p><p>  Without fail, the following components are useful to the applicant: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  tax return for a given period; </li><li>  income statements; </li><li>  checks indicating certain expenses; </li><li>  statement of the established form; </li><li>  agreement on the conclusion of a transaction or the provision of services. </li></ul><p>  But that is not all.  Next, we consider the additional statements required by a person when making deductions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ideiforbiz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortgage Deduction - Size" class="if uuid-3001479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3001479.jpg"></div><h2>  Inquiries for property returns </h2><p>  What documents are needed for the tax deduction for an apartment or a mortgage?  Usually the above list needs to be supplemented: </p><ul><li>  mortgage or sale contract; </li><li>  loan repayment schedule; </li><li>  receipts for the transfer of money for the main transaction; </li><li>  USRN statements for real estate. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, this will be enough.  All extracts indicated should be presented only in the originals.  Their copies are not considered by authorized services. </p><h2>  Inquiries when applying for a deduction for treatment </h2><p>  Need to receive money in the form of personal income tax refund for medical services?  It is not as difficult as it seems. </p><p>  In order to avoid problems and questions from the authorized bodies, the applicant must carry out the preparation of: </p><ul><li>  licenses of a medical institution and a doctor; </li><li>  medical service contracts; </li><li>  checks and receipts; </li><li>  prescriptions (if a person reimburses funds for medicines). </li></ul><p>  As a rule, modern clinics help prepare documents for tax deduction.  Therefore, there should not be any significant problems. </p><h2>  Documents for deduction for studies </h2><p>  Help for a tax deduction in the Russian Federation can come in handy different.  We have to always start from a specific situation. </p><p>  Would you like to return the income tax for educational services?  In this case, you will need: </p><ul><li>  student certificate; </li><li>  extracts from the educational institution that the person is really studying in it; </li><li>  Organization license </li><li>  accreditation of a student's chosen specialty; </li><li>  contract for the provision of paid educational services. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, all of these extracts can be taken at an educational institution.  The contract for the provision of services must be kept in the hands of the applicant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="finance.rambler.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to return personal income tax for transactions" class="if uuid-3001480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3001480.jpg"></div><h2>  For family people </h2><p>  As already mentioned, a tax refund can be issued not only for yourself, but also for relatives.  In addition, when it comes to acquiring property, a family person will have to form a special certificate package. </p><p>  Does the recipient of the deduction have a family, or does he draw up a personal income tax return for a child, brother or sister?  Then you need to take with you to the authorized bodies: </p><ul><li>  certificate of marriage or divorce; </li><li>  certificates of birth or adoption of children; </li><li>  statements confirming kinship with a brother or sister. </li></ul><p>  If the spouses have a marriage contract, it will not be superfluous either.  The thing is that when acquiring property in a marriage, it is recognized as common with the husband / wife.  And the second half of the applicant has the right to its design.  The presence of a marriage agreement will exclude unnecessary problems and questions from employees of the Federal Tax Service. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what is the maximum amount of tax deduction in a given case.  And how to demand the appropriate funds is also clear. </p><p>  What is the average time to wait for money?  About 4-6 months.  Of these, only 1.5-2 will be considered an application for a deduction.  And the same amount will be spent on carrying out a banking operation for crediting money to the account indicated in the application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.farpost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax deductions" class="if uuid-3001478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3001478.jpg"></div><p>  You can quickly apply for a deduction through the employer - exemption from personal income tax will occur from next month.  That is, from the first salary deduction right received after exercise.  But this option is not in demand among the population. </p>
