Therefore, many consumers face a serious dilemma: which phone is better - “iPhone” or “Samsung”?  Models from the South Korean manufacturer have always been distinguished not only by a high-quality "filling", but also by a pleasant design, as well as an abundance of some "chips", and the venerable Apple continues to stamp reliable classics. </p>

    <p>  In general, the question of which phone is better - “iPhone” or “Samsung” is not entirely correct.  The first is characterized by rigor, consistent quality and painfully familiar (and to someone already rather boring) design.  The second one has significantly greater functionality thanks to the flexible Android platform, it has a variety of stylistic solutions and a flexible "filling" that allows for a competent pricing policy. </p><p>  If you look at the bare sales statistics, we will see that in the middle price segment, the South Korean manufacturer is clearly the leader, not to mention the budget one.  There are other dilemmas in the latter sphere (for example, which phone is better - Samsung or Sony Xperia?), And the question about iPhones is not at all.  The premium segment was almost completely captured by the “apple” devices with their impeccable quality and no less impeccable advertising campaigns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We’ll try to figure out why consumers so value the models of the South Korean brand, and determine which Samsung phone is better than the other and why.  We will start with the most “delicious” and expensive, gradually moving to the middle and budget price segment. </p><h2>  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S7 Edge </h2><p>  The flagship S7 model can be called the best phone from Samsung.  The series was distinguished by attractive streamlining of gadgets and a universal screen diagonal of 5.5 inches.  The device turned out to be thin and light. </p>

    <p>  Many users in their reviews ambiguously perceived such a "thinness."  On the one hand, yes, the device looks interesting and stylish, but on the other hand, holding it in your hands is not very comfortable.  The phalanges of the fingers simply have nowhere to put up free space, and not everyone likes to hold it like a piece of paper. </p><p>  As befits the <span>best phones</span> from Samsung, the flagship is well protected from water, dust and other dirt according to the IP68 standard.  It should also be noted that the water resistance class is supported without any plugs. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  Unlike its predecessor, the sixth generation, the S7 provides enhanced work with external media of any size, and also has support for two SIM cards.  The only thing worth clarifying is that separate slots for installation, alas, are not provided.  Despite the success of the previous generation of S6 devices, the company did not take into account all user reviews.  A good Samsung phone should not put its owner in a dilemma: buy a gadget immediately with a large amount of storage or limit yourself in choosing telecom operators.  Unfortunately, this problem remains in the new device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  one of the best matrices in its segment <span>(better than an iPhone)</span> ; </li><li>  nice and stylish appearance; </li><li>  extensive functionality and features for customization; </li><li>  good protection against moisture and dust according to the IP68 standard; </li><li>  Support for all modern networks, including LTE Cat.9. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  combined slots for CD drives and a second SIM card; </li><li>  non-removable battery; </li><li>  the price is too high for the domestic market. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 40,000 rubles. </p><h2>  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Note 5 Duos </h2><p>  The Note line has always been distinguished by advanced features, where the main trump cards were a large screen diagonal and stylus support.  This gadget can be called the best Samsung Galaxy phone in this series.  In the fifth model, the electronic pen scheme and interaction with the screen were slightly reworked, and users, judging by their reviews, had a great liking for the new solution. </p>

    <p>  For example, as soon as you take out the stylus from a regular place, the application for notes automatically opens, and there is no need to enter passwords, keys or somehow unlock the screen.  Despite its popularity and recognition, the model has its own, for some, by the way, critical shortcomings.  Many users still do not understand the company's decision to deprive their "tabletphone" of the ability to use external memory cards.  Well, at least the device received support for alternate work with SIM cards, and so it would suffer the fate of the infamous seventh version of Note. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  improved work with electronic pen; </li><li>  nice looking design; </li><li>  support for all modern communication protocols; </li><li>  two SIM cards with alternate operation mode; </li><li>  quick cold start of the GPS module. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  there is no support for external SD cards; </li><li>  non-separable type case; </li><li>  no third-generation USB interface support. </li></ul><p>  Estimated price - about 23,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy A5 (SM-A520F) </h2><p>  It’s worth mentioning right away that there are a lot of modifications of the A5 series, and a good half of brand admirers are asking quite a logical question: which Samsung A5 phone is better?  On sale you can find models of 2016 with the identifier SM-A510F and 2017 - SM-A520F.  The difference in price between these two generations ranges from 3,000 rubles, but the modern model has a more powerful “stuffing” and is more technical savvy. </p>

    <p>  The SM-A520F received support for 802.11ac protocol, a 16-megapixel front camera (instead of the 5 megapixel of the previous generation) and IP68 case protection, so for many the choice is more than obvious.  Also, the internal memory was added to the new device and the assortment of “girlish” colors in pink and light blue styles was diversified. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the device </h2><p>  The model can be called with full confidence a very good phone from Samsung.  The gadget, in addition to all the above advantages, received a separate slot for a memory card and a speaker on the side.  The latter solution is rather unusual, but the sound, according to user reviews, is much less often drowned out by the fingers and palm. </p><p>  We should also mention such an interesting and useful innovation as Always On Display.  It allows you to display information on current events, such as time, date, received messages and missed calls, on the "sleeping" screen. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  stylish and nice looking design; </li><li>  powerful set of chipsets; </li><li>  16MP front camera </li><li>  the presence of the useful function Always On Display; </li><li>  protection against moisture and dirt according to class IP68. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  non-removable battery; </li><li>  biting price tag in comparison with other models of the A5 series. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 22,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy C5 </h2><p>  About a year ago, the company expanded the range of its gadgets and introduced to the market devices in thin metal cases.  It turned out quite nice and good Samsung phones of the C5 series, and the constructive component is far from the only advantage of this line. </p>

    <p>  Naturally, the “stuffing” is far from the level of flagship models, but for everyday needs it is more than enough.  Especially users were pleased with the amount of RAM.  Nearly 4 GB of RAM allow you to safely work with a lot of tabs in the browser and run “heavy” applications without lags and freezes.  Any toys run without problems, but on especially demanding ones you will have to reset the graphics settings to the average value. </p><h2>  Gadget features </h2><p>  We add here the Super AMOLED class matrix, which copes with Full HD-scans perfectly, an adequate fingerprint sensor, NFC support - and we get an almost perfect option for our money.  Moreover, user reviews about the device are completely positive, but the owners did not find any critical flaws. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  perfect balance of price and quality; </li><li>  one-piece metal alloy housing; </li><li>  good cameras; </li><li>  excellent matrix, giving out a juicy and truthful picture; </li><li>  good viewing angles; </li><li>  Attractive appearance and overall style. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  the manufacturer does not guarantee flawless operation on popular domestic LTE protocols; </li><li>  Does not support the modern Wi-Fi standard according to the 802.11ac specification; </li><li>  inconvenient combined interface for the second SIM card and external drive. </li></ul><p>  Estimated price - about 16,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy J7 (SM-J710F) </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the company refers to the budget segment as a very attractive and in many ways good Samsung phone of the J7 series, it is able to give odds to many models of the average price level.  The first thing worth mentioning is the excellent battery life. </p>

    <p>  Despite the voracious Android platform, the device manages to overtake even the simple and outdated Symbian gadgets by this indicator.  To the old "Nokia", which worked for months, he, of course, far, but among other gadgets, the J7 series is clearly the leader in the field of battery life. </p><p>  Judging by user reviews, the mediocre matrix acts as an obvious fly in the ointment, which hardly even extends HD-resolution, not to mention the claimed Full HD.  Although not completely, but Super AMOLED technology compensates for this drawback, there will be no problems with color depth and reading data in the sun. </p><h2>  Smartphone Features </h2><p>  Another sign indicating that the device belongs to the budget segment is the lack of a light sensor, which means that the brightness will have to be adjusted manually and often.  Despite its low price, the manufacturer did not stint on equipping the gadget with sensible cameras, and the company's marketers even position the device as a “selfie phone” in their praises. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  A good matrix for a budget smartphone, which allows you to safely work in the sun; </li><li>  A good set of chipsets, eliminating the brakes and sagging interface; </li><li>  excellent indicator of battery life; </li><li>  high-quality front and rear cameras; </li><li>  Separate interface for SIM cards and external media; </li><li>  removable battery. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  there is no light sensor; </li><li>  no indicator of events; </li><li>  touch buttons are devoid of backlight. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 14,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy J1 (SM-J120F / DS) </h2><p>  The J1 model is a frankly budget, but nonetheless a good phone from Samsung.  One of the obvious advantages of this device is the matrix, which works in tandem with AMOLED technology, so bright sunlight will not interfere with the screen. </p>

    <p>  The low cost of the smartphone made itself felt: mediocre color rendition with a clearly oversaturated gamut, a simple set of chipsets and the same cameras.  You won’t be able to launch serious programs on the device, and fans of playing modern toys will have to reset the graphics settings to a minimum, provided that they even work at least somehow. </p><h2>  Features of the device </h2><p>  This model will be useful to undemanding users, that is, those who have enough music, films and the Internet, without a "heavy" surroundings.  The advantages of the gadget can be written not only more than a democratic price tag, but also an attractive battery life (in fact, there is nothing and no one to work with there). </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  excellent readability of data even in direct sunlight; </li><li>  Separate interfaces for a SIM card and an external drive; </li><li>  supports all domestic LTE protocols; </li><li>  removable battery; </li><li>  good battery life; </li><li>  more than a democratic price tag for a model from a venerable brand. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  mediocre matrices in both cameras; </li><li>  distorted color rendering; </li><li>  There is no light sensor. </li></ul><p>  Estimated price - less than 7000 rubles. </p>
