The fact is that most of the devices work on customized firmware with reference to the provider.  Because of this, the device is not able to function with cards of other operators.  Examples of such modems include products from ZTE, Huawei, MTS and Kyivstar. </p><p>  In order to unlock the modem, you must use a special method.  There are both paid options and free ones.  An example of the first method is the <em>DC-UNLOCKER program</em> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="modem unlock" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1866251.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Unlock Programs </h2><p>  This program is quite unique in its own way.  No wires are needed for its operation.  It is capable of unlocking all phones and modems directly from the computer‚Äôs dialog box.  The software is updated regularly, a huge number of new device models are constantly being added. </p><p>  In order to unlock the modem, you need to purchase 7 credits (they cost about $ 10).  Next, the buyer will receive a username and password, which should be entered in the "Server" section.  By pressing the "Unlock" button, you can unlock any modem. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If there are funds, then you can purchase the program itself.  It will allow you to earn money on unlocking a modem.  Such a solution will allow you to receive updates completely free, but the cost may seem too high. </p><p>  There are hacked versions on the Internet, so in order to save money, they will work best.  But you need to trust the source from which the download occurs.  Quite often, the so-called killer spreads instead of this program.  After using this program, the modem stops working. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unlock modem zte" class="if" height="491" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1866252.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  DC-UNLOCKER </h2><p>  Not always free methods can help, but still several working options are available.  If they do not work specifically on any modems, then even then you should seek help from either a specialist or the <em>DC-UNLOCKER program.</em>  Problems may arise with Kyivstar and MTS devices.  Unlocking the modem and any flashing is prohibited due to the factory lock.  How to understand that the device belongs to just such?  If IMEI starts at 359, then you need to be wary already - most likely, it will be quite difficult to unlock the modem.  In any case, you can try. </p><p>  The cheapest and easiest options are easiest to ‚Äúfree‚Äù from binding.  They usually require the usual unlock code when connecting someone else's SIM card.  It can be either purchased or calculated using online methods.  Calculators and similar programs are freely available on the Web, so unlocking such a modem does not require much effort and time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei modem unlock" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1866253.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Unlock ZTE MF180 (Beeline) </h2><p>  When connecting the modem to the computer, it is necessary to install software called ‚ÄúBeeline USB-modem‚Äù.  Unlocking can be done through it, or through some other unofficial utilities, for example, MTS Connect Manager.  For the successful completion of the process, the PCUI.VN file is required, which will allow to avoid incompatibility of versions of preinstalled software, firmware (described above), QPST package.  All this can be easily and in a second found on the Internet. </p><p>  To unlock the ZTE modem, it is best to use a laptop with a Windows operating system.  You must first install the QPST application.  Next - get all the files from the desired firmware.  The modem should be connected to the laptop and install the standard program from the operator.  Be sure to go to the device manager and check whether all the drivers and virtual utilities are installed for this particular device.  Next, you need to remember which <span>COM port is</span> connected to the modem, this is useful when working with QPST.  We launch the last program, enter the connector into it, to which the virtual interface is connected.  Next, create a new port.  It synchronizes with the COM connector.  Next, through the "Accessories" in the "Start" menu, you need to start EFS Explorer.  Then, confirm the selected port, and the program will open the modem files.  There must be a PCUI.VN file in the device‚Äôs memory.  If it is absent, then it should be added.  Then you need to drag it into the program window. </p><p>  Work with EFS Explorer is over.  Now you need to run the firmware from MTS.  It is factory, does not need additional installation.  If you have problems at startup, you can try to open it as an ‚Äúadministrator‚Äù. </p><p>  Immediately after this, the device will be flashed.  The maximum time required for this is 20 minutes.  You should not interrupt the download - there is a 90% chance that the modem will not turn on after that. </p><p>  After the flashing is successful, you need to remove the software from Beeline from the computer.  Now you can use the services of any operator without any restrictions.  If you connect the modem again to the computer, "MTS Manager" is installed. </p><p>  Also, do not forget that you need to configure network profiles.  It is especially important to register the operator‚Äôs APN.  If the network is available without preliminary settings, then the last parameter is unimportant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="program for unlocking the modem" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1866255.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Unlock modem for all operators </h2><p>  Using the <span>HUAWEI E173</span> as an example, <span>we</span> can explain how the unlock occurs immediately for all possible operators. </p><p>  You need to find the firmware that is most suitable for the needs of the user.  Ideally, on the Internet you can easily find a manager that allows you to use the Internet, send and receive SMS, MMS, voice and video calls.  Below we will consider detailed instructions on how to <span>unlock the Huawei modem.</span>  Before starting the process, it is necessary to establish a factory manager, otherwise an error will occur during a flashing.  The fact is that it installs drivers in the system that allow you to contact the modem and perform all the necessary manipulations.  Next, you need to reflash the manager itself to the one you need.  After this is done, it is necessary to check whether the modem works with other operators.  If not, follow the instructions below.  There are two solutions to the problem.  Consider them below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unlock modem for all operators" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1866256.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Option number 1 </h2><p>  You need to download the connection manager, which initially changes the operator‚Äôs settings.  After proper installation, when you change the card, a window will pop up asking you to enter the unlock code.  This can be "cured" with a program that generates code according to IMEI.  There are many working options on the Internet, both paid and free. </p><h2>  Option number 2 </h2><p>  First you need to check if the router is unlocked.  This can be done both by using an extraneous card from another operator, or by special programs.  Further, thanks to Huawei Modem Unlocker, you need to create a special code such as NSK.  It is needed specifically for unlocking.  After entering it, you can freely work with any operator. </p>
