    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The address officially sounds like this: Ukraine, Zaporizhzhya region, Akimovsky district, Kirillovka, Stepok, Coral Island.  The base is located on Fedotova Spit, which crashes into the sea, on the street of the same name.  The postal number of this institution is 231, and the postcode is 72563. At first glance, everything may seem complicated, but in reality it‚Äôs easy to find a base.  Two braids extend from Kirillovka.  One to the left (when facing the sea), this is Peresyp.  Another to the right.  This is Fedotova.  It is a rather narrow sandy natural formation, crashing into the sea for about 45 km.  The ‚ÄúCoral Island‚Äù (Kirillovka) from the beginning of the spit is quite far, almost at the very end of a long series of other bases, tightly pressed against each other.  Landmarks - fisheries and the Meliorator base.  On the one hand, such a distant location is not quite convenient, because if necessary, you will need to go to the village for 20 minutes or more, depending on the capabilities of the vehicle.  But here on the coast you can find really quiet nooks that vacationers from other bases can only dream of. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The main thing is to know where Kirillovka is located.  "Coral Island" is no longer difficult to find.  Residents of the nearest cities (Zaporozhye, Dnepropetrovsk, Nikopol, Melitopol, Kharkov, Kherson) can reach the village by regular buses or special minibuses, which work on request during the season and can be taken to any base at the request of passengers.  For Russians and Ukrainians living far from this region, the most optimal and convenient option is to get to Zaporozhye by train or plane, or even better, to Melitopol.  From it to Kirillovka about 60 km or an hour's drive.  Minibuses depart as passengers fill directly from the railway  station.  Even closer, only 40 km, is Kirillovka from the Akimovka station, but not all trains stop at it. </p><p>  By car you need to follow the Simferopolskaya highway.  At the fork (Akimovsky turn, the landmark is a silver monument to a deer), turn onto the T0820 highway, to the left in the direction of travel.  At the end of the route will be the Utlyuk estuary and Kirillovka.  Coral Island can provide its guests with its own small transfer, but this is only by prior arrangement.  There is no such service specifically. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  Summer in the south of Ukraine is hot.  <span>Fedotova spit, the</span> main soil of which is sand, cannot boast of special natural beauties.  But the recreation center "Coral Island" (Kirillovka) through the efforts of employees appears to its guests a cozy green oasis with flower beds, colorful flowers, comfortable gazebos and swings, neat paths along which various trees are planted.  There is even a pretty alpine hill with a small fountain here. </p><p>  Among this natural and man-made beauty are a children's playground, cafe, bar, parking lot, sports ground, administrative building, 4 specially equipped glades with barbecue facilities.  There is no pool at the base, because the sea is nearby.  Given that this is the age of the Internet, Coral Island (Kirillovka) on its territory provides Wi-Fi, which can be used both in rooms and in any corner of the base.  The cost of this pleasure is 20 hryvnias. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Conveniently enough for everyone, the issue of food on the basis of Coral Island in Kirilovka has been resolved.  The reviews of those who had rest there before, indicate unattractive and small in volume dishes, unscrupulous catering staff.  In 2015, everything changed.  Now the guests are satisfied with the quality of the dishes and the service.  On the base you can buy tours with or without food, depending on who you like.  Anyone who wants to can choose for themselves some coastal cafe and eat there.  Another option is to cook yourself in the shared kitchen available on the territory.  Who does not want unnecessary trouble, eats at the cafe base.  They cook here like at home.  Breakfasts, lunches and dinners are organized according to the example of foreign hotels - the "buffet".  The only drawback is that the cafe is open only until 7 pm.  Who does not have time, feeds himself.  Sometimes you can hear complaints about the menu.  Here it must be taken into account that on average the amount of food per day per person is about 90 hryvnias.  This is probably why there are no special delicacies in the menu. </p>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Just a couple of minutes from the seashore is the recreation center "Coral Island" (Kirillovka).  Reviews of beach vacations, however, are mixed.  The fact is that nearby is a fishing farm.  Like many enterprises, it has its own nuances, for example, long-haul barges repaired on the shore, sometimes dead bulls floating in the water.  And although this is not directly related to the beach of the base, some tourists are annoyed by such a neighborhood.  This problem is easy to solve.  The fact is that B.O.  ‚ÄúCoral Island‚Äù (Kirillovka) closes a number of bases and tourist complexes of Fedotova Spit, adjacent to the famous Biryuchy Island.  In fact, this is the same braid, only much wider.  After literally 150 meters along the coast, you can get to a completely deserted and pristine clean beach, where there is no noise, nor any smells other than sea.  The beach near the base, many vacationers also like.  Its main advantage is cleanliness.  They clean and rake the sand here every morning.  There are canopies from the sun on the beach, there are also sun loungers, but they are paid.  The Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov is famous for its warm water and depth at a great distance from the coast.  All this is a big plus for vacationers with small children.  Water in the summer in shallow water can warm up to +28 degrees, and at a depth of up to +25.  Rain during the holiday season is very rare, there is almost no wind.  So the resort for a beach holiday is perfect. </p><h2>  Leisure on site </h2><p>  Base "Coral Island" (Kirillovka) can offer its guests a sports ground, cozy pavilions where you can relax from the sun, read, sit on the Internet.  There are also large comfortable swings for children and adults.  Barbecue lovers are provided with free barbecue facilities in specially equipped places.  Children enjoy having fun on the playground.  In addition, entertainment programs are organized for young tourists every day, organized by specialists from the Coral Island Base (Kirillovka).  Reviews of children's animation are not very enthusiastic.  People note that the programs are repeated day by day, and the animators work without any apparent interest in captivating the children. </p><p>  For lovers of fishing, the location of the base is ideal.  Gobies here can be caught not only from the boat, but also from the shore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Coral island in Kirilovka" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/867327.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure outside the base </h2><p>  With its entertainment complexes, the Treasure Island water park, the dolphinarium, a large amusement park, numerous cafes, restaurants, and a good market, tourists can please Kirillovka.  ‚ÄúCoral Island‚Äù, as noted above, is not very close to the village, so not all guests of the base will be comfortable traveling there.  On Fedotova Spit, about halfway from Coral Island to Kirillovka, there is another water park with a wonderful playground for children.  There is also a clothing market, where you can buy forgotten beach accessories at home and much more.  On another spit - Peresyp - there is a children's zoo, where you can also visit.  But it‚Äôs even better to get excursions to the <span>Biryuchy island,</span> where they simply do not let anyone in.  There is a national nature park called Azov-Sivashsky.  Visitors, of course, will be pleased with deer, raccoons, foxes, fallow deer and other animals who freely walk around the park.  In total, about 250 species are registered there.  Also on Biryuchim a very beautiful nature.  In addition to the salt marshes typical of the Azov Sea with feather grass and grass drying in summer, glades of flowers and trees rustling with foliage are pleasing to the eye.  There are approximately 300 species of plants in the reserve, among which there are very rare.  In Kirillovka, you can buy tours to the Askania Novu Nature Reserve, to the Stone Grave. </p><p>  In addition to beach recreation and entertainment, vacationers on the basis of ‚ÄúCoral Island‚Äù get the opportunity to improve their health by using the healing mud of the Ulyuk estuary or Molochny located near Peresyp.  Muds are useful for diseases of the bones, joints, nervous system, gynecological problems.  You can use them for free, making applications.  Many vacationers bring "magic" mud home, picking it up in bottles. </p>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Tourists like the hospitable, slightly provincial Kirillovka.  ‚ÄúCoral Island‚Äù is one of those recreation centers where you can spend your long-awaited vacation or regular weekend without problems, without spending a lot of money.  There are no fixed prices here, they vary depending on the type of room and time of stay.  The highest from June 12 to August 31.  In this period, they vary from 360 hryvnias per day for ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù for two, to 1000 hryvnias per day for apartments.  "Turkey" is at this time 650 gr. / Day.  In May and September, prices are almost 2 times lower.  Before booking a room, the price must be clarified, since it, among other things, will depend on the type of food (full board, only breakfast, breakfast and lunch, nothing at all).  On the basis of the system there is a "coupon", suggesting certain benefits and convenience when eating.  But vacationers ‚Äúcoupons‚Äù are not in special demand. </p><p>  Payment on the basis of cash only.  Reservations can be made by calling 0038 097 32 40 505 during business hours from 9 am to 6 pm or online round the clock. </p><p>  Children are admitted to the Coral Island recreation center from any age, and animals are not allowed. </p><p>  The time of arrival and departure in most cases is strictly fixed.

But sometimes, under unforeseen circumstances, the administration will meet you and may extend the time spent in the room. </p><h2>  The recreation center "Coral Island" in Kirilovka: reviews </h2><p>  The work of any enterprise depends, first of all, on the professionalism and conscientiousness of its employees.  The same applies to Coral Island.  On the Internet you can find many negative reviews about this base of those who have been here in past years.  For the 2015th year, reviews are at least positive, but there are a lot of enthusiastic ones.  People who came here for a week, regret that they have to leave, and are certainly going to return again.  Among the advantages they note: </p><p>  - attentive, helpful, professional staff; </p><p>  - cleanliness in the rooms and on the territory; </p><p>  - Tasty food; </p><p>  - proximity to the sea; </p><p>  - inexpensive services; </p><p>  - lack of mosquitoes and other insects interfering with a quiet rest; </p><p>  - unobtrusive and tireless rules of residence at the base. </p><p>  The administration of the base and all its employees made a lot of efforts to make Coral Island one of the best vacation spots in Kirillovka.  Still, there are still flaws.  Tourists note the following: </p><p>  - poor soundproofing in the rooms; </p><p>  - Too small refrigerators; </p><p>  - noisy air conditioners; </p><p>  - European-style repair almost did not touch the rooms of the Standard category; </p><p>  - in the shower is not fresh, but sea water (purified); </p><p>  - proximity to the fishing base; </p><p>  - noise from a cafe located on the shore (not the property of Coral Island); </p><p>  - a small number of barbecues (sometimes they are not enough for all kebab lovers, you have to take a queue); </p><p>  - uninteresting children's animation; </p><p>  - Not quite a good location for the playground. </p><p>  Conclusion: the recreation center "Coral Island" is great for beach holidays for children and adults who like to relax with mood.  Here you can have a wonderful vacation without spending unnecessarily large amounts on it. </p>
