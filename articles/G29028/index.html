    <p>  Almost all tourists who come to Pattaya purchase excursions here, most often the trip is scheduled for early morning, and here vacationers will certainly encounter a hotel drawback - the lack of lunch boxes.  In other words, ordering lunch with you will not work, but everything you need for the trip can be pre-purchased at a local store. </p><h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  Welcome Jomtien Beach Place 3 * (Thailand) does not have its own beach, like other hotels in the city, so tourists will have to spend their holidays on a city sandy beach located across the street from the hotel.  For an additional fee on the beach you can rent sun loungers, umbrellas.  Many sincerely believe that in the city it is simply impossible to take sun baths and swim due to dirt, but this is completely not so. </p><p>  Jomtien Beach is clean enough, daily cleaning.  Yes, the sand here is not as snow-white as on the islands, and the water is not of such an azure hue as in the photo from the Internet, but to relax and enjoy the warm and gentle sea is quite comfortable and pleasant.  Tourists note a good beach infrastructure: here you can rent sports equipment, engage in active water activities, as well as buy soft drinks, fresh fruits and enjoy seafood. </p>
