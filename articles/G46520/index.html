Exquisite jewelry, original dresses, unique equipment, and designer accessories have become more interesting now, as the range of materials has expanded significantly.  Manufacturers offer not only classic natural fabrics, but also more modern synthetic ones, as well as materials with a mixed composition.  Nowadays, there is a need for synthetic consumables, for example, threads.  They retain color and structure much better than natural ones.  In addition, they have increased strength, which is necessary when sewing products with a large load on materials, for example, tents, tents and other tourist equipment.  Today, nylon is the most popular synthetic material for making yarns. </p><h2>  Material History </h2><p>  Nylon was invented at the beginning of the 20th century by the American company EI duPont de Nemours, Inc.  Adipamide polyhexamethylene or ‚Äúpolymer 6.6‚Äù (working title) was renamed nylon during a marketing campaign at an exhibition in 1939 in New York.  The name is made up of the first letters of the cities of New York and London.  This material is a product of oil refining, while its structure is close to the structure of silk fiber.  It was this that allowed the material in 1939 to gain popularity among the female population of America and Europe, and the increased strength, water resistance and durability allowed nylon to become a strategic material during the Second World War. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.rashbel.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nylon threads for sewing" class="if uuid-2829028" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2829028.jpg"></div><h2>  Sewing threads </h2><p>  Initially, nylon threads were made only for the further manufacture of fabric.  Depending on the weaving and thickness of the thread, many fabric options have been developed, ranging from stocking material to cordura.  However, when sewing with cotton threads, the product lost not only its appearance, but also a large percentage of strength.  For this reason, it was decided to manufacture nylon threads for sewing. </p><p>  They are characterized by increased strength and durability.  The thread is smooth, a little shiny, consists of several thinner fibers twisted together.  In addition, there are reinforced nylon threads, where the core is a thicker fiber, around which thin are twisted.  On sale there are threads with a mixed composition, for example, with cotton.  This option allows you to use the thread not only for synthetic materials, but also for natural ones. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  Nylon threads have a lot of advantages: </p><ul><li>  During operation and subsequent operation, they do not fade. </li><li>  Well retain the original structure. </li><li>  Nylon threads are ideal for sewing knitwear.  The line does not tear when stretched, the fabric does not deform. </li><li>  Reinforced nylon thread withstands fairly large loads, does not absorb moisture.  Therefore, it is best suited for sewing camping equipment and outerwear from fabrics containing nylon. </li><li>  It does not shrink, does not fade, which allows you to save the appearance of the product after several washings. </li><li>  The melting point of nylon threads is very high.  Therefore, there is no way to damage the stitch with an iron, steaming the finished product. </li><li>  A single nylon thread (or monofilament) merges with the fabric, so it is indispensable for hemming trousers or hem, as well as for sewing those parts where it is necessary to hide the seam. </li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Absolutely every product has flaws.  This can be attributed to nylon threads.  Their disadvantages are as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  It is difficult to sew with these threads at home, since it is necessary to reconfigure the overlock or sewing machine. </li><li>  When working on a household sewing machine, this thread is best used from the bottom (for the bobbin) since when passing through the needle (with incorrect settings) it can be delaminated and tangled. </li><li>  Not suitable for sewing natural fabrics. </li></ul><p>  Despite all the advantages and disadvantages, this thread is quite in demand among needlewomen and industrial enterprises. </p><p>  Nylon can be found not only in sewing threads, but also in other materials for needlework: for knitting, macram√©, beadwork and others. </p><h2>  Yarn </h2><div class="photo" data-original="alohablu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yarn with nylon" class="if uuid-2829026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2829026.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting nylon threads could not occupy a leading position among other materials, because products from such yarn are loose, poorly kept in shape, poorly ‚Äúbreathing‚Äù, can cause allergies.  However, in combination with other materials, nylon can be found quite often.  It is used to give strength, elasticity, shine, as well as the bonding of villi, for example, in combination with mohair.  Typically, nylon is 15-20%, less often - 50% in the composition of the yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yarn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nylon thread for knitting photo" class="if uuid-2829438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2829438.jpg"></div><p>  In the photo presented, nylon threads for knitting.  They are used for decorating products, knitting toys or in combination with yarn made from natural materials.  Red Heart Scrubby Yarn is popular in Europe.  From it knit napkins for washing dishes.  There are two options for such products: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  From pure yarn.  Products are hard, do not absorb water, suitable for washing heavily soiled surfaces. </li><li>  With the addition of cotton thread.  In this case, the wipes are softer, cleansing is more gentle, and the mixed composition allows you to remove excess moisture. </li></ul><p>  It is very easy to care for products made of nylon yarn. It is enough to adhere to the following rules: </p><ol><li>  Do not wash in hot water.  At high temperatures, the material stretches, so the water should be no more than 40 ¬∞ C. </li><li>  When washing, do not use chlorine.  Better use bleach with <span>sodium percarbonate.</span>  To remove the yellow or gray tint, starch can be added to the powder. </li><li>  When rinsing, it is better to add conditioner and antistatic. </li><li>  Nylon yarn is very easily dyed, so when washing it is necessary to exclude getting together with the product in one tab of things with unstable paint. </li><li>  Dry at room temperature. </li><li>  Ironing is allowed at a temperature not exceeding 110 ¬∞ C. </li></ol><h2>  Macrame </h2><div class="photo" data-original="new.wirecordthread.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="macrame nylon cord" class="if uuid-2829021" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2829021.jpg"></div><p>  For macrame, there are several types of nylon threads: fiber, thread and cord.  It is the latter species that is most popular with needlewomen.  An extensive palette of colors and shades will delight anyone.  The slippery, elastic cord is slightly springy, keeps the shape of even complex knots well, and is great for crocheting and decorating. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.perlesandco.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nylon cord macrame necklace" class="if uuid-2829024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2829024.jpg"></div><p>  Necklaces made using the macrame technique also look original.  Such a decoration made of nylon threads is suitable for both an evening dress and jeans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lc.pandahall.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nylon thread bracelet" class="if uuid-2829022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2829022.jpg"></div><p>  Friendship bracelets from such a cord are bright, durable.  At the same time, they are knitted very quickly, and a nylon cord will allow you to diversify classic tracks with all kinds of arches and decorative knots. </p><h2>  Beadwork </h2><p>  Nylon thread for beadwork is also very popular among craftsmen.  They are more flexible and flexible than fishing line.  This makes the thread less visible in the finished product and comfortable to work with.  It is quite thin and strong, which allows you to thread it through the hole of the beads several times without tangling and deformation.  Especially this material is suitable for weaving fringed products.  The nylon thread under the weight of the beads is easily straightened, therefore this element of the decoration is uniform and neat.  However, when working with frosted beads and glass beads, it is better to abandon nylon, since the thread is frayed when it comes into contact with the rough surface of the frosted beads or with the sharp end of the glass beads. </p><h2>  Monofilament </h2><p>  This one-piece nylon string for beads is well suited, however, only in those products where the load on it is minimal.  Under high tension, the thread breaks.  However, she has a small margin of tension.  This is what makes monofilament ideal for creating one-piece, tight-fitting accessories, such as bracelets or rings.  In this case, it is important to choose the right size so that while wearing the thread is not constantly in a state of tension.  In addition, monofilament is better than classical for working with matte beads, but the fringe on it does not work out even. </p><h2>  Embroidery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinsdaddy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nylon beading threads" class="if uuid-2829025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2829025.jpg"></div><p>  Nylon threads for embroidery with beads are well suited.  Their features: </p><ul><li>  Flexible enough.  It is convenient to fix them on the canvas or fabric. </li><li>  Thin.  This allows you to pass through the bead several times. </li><li>  Transparent or matched to the color of the beads.  Therefore, almost invisible on the canvas. </li><li>  Able to stretch a little, and then take its original shape.  This makes it possible to use them when embroidering even on knitted clothes. </li></ul><p>  Monofilament is also suitable for this type of embroidery, especially when using transparent beads.  However, fixing it is a little more difficult, so it is inferior to ordinary nylon threads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kingbird-tex.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nylon thread for embroidery with beads" class="if uuid-2829023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2829023.jpg"></div><p>  In classic hand embroidery, nylon has not become a popular material.  The nylon thread is too thin, fits tightly, fills the space poorly.  If you choose a thicker thread, then the embroidery looks rough.  If you use nylon in embroidery, then only in the machine.  Usually nylon threads are put in a bobbin (to the bottom of the line). </p><p>  Nylon is one of the oldest, but still popular materials, it can be found both in light industry and in medicine.  Thanks to its many advantages, it has firmly entrenched in the modern market.  Even sewing nylon threads, despite some features, have become popular and in demand among needlewomen of varying degrees of skill. </p>
