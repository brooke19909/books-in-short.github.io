One of these is working with photography, that is, shooting, storing, editing, including deleting pictures.  Many in this regard ask quite logical questions: "What should I do if I deleted the photo on Android? How can I <span>recover lost data</span> and, in general, is it possible?". </p>

    <p>  In a parallel, computerized environment, there are a lot of methods for resuscitating files, but on mobile platforms, such functionality, alas, has clearly limited capabilities.  Before restoring deleted photos on Android (Samsung, Sony, Huawei and other manufacturers), it is important to know that all the information that was sent to the ‚ÄúBasket‚Äù does not disappear, at least some time.  Remote data is recorded in free clusters, and the system simply allows the platform to overwrite it.  And while this process (overwriting) has not occurred, there is always the possibility of resuscitation of files. </p><p>  So, we‚Äôll figure out how to restore the photo on the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù after deletion and what tools we need for this.  Here we have only two options - resuscitation using a PC and without it.  Depending on the choice, the toolkit will also differ. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Using pc </h2><p>  First of all, we‚Äôll look at how to recover deleted photos on Android using a personal computer or laptop.  This is the simplest and most universal option that does not require any specific knowledge and skills. </p><p>  In this case, we will work with the gadget as if it were a regular computer hard drive.  Before restoring a photo on Android from Samsung, Sony or other manufacturers, you need to connect the device to a PC via a USB interface.  After connecting to a computer, a smartphone or tablet will ask you for permission to transfer data along this route.  Accepting the choice, you will see a gadget drive and an external SD card in the list of devices on the PC, if one was installed. </p>

    <p>  Some models from the Middle Kingdom are very picky in terms of drivers, so the device may not be detected the first time it is connected.  In this case, you need to install the necessary proprietary software on your computer, which can be downloaded on the official website of the manufacturer of your device, or found on specialized forums and amateur resources. </p><p>  Before restoring a photo on Android after deletion, you will need to select the appropriate utility for resuscitating files.  Among other applications of such a plan, two ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù can be distinguished that reanimate what is called everything and everything ‚Äî these are Recuva and 7-Data Android Recovery.  This software has an enviable demand both in the amateur and in the <span>professional environment of</span> users, along with high ratings from experts and a lot of positive reviews. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Recuva </h2><p>  Rekuva is the most universal application for recovering photos on Android from any smartphone or tablet.  The program is easy to master, and some specific skills are not needed here, especially since domestic localizers did their best and all the menu branches are understandable and also have an explanatory description. </p>

    <p>  After you connect your gadget to the computer, you can start the utility and, having selected the necessary medium from the drop-down list, wait for the file scanning to complete.  After that, the program will provide a complete list of chains that can be reanimated one way or another, including restoring a photo on Android. </p><p>  It should also be noted that all elements in the drop-down list are assigned a specific color.  The green marker is a complete resuscitation, the yellow one is partial with some conditions, but the red one means that it will not be possible to restore the photo on Android.  The latter option can be attributed to neglected cases when a lot of time has passed since the deletion and the clusters on the drive have already been overwritten. </p><h2>  7-Data Android Recovery </h2><p>  This is a highly specialized software aimed specifically at resuscitation of files on this platform.  Using the utility, you can also easily and quickly restore photos to Android.  By its functionality, the program resembles Rekuvu, but, unlike the latter, it can work with all types of memory.  That is, to reanimate not only data from external or internal drives, but also directly from the RAM of the gadget. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  After starting the program, she will ask for permission to scan the internal memory of the phone and the SD card, and then display a list of files to be restored.  She immediately rejects hopeless options, so there are no colors here, like Rekuva‚Äôs.  But there is a convenient preview where you can see a preliminary picture of the resuscitated image and thereby choose only what you really need. </p><h2>  PC-free recovery </h2><p>  If you do not have access to a computer or laptop, and you really need to restore the data, then you can use less effective, but sometimes very effective applications. </p><p>  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that most utilities of such a plan will work correctly only with super-user rights, that is, with firmware or setting root access.  Otherwise, the percentage of normal data recovery is significantly reduced. </p><h2>  "Basket" </h2><p>  This utility works like a computer ‚Äúbasket‚Äù, when all deleted files are stored in a separate folder, after which they can be reanimated with a couple of clicks.  What is noteworthy, the program does not need root rights at all, and data recovery takes place in a matter of seconds. </p>

    <p>  And in the "basket" does not accumulate the actual volume of photos, but only the names and code part, so there should be no problems with free space.  In a pinch, you can set up automatic cleaning of the application from ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù after a period of time.  But then neither Rekuva nor any other software will help.  The program is distributed through Google Play. </p><h2>  GT Recovery </h2><p>  One of the clear advantages of this software is its versatility.  GT Recovery will work on any, even the most outdated or, conversely, a new gadget, from any manufacturer.  And if the ‚ÄúBasket‚Äù sometimes picks it up with the same ‚ÄúHuawei‚Äù or ‚ÄúXiaomi‚Äù, then for this utility all is one thing - it will search and reanimate files on all devices that you offer it. </p>

    <p>  As a fly in the ointment, there are restrictions on user rights, that is, for the application to work correctly, root access is required.  In Google Play there is a modification that does not require super-administrator rights, but, as mentioned above, the program‚Äôs capabilities are very limited. </p><p>  Software works according to an already familiar principle: it scans the drives of your mobile gadget, and then displays a list of files where the user will have to select from them those that he wants to recover.  The percentage of resuscitation in the full version is very high, so you can recommend the utility to everyone and those who do not stop getting root-rights. </p><h2>  Titanium backup </h2><p>  This utility is a complete analogue of the "Recycle Bin", or rather, on the contrary, the latter is considered similar to "Titan", because Titanium Backup is a whole complex for saving your data, and from all devices. </p>

    <p>  After starting the application, it will completely scan your device and present a detailed list of everything that is, that has been deleted and will be protected by the utility.  The software handles user data very carefully, so when working with the utility, even saving to games will not be affected. </p><h2>  Application features </h2><p>  As in the case of the "Recycle Bin", here you can configure the cleaning periods, types of received data, the number of duplicates of important files and much more.  It is possible to control not only photos, videos or music, but also SMS with phone numbers, which is very convenient. </p><p>  The only fly in the ointment, which will become a critical moment for some, is the system requirements of the application.  The utility ‚Äúeats‚Äù quite a lot of RAM, so owners of weak smartphones and tablets should better look at other options that will not hang up the already demanding Android platform. </p><p>  Reviews about the application on Google Play are mostly positive, and if they come across negative ones, then it‚Äôs only about performance on weak gadgets.  Therefore, if you have a modern device, then Titanium Backup will become an indispensable tool in saving your data. </p>
