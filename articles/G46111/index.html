Best Debit Cards</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The article will compare debit cards. </p><p>  Such a product is by default one of the most affordable banking tools.  Banks rarely refuse to issue cards.  The most common reason for refusal is, as a rule, the lack of citizenship, along with the mismatch of the category of holders for which the plastic is specially designed. </p><p>  Otherwise, there are practically no restrictions.  A really large number of seemingly similar proposals is the reason for the complication of the final choice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hostelhunting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="debit card comparison" class="if uuid-2951122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2951122.jpg"></div><h2>  Difficult choice </h2><p>  It is extremely difficult for those wishing to receive a card to decide on a product so that after its registration and receipt they won‚Äôt regret their choice.  In this regard, comparing the debit card issued by different banks in the current year is a necessary, and at the same time effective measure, which is designed to facilitate the process of selecting the final product. </p><h2>  Cashback Cards </h2><p>  Cash back is the most pleasant addition to the main options of such cards.  Users can spend their own funds, for which the banking structure will return part of the spent amounts to their personal account.  Charge is made both for all purchases made and for purchases within the designated affiliate networks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The latter option is considered more profitable, as the bank and outlets have an agreement according to which the parties can receive additional benefits.  At the same time, the clients themselves do not stand aside, since the financial institution returns increased, that is, the maximum percent of the spent amount to them. </p><p>  What is good about a debit card is interesting to many. </p><p>  In that case, if you analyze the conditions of the cards for this particular indicator, then the size of the returns is very important along with the number of trading partners, the range of purchases for which the cashback is charged, and so on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff and Alfa Bank debit card comparison" class="if uuid-2951125" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2951125.jpg"></div><h2>  What are the suggestions? </h2><p>  According to these criteria, the following options are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Cash Back offer from Alfa-Bank. </li><li>  Card "All at once", which is provided by Raiffeisenbank. </li><li>  "Card number one" from the "East Bank". </li><li>  The offer "Cozy space" from "Rocketbank". </li><li>  Multicard from VTB Bank. </li><li>  Plastic called Card Plus from "Europe Bank". </li><li>  Tinkoff Black card from the popular Tinkoff financial institution. </li><li>  The program "Accumulative" from the "Russian Mortgage Bank". </li><li>  "Smart card" from the financial institution "Discovery". </li><li>  Touch Bank card from the financial structure of the same name. </li><li>  Plastic "Classical" from Sberbank. </li></ul><p>  It‚Äôs not easy to find the best debit card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For each of these products mentioned above, they provide a standard program and special offers.  In particular, such a mechanism is used by Tinkoff, Sberbank and Rocketbank.  The latter is offered an increased size of cashback in cases of increasing payment for annual maintenance. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that in the process of comparing the presented cards, it is possible to find out that all of them are interchangeable and most profitable to date, taking into account the needs of customers.  The remaining subtleties when choosing already depend directly on the individual requests of a particular card holder. </p><h2>  Interest on balance </h2><p>  Let's continue the debit card comparison.  Some of them involve the calculation of interest on the cash balance. </p><p>  This option allows you to get additional earnings in cases when there is a certain amount on the card balance at the end of the period indicated by the financial institution.  According to the terms of user agreements, the bank accrues interest from the amount available on customer accounts.  Such organizations use different accrual schemes.  In the vast majority of examples, they are provided only in cases where, during a certain period of time, the holders spend the amount that was set by the bank in the form of a minimum. </p><p>  For example, on the card balance by the end of the reporting period there are fifty thousand rubles, which are recognized as the balance on the card.  The conditional financial institution will accrue the agreed interest for this amount if the user has spent thirty thousand over the past thirty-day period.  If such a requirement is not met, then, accordingly, no interest is accrued. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="shorelinecards.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="profitable debit cards" class="if uuid-2951126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2951126.jpg"></div><p>  When comparing debit cards, one more nuance must be taken into account. </p><h2>  Balance limit </h2><p>  A very common condition is the restriction on the amount of the balance for calculating interest.  Banks set the maximum threshold at which accruals are made.  Amounts over the set thresholds will not be taken into account in the calculations. </p><p>  It is worth giving an example: the bank has set a maximum threshold for interest accruals in the form of one hundred thousand rubles, provided that during the billing period purchases were made on the card for at least half of the indicated amount.  At the same time, when, for example, there are one hundred seventy thousand on the balance sheet, the surplus will not be taken into account.  Thus, according to the criterion for calculating the interest on the balance of the choice, today it is worth paying attention to the following products: </p><ul><li>  Plastic "Smart Card" from the banking organization "Discovery". </li><li>  Cosmos card from Home Credit Bank. </li><li>  Tinkoff Black card from Tinkoff financial institution. </li><li>  Proposal "Growth Map" from Transcapitalbank. </li></ul><p>  Now find out which of the payment instruments are recognized as the best debit cards. </p><h2>  Most profitable cards </h2><p>  If you consider all the necessary criteria when choosing a debit card, you should name the following payment instruments, which are considered the most profitable this year, according to most customers. </p><ul><li>  Bright card from St. Petersburg Bank. </li><li>  Card Plus offer from Credit Europe. </li><li>  Plastic "Cozy Space" from "Rocketbank". </li><li>  A plastic called ‚ÄúMaximum Income‚Äù from Loko-Bank. </li><li>  Offer "Bank in the pocket of Gold Promo" from the structure "Russian Standard". </li><li>  Card "Savings Account" from the "Post Bank". </li></ul><p>  Such cards are rightly called a good alternative to bank deposits.  The difference really exists, because when placing deposits in any of the financial institutions, clients lose access to their financial assets for the duration of the agreement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.barclays.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="top debit cards" class="if uuid-2951119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2951119.jpg"></div><p>  Below we compare the Tinkoff and Alfa-Bank debit cards. </p><h2>  What are the advantages of cards from Tinkoff and Alfa-Bank </h2><p>  One of the most successful cards from Tinkoff today is Tinkoff Drive plastic.  This fresh offer is suitable for those who spend a lot of time behind the wheel.  The holder of this plastic is given the widest choice of cashback for acquisitions not only at gas stations, but absolutely for everything connected with cars, expensive and even fines and other expenses for personal transport. </p><p>  Any other purchases to the client will also be returned to the card in the form of one percent of any expense for absolutely every hundred.  That is, when a purchase is less than one hundred rubles, then cashback is not credited, and if one hundred and fifty, then exactly one ruble will return to the card.  For all other cards of this bank, cashback is credited according to a similar principle. </p><p>  Alfa-Bank has one of the best offers as opposed to Tinkoff products today with a debit instrument called Alfa-Card.  This tool is characterized by innovativeness and dual capabilities, since it has two sides at once: it is both credit and debit at the same time.  Thus, in this regard, this payment product significantly overtakes offers from Tinkoff Bank.  Why order to issue as many as two cards when you are given the opportunity to use one with a dual purpose, and even a hundred days without any interest on a loan to make purchases and cash withdrawals.  The conditions for this offer are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Availability rates of twenty-four percent. </li><li>  Higher Gold Credit Discount. </li><li>  Maintenance for only five hundred rubles a year. </li><li>  The presence of a free mobile application called Alfa Mobile. </li></ul><p>  These are fairly profitable debit cards. </p><h2>  What is a good gold card from Sberbank? </h2><p>  Based on the income of its customers, their overall solvency, a leading Russian bank issues a card product in three categories: entry-level, classic and premium.  Among the latter category, Sberbank's gold debit card is very popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dfi.wa.gov" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is a good debit card" class="if uuid-2951121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2951121.jpg"></div><p>  The conditions for its provision are: </p><ul><li>  Validity of at least three years. </li><li>  The currency is rubles along with the euro and the dollar. </li><li>  Annual customer service costs three thousand rubles.  And in the first year of the special offer, only one and a half. </li><li>  Availability of free connection and use of a mobile bank. </li><li>  Free reissue. </li><li>  Providing a <span>limit on cash withdrawals:</span> three hundred thousand rubles per day and three million per month. </li><li>  Debit products take part in the ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù bonus program, that is, up to twenty percent of the cost are returned with bonuses to the account when making purchases. </li></ul><h2>  How to use a debit card? </h2><p>  Banking institutions offer a wide selection of various financial products, of which debit are one of the most popular.  Mostly these serve as a tool for accessing personal bank accounts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="issuing a debit card" class="if uuid-2951124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2951124.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Cash withdrawal at ATMs or cash desks of a financial institution. </li><li>  Carrying out non-cash payment of goods and services in trade and service enterprises. </li><li>  Payment of fines, taxes and utility bills. </li><li>  Revenue generation. </li></ul><h2>  What are the main expenses of debit plastic holders? </h2><p>  What does a debit card require? </p><p>  The costs are usually as follows: </p><ul><li>  Holding an annual account maintenance fee. </li><li>  Write-off fee for cash withdrawals at ATMs (charged in most situations when withdrawals are carried out at third-party ATMs and amount to about one percent). </li><li>  Taking a conversion fee (charged in the case when the transaction currency does not coincide with the account). </li><li>  The provision of a fee for SMS informing (approximately fifty rubles per month, in some banks this service is free). </li></ul><h2>  Safety Instructions for Use </h2><p>  The safety rules for the use of such cards are as follows: </p><ul><li>  The PIN code is a unique identifier, information about it is forbidden to transmit.  You cannot store this code with a plastic card. </li><li>  Control of incoming messages. </li><li>  In case of any alarming situations (for example, a call from a call center with a request for information about the owner and a one-time password), you should call your contact center by the number indicated on the plastic and double-check the information. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.nsb.lk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Gold Debit Card" class="if uuid-2951123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/2951123.jpg"></div><p>  It should be noted that bank employees do not have any right to request a code, since all information is stored in the database.  To use a mobile application, you must install an antivirus.  In conclusion, it is also worth saying that you should not forget to turn off unnecessary services in your personal account, which are installed automatically when the card is activated.  For example, SMS alerts. </p><p>  We conducted a comparison of debit cards. </p>
