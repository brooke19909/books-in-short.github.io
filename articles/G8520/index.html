    <h2>  Construction </h2><p>  The first and second buildings will be commissioned in the first phase of the <span>residential complex</span> : the first - at the beginning of 2018, and the second - closer to summer.  The second phase includes three more buildings that are planned to be commissioned in the second quarter of 2019.  Architecture and planning solutions LCD "Home" reviews are especially often mentioned.  This is not only <span>comfort-class</span> housing <span>, this is what</span> distinguishes almost all new buildings in the capital.  There will be a building in a fundamentally new quality, first of all, it concerns the landscape design, sustained in a single concept, the well-thought-out infrastructure of the Domashny residential complex.  The reviews mention such a great solution as huge windows in buildings (they are installed sixty centimeters from the floor, that is, the view will be almost panoramic. Another very wide assortment (more than seventy types!) Of planning solutions for apartments is noted - from the smallest (thirty square meters ) to quite extensive (more than a hundred meters). And one can not help but mention the main feature of the residential complex "Domashny" (Maryino). Reviews are always overwhelmed with admiration when they mention the insolation of each apartment and the common area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe courtyard.  Here, very different buildings are combined very correctly - from low-rise six to nine floors to high-rise thirty-two-story ones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The space inside the courtyard is completely free and protected from vehicle traffic, the creators of the project organized such protection through underground parking and ground parking.  No one will interfere with children's games in the well-equipped playgrounds and sports fields in the yard, all of them are safe and designed for children of all ages.  There is a platform for dog walking, a sports ground.  An example of the excellent organization of bike paths and pedestrian zones for the entire Maryino district is the Domashniy residential complex, reviews of future residents are very grateful for such concern.  The infrastructure is also thought out to the smallest detail.  The first floors of residential buildings are given to shops, cafes, medical facilities, beauty salons and other useful institutions.  You can dive into the bustle of a metropolis only in the rarest case - everything you need is on the territory of the Domashny residential complex, customer reviews confirm this.  And in extreme cases, you don‚Äôt have to go far - Maryino as a district has long been established, the infrastructure here, as in the entire capital, is wonderful. </p>

    <h2>  Details </h2><p>  A school for 875 students and two kindergartens were designed on the territory, each with 190 seats.  Parents do not have to worry about how their children will be arranged, and this is a big plus for the Domashny residential complex.  Customer reviews also note that there are many schools and kindergartens in the vicinity - within walking distance, if it suddenly happens that these educational and pre-school institutions cannot satisfy their parents.

Borovik and immediately adjacent to the 850th anniversary of Moscow.  A huge plus is the river outside the windows.  Maryino is a fairly young area, the construction of which provided for all modern infrastructure.  According to the security rating - one of the best in the capital.  A lot of educational institutions in its territory. </p><p>  There will be no cars in the yards, video surveillance is provided around the clock, and therefore security of residence is the number one advantage.  Access to emergency vehicles, however, will not be difficult.  Playgrounds are good because they are designed for children of different ages.  Designed bike parking.  There is also a control system in the entrances, no stranger can enter freely.  There are no steps and ramps at the entrances to the entrances, which will greatly facilitate the lives of people with disabilities, elderly and sick people.

In the afternoon these are picturesque parks, a river, in the evening - magnificent lights of Moscow at night.  This is directly the Maryino area, and more distant - Brateevsky Park, Borisov Ponds, the reserve "Kolomenskoye".  And in the distance are clearly visible towering towers of the complex "Moscow City".  Exceptionally well, the project provides for the decoration of all entrance groups and floor spaces.  Here, too, a solution has been developed in a single concept.  The inter-apartment halls are spacious and bright, each little thing is thought out for the comfort and convenience of future residents. </p><p>  The space is fully planned: with cozy waiting areas, with a place for concierge, storage rooms and the like.  The light is thought out highly professionally: designer chandeliers (individual order) will fill each room with warm and soft light.  Walls and ceilings in a noble color scheme, where dark and light shades do not argue with each other, but complement and saturate, there are no sharp transitions, so a calm home mood is created.  Thresholds are absent everywhere, and this is also an important element of concern for future residents of any age.  Materials for decoration are used only the highest quality: porcelain stoneware floor, a modern combination of wall decoration.  The lobby has panoramic windows and natural light gives extra joy to those there.  The navigation system is convenient, solved in a modern approach, plus even mailboxes perfectly complement the interior. </p>

    <h2>  With decoration </h2><p>  If the buyer needs to enter the already finished apartment, he will be offered it in the second launch complex in the sixth section.  Only one and two-room apartments from 37.2 square meters to 68. Planning solutions are standard, as usual, one-room apartments and two-room apartments are implemented, but several solutions are offered - at the client‚Äôs choice, so that the accommodation corresponds to his ideas about the functionality and comfort of living.  Finishing is offered in two versions, both are wonderful and differ from each other only in the choice of color scheme. </p><p>  In the first version - light colors in all materials used for finishing floors and walls.  Wall tiles for bathrooms and kitchens are used from combined collections, which combine white decorative glossy inserts with the main formats (marbled pattern).  Floor coverings are laconic and in harmony with door interior blocks.  In the second version of the decoration, the shades are darker - both the floor and the walls.  Color solutions are neutral in concept, comfortable for perception.  Wall tiles in the bathroom in harmony with the door blocks and walnut flooring.  The materials used are high-quality: porcelain stoneware and <span>ceramic tiles</span> Italian Kerama Marazzi, sanitary ware Czech Jika and Bulgarian Vidima, Swiss laminate Kronostar and US-French Tarkett, interior doors Mario Rioli with German and Brazilian fittings, and sockets and switches French. </p><h2>  Area </h2><p>  Previously, there was an industrial zone, and therefore, restoration is necessary for the soil, which is also provided for by the creators of this project.  The social infrastructure is well developed: in addition to kindergartens and schools on the territory of the complex, there are literally other schools, gymnasiums, a music school, many kindergartens, a hospital, several large shopping complexes, and the Ice Palace not far from it. </p><p>  Transport so far is only fixed-route taxis that will take residents to the Maryino metro station (about ten minutes).  Eight kilometers away is Kashirskoye Shosse, on the other hand, Lublinskaya Street, where you can go onto the Moscow Ring Road.  The railway station "Pererva" is three kilometers away, and you can also get there by minibus. </p>
