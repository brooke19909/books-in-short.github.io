    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  LCD "Union Park" ("Krost") is a Russian-Dutch project, for which it clearly deserves special attention.  The complex is based on the best practices of European colleagues.  The project is being built using monolithic construction technology.  Houses with a height of 31 floors make up the general concept of the project, while each of them is endowed with individuality and unique style.  If you are tired of monotonous projects, standard layouts, but are not ready to say goodbye to the developed metropolitan infrastructure, your choice should definitely fall for Union Park residential complex.  The feedback of the first tenants confirms that the project combined all the advantages of modern development and fully met the expectations placed on it.  The final commissioning of the facility is scheduled for the 2nd quarter of 2017.  A little more, and the happy owners of the keys will be able to proceed with the repair. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The Krost company is actively building <span>new buildings in Moscow</span> and the region.  This is the largest developer of the capital, on whose account dozens of successfully implemented facilities.  How many people - so many opinions.  And here, buyers were divided into two categories: some completely trust the developer, because they had the opportunity to assess the quality of already built houses, others simply consider the company unscrupulous.  The reason for such a negative attitude was largely the situation with the change in the value of apartments.  Indeed, quite a few complaints and grievances now sound.  But there is only one conclusion - carefully read the contract and its terms.  Only in this case will you protect yourself from mistakes and disappointments. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The North-Western district, which was selected for the construction of Union Park residential complex, is famous for the ideal ratio of developed infrastructure, transport accessibility, ecology and a huge number of park areas for family vacations. </p><p>  Perhaps the area can be called the main and undeniable advantage of the project.  Within walking distance from the LCD "Union Park" are the famous Serebryany Bor and the river.  There is enough space for outdoor recreation, family picnics and just pleasant leisure.  The remoteness of Zvenigorodskoye Shosse (located 700 meters from the complex) made it possible to maintain silence and calm in the microdistrict. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  All those considering the Union Park residential complex are likely to be attracted by transport accessibility.  Car owners note the availability of a convenient exit to the Zvenigorod highway.  With all the traffic on the highway, it is almost always free.  Accordingly, you can get to work pretty quickly.  At the time the facility is commissioned, several public transport routes will be launched that connect the new district with the center of the capital. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Projects with developed infrastructure in prestigious areas of the capital are offered by the Krost company.  LCD "Union Park" on Karbyshev was no exception to the rule. </p><p>  Europe currently not only promotes, but also supports a healthy lifestyle, an integral part of which is regular exercise.  That is why quite a few sports facilities are being built on the territory of the Union Park residential complex: a football field, a basketball court, and a tennis court. </p>

    <p>  Underground parking for 233 cars - a modern alternative to garages.  Nimble real estate investors who managed to acquire together with an apartment and a parking place once and for all saved themselves from parking problems. </p><p>  At the moment, the project does not provide for the construction of social infrastructure, but all residents of the complex will have access to the infrastructure of an already settled and developed area.  Children will be able to attend kindergarten and the prestigious Khoroshevskaya gymnasium.  In the immediate vicinity of the complex there are enough shops, shopping and entertainment centers, bars and restaurants.  Residents of the complex do not notice any discomfort. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  Living in unity with nature is certainly luxurious.  But surely you want to feel safe and secure.  So, in almost all reviews there is a mention of the fenced area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe object.  In the future, it is planned to equip it with a round-the-clock video surveillance system, as well as checkpoints.  It will be simply impossible for unauthorized persons to enter the territory of the complex.  Interest holders emphasize that this condition is important, since in the absence of outsiders you can not worry about their safety and the safety of children playing on the site. </p>

    <h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  The territory of the complex is landscaped: the areas are asphalted, there are enough walking and walking paths, playgrounds, flower beds in the territory.  The developer really made a lot of efforts so that every resident would feel as comfortable as possible.  Moreover, if objects in the territory break down without additional reminders and complaints, the damaged element is repaired or replaced. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  Currently, houses that were commissioned in the first place are populated, which allows you to get feedback from residents.  So how did the first buildings of the Union Park residential complex come about?  Layouts of apartments are diverse.  You can buy a small, but cozy "odnushka" or prefer a spacious "three rubles" with a large kitchen and isolated rooms.  Residents note that the quality of construction does not cause any complaints.  The houses turned out warm, with excellent sound insulation. </p><p>  All apartments are for rent with rough finish.  Interest holders attribute this feature rather to shortcomings.  The cost of the apartments is quite high, but even taking into account the impeccable quality of the houses and a good rough finish, preparing the surfaces for subsequent wallpapering, painting is not a cheap pleasure.  Of course, I want to bring furniture and live after receiving the keys. </p><p>  At the same time, each apartment has a minimum set of necessary communications: cold and hot water, electrical wiring, coolants. </p>

    <h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  <span>A</span> business class <span>residential complex</span> in a prestigious area is not the most affordable pleasure.  Apartments in LCD "Union Park" is advantageous to purchase only at the stage of laying the foundation, that is, become an interest holder.  At the stage of completion of the object, a one-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 35 square meters will cost about 6,000,000 rubles.  The cost of three-room apartments with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã94 square meters is about 24 million rubles.  Of course, for the Moscow region the price is fabulous.  There is an opinion that the cost of apartments is significantly overstated.  But in this case, do not forget about the class of the complex.  It is located in an ecologically clean area, which is rare for Moscow.  Residents of the neighborhood enjoy peace, tranquility, clean air.  This is a great place for families with small children.  You can rest assured that your children will be grateful to you for the opportunity to walk in the park, run and frolic all day, spend time on the playgrounds and sports fields, which are abundant here. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  LCD "Union Park" - an interesting project.  It is worthy of special attention, being an example of modern buildings.  The best European experience helped create something unique, special, to realize the idea in one of the best areas of Moscow, where unique conditions for life were created. </p>
