    <p>  Since the Elysium Side Bella Hotel (ex. Side Bella Luna Hotel) has recently changed its owner, the living conditions in it have slightly changed.  This point should be borne in mind by regular customers of the hotel. </p><p>  Cash exchange is best done at specialized points.  They are found in abundance in the center of Side and in Manavgat.  The Russians use the services of Deniz Bank.  He issues Turkish lira by withdrawing money from a bank card account.  Very convenient and profitable. </p><p>  A half hour walk from the residential building are the ruins of Barut.  You need to stick to the boardwalk, and then ask the locals.  They will tell you the way. </p><p>  Near the complex there are travel companies.  Prices for excursions are cheaper than in the hotel’s travel agency.

This part of the resort is approximately 2 kilometers away.  You can use a taxi or minibus. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  In local representations of travel agencies, river boat or boat trips around Manavgat are in the greatest demand.

Cost - 1,200 rubles. </p><p>  Fans of extreme entertainment choose rafting.  During the descent, travelers cover a distance of more than 14 km. </p>
