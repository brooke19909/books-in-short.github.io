On the map of Italy, he is in the place where the heel begins, washed <span>by the waters of the Adriatic.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bari on the map of italy" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/391279.jpg" width="480"></div>  Thousands of tourists are eager to visit this fabulous corner of the country.  Its appeal lies in the fact that this large settlement managed to maintain the atmosphere of a small town.  Here you can see many historical <span>architectural structures</span> and monuments, magnificent castles, small markets and luxury shops.  Guests of the city can taste local dishes, get acquainted with history and culture, see one of the main relics of the Christian world - the myrrh-streaming relics of Nicholas the Wonderworker.  An important reason for visiting Bari is that it is here that history and legends are closely intertwined, creating a unique atmosphere. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bari italy" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/390839.jpg?1399475820221" width="600"></div>

Presumably, the ancient Greeks lived here, which were subsequently supplanted by the Romans.  The first mention of Bari harbor was found in 181 written sources.  Most likely, after the branch of the ‚ÄúTrojan Road‚Äù trade route passed through this territory, the city acquired the significance of a large port.  Already in the 5th century the Goths ruled here, then the Byzantines.  In 847, the territory was captured by Arabs, but could not hold power over it, and in 871 he returned to the Byzantines.  In 1068, the whole of southern Italy was conquered by the Normans, whose reign ended in the 12th century.  In the 14th and 15th centuries, the city was ruled by a dynasty of dukes, which brought it into decline.  After the death of the daughter of Isabella of Naples, the county became the property of the Kingdom of Naples again. </p><h2>  Churches and temples of Bari </h2><p>  Pilgrimage tours to Bari are very popular among Orthodox Christians from Russia.  Italy is primarily attracted by the opportunity to touch the relics of St. Nicholas the Miracle Worker, which are stored in the specially built for them the Basilica of St. Nicholas.  Its construction dates back to the period of Norman rule in Puglia.  The basilica was built to store the relics of <span>St. Nicholas</span> brought from the city of Mira.  Its majestic facade is divided into three parts by pilasters.  The basilica has three entrances, the doors on which are trimmed with rich carvings.  On both sides are attached two bell towers with a shortened shape.  The inner part looks like a <span>Latin cross</span> and is decorated with beautiful carvings, frescoes and gilding. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bari italy sights" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/390840.jpg?1399431961726" width="590"></div>

Other significant sights of the city of a religious nature include the cathedral church of St. Sabine, built in the Romanesque style, the architecture of which is characterized by power and strength.  Looking at such a structure, you feel protected and are filled with strength. </p><p>  The cost of a pilgrimage tour to Bari (Italy readily accepts all pilgrims) lasting 7 nights is, on average, from 1,150 euros. </p><h2>  Norman Swabian castle - a symbol of the city </h2><p>  Along with pilgrimage tours, sightseeing tours are no less popular.  During such a trip to Bari (Italy cordially opens its arms to tourists from different countries), you can see a huge number of unique attractions, the leading place among which is occupied by historical architectural structures.  It is recommended to visit an impressive building, which is considered to be a symbol of the city - Bari Castle.  It was built in the 12th century by order of the Sicilian king Roger II.  Having existed for only 25 years, it was destroyed, and in 1233 restored, but by the Roman emperor Frederick II.  Subsequent rulers of the city converted and completed the castle at their discretion.  Today it is a magnificent building with thick walls and spear-shaped bastions for gunshot attacks.  Since a deep moat has been dug around the castle, you can get into it only after passing through the massive bridge leading to the entrance.  Currently, a historical museum is located here, telling about interesting facts from the past. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bari city italy" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/390841.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is the largest in the city and the fourth largest in the country.  Its construction was carried out at the initiative of the brothers Antonio and Onofrio Petrutzelli in 1903.  The interior is decorated with amazingly beautiful painted frescoes.  The theater itself is a unique two-story building, painted in dark red and decorated with white decor.  On his roof there are sculptures.  Many famous Italian artists performed on the stage of this theater, including Riccardo Muti, Luciano Pavarotti, Carla Fracci. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bari italy reviews" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/390850.jpg?1399433171163" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The sights of the city also include numerous palaces belonging to the Italian nobility and built in the Middle Ages.  The largest of these is the Archbishop's Palace, followed by the Palazzo Diana and the Palazzo Gironde. </p><h2>  Piccinni Theater </h2><p>  On the southern border of the historic center of Bari, Italy shows the visitor the oldest theater in the city - Piccinni, whose building was built in 1854.  The first performance took place on May 30 of the same year.  The theater got its name only a year later in honor of the composer Niccolo Piccinni.  After Petrutzelli was destroyed by fire in 1991, Piccinni became the cultural center of the city and stayed that way for almost 20 years.  Now it is one of the largest theaters in Puglia, which attracts no less spectators than the Verdi Theater in San Severo or Politeama in Lecce. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tours to bari italy" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/390843.jpg?1399432638418" width="600"></div><strong></strong>

    <h2>  Other attractive places of the city </h2><p>  In addition to the castles and palaces that have been preserved in Bari, Italy does not limit the sights of the city to just the already mentioned places and objects.  This list can be supplemented with such an interesting place as Piazza Ferrarese, which makes a tremendous impression on vacationers.  It is located near the old harbor.  The square is especially elegant and beautiful in the evening and at night, when the lights turn on on a busy shopping road. </p><p>  You can feel complete peace of mind by visiting the University of Bari Botanical Garden.  Italy is proud of him and assigned a 1 hectare area near the Russian church under the garden.  Its discovery occurred in 1960.  A conservatory is built in the garden.  Here you can see about 40,000 species of plants, 500 of which are found only in Puglia. </p><h2>  Museums of the city </h2><p>  The city of Bari (Italy) has a huge number of museums that are always ready to tell each tourist something new and interesting.  The most visited is the Nikolaev Museum.  Here is a collection of exhibits related to the history of the Basilica of St. Nicholas, ancient icons, objects of worship and other materials of the Byzantine era.  It was opened in 2010 and accepts tourists daily (except Friday) from 10.30 to 17.00. </p><p>  It will be interesting to visit the archaeological museum, which contains a complete collection of archaeological materials of Puglia, most of which are bronze and ceramics.  Here you can get acquainted with the representatives of the Apulian civilization - the Peucian, Massalian and Downian peoples. </p><p>  For connoisseurs of art, the Art Museum has been opened, which contains a huge collection of works of the 19-20th centuries. </p><h2>  Bari beaches </h2><p>  Going on vacation to the specified city, which is located on the sea coast, most tourists assume the presence of excellent beaches in this resort.  But in Bari <span>(Italy), beaches are</span> not entirely attractive for swimming, as they have a rocky topography.  The only place in the city where you can sunbathe and swim safely is Pane e Pomodoro Beach.  It is well equipped and provides vacationers with plenty of entertainment.  Its only drawback is the small area, which can not accommodate everyone.  Those who want to sunbathe on more spacious beaches should drive 20-25 kilometers from the city, as there are small bays. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bari italy beaches" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/390842.jpg?1399432681848" width="600"></div>
