Despite the fact that in this country it is difficult to find free beaches, the level of service, the abundance of historical attractions, the hospitality of local residents and excellent cuisine attract thousands of tourists every year. </p><p>  Especially popular is the area called Riccione, Cattolica and Marittima.  These three villages form a kind of resort agglomeration.  Hotels of different stars lined up along the coast of the Adriatic Sea.  And not far north of Riccione is the ancient city of Rimini - with many historical and cultural attractions. </p><p>  In this article we will talk about the Gran San Bernardo 3 Hotel. Despite the name that refers to the Alpine Gran San Bernard Pass, there is nothing mountainous about this hotel.  It stands on the first line of the sea and has its own beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gran san bernardo 3" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538955.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  The administrative hotel Gran San Bernardo 3 is owned by Riccione.  However, it stands north of the center of this resort town.  But right on the road that buses run (No. 11) and trolleybuses between Rimini and Riccione.  Their stop ("Beach 125") is located directly at the hotel.  Buses and trolleybuses run strictly according to the schedule (in the daytime with an interval of eight minutes).  So the question is how to get to the hotel from the airport.  Fellini in Rimini, you can not worry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To the center of Riccione, walk about twenty minutes.  This interesting town is called the "Green Pearl of the Adriatic."  In addition to parks, there is also the largest water park in Europe.  There is a dolphinarium at the resort.  But the most important thing for which tourists come to Riccione is the thermal springs.  There are four types of them (bromo-iodide, manganese, salt and sulfur), and therefore the spectrum of diseases that are treated in a hydropathic clinic is very wide. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Gran San Bernardo 3" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538934.jpg" width="357"></div>

    <h2>  The territory of the hotel Gran San Bernardo 3 (Italy, Riccione) </h2><p>  This is a small cozy hotel.  It occupies a four-story building with an attic.  The name in honor of the Alpine mountain pass is supported by wooden balconies in the style of a Swiss chalet.  The hotel has a small area occupied by a green Mediterranean garden.  There is an elevator in the building, and reviews of tourists recommend asking for a room on the upper floors when checking in. </p><p>  Across the road, through which there is a pedestrian crossing, there is a private equipped beach of the hotel.  Despite the fact that this area is located between Rimini and Riccione, the area can not be called sleeping.  There are other hotels around, there are many shops, cafes and restaurants. </p><p>  One of Riccione's water parks, Beach Village, is just six hundred meters from the hotel.  Tourists celebrate the beautiful promenade, which is nice to walk in the evening.  The hotel positions itself as a place where cyclists like to stay.  For this category of tourists there is a garage and a repair shop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gran San Bernardo 3 Riccione" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538949.jpg" width="600"></div>

All of them belong to the same category - ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù.  But still the numbers are different, and substantially.  There are family rooms where, in addition to the matrimonial bed, there is a bunk bed for children.  The best option for booking in the hotel Gran San Bernardo 3 is balcony sea view.  Some rooms (by no means all) also have balconies, but they go to other hotels that are right next to the Gran San Bernardo 3. </p><p>  On the ground floor of the building there is a lobby, restaurant with terrace, reception.  Guests are accommodated starting from the second tier and higher.  In Italian hotels, especially in the "triples", the rooms are tiny.  But their plus is a stylish design.  Everything is very beautiful and festive.  The inadequate area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwenty square meters is compensated by the rich technical equipment.  In addition to the ceiling fan, there is also air conditioning.  A flat-screen TV is hanging on the wall.  The bathroom comes with a hairdryer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gran San Bernardo 3 Rimini" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538953.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Gran San Bernardo 3 has already included breakfast in the room rate.  They are served in the hotel restaurant on the ground floor.  But the tables are on the street, on the terrace under the marquises.  Breakfast is buffet style.  Many tourists complain that Italians are used to eating very little in the morning.  Therefore, most hotels offer a cup of espresso and some pastries for breakfast.  But at the Gran San Bernardo Hotel, this meager set is complemented by yogurts, granola, cheese and meat slices and juices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As the hotel caters for cyclists on their <span>travels in Italy,</span> packed lunches can be ordered here.  Many tourists book half board at the hotel.  Then for dinner, they are waiting for delicious Italian cuisine.  The waiters serve an evening meal on a custom-made menu.  You can choose one dish from soups, appetizers, main dishes and desserts.  But drinks at dinner are not included in the price of half board and are paid separately. </p><h2>  What tourists say about the food in the hotel.  Recommendations </h2><p>  The skill of the cooks in the hotel restaurant was highly appreciated by the reviews.  The dinners were just wonderful, the menu was always changing.  In addition, the meal was a common table littered with a variety of vegetables and snacks that could be taken unlimited.  A choice of one of three dishes was offered.  There was always something vegetarian on the list, so this category of tourists was satisfied.  Taken wine can not be drunk in one sitting.  The bottle of your room number will be put in the refrigerator and brought to you the next day.  By the way, dinners can be changed for lunch - they are also served on the menu. </p><p>  The tourists described the breakfasts as good.  There were no fruits, but you can drink excellent coffee as much as you want.  And bite at the same time with first-class Italian pastries. </p><p>  Right across the street from the Gran San Bernardo 3 hotel (in front of the beach entrance) there is a restaurant with affordable prices for lunch.  A second course, salad and a glass of wine will cost about fifteen euros.  You can find many cafes, pizzerias, restaurants, and boutiques in the nearby streets of Dante and Ciccarini. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gran San Bernardo 3 Italy Riccione" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538958.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  They go to Italy not quite overseas, but it would be unfair not to mention him.  Directly across the road is Gran San Bernardo 3's own sandy beach. It is well-equipped.  There are a number of changing cabins, so there is no need to stand in line, showers, sunbeds, umbrellas, a toilet, a volleyball court and ping-pong tables.  Floaters are watched by rescuers.  And even when the sea is storming and a red flag is hanging on the beach, indicating that it is impossible to enter the water, they are on alert and on duty with inflatable rafts.  There are not many people ashore.  Since this is not the center of the city, the sea here is very clean.  The bottom is shallow, and in summer the water warms up so much that it just becomes hot.  Italians are very child-loving, and on many <span>beaches of Rimini,</span> Riccione, Cattolica and Marittima, children's animation works.  The coast of Gran San Bernardo is no exception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gran San Bernardo 3 reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538943.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel service </h2><p>  And again it should be mentioned that Gran San Bernardo 3 (Riccione) specializes in the reception of cycling tourists.  But even if you do not belong to those, the hotel will instill in you a love for this type of transport.  You can rent a bike for free, including for children and teenagers.  The terrain here is flat, equipped paths, isolated from both road transport and pedestrians, and therefore you will enjoy driving. </p><p>  In addition to the restaurant, the hotel also has a bar where you can relax with a glass of your favorite drink.  "Wi-Fi" in the hotel is paid, complaints are complaining, and a little expensive - two euros per hour.  In Italy, the problem is to find free beaches.  And here - at hand.  The double room includes one umbrella and two sun loungers, regardless of the number of residents.  The hotel has parking, as well as a tennis court and a gym.  The hotel is pet friendly.  Valuables can be stored in a safe (five euros per week). </p><h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  Hotel Gran San Bernardo 3 (Rimini) has an outdoor playground for young guests.  The restaurant has high chairs for feeding babies and, which tourists highly appreciated, a children's menu.  On request and at an additional cost, a crib can be placed in the room.  You can also use the services of a professional babysitter.  Tourists liked the pricing policy for children.  Kids who are under the age of three stay at the hotel absolutely free.  Children from three to seven years old - at half price.  And for ages seven to twelve, the hotel has a twenty percent discount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gran San Bernardo Riccione 3" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538954.jpg" width="600"></div>
