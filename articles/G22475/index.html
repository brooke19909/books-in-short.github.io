In the high season, planes from Russia fly directly to his airport.  If you are not a big fan of the summer heat, you can get to Athens, and from there already - by ferry.  In this article we will tell you about the small hotel ‚ÄúKabanari Bay‚Äù (also called <span>Kabanaris Bay</span> 3 Kiotari because of the area in which it is located).  Having been in a hotel, according to those who visited him in their comments, you can appreciate the beauty of this <span>Greek island.</span>  There are still not very many tourists from Russia, but with an abundance of British and Germans.  Therefore, Rhodes is considered a real European resort.  You will visit the local attractions, feel like a real gourmet, tasting the local cuisine, and simply dissolve in unity with nature.  And all this can be very budgetary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaanari bay 3" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/603609.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Holidays in Kiotari </h2><p>  A map of Rhodes with hotels shows us that there are not so many hotels in the southeast of the island.  Kiotari, one of the most remote resort areas from the capital, is also the youngest.  This means that most of the hotels there are quite new.  This area began to be built up from the nineties of the last century.  The hotels there are decorated in a traditional Greek style.  This includes the hotel, which we describe.  Tourists call it ideal for families with children or couples who want a romantic getaway.  And no wonder.  They have fun here, walking in the surroundings, having lunch in coastal taverns and riding bananas in the water. </p><h2>  General Information about Cabanari Bay </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Kabanari Bay 3 Hotel is located in the Kiotari area.  This is the area in the southeast of the island.  The area is located away from villages and luxury hotels.  To the capital of the <span>island of Rhodes,</span> as well as to the airport, more than fifty kilometers, that is, to go about an hour.  The beach is very close - a few tens of meters from the hotel.  Tourists eat on an all-inclusive basis, although you can take half board and breakfast.  There are board games - darts, billiards - and sports entertainment.  You can play water polo and beach volleyball.  The hotel has animation.  If you are with a car, you can use the parking, and if not, the hotel will give you a car rental.  The territory of the hotel is clean, large and well-groomed.  This hotel is family-run, which is very typical of Greece. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaanari bay 3 reviews" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/603611.jpg" width="480"></div>

Mostly these are typical for Greece apartments with balconies.  But families with children or large companies can settle in very spacious rooms.

Water is heated using solar panels, so in the morning it goes cool.  The furnishings in the rooms are standard - wooden beds, bedside tables, TV, hairdryer in the bathroom, armchair, table.  Plumbing is not new, but it works well.  Give a shower gel and shampoo.  Cleaned every day, changed towels every three days.  The mattresses are of high quality, the linen is cotton.  The windows and balconies offer great views.  Below is a green garden, and then a pool and the sea.  Very beautiful in the morning when the sun rises. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kabanaris bay 3 kiotari" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/603613.jpg" width="480"></div>

There are sunbeds, umbrellas.  The beach itself is sandy, but pebbles are scattered around the entrance to the sea, so tourists are advised to buy beach slippers so as not to feel discomfort.  Near the large boulders on the shore you can swim with a mask and watch the fish.  The sea is warm, gentle, amazingly blue and very salty.  The beach itself is huge, and there are almost no people there, despite the high season.  In addition, the hotel has swimming pools for adults and children.  There is where to swim, and free sunbeds are always present.  By car engine, which departs from the hotel, you can also get to other beaches. </p><h2>  Where to go and go </h2><p>  Hotel Kabanari Bay 3 (Rhodes) is located a bit far from the main streets of the resort of Kiotari, but there are cafes and shops near it.

Of course, it‚Äôs best to have a car, or at least right.  Then you can easily explore the whole island.  If you do not know how to drive, then it is better to take excursions.  As a rule, those who come here for the first time take a sightseeing tour of the island.

    <h2>  Kabanari Bay 3 Reviews </h2><p>  This hotel is popular with lovers of a quiet family holiday.  A calm measured life, relaxation and enjoyment of the sea are the main bonus of staying here.

Independent travelers also appreciated it.  The hotel is very convenient for taking long walks and trips around the island.  But in this case, it is beneficial to take only breakfast.  Hotel Kabanaris Bay Hotel 3 (Rhodes), according to the guests, can be rated even higher than the "troika".  For example, compared with Cretan hotels of the same class, it has a very large and beautiful territory.  There is practically no animation at the hotel, but on the already mentioned train you can get to the Rhodes Princess Hotel, where everyone is allowed to entertain themselves at the local amphitheater.  Since the <span>ticket</span> is valid all day, you can go anywhere, and then take the train and continue on.  He also runs to the shopping center. </p>
