Are you looking for an opportunity to tighten up a foreign language, but not sit at the same time over a stack of textbooks?  Do you dream to have fun and usefully spend time in a pleasant company?  In this case, the game Scrabble is what you need! </p><p>  What is a scrabble?  Where did she come from and how to play her?  You can get answers to these questions and many other useful information about this entertainment by reading a short article. </p><h2>  What is scrabble </h2><p>  Scrabble is a board logic game designed for a small company from two to four people.  The main goal is to compose words from the letters of the alphabet, for each of which the player receives a certain number of points. </p><p>  The name of the game is literally translated from English as "rummaging, scratching, scribble." </p><p>  There are many varieties of the legendary game.  The most famous analogue of the Scrabble game in Russia is Scrabble.  There is also "Balda" - a greatly simplified version of the game that does not require a special set. </p><h2>  Game history </h2><p>  The ‚Äúfather‚Äù of Scrabble is an ordinary US architect named Alfred Butts.  The author of the masterpiece was distinguished from other people by a huge love for board games.  Having collected enough information about the variety of games that existed in the United States in the first quarter of the 20th century, Butts set about trying to create the best board game ever.  The author took a hybrid of verbal and numerical games as the basis of the game, embodied in the compilation of words that had a certain value in points. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scrabble game" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69761/2226259.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Back in 1948, the world saw the first release of the board game Scrabble.  I saw, but did not appreciate.  For several years, Alfred and his partner James Bruno tried to ‚Äúbreak the ice‚Äù in the board game industry, but they failed to do it on their own. </p><p>  Board games company Selchol and Righter has acquired a patent for this ingenious invention and brought the board game to the world level.  The popularity of the game has skyrocketed to unprecedented heights and continues to remain there after almost 70 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="board game scrabble" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69761/2226221.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The game has not only not lost its relevance over time, but has grown to the scale of world championships.  Today in many countries there are Scrabble federations, and in the USA, according to statistics, every third American is passionate about the game. </p><h2>  How to play Scrabble </h2><p>  As a rule, the following components are present in a game set: a playing field, a bag with letters, and letter stands.  It will also be useful to arm yourself with paper and a pen for scoring. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  First of all, it is necessary to determine the order of progress.  To do this, shuffle the letters in the bag and pull out one for each player.  The player who receives the letter closest to the beginning of the alphabet makes the first move.  The sequence of moves of the remaining players is determined in a similar way. </p><p>  At the beginning of the game, each player takes 7 letter tokens.  The player to complete the move first must lay out the word from the available letters, passing it through the middle of the board. </p><p>  The essence of the game is to build the most ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù words.  There are two ways to build words: from top to bottom or from left to right.  When creating words, it is desirable to activate as many colored cells as possible. </p><p>  On the playing field there are cells painted in one of four colors: blue, pink, blue or red. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Blue </td><td>  Points earned in one letter are doubled. </td></tr><tr><td>  Pink </td><td>  Points earned per word are doubled. </td></tr><tr><td>  Blue </td><td>  Points earned in a single letter triple. </td></tr><tr><td>  Red </td><td>  Points earned per word triple. </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Bonuses from several colored fields add up.  Upon receipt of several bonuses, they are counted in the order of reading the word. </p><p>  The game ends in two cases: when there are no letters left in the bag for distribution or when all the players "pass" twice in a row. </p><p>  Determination of the winner is carried out by counting the points scored by each of the players.  The participant with the most points is declared the winner. </p><h2>  The benefits of the game </h2><p>  Board game allows you to not only significantly increase your vocabulary, but also get a lot of positive emotions.  Such hobbies bring people together and simplify further communication. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="game scrabble reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69761/2226220.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Using Scrabble, you can ‚Äúpull up‚Äù a foreign language.  To date, there are 37 localizations of the game for players from different countries.  It is very good if a native speaker plays with you.  He can not only show a lot of new things, but also act as an arbiter.  Also, the game can be useful for a foreigner when immersed in the depths of the great and powerful Russian language. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="board game mattel scrabble" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69761/2226218.jpg"></div>
