    <p>  The interest rate on a Tinkoff Platinum credit card varies and depends on the operation made using a credit card: </p><p>  1. Payment for purchases: </p><ul><li>  0% during the grace period; </li><li>  From 19.9 to 29.9% per annum after the grace period, subject to the timely payment of the minimum payment. </li><li>  From 32.9‚Äì49.9 per annum after an interest-free period and non-payment of the minimum payment. </li></ul><p>  2. With a Tinkoff Platinum card, cash withdrawals are 32.9‚Äì49.9% per annum. </p><p>  3. Commissions for other actions - 32.9‚Äì49.9% per annum. </p><h2>  How to deposit funds to the card </h2><p>  The direction of Tinkoff Bank is remote work with clients.  In addition to the fact that the organization does not have its own offices, they also do not have ATMs.  But this is not a problem for closing credit card debt, because the organization has a whole network of partners, which includes 350 thousand payment points with the possibility of depositing money. </p><p>  The simplest option to recharge a Tinkoff Platinum card (according to reviews) is a debit card of this or any other bank.  In addition, it is possible to replenish the account by bank transfer or by depositing cash through payment terminals.  All these methods do not imply payment of a bank commission, but in some cases it will be necessary to pay a partner, therefore, in order to save money, it is worth examining the conditions before the operation. </p><p>  In addition, do not forget about the timing of crediting money.  Transferring from one card to another or depositing funds through the terminal is usually done in a few minutes, but a bank transfer can take several days.  This circumstance should be taken into account in order to prevent late payment. </p>

    <h2>  Card financial transactions </h2><p>  The procedure for transferring funds to a bank card with a Tinkoff Platinum credit limit can be performed in different ways: </p><ul><li>  Bank transaction.  Before sending money in this way, you need to make sure that the selected financial institution does not charge a transaction fee and is really a Tinkoff partner of the bank.  There are companies that charge fees, but do so purely symbolically.  For example, Avangard Bank charges 10 rubles for a bank transfer, regardless of the amount. </li><li>  Transfer from a card of another bank.  Tinkoff Bank itself does not charge a commission for such a procedure, but the other party may charge a fee for the service.  This point should be clarified before sending money.  When sending funds from a Tinkoff debit card to a credit operation, it is executed instantly and without any fees.  Internet banking has a separate module for conducting transfers. </li><li>  Transfer through partner banks.  The full list of partners is published on the official website of the organization, in the Internet bank, as well as in the mobile application.  Transfer fees are most often not charged, but there are exceptions.  For the operation, it is necessary to provide a loan agreement number, sometimes a passport is required. </li></ul><p>  In addition, you can transfer funds to any other from a Tinkoff Platinum credit card, but you will need to pay a fee of 2.9% of the transfer amount plus 290 rubles for the transaction.  Since the interest-free period extends solely to payment for purchases, then interest on spending credit funds will be accrued. </p><h2>  How to find out the balance </h2><p>  You can get information about the credit balance in the account in different ways: </p><ul><li>  Through <span>online banking.</span>  <span>This</span> is the fastest and easiest way.  Data is updated in real time, so any errors are excluded. </li><li>  By customer support number 880055510101. This method is convenient to use when there is no Internet at hand.  The operator will ask several questions for identification, after which he will tell you in detail about the status of your account. </li><li>  By sending an SMS message to number 2273 (MTS, Megafon and Beeline).  After sending a message with the text ‚ÄúBalance‚Äù and the last four digits of the bank card number, information about the account will be received. </li><li>  Through the mobile phone application.  As fast and convenient as Internet banking, Internet is required. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Credit card reissue </h2><p>  A month before the <span>expiration of the bank card, the</span> bank automatically issues a new one.  It is also brought to the client by a bank employee by prior arrangement.  Relocation is not performed in two cases: </p><ul><li>  When a customer has overdue credit account debt. </li><li>  If the owner has not used the card for a long time and has not taken any action on it. </li></ul><p>  If it was lost or stolen, then you can re-open the Tinkoff Platinum card early.  To do this, call the toll-free number 88005551010 and report on the reason for which a reissue is required.  After receiving the application, the client will receive a new one in the shortest possible time. </p><h2>  How to close a card </h2><p>  To close the Tinkoff Platinum credit card, several steps are required: </p><ul><li>  Pay off debts to the bank and pay all fees.  It is necessary to call the customer support service of the bank.  After passing the identification, the dispatcher will say the exact amount payable for the current month.  Be sure to ask the bank employee to turn off the SMS banking service, because a monthly fee is charged for it every month.  Check with the operator if this amount is full for the calculation, and whether interest will be accrued on it in the next month.  Once all debts have been closed for credit, you should block your credit card if you do not intend to use it in the future.  In case of overpayment to the bank, this amount can be requested to be returned to the specified details.  In addition, you can find out the amount of debt in the Internet bank. </li><li>  For thirty days, send an application to the bank with a request to close the card account.  If necessary, you can withdraw the application within the same period. </li><li>  The agreement states that the card is the property of the bank and must be returned to the owner.  In practice, it is extremely rare to return a card, since after closing it turns into a regular piece of plastic, but just in case, you can keep it for several months in case you need a refund. </li><li>  After 30 days, you need to call back to the Tinkoff customer support service to make sure the account is closed and ask for a certificate, which must have a blue print on it.  The banking institution cannot refuse you, they are obliged to send it by mail to the home address. </li></ul><h2>  How to find out and increase your credit limit </h2><p>  Card credit limit is the maximum amount a client can spend.  It is installed on an individual basis and can reach 300 thousand rubles.  You can find out the amount that is available specifically for you, as well as other Tinkoff Platinum conditions and tariffs, in Internet banking or in the letter attached to the credit card. </p><p>  The credit limit of these cards is revolving.  With timely payments, you can always pay her in stores. </p><p>  Many credit card holders have a question: how to increase the limit on a Tinkoff Platinum card?  It is impossible to do this at the request of the owner, only a bank makes such a decision.  To help increase the amount, you need to use the card as often as possible and make payments established by the bank on time, Tinkoff encourages and trusts respectable borrowers. </p>
