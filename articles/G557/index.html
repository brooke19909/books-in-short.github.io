    <h2>  Complex in Abu Dhabi </h2><p>  I would also like to note that in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, in the city of Abu Dhabi, there is also a hotel with the same name.  However, this is not surprising.  After all, these complexes, like several others with similar names, belong to the same network, known as the Hawthorn Suites. </p><p>  What can you tell about this hotel?  Hawthorn Suites By Wyndham (Abu-Dhabi) 4 * is a less luxurious and, accordingly, more budget hotel complex.  It is about a 12-minute walk from the beach.  The nearest airports are 30 and 90 kilometers respectively. </p><p>  The facilities and services are the same as in the Dubai hotel.  But the apartments are decorated in a different, more restrained and elegant style.  And they are less expensive. </p><p>  A week of accommodation in a 2-bed deluxe room, for example, will cost two guests 20-25 tr  (excluding fees and breakfast).  The apartment area is 27 square meters.  They have a huge 2 double bed, a seating area, floor-to-ceiling windows, a spacious bathroom and all the other amenities that have already been listed. </p><p>  The most expensive apartments in this complex are luxury 3-bedroom super-suites with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã120 square meters.  m. Their weekly price is about 95,000 p. </p>

    <h2>  Who will like the hotel? </h2><p>  Summarizing, I would like to say that the hotels of the Hawthorn Suites chain are able to satisfy the demands regarding the comfort of even the most demanding tourists.  The level and quality of service are fully consistent with the declared stardom, and the best confirmation of this is the positive feedback from grateful vacationers. </p><p>  So if a person is looking for a good apart-hotel for his vacation, he can safely make a choice in favor of the discussed option.  Of course, the hotel complex does not have entertainment like a casino, a multi-level night club or an aqua park.  But his concept is different.  Hawthorn Hotel &amp; Suites by Wyndham JBR is a hotel with the utmost comfort.  And you can see this if you spend a vacation here. </p>
