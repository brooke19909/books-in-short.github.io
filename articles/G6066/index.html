    <p>  You can search for housing on your own or use the help of realtors.  You should rely on the requirements presented by the bank for real estate: </p><ul><li>  It should not be emergency, dilapidated or planned for demolition. </li><li>  Mandatory presence of communications. </li><li>  There should be no illegal redevelopment. </li></ul><p>  Only then can real estate be issued on credit.  The bank offers to select objects from partners, because then the application is most likely to be approved. </p><h2>  Property Documentation </h2><p>  When the property is selected, you must conclude a preliminary contract with the owner.  The bank must provide documentation on the object: </p><ul><li>  Purchase agreement. </li><li>  Registration certificate of housing. </li><li>  Extract from the Unified State Register. </li><li>  Confirmation of the absence of debt for utility bills. </li><li>  Copy of seller‚Äôs passport. </li><li>  Copy of personal account. </li></ul><p>  The security service of Sberbank examines the documentation, assesses the risk of a mortgage.

    <p>  With the help of maternity capital, it will be possible to make the first installment of a registered loan.  They are used for construction, reconstruction of the house and payment of the price of the purchase agreement.  Only then should we wait until the child reaches the age of three.  The certificate can be used to pay the main debt and <span>mortgage interest.</span>  In this case, you do not need to wait for the child‚Äôs three-year anniversary. </p><p>  To use maternity capital to pay the first installment after receiving a loan agreement, it is important to contact the Pension Fund and file an application for managing the money to pay the mortgage.  The application is considered within one month, and two more are spent on transferring funds to the bank. </p><h2>  Sale transaction </h2><p>  When the stages of obtaining a mortgage in Sberbank for housing under construction are passed, a purchase and sale transaction is executed.

    <p>  When these documents are executed, the calculation is made for the purchased property: the borrower makes the first payment, which is transferred to the seller‚Äôs account, or the funds are transferred to the rented bank cell.  The bank transfers or issues cash in cash on a mortgage.  Money will be available to the seller after drawing up a document of the transfer of real estate, registration and registration by the borrower of the purchased object. </p><h2>  Registration of rights </h2><p>  At the end, the borrower needs to arrange housing for himself.  The right of ownership is registered in Rosreestr.  As confirmation, a certificate for the purchased property is issued.  Then you need to draw up an agreement on personal insurance, as well as on collateral insurance. </p><p>  After this, the transaction is considered to be fully completed.  Housing becomes the property of the borrower.  Making a mortgage allows you to get your own housing for those who do not have the opportunity to purchase it immediately at full cost.  It remains only to make timely payments for it. </p>
