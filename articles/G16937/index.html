  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Entrepreneurial income of an enterprise as a fundamental indicator of its value</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The relevance of model research on <noindex>  <span>cost estimation</span> </noindex>  enterprises <span>profitable method</span> due to the ongoing processes of corporatization and privatization of enterprises.  Thus, the share of private property in the total number of functioning enterprises in the CIS countries reaches 90%. </p><p>  Currently, in these countries the main method of assessing value is costly.  However, in a market economy, a potential investor will not invest in a business project without making sure that the company will generate income after the acquisition.  Any investor who invests financial resources in an enterprise buys, above all, a stream of future income. One of the main reasons why the models of the income method are not used in the assessment is the ambiguous definition of the concepts of ‚Äúincome‚Äù, ‚Äúcapitalization of income‚Äù, ‚Äúnet income‚Äù , ‚ÄúCapitalization of profit‚Äù, ‚Äúentrepreneurial income‚Äù, etc. The problem of how income from <span>entrepreneurial activity</span> in general, and what indicators of income in particular, to use when evaluating an enterprise and its effectiveness, has not been methodologically solved.  functioning.  Taking into account all the difficulties and uncertainties of evaluating the effectiveness, the most developed in terms of theory and methodology seem to be approaches for individual projects (investment project, modernization of production and introduction of new equipment, accounting systems, correction analysis, etc.) than the assessment of the enterprise as a whole. </p><p>  For example, to assess economic efficiency at the state level, a generalized indicator of <span>national gross income is used,</span> at the enterprise level, an indicator of profit, cash flow.  There are many private indicators: profitability, turnover, entrepreneurial income, investment efficiency, capital intensity, capital productivity, labor productivity and others. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to the evolution of information and economic development over the past decades, perceptions of effectiveness have continued to change.  One of the most significant changes is associated with the transition to market development of the economy.  With the market management method, many of the indicators used to measure effectiveness do not contradict each other.  However, it is very difficult to establish a general indicator.  In addition, it can be calculated by different methods. </p><p>  The concept of ‚Äúentrepreneurial income‚Äù and the income indicator itself are not provided for in the system of composition of industry <span>performance indicators</span> at the macro level in the regulatory documents of the Russian Federation.  The terms of the ‚ÄúRevenue Generation by Sector‚Äù account include indicators: gross <span>value added,</span> gross profit, labor remuneration, gross mixed income.  There is no indicator "entrepreneurial income" in the section "General economic indicators". </p><p>  In addition to the above indicators, in the ‚ÄúFinance and Credit‚Äù section of the statistical yearbook, it is additionally recommended to calculate articles: ‚Äúnet profit‚Äù, ‚Äúreturn on assets‚Äù and others when evaluating the performance of industries.  As a result, in managing the economy at the micro level, the concept of ‚Äúentrepreneurial income‚Äù and income, as indicators in assessing enterprises as quality, are not used as generalizing. </p><p>  As a result of this, when evaluating an enterprise, many indicators are used without emphasis on the generalizing character and without taking into account the particularities of the methodology for its calculation.  This indicates the need to introduce a basic comprehensive indicator that evaluates the effectiveness of the enterprise and takes into account interaction with all other interested parties that may generate income in the future.  Such an indicator is the maximization of the value of the enterprise by increasing income to all participants in production. </p><p>  The approach to the assessment of this income under the conditions of the market management expresses the ratio between the market value of the enterprise and the income received by the owners, employees of the enterprise and the state, plus the value of net assets that can generate income in the future through cash inflows. </p>
