  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The coolest apps for Android</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For the average user, the applications described below may seem complicated, somewhere uncomfortable and redundant.  But if you mastered the Android platform properly, have minimal knowledge of the English language and feel like a fish in water on this OS, then you probably noticed for yourself that you no longer have the usual utilities on Google Play.  I want something advanced and multifunctional. </p><p>  But on the same Google Play you can find some pretty cool phone apps on Android, which can offer their user much more familiar programs.  We‚Äôll just try to consider them.  As such, ‚Äúcoolness‚Äù will be determined by the complexity of the utility, but at the same time its increased practicality in a particular area. </p><p>  So, we present to your attention a list of the coolest applications for Android, which were distinguished by their high-quality component, as well as high performance, along with a lot of positive feedback from users.  All the software described below is free, so there should be no problems with testing. </p><p>  Top cool apps on Android are as follows: </p><ol><li>  IFTTT. </li><li>  App Cloner. </li><li>  Air Droid </li><li>  Avatan </li><li>  LastPass </li><li>  All-In-One ToolBox. </li><li>  Nova Launcher. </li></ol><p>  Consider each utility in more detail. </p><h2>  IFTTT </h2><p>  This is one of the coolest free Android apps for advanced users.  The utility is positioned by the developer primarily as a tool for automating the work of local programs and services that are synchronized with your gadget. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.phonecruncher.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ifttt application" class="if uuid-2624934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2624934.jpg"></div><p>  For example, the application itself can backup new images to Google Drive or turn on Wi-Fi as soon as you cross the threshold of your home.  That is, this software is a set of diverse and complex scenarios that are aimed at working with numerous services and third-party applications. </p><p>  You can choose from a variety of ready-made solutions or create your own individual scenarios.  Judging by the reviews, advanced users consider IFTTT one of the most useful and cool apps for Android. </p><h2>  App cloner </h2><p>  This utility allows you to copy, or rather, clone other programs.  For example, some users need to maintain two accounts in some social service, and the platform‚Äôs standard tools, alas, do not provide such capabilities.  This is where the cool application for the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù App Cloner comes to the rescue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="whysurfswim.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cloning application" class="if uuid-2624937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2624937.jpg"></div><p>  Software creates an exact copy of the selected program on your mobile gadget, and you can equally well use both the original and the clone.  The product is distributed under a free license, but the developer has provided an even more advanced modification with the Pro prefix, which supports a much larger list of applications, as well as significantly expanded functionality: setting passwords, setting proxies, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For regulars of social networks and lovers of forums, this cool application for Android will be a great help. </p><h2>  Air droid </h2><p>  This is mostly a service than a standalone program, but is distributed as a platform product.  A cool application for Android allows you to significantly increase the functionality and practicality of third-party services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gigaom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="advanced android apps" class="if uuid-2624935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2624935.jpg"></div><p>  Air Droid will help transfer files, and any data between a computer and a mobile gadget, without the participation of ubiquitous cables and wires.  In addition, the service allows you to view and send short messages together directly from your PC, as well as duplicate the picture from the smartphone‚Äôs camera to the monitor screen. </p><p>  The product is distributed in two versions - with a free and paid license.  In the first case, there are restrictions on the number of connected devices, and in the second they are completely removed.  There is no advertising either in the free or, naturally, in the paid version. </p><h2>  Avatan </h2><p>  This is perhaps the coolest photo processing application on Android.  The utility includes just a huge number of various filters and a list of functions that are inherent in desktop versions of editors, such as Photoshop or Corel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="android.mi9.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="graphics application" class="if uuid-2624938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2624938.jpg"></div><p>  Here you can crop images, adjust the color gamut, improve the quality of the picture in automatic and manual mode, add captions, apply some effects and much more.  Separately, it is worth mentioning about editing portraits.  In this section you can find all the necessary tools for working with photography: correcting skin defects, getting rid of ‚Äúred eyes‚Äù and even changing facial features, up to applying makeup. </p><p>  Cool photo application for Android allows you to edit images of any size, and without looking at the source.  The latter can be both pictures from the smartphone‚Äôs camera, and some professional drafts from a personal computer.  Here you can also create slide shows with collages and immediately send them to e-mail or directly to social networks, which is very convenient. </p><h2>  Software Features </h2><p>  The only, and for some critical minus, is the demanding software for the "stuffing" of your gadget.  Users often complain about friezes and lags when launching the application on budget and low-end devices with a small amount of RAM and a modest processor.  All the rest are completely satisfied with the available functionality, as well as the extensive features of the program. </p><p>  The software itself is distributed under a free license, but if you are seriously interested in graphics, then powerful and sensible filters with plugins will have to be purchased on the official developer resource.  The ‚Äúnaked‚Äù version copes well with collages and primary processing of photos, but for the rest, additions are needed more seriously. </p><h2>  Lastpass </h2><p>  If you use a whole bunch of various services on your mobile gadget, as well as accounts, then you must have encountered the problem of passwords and logins.  Remembering and inventing them is not so easy, especially if you do not want to be accessed by attackers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="phandroid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="password application" class="if uuid-2624939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2624939.jpg"></div><p>  This application will completely save you from such problems.  The utility generates the <span>most complex passwords</span> with logins and stores them securely in the system part of the smartphone.  If you still want to participate in the process, you can set the semi-automatic mode, where the correction of the input data is available. </p><p>  Perhaps the only independent and responsible step that rests with the user is to come up with a password and login to the LastPass service itself.  The application will do the rest itself and in the best possible way. </p><p>  The product is distributed completely free of charge and is practically devoid of ad units, which, by the way, cannot be called aggressive. </p><h2>  All-In-One ToolBox </h2><p>  The developer positions his application as an uninstaller for programs, but the functionality of the utility is noticeably wider.  Software allows you to get rid of unnecessary garbage in the shortest possible time and get rid of the gadget from it in just two clicks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ghacks.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sync application" class="if uuid-2624941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2624941.jpg"></div><p>  Here you can not only uninstall installed applications, including batch, but also clean the cache, transfer programs from the internal drive to an external memory card and vice versa, as well as edit startup.  The last item will be especially useful if your device starts to slow down and behave strangely.  The application will quickly save you from unnecessary programs in the system memory and speed up the gadget. </p><p>  The product is distributed completely free of charge, and as such there is no advertising here.  The program, in fact, advertises the developer and his other applications. </p><h2>  Nova launcher </h2><p>  "Nova Launcher" is a kind of software shell, which greatly expands the capabilities and functionality of the familiar Android interface.  For those who are bored with the familiar themes of the platform, this software will come in handy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="application shell" class="if uuid-2624940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2624940.jpg"></div><p>  After installing it and activating the program, your operating system will sparkle with new colors and visually become prettier in visual terms.  The application adds nice icons, widgets, certain animations, as well as convenient gestures. </p><p>  There is no need to delve into the program interface, because the main menu literally duplicates the regular menu, where themes and design elements are selected.  All you need to do is to choose your favorite shell and, if necessary, adjust the icons. </p><p>  The product is distributed free of charge, but those who want even more variety will have to fork out for additional topics and all kinds of animated ‚Äúchips‚Äù. </p>
