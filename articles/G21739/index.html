However, the progress of Russian society, as we see from history, directly depends on the quality of the specific creative creative process conducted in it.  What is institutionalization?  This organization is a developed civil society standardized passage of <span>social processes.</span>  The tool is the intellectual education developed by society - institutions with a fixed functioning scheme, staff structure, job descriptions.  Any sphere of public life - political, economic, legal, informational, cultural - in order to progress society is subject to generalization and streamlining of this process. </p><p>  Examples of institutionalization are, for example, a parliament created on the basis of meetings of citizens;  a school crystallized from the work of an outstanding artist, artist, dancer, thinker;  religion, originating from the sermons of the prophets.  Thus, institutionalization is, of course, in its essence, ordering. </p><p>  It is carried out as a replacement of the sets of individual behaviors with one - generalized, regulated.  If we talk about the constructive elements of this process, the social norms, rules, statuses and roles developed by sociologists are an operating mechanism of institutionalization that solves pressing social needs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  Russian institutionalization </h2><p>  It should be recognized that institutionalization in Russia in the new century is provided with a truly reliable economic foundation.  Increased production.  The political system has been stabilized: a ‚Äúworking‚Äù Constitution, a competent separation of the branches of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, and existing freedoms provide the basis for such a development. </p><p>  Historically, the institutionalization of the Russian government went through the following stages: </p><ul><li>  The first (1991‚Äì1998) - transitional from the Soviet regime. </li><li>  The second (1998‚Äì2004) is a change in the model of society from oligarchic to state-capitalist. </li><li>  The third (2005‚Äì2007) is the formation of effective social institutions. </li><li>  The fourth (since 2008) is the stage characterized by the effective participation of human capital. </li></ul>

But new principles of democracy are being introduced into society.  The institutionalization of power in Russia has led to the fact that political institutions are divided not only into powerful ones, but also into institutions of participation.  Currently, the role of the latter is growing.  They have a directed effect on certain aspects of the progress of society. </p><p>  The sphere of influence of the authorities is the entire population of the country.  The main political institutions include the state itself, civil society.  A feature of Russian institutionalization is its modeling, taking into account the interests of the country's development.  The blind importation of Western institutions is not always effective here, so institutionalization in Russia is a creative process. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Institutionalization and social institutions </h2><p>  Social institutions and institutionalization are important as universal tools for uniting the efforts of many people living in various regions of the federation for the optimal allocation of resources and their satisfaction with Russian society. </p><p>  For example, a state institution exercises power to meet the needs of the maximum number of citizens.  The Institute of Law regulates the relationship between people and the state, as well as individuals and society as a whole.  The Institute of Faith helps people gain faith, the meaning of life, truth. </p><p>  These institutions serve as the foundation of civil society.  They are generated by the needs of society, which are characterized by mass manifestation, the reality of existence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  From a formal point of view, a social institution can be represented as a ‚Äúrole system‚Äù based on the roles and statuses of various members of society.  At the same time, acting in a federal state, Russian institutions are doomed to combine the maximum set of traditions, customs, moral and ethical standards in order to gain maximum legitimacy.  The regulation and control of <span>public relations is</span> carried out with the help of institutions that comply with legal and social norms, developed taking into account these traditions and customs. </p>

    <p>  The distinguishing features of the institutions that help to determine their presence in the diverse social life of the country are the numerous permanent types of interactions, the regulation of both job duties and the order in which they are performed, and the presence of ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù specialists trained in the staff. </p><p>  What social institutions can be called the main in modern society?  Their list is known: family, healthcare, education, social protection, business, church, mass media.  Are they institutionalized?  As you know, in each of these areas in the government there is a corresponding ministry, which is the "top" of the corresponding branch of power that covers the regions.  In the regional system of executive power, appropriate departments are organized that control the direct executors, as well as the dynamics of the relevant social phenomena. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Political parties and their institutionalization </h2><p>  The institutionalization of political parties in its current interpretation began after the Second World War.  About its composition we can say that it includes the institutionalization of political and legal.  Political streamlines and optimizes the efforts of citizens to create parties.  Legal establishes the legal status and activities.  Important issues are also the problem of ensuring the financial transparency of party activities and the rules for its interaction with business and the state. </p>

    <p>  The activity and status of modern parties is regulated by law.  In Russia, the task of institutionalizing parties is resolved by the special federal law On Political Parties.  According to him, the party is formed in two ways: by the constituent congress or the transformation of the movement (public organization). </p><p>  The state regulates the activities of parties, namely rights and obligations, functions, participation in elections, financial activities, relations with state bodies, international and ideological activities. </p><p>  The restrictive requirements are: the all-Russian character of the party, the number of members (more than 50 thousand), non-ideological, non-religious, non-national character of this organization. </p><p>  Representation of parties in legislative bodies is ensured by associations of deputies (factions) elected in them. </p><p>  The legislation also defines the legal personality of parties: administrative, civil law, constitutional law. </p><h2></h2>

    <h2>  Institutionalization of Conflicts </h2><p>  Let's turn to the history.  The institutionalization of conflict as a social phenomenon finds its roots in the era of the emergence of capitalist relations.  Deprivation of land by large landowners, the transformation of their social status into proletarians, conflicts of the nascent class of the bourgeoisie and not wanting to abandon their positions of the nobility. </p><p>  In terms of conflict management, institutionalization is the resolution of two conflicts at once: industrial and political.  The conflict between employers and workers is regulated by the institution of a collective agreement, taking into account the unions' interests of wage workers.  The conflict for the right to control society is resolved by the mechanism of suffrage. </p><p>  Thus, the institutionalization of conflict is a safeguard tool for public consensus and a system of balances. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Public opinion and its institutionalization </h2><p>  Public opinion is a product of the interaction of various segments of the population, political parties, <span>social institutions, social</span> networks, and the media.  The dynamics of public opinion has increased significantly thanks to the Internet, interactivity, flash mobs. </p>

These organizations collect, study the existing and form a new public opinion.  It should be recognized that often such a study is biased and is based on biased samples.

    <p>  Unfortunately, a structured shadow economy distorts the concept of "institutionalization of public opinion."  In this case, the judgments and wishes of most people do not find embodiment in the real politics of the state.  Ideally, there should be a direct and clear connection between the expression of the will of the people and their implementation through parliament.  People‚Äôs representatives are obliged to serve public opinion by promptly adopting the necessary regulatory legal acts. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Social Work and Institutionalization </h2><p>  At the end of the 19th - beginning of the 20th centuries, in Western European society, in connection with industrialization and the involvement of a wide variety of population groups in <span>social production,</span> the institution of social work arose.  It was mainly about social benefits and assistance to the families of workers.  In our time, social work has acquired the features of reasonable altruistic help for people who are not sufficiently adapted to living conditions. </p><p>  Social work, depending on the subject of its implementation, is state, public and mixed.  State institutions include the Ministry of Social Policy, its regional departments, and local institutions serving socially disadvantaged people.  Help is provided to certain members of the community.  It is regular, carried out by full-time social workers and relies on budgetary funds.  Public social work is voluntary, carried out by volunteers and most often irregular.  As you understand, the institutionalization of social work gives the greatest effect with a mixed version, where both its state and social forms coexist. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Stages of institutionalization of the shadow economy </h2><p>  The process of institutionalization is phased.  Moreover, all stages of its passage are typical.  The root cause of this process and at the same time its nourishing basis is the need, for the implementation of which organized human actions are necessary.  Let's go in a paradoxical way.  Consider the stages of institutionalization in the formation of such a negative institution as the ‚Äúshadow economy‚Äù. </p><ul><li>  Stage I - the emergence of needs.  Disparate financial transactions (for example, the export of capital, cashing out) of individual economic entities (starting from the 90s of the last century) acquired a broad and systematic character. </li><li>  Stage II - the formation of certain goals and the ideology that serves them.  The goal can, for example, be formulated as follows: "Creating an economic system" invisible "to state control.  Creating a climate in society when those in power use the right of permissiveness. ‚Äù </li><li>  Stage III - the creation of social norms and rules.  These norms initially establish the rules that determine the "closeness" of power for control by the people (the "Byzantine system of power").  At the same time, ‚Äúnon-working‚Äù laws in society force economic entities to ‚Äúgo under the roof‚Äù of illegitimate structures that actually carry out a regulatory function lost by laws. </li><li>  Stage IV - the emergence of standard functions related to standards.  For example, the function of ‚Äúprotecting the business‚Äù of those in power by the security forces, the function of providing legal cover for raiding, cashing out finances under fictitious contracts, creating a system of ‚Äúkickbacks‚Äù with budget financing. </li><li>  Stage V - the practical application of norms and functions.  Gradually, shadow conversion centers are being created that are not advertised in the official press.  They work with certain customers steadily and long-term.  The percentage of conversion in them is minimal, they successfully compete with official converting organizations.  Another area: shadow salary, which is 15‚Äì80%. </li><li>  Stage VI - the creation of a system of sanctions that protect the criminal structure.  Government officials are privatized by capital to serve the business.  They, these officials, are developing "rules" punishing for "slander," for "moral damage."  Manual human rights and tax authorities are turning into a private "squad" of those in power. </li><li>  VII stage - shadow verticals of power.  Officials are turning their leverage into a resource for their entrepreneurial activity.  Power ministries and prosecutors are virtually isolated from the function of protecting the interests of the people.  Judges who ensure the policy of the regional authorities and for this ‚Äúfeed‚Äù it. </li></ul><p>  The process of institutionalization, as we see, is universal in terms of its main stages.  Therefore, it is crucial that the creative and legitimate social interests of society are exposed to it.  The institute of the shadow economy, worsening the quality of life of ordinary citizens, should be replaced by the institution of the rule of law. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Sociology and institutionalization </h2>

    <p>  Sociology studies society as a complex institutional system, taking into account its social institutions and the relationships between them, relations and communities.  Sociology shows society in terms of its internal mechanisms and the dynamics of their development, the behavior of large groups of people and, in addition, the interaction of man and society.  It provides and explains the essence of social phenomena and citizens' behavior, and also collects and analyzes primary sociological data. </p><p>  The institutionalization of sociology expresses the internal essence of this science, which organizes social processes with the help of statuses and roles, and is itself aimed at ensuring the vital functions of society.  Therefore, there is a phenomenon: sociology itself falls under the definition of an institution. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Stages of sociology </h2><p>  There are several stages in the development of sociology as a new world science. </p><ul><li>  The first stage belongs to the 30s of the XIX century, it consists in highlighting the subject and method of this science by the French philosopher Auguste Comte. </li><li>  The second is the ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù of scientific terminology, the acquisition of qualifications by specialists, the organization of operational scientific exchange of information. </li><li>  The third is positioning oneself as part of philosophers by ‚Äúsociologists‚Äù. </li><li>  Fourth - the creation of a sociological school and the organization of the first scientific journal "Sociological Yearbook".  The greatest merit belongs to the French sociologist Emil Durkheim at the University of Sorbonne.
