However, in 1942, anticipating an early victory, the Soviet command issued a directive on the offensive on all fronts.  Without careful preparation and replenishment of reserves, this led to a series of serious defeats for the Soviet Union in early 1942.  Military advantage was lost.  The parties were preparing for new battles.  One of the decisive battles was the Battle of Stalingrad.  Participants in the battle, who were there, called it "hell on Earth." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="battle of stalingrad battle participants" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1292877.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The strategic importance of Stalingrad </h2><p>  Many liberal and Western historians were skeptical of the defense of this city.  They believed that his defense was connected with the name of the Supreme Leader of the USSR and there were ambitions of two dictators, one of whom wanted to capture a settlement called the leader of the enemies, and the second threw all his strength to prevent this.  But the Battle of Stalingrad, the memoirs of the participants of which also refute this information, was of great strategic importance.  The fact is that the military power of the armies of the Second World War did not play any role without oil reserves.  Hitler was the only such country in Romania.  But her resources were clearly not enough.  Germany attempted to capture Egypt and the oil-rich Middle East.  For these purposes, the army group "Africa" ‚Äã‚Äãwas created, led by the legendary Rommel.  Her number was, of course, small, but comparable with the forces of the British troops, who did not let the Germans into these territories.  Italian geologists, fortunately for our history and country, did not find oil in Libya.  Perhaps history would have a different scenario, but, as you know, it has no <span>subjunctive mood.</span>  Thus, the only right decision of the German command was the abandonment of Moscow and the capture of Stalingrad, which opened the way to the Caucasus with its rich oil fields.  In addition, an important transport artery was blocked for the Soviet Union itself.  In Siberia, oil was not yet extracted at that time, so the loss of the Caucasus completely disarmed our army.  Therefore, one of the bloodiest battles in the history of mankind took place - the Battle of Stalingrad.  The participants in the battle very well understood the importance of the bridgehead.  Hence the sacrifice and heroism of Soviet fighters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="participants of the battle of stalingrad list" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1292876.jpg" width="600"></div>

Marshal of the Soviet Union Shaposhnikov insisted on strategic defense, passing in some sections of the front in a counterattack.  The main reserves had to be concentrated in the central direction in such a way that they could easily be transferred to the desired section of the front through the railway network.  This plan was based on the transport advantage of the USSR.  The railway network in the territory controlled by the Germans was constantly subjected to sabotage.  There was no possibility of a sharp change in the direction of a strategic strike.  In addition, the fascist troops did not have a second front and could concentrate all available reserves on the east. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Battle of Stalingrad" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1293185.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The disaster of 1942 </h2><p>  Marshal S.K. Timoshenko pointed out the need for a preemptive strike by the Southwestern and Southern Fronts.  At a meeting with Stalin, it was decided to advance in the south in the region of Kharkov and Crimea. </p><p>  But the attacks of the Soviet troops were unsuccessful, in addition, the German 11th Army in May launched a counterattack on the Kerch direction and literally crushed the Crimean Front.  The remaining troops were evacuated from the peninsula.  The attack in <span>the Kharkov region</span> was also unsuccessful <span>.</span>  The two largest fronts at the end of May were surrounded and on the verge of total annihilation.  German aviation completely dominated the air.  The situation in the country was catastrophically worsening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Battle of Stalingrad" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1292874.jpg" width="600"></div>

Directive No. 41 was issued, which indicated the need to tear away from the USSR a number of economic agricultural territories of Ukraine and the oil-bearing regions of the Caucasus. </p><p>  In June, the remaining troops of the two fronts began a retreat to prevent the threat of encirclement and complete destruction.  Now both sides were preparing for decisive battles in the Caucasus and in Stalingrad.  At this time, the Supreme Headquarters issued a number of decrees, which are controversially and sharply discussed by many historians.  Order No. 227 ‚ÄúNot a Step Back‚Äù and the decree on the creation of penal battalions.  In fairness, it is worth noting that the latter already existed in the German army and showed themselves well in battle.  So the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreation does not belong to Stalin, as many Western historians say about this. </p><h2>  Tactical Miscalculations <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="participants in the battle of Stalingrad live" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1292873.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The German leadership, delighted with success in the southern direction, made a strategic miscalculation.  The Nazis threw the main strike group into the Caucasus, and only one army of General von Paulus was allocated to Stalingrad.  In addition, a tank brigade was withdrawn from the group and also thrown into the Caucasus.  After successful battles, the Germans did not expect to see significant Russian resistance on this site.  But the calculation of the Supreme Headquarters - to concentrate significant reserves so that they could quickly be transferred to the desired direction - was fully justified.  The battle of Stalingrad began.  The participants of the battle tremblingly remembered her for the rest of their lives.  We will remember. </p><h2>  Participants of the Battle of Stalingrad.  List of heroes </h2><p>  Given the severity and duration of this military operation, several armies, tank and air divisions were involved in it.  Of course, we will not be able to list in a short article those who saw with their own eyes a terrible sight called the Battle of Stalingrad.  Participants in the battle will never be forgotten in the memory of generations.  Imagine only a few of the fallen heroes of this meat grinder.  We will be glad if any of the descendants sees their illustrious relatives: </p><p>  Agarkov Pavel Demyanovich; </p><p>  Vorobiev Mikhail Dmitrievich; </p><p>  Kolesnichenko Andrey Alexandrovich; </p><p>  Smyslov Alexey Maksimovich. </p><p>  These and other participants in the Battle of Stalingrad, dead or alive, will always remain heroes for our country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children participants of the battle of Stalingrad" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1292872.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "There is no land beyond the Volga" </h2><p>  On August 23, 1942, the Germans fiercely bombed the city.  Beat from all the guns.  A powerful industrial center has turned into ruins.  The two-day defense of the city began.  The Germans realized their miscalculation and threw more and more forces to Paulus' reinforcements.  But it was too late.  The Soviet command and ordinary soldiers vowed to defend the city at all costs.  Victory in battle meant victory in the entire Great Patriotic War.  Of course, before its end there was still a lot of time, lost lives, high-profile victories and annoying defeats.  But the defeat of large German forces here proved to be psychologically crucial in the entire military campaign.  It is no coincidence that American and British politicians even issued commemorative medals and diplomas dedicated to this event. </p><h2>  Heroes will be remembered forever <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the participants of the Stalingrad battle of the USSR" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1292871.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The battle of Stalingrad became a difficult test for the entire Soviet people.  The names of the participants will be presented in this article.  Raguzov Sergey Alexandrovich, was born in 1922.  In Stalingrad, he was the commander of a mortar platoon.  He was awarded the gratitude personally signed by Stalin "For personal courage and courage."  His platoon stopped a powerful tank attack.  The commander himself ran into one of them face to face, but was not at a loss and threw a couple of Molotov cocktails.  The tank exploded in a fire.  In this attack, a platoon of Raguzov destroyed 4 heavy vehicles, several dozen foot soldiers.  In total, about 10 tanks were advancing.  The rest after the losses receded. </p><h2>  Tulyakov Ivan Antipovich </h2><p>  Many heroes participating in the battle of Stalingrad died the death of the brave.  The USSR, and modern Russia, has never forgotten its heroes.  I would like to recall Ivan Antipovich Tulyakov, a war correspondent who died during the crossing of the Volga.  In his last note, Ivan Antipovich wrote: "It is better to be a wife, mother, child of a dead hero than a surviving coward."  And so all the defenders of the city thought. </p><h2>  Churanov Victor Vasilievich </h2><p>  Children participating in the Battle of Stalingrad remember another hero of these days - Viktor Vasilievich Churanov.  The participant of the defense of Moscow, the defense of Stalingrad, the capture of Warsaw was awarded two medals "For Courage".  As a tank driver, he recklessly drove his car at the enemy, not sparing his life.  His crew knocked out several German cars both near Moscow and near Stalingrad.  One of the few surviving these terrible days of the war from the first to the last day. </p><h2>  Shelyvanov Vasily Andreevich </h2><p>  The Germans threw 18 cars against the battery of Vasily Andreevich.  Defenders, showing heroism, met the Nazis with powerful shelling, destroying 4 cars, several more were hit, but retreated.  The Germans, who did not expect such a rebuff, retreated. </p><p>  Here is a partial list of the characters presented in the article.  Unfortunately, there are many dead in this terrible war.  Let's not forget their names. </p>
