Lumia 1520: Owner Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 1520 smartphone was released in November 2013.  But it still does not lose its relevance.  After all, Nokia or Microsoft have not yet released a smartphone for the Windows Phone operating system with such characteristics.  What is the secret of his popularity?  Why so much praise Lumia 1520 customer reviews?  Read on and we will answer all these questions. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Here's what comes in the standard kit when you purchase: </p><ul><li>  smartphone itself; </li><li>  Charger; </li><li>  user's manual; </li><li>  usb cable (as with many Nokia phones, it is intended not only for data transfer, but also for charging); </li><li>  headset. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="1520 lumia" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/981999.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  Well, the case for the Lumia 1520 and other accessories will have to be purchased separately.  Their range is surprising in its variety, and thanks to a strong Bluetooth transmitter, wireless headphones, speakers, chargers and other devices work quickly and reliably. </p><h2>  Case and dimensions </h2><p>  The 1520 Lumia smartphone looks large, it is much larger than the iPhone 5 and rises even above the iPhone 6. With dimensions of 16.3 x 8.5, it hardly fits in your jeans pocket.  And even if so, then it will have to be strengthened by the seamstress, since the weight of the smartphone is 206. Even the Galaxy Note 4 is 30 g lighter and 1 cm shorter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A visual comparison of different Lumiy models is shown in the photo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumia 1520 price" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/981993.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But with all this, the 1520 Lumia lies gracefully in the hand and does not cause a ‚Äúcobblestone‚Äù feeling.  Affects its subtlety - only 8.7 mm and the smoothness of the body.  From it, only a little protrudes the camera. </p><p>  The case is made of durable monolithic polycarbonate plastic.  Corning <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 2 is Lumia 1520 glass. With such components, this smartphone should survive several falls.  But sharp corners can crack during operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="case for lumia 1520" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/981994.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the side of the case there is a slot for a nanoSIM card, which is even smaller than microSIM, next to it there is a slot for a microSD card, which will increase the memory capacity to as much as 96 GB. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 1520 specifications" class="if" height="239" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/982002.jpg" width="450"></div>  The headphone jack (standard 3.5 mm) is on top of the case, and mini-USB is on the bottom.  There, but on a sloping edge, there is a speaker.  Thanks to this, even when the smartphone is on the back, the sound is not muffled. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 1520 windows" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/981995.jpg" width="600"></div>

This enhances the impression of rigor and solidity, but is not always convenient for the user. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  After the launch of <span>Samsung Galaxy Note 4</span> and LG G4, it can be argued that smartphone manufacturers began to compete with each other not in the power of processors and camera pixels, but in the diagonals of screens and their brightness. </p><p>  It is important not only what tasks your device can perform, but also how much it fits the information on the display and how it shows.  After all, users are accustomed to watching movies in HD-quality, comfortable work on the Internet and dynamic games. </p><p>  The Nokia 1520 Lumia accepts the challenge and, with its dimensions, can claim the title of phablet or tabletphone (a smartphone with characteristics similar to a tablet).  The model has a 6-inch capacitive LCD IPS screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels.  Nokia's ClearBlack technology provides black brightness regardless of lighting, and the ultra-sensitive sensor allows you to work with your smartphone even with gloves on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 1520 windows 10" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/981996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Stuffing" Lumia 1520 </h2><p>  The characteristics of the smartphone are impressive: the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor with a frequency of 2.2 GHz gives this monster the necessary power, and 2 GB of RAM ensures fast and stable operation of any application. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The model has 32 GB of internal memory, it supports memory cards with a capacity of up to 64 GB. </p><h2>  Interface </h2><p>  What operating system is the Lumia 1520 smartphone designed for?  Windows Phone 8 has shown itself in all its glory on this powerful device.  If all previous attempts to use this interface on smartphones looked like miserable copies of Android, then in this model the innovative tiled design of the OS was really liked by users. </p><p>  In addition to convenient applications, you can call the voice assistant "Cortana", which can make calls, search the Internet and other functions.  Such familiar services as DropBox, Pandora or social networks - Instagram, Tumblr and many others, are also available to smartphone users.  The list of applications is constantly updated. </p>

    <p>  Some of the inconveniences that annoyed users, such as the need to open Settings to simply turn Wi-fi on or off, were fixed with the Windows 8.1 update.  As it turned out later, this is not the limit of possibilities for the Lumia 1520. Windows 10 can be installed on this smartphone, although it is not in the official list of models supporting the new operating system.  The latter was perplexing for many.  Indeed, Lumia more than meets the minimum requirements for RAM and disk space, and even the leading developer, Microsoft corporate vice president Joe Belfiore, demonstrated the operation of the new OS on this smartphone.  The specialist himself, in response to these arguments, explained that not all models can guarantee the stable operation of Windows 10, therefore, to avoid inconvenience, it is better not to rush to install it on your device until the company includes it in the list of compatible with Windows 10. </p><h2>  How long does the battery last? </h2><p>  Nokia Lumia 1520 features such that without a strong battery it will not work for a long time.  With such a large and bright screen, a 3400 mAh battery is not an overkill, but a necessity.  It charges slowly - about 15-20% per hour, while you should not expect that its working time is infinite.  The smartphone will quietly work in normal mode during the day.  But after that it will have to be charged again.  For example, in Flight mode, the battery weakened by 17% overnight.  But while watching a 90-minute film as 720 pixels (at maximum screen brightness), the battery charge remained at a little less than 84%. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  This is a separate pride in the Nokia Lumia 1520. The 20-megapixel matrix allows you to create amazingly clear and vivid photos. </p><p>  Shooting settings are much wider than most smartphones: ISO, shutter speed, white balance, exposure and others.  But all of them can be turned off by going to the "Auto" mode.  Users argue that with him, too, great shots are obtained. </p><p>  In addition to autofocus, there is a manual focus, which is especially convenient for macro photography.  Exposure to 4 seconds allows you to take beautiful pictures of objects in the dark, such as cars on the road or the moon.  But in order for the frame not to blur, it is best to work with a tripod. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 1520 specifications" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/981992.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An interesting feature is that the smartphone offers to save all images with two quality levels: 16 megapixels and 5 megapixels.  The latter occupy a much smaller amount of memory, which is convenient for social networks and mailing, and it is their smartphone that will show you in the gallery.  The former will be available only for viewing on a computer. </p><p>  In addition, there is support for the RAW format, which Nokia calls DNG.  It allows you to do what is called "digital negativity" - completely uncompressed and unprocessed images that give the photographer maximum options for editing them.  But keep in mind that you need a lot of free memory to work with it, so you have to immediately get a 64 GB flash card. <br>  In the ‚ÄúPhoto‚Äù mode, you can use double zoom, and in the ‚ÄúVideo‚Äù mode, and even more - four times. </p><p>  Also, the smartphone boasts 4 microphones on the back.  They allow you to record the sound coming from the subject, avoiding noise from the "operator". </p><h2>  How much does the Nokia Lumia 1520 cost? </h2><p>  The price of the device at the beginning of sales was about 30 thousand rubles.  After 3 months, it decreased to 25 thousand rubles.  But since almost 2 years have passed since then, today the price for Nokia Lumia 1520 is even lower.  A smartphone will have to pay about 21-23 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Customer opinion </h2><p>  On the Lumia 1520 smartphone, reviews are mostly positive.  Many note that at first its dimensions seem uncomfortable, but you quickly get used to them.  Although using the device with one hand is still difficult, for example, answering a call while driving will be quite problematic.  But this is a drawback of all models of such dimensions.  But the smartphone captivates with its sense of strength and reliability with a fairly small thickness. </p><p>  Users praise the fast and smooth operation of applications.  The pre-installed Microsoft Office suite has greatly simplified the lives of many business people. </p><p>  The tiled design of the start page allows you to get all the necessary information at a glance: call log, calendar, weather forecast and even a gallery from your photos, all without having to open separate applications.  Of course, its contents can be customized. </p><p>  Voice GPS is clear and loud, with it you can safely refuse all old devices. </p><p>  The battery also pleases - it is enough for a day of active use. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 1520 specifications" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/982147.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Model flaws </h2><p>  The censure caused the use of nanoSIM cards, as it made it difficult for users with old cards to switch to a new smartphone. </p><p>  But most of all, buyers were disappointed that not all applications that they are used to on Android or iOS can be found on Windows Phone.  Today, this flaw is almost eliminated.  But if some applications are vital for you, then before buying, check if there are any analogues for this smartphone. </p><p>  In isolated cases, users had problems either with a microphone, then with a battery, or with a screen that he himself ‚Äúpressed‚Äù the buttons.  But it cannot be said that these complaints are systemic in nature, and no one is safe from marriage in the party. </p><p>  Much more perplexing is the use of Gorilla Glass version 2, which is less resistant to damage than the 3rd version already available at the time of the release of the model. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Smartphone Nokia Lumia 1520 has occupied its niche in the market.  Its customers are people who are willing to give up a little on the convenience of carrying the device, instead of wearing both a phone and a tablet.  And it turned out that this is a fairly large category of users. </p><p>  Excellent features, a camera that will successfully replace a digital camera, a user-friendly interface to which useful updates regularly come out - the Nokia 1520 can offer a lot to even the most demanding user.  And all this at an adequate price.  Therefore, she does not lose the love of her current owners and even finds new fans. </p>
