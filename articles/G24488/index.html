The conical nuraga towers, which were built over 2 millennia ago, are the main attractions of Sardinia.  The constructions were erected by an unknown people who lived here before the invasion of the <span>Roman army.</span>  These people knew how to work with metal, and they were also well-versed in all the tricks of construction and architecture.  Today, this tower complex is in a dilapidated state, but it is still of great interest to each of us. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sardinia attractions" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/264339.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is impossible to imagine the sights of Sardinia without the <span>Costa Smeralda</span> coast <span>,</span> which means ‚ÄúEmerald Coast‚Äù.  In this place are the <span>most expensive hotels</span> and boutiques of the region.  Here, yacht clubs, <span>helipads,</span> chic restaurants and other establishments have their place, in which you can leave all your fortune in one day.  Only not every tourist can get here.  The coast, whose length is 55 kilometers, is a matter of pride for local residents. </p><p>  As mentioned above, the island of Sardinia is famous not only for human labors.  The sights of nature are no less interesting and exciting, and among them it is worth highlighting the cave Is Zuddas.  This mysterious grotto was formed from <span>stalactites and stalagmites</span> hundreds of millions of years ago, which is proved by monuments of fine art and literature, as well as archaeological research.  The intricate figures of natural architecture in this cave have been attracting tourists from all over the planet for many centuries. </p>

    <p>  The small town of Cagliari, located on the island, is the center of interweaving of ancient Italian and Middle Eastern culture.  Sights of Sardinia, located here, were built by both locals and Phoenicians, who came from the Eastern Mediterranean.  You can examine them literally in half a day, but remember these works of architecture for life ... </p><p>  But the small village of Porto Torres is famous throughout Europe for one of the oldest and best-preserved monuments of the Romanesque era.  We are talking about the Basilica of San Gavino, which stores the most valuable sculptures of that time.  The sights of Sardinia contained there are sculptures of holy martyrs, images of religious characters and other church artifacts.  By itself, this building is already an important monument, a symbol of the era of the Early Middle Ages. </p><p>  In conclusion, it should be noted that the cleanest beaches, fresh air, the many secrets of history and the <span>indescribable beauty of</span> buildings - these are all Sardinia.  The sights of this region cannot be fully described; they need to be admired ... </p>
