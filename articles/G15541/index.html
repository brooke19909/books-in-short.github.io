Despite this, they have become a very popular product due to the comfort that they provide to the user.  At the same time, the card is a means of payment and a tool that ensures the safety of your funds.  Even if the plastic is stolen or lost, you can not worry about your money in the account - just block the card. </p><p>  Each bank has a set of cards that it can issue to its customers.  Especially a wide choice for those who use the services of an institution such as Sberbank.  The largest bank in the Russian Federation has a really large selection of instruments.  Therefore, in this article we will consider the cards of Sberbank, types and cost of service.  In parallel, we will try to explain why it is better to use one or another card. </p>

    <h2>  Credit cards </h2><p>  Let's start with such a popular means of payment as usual credit cards.  This is a very convenient form of issuing loans for a short period mainly for the purchase of goods and services.  Their work scheme is simple: a person receives it with a certain credit limit (for example, Sberbank credit cards, the types and costs of servicing of which we discuss in this article, can be with a limit of 120 thousand rubles or more).  As soon as the borrower wants to make a purchase, he simply pays with a card, due to which he also receives additional bonuses in the form of some kind of discounts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  According to the conditions of Sberbank, the user must pay a certain rate on the card (for example, 25 percent per annum).  If payment does not occur within the allotted time, penalties will be charged.  It should also be noted that in addition to interest on the use of credit funds, the user must regularly pay a fee for servicing the card. </p><h2>  Types of Sberbank Special Credit Cards </h2><p>  All cards of Sberbank, the types and cost of servicing of which varies depending on the type, are intended for issue to certain groups of customers.  For example, Youth cards are designed for a young audience of borrowers.  These are <span>Visa and MasterCard</span> (optional) with a service cost of 750 rubles.  To receive them, you need to confirm the income.  The amount of the credit limit is 200 thousand rubles, the interest rate is 33.9%. </p>

    <p>  For those who would like to take a loan without delay, there are so-called instant cards.  The credit limit for them is lower - only 120 thousand rubles, and the interest rate is 25.9%.  To receive it, only a passport is required from the borrower, the service is free. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Classic credit cards </h2><p>  Of course, there are also classic cards in the bank's product line.  These are credit cards that do not provide any additional difficulties for the client - everything is extremely simple.  The credit limit is 600 thousand rubles, the borrower is obliged to confirm the income, the cost of servicing varies from 0 to 750 rubles per year (it depends on whether you are a regular customer of the bank or not).  There are two types of classic Sberbank cards, types and cost of services, the photos of which we provided - Visa Classic and MasterCard Standard.  Each of them provides, as indicated on the bank's website, the optimal set of services.  There is everything that a client may need, and nothing more.  Yes, and do not need to overpay. </p><h2>  Partner Credit Cards </h2><p>  There are still Sberbank cards, the types and costs of services (reviews confirm this) which differ from the basic set.  These are partner cards.  At the moment, there are only two of them - this is a card of the ‚ÄúGive Life‚Äù fund and a card of ‚ÄúAeroflot‚Äù.  The first organization is engaged in the transfer of funds received from customers for services to the accounts of sick children.  The second allows you to not only <span>borrow money</span> and pay with them for purchases, but also to accumulate bonus miles for traveling around the world in the future. </p><h2>  Debit cards </h2><p>  There are other Sberbank cards, the types and cost of servicing of which differ from credit cards.  These are debit ones, the essence of which is not in obtaining borrowed funds from the bank, but in depositing their money into the account. </p>

    <p>  The advantages of such cards are many.  Firstly, it is a convenient means of payment.  Thus, you can, for example, transfer money to people as payment for services or goods, as well as accept finances in the same way.  Secondly, the card allows you to save money.  Here is a simple example: if you lost your wallet, it would be naive to expect that you can return the money left there.  Whereas if you lose a card, it‚Äôs enough to block it and get a new one.  Thirdly, <span>debit cards</span> and bank accounts allow you to increase funds.  Financial institutions pay a certain percentage for keeping your money with them.  It varies depending on the type of card. </p><h2>  For payment </h2><p>  Well, here are the main types of bank debit cards available at Sberbank.  The first category is those intended for settlements, such as Visa / MasterCard Virtual, prepaid Visa Classic, as well as Momentum instant issuance cards.  The first is ideal for paying for purchases on the Internet - the client does not even need to receive it in its present form, it can only operate with card data;  the contents of such a card will cost 60 rubles per year.  A prepaid plastic card is designed to give it to a person instead of a cash amount.  With it, he will be able to pay for any goods in the future.  As for the Momentum card, it is notable for its quick design, that is, a simplified procedure. </p>

    <h2>  Other species </h2><p>  There is also a youth card, 10 percent of which goes in the form of bonuses to a special account, and a social one for pensioners.  The latter has some features.  Such Sberbank cards (types and costs of service for pensioners differ) offer the following conditions.  The service here is free.  On the card, you can easily issue a pension withdrawal.  In addition, the bank charges 3.5% per annum on the amount that is on the account. </p><p>  Recall that all cards of Sberbank (types of cards issued, conditions for receipt) are presented in detail on the official website, so you can get the most relevant information there. </p><p>  I would also like to note the cards are classic.  These are Visa Classic and <span>MasterCard Standard</span> (as is the case with credit).  Their cost is quite high - 750 rubles per year.  An alternative may be <span>Visa Electron</span> (also available for issuing a Sberbank card).  The types and cost of ‚ÄúVisa Electron‚Äù services are as follows: there is only 1 card here (there is simply nothing to choose from);  the service is relatively inexpensive - only 300 rubles.  For these funds, the user receives a basic range of banking services. </p>

    <p>  Finally, we note the elite cards for status users.  These are Gold and Platinum from Visa and Mastercard.  Their maintenance costs from 3 to 15 thousand rubles a year, since these products have advanced options (protection of purchases, insurance, support abroad and so on). </p>
