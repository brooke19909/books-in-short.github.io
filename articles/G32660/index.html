    <p>  North Korea is a country of "triumphant socialism."  It has a special political system and an ideology peculiar only to this country, which is based on the construction of socialism.  This ideology is called Juche in honor of its founder, the first president of the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea, Kim Il Sung.  In addition, the son of Kim Il Sung Kim Jong Il has great authority and respect.  Today this peculiar country is completely and completely connected and depends on the names of these great leaders.  All North Koreans worship and greatly honor these people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The capital of North Korea is the city of Pyongyang.  It is the political, economic and cultural center of the country.  In addition, the city of Pyongyang is a visiting card of North Korea.  The capital of North Korea is significantly different from other cities in this socialist country.  The population always walks in neat, clean and elegant clothes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="travel to north korea" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8904/18726.jpg" width="400"></div>  On the streets you will not see garbage.

    <p>  There are never traffic jams on the streets of Pyongyang, as there are very few cars here.  Along the roads you will see many kilometers of flower strips planted by hand.  The capital of North Korea is always filled with the festive mood and joy of its inhabitants, mass organized processions and dances of young people in the squares.  In this country, a measured, calm life predominates; crime is almost completely absent here. </p><p>  However, few can get to North Korea, as the country is closed to foreign tourists.  The entry of visitors into it is controlled by the authorities.  It is almost impossible to visit her tourists from the United States and Israel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trip to north korea" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8904/18727.jpg" width="375"></div>  Travelers from other countries are allowed to visit North Korea, however, it is given with great difficulty.  If you did happen to get here, then your trip takes place under constant supervision and accompanied by local guides.  One of them is a guide in the country, the other performs a control and protective function.

    <p>  A special political regime affects the daily life of the population, as well as tourists.  Tourists cannot move freely in North Korea, only accompanied by guides.  In addition, mobile phones, propaganda literature, and more cannot be brought into the country.  It should be noted that you will not find Internet access in this country, as well as ATMs.  So, before making a trip to this unusual republic, which is closed to others, familiarize yourself with the rules of stay and life of its population. </p>
