There is everything in order to have a great vacation.  The magnificent nature, favorable climate, the sights of Honduras - all this will captivate even the most experienced traveler.  To become a tourist Mecca for Russians, only remoteness prevents the country.  So, a flight from Moscow to Tegucigalpa takes at least 28 hours. </p><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  To understand where Honduras is, just remember the location of the two Americas on the map.  In the very center of the isthmus connecting the continents, it is not difficult to find the name of the country.  From the west, its shores are washed by the waters of the Pacific Ocean, and from the east - by the Caribbean Sea.  The geographical neighbors of the state are El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua.  Local time is 9 hours behind Moscow. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="15.199999" data-lng="-86.24190499999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="4"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/8/1/4/4814.png"></div><h2>  Nature and climate </h2><p>  Most of the country is a mountainous plateau.  An exception is the coastal lowlands and valleys of the rivers Ulua, Aguan, Patuka.  The ridges formed by lavas and metaphorical rocks are picturesque.  Peak Cerro Las Minas is considered the most recognizable peak of Honduras.  A photo of a natural landmark towering 2,870 meters adorns country brochures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="hondurastravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Peak Serra Las Minas" class="if uuid-2573264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2573264.jpg"></div><p>  Honduran plateaus are covered in rainforests.  Deciduous and coniferous trees, shrubs, various types of vines grow in the jungle.  The fauna of forests is extremely rich.  The jungle is inhabited by a variety of animals: from alligators to panthers and exotic armadillos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.transat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Honduras nature" class="if uuid-2573288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2573288.jpg"></div><p>  The country is located in the tropical zone.  Therefore, the climate is mild.  Even in mountainous regions, the average annual temperature is about +20 ¬∞ C.  The rainy season begins in September and lasts until the end of January. </p><h2>  State structure, population, religion </h2><p>  The constitution states that Honduras is a unitary state, in which the supreme power belongs to the president.  A senior official also heads the cabinet.  Legislation is entrusted to the deputies of the National Congress.  The mandate of the president and parliamentarians is valid for 4 years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="flagdatabase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flag and coat of arms of Honduras" class="if uuid-2573307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2573307.jpg"></div><p>  The territory of the state is divided into 18 departments.  The largest cities are the capital of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula with 1,680,000 and 1,300,000 inhabitants, respectively.  The total population of the country exceeds 8,000,000 people, among which mulattoes predominate.  Indians account for no more than 7%. </p><p>  Contrary to prejudice, not all people profess Catholicism.  There are many Protestants.  Ethnic Indians continue to adhere to traditional beliefs.  Spanish is recognized as the official language. </p><h2>  Features of the economy </h2><p>  Less than half of Hondurans live in cities.  As a result, the main income to the state treasury comes from agriculture.  Budget fullness depends on the prices of traditional export products: coffee, bananas, cigars, palm oil, seafood, beef.  Tourists who come to enjoy the sights of Honduras help to create a positive balance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nvmvs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One lempira note" class="if uuid-2573313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2573313.jpg"></div><p>  Industry is poorly developed.  The main suppliers of goods to the country's markets are companies from the USA, Mexico, Canada, Brazil.  The local currency, named after the Native American leader, is extremely weak.  Today, 24 lempiers give for one American dollar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Historical note: main events, interesting facts </h2><p>  The history of the <span>country of Honduras</span> is eventful.  Once upon a time, paya, lenka, and other primitive tribes inhabited by Maya Indians inhabited these lands.  After the exodus of the representatives of ancient civilization to Yucatan, everything returned to normal. </p><p>  Europeans appeared here in the first third of the 16th century.  Aborigines without reverence reacted to the conquistadors.  The leader of Lempira managed to organize armed resistance, brutally crushed by the conquerors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dontstopliving.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Francisco Morasan - the hero of the national liberation struggle" class="if uuid-2573345" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2573345.jpg"></div><p>  For almost 300 years, Honduras remained a <span>colony of Spain.</span>  The state succeeded in freeing itself from the "guardianship" of the mother country only in 1823. Following the declaration of independence, the formation of political parties began, the national bourgeoisie appeared, and the class stratification of society accelerated.  The formation of statehood was difficult.  The country survived in the 19th century 12 civil conflicts, constantly fought with its neighbors. </p><p>  The next century was also not calm.  Honduras has gone the way traditional for most Latin American states: from the military junta to moderate liberalism.  The geographical position has made the country an object of US interest.  Today, it is, in fact, a satellite of continental hegemon. </p><h2>  The main attractions of Honduras </h2><p>  Tourist attraction to the country is provided by man-made monuments created by several civilizations and delightful creations of nature.  Several interesting places are worth mentioning separately. </p><p>  To the south-east of San Pedro Sula is a unique archaeological site - the ruins of the ancient Mayan Indians polis.  One and a half millennia ago, Kopan was a prosperous, densely populated city.  Huge palaces were erected for powerful local rulers.  Majestic temples dedicated to the terrible Indian gods.  Some buildings are well preserved, despite the tropical climate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruins of the city of Copan" class="if uuid-2573362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2573362.jpg"></div><p>  Tegucigalpa, proclaimed the capital of the state in 1880, is considered a metropolis by local standards.  The city has always played an important role in the life of the country, therefore there are many historical monuments and beautiful buildings on its streets.  Tourists must see the gilded altar of the Cathedral of San Miguel, the <span>medieval church of</span> St. Francis, the equestrian statue of the national hero F. Morasan.  Of great interest to visitors are the expositions of the National Art Gallery and Tegucigalpa museums. </p><div class="photo" data-original="elevation.maplogs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tegucigalpa Night Panorama" class="if uuid-2573371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2573371.jpg"></div><p>  A safari in the highlands of La Tigra will be an unforgettable adventure.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãunique natural recreation is about 7.5 thousand hectares.  The slopes of the mountain ranges here are covered with pristine jungle.  Their inhabitants - ocelots, monkeys, cougars - are not at all afraid of humans.  Among the representatives of the flora of local forests, it is worth highlighting the erythrin and ceiba trees that the Mayans worshiped. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sciencestruck.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="La Tigra National Park" class="if uuid-2573384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2573384.jpg"></div><p>  The ancient capital of the state - Comayagua has prepared a feast for architecture admirers.  On its streets preserved monuments of architecture of different eras.  La Merced Temple and the convent of St. Francis, for example, were erected in the 16th century, while the buildings of the city‚Äôs cathedral and the bishop‚Äôs residence were built a century later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hondurastravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Cathedral in Camayaguo" class="if uuid-2573430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2573430.jpg"></div><p>  The pearl in the necklace of the natural attractions of Honduras are Taulabe Caves.  So far, cavers explored only 12 km of mysterious underground labyrinths.  Tourists are offered to go along a special 400-meter route.  Nature has worked here wonderfully.  Rocky ledges of an intricate configuration, grottoes, stalactites and stalagmites create a fantastic surroundings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ddbrewery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Taulabe Caves" class="if uuid-2573401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2573401.jpg"></div><p>  Another miraculous monument that is shown to all tourists is the Pulhapanzak waterfall.  The spectacle is truly enchanting.  The waters of a mountain river are thrown down through several rocky terraces.  Myriads of spray shimmer in the sun, creating a fantastic halo around. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reddit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pulhapanzak Waterfall" class="if uuid-2573414" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2573414.jpg"></div><h2>  Popular resorts </h2><p>  The lovers of relaxation on the beaches of the resorts of Honduras will delight.  Prices for food and accommodation are low, and the level of service is quite high. </p><p>  Especially popular with tourists are recreations in the vicinity of the city of Tela.  The coast here is covered with fine white sand.  Jeanette Kawas National Park is nearby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Puerto Cortes beaches" class="if uuid-2573448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92123/2573448.jpg"></div><p>  The resort town of Puerto Cortes is famous for its magnificent beaches and carnival.
