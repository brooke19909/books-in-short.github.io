Its deserts, rivers and lakes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Turan lowland is one of the most interesting regions of Kazakhstan and <span>Central Asia.</span>  Once upon a time, a huge sea stretched on this place, the modern remains of which are the Caspian and the <span>Aral Sea.</span>  Currently, it is a huge plain, the territory of which is occupied by the deserts of Karakum, Kyzylkum and others. </p><h2>  Where is the Turan lowland </h2><p>  The nature of this territory largely depends on the geographical location.  The Turan lowland is located on the territory of three sovereign states - Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.  In the north-south direction, the lowland extends for 1.6 thousand km, and in the west-east direction - for 1 thousand km, occupying a huge area. </p><p>  The name of the region comes from the word "Turan", "country of tours."  This name is recorded in the holy book of Zoroastrianism - the Avesta, which dates back to 1000 BC.  Researchers suggest that the ‚Äútours‚Äù are steppe arias. </p><p>  The region is rich in minerals (oil, gas, gold, sulfur, etc.), livestock and <span>irrigation agriculture</span> are widely developed <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Relief </h2><p>  The relief of the Turan lowland is mostly fairly gentle, the height differences are relatively small.  However, here the plains alternate with numerous ups and downs.  The lowest point of the lowland is the <span>Karagie Depression, the</span> absolute height of which is minus 132 meters (located below sea level), and the highest point is Mount Tamdytau (0.922 km). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the turan lowland" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1178721.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The average height of the region is 200-300 meters above sea level.  The most elevated region of the Turan lowland is the Kyzyl Kum desert with an average absolute height of 0.388 km.  In ancient times, the Turan Lowland was the bottom of a vast inland sea, the remains of which in our time are the Aral and <span>Caspian Seas.</span> </p><p>  The Kyzylkum and Karakum deserts are covered with sand with a pronounced aeolian landscape.  Here you can admire the lumpy sands, dunes and dunes. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The climate of the region, which is sharply continental and desert, is determined by its geographical features.  Firstly, the Turan lowland is located in the heart of the continent.  At a considerable distance from the oceans and moist air currents.  Secondly, from the southern and south-western directions, the Turan lowland is limited by mountain barriers, which weaken the circulation of air masses. </p><p>  All this makes the region extremely arid and largely covered by deserts.  Moreover, in the direction from north to south, the amount of precipitation tends to decrease, and the amplitude of temperature fluctuations increases. </p><h2>  The river system of the district </h2><p>  Due to climatic characteristics, the river network of the region is extremely poorly developed, it is mainly represented <span>by the Syr Darya</span> and Amu Darya rivers, which flow into the Aral Sea.  It, in turn, is actually a lake of the Turan lowland.  Moreover, in the last century, due to the active development of agriculture, the flow of the Amu Darya has greatly decreased, and the Syr Darya has practically stopped, which caused the Aral Sea to gradually dry out and a lot of environmental problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turan lowland river" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1178723.jpg" width="600"></div>  The river of the Turan lowland Syr Darya divides the entire territory into two unequal parts - northern and southern.  In addition to two fairly full-flowing rivers, on the Turan lowland in the direction of southeast - northwest lies the dried up riverbed of the Uzboy River.

And the sand dunes are called Ak-kum ("white sand").  Karakum is also known for the fact that in its sands a whole Temple city of Gonur-Depe was found, fire was worshiped here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turan lowland" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1178725.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The desert is very arid and almost unsuitable for life.  60-150 mm of precipitation falls in various areas here annually, with the vast majority of them (70%) falling in the cold season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="in the clay deserts of the Turan lowlands live" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1178722.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is very hot in the summer, the temperature in some parts rises to 50 <sup>0</sup> , and the sand itself warms up to +80, making barefoot movement on it completely impossible.  In winter, severe frosts occur here, sometimes the thermometer column drops below 30 <sup>0</sup> Celsius.

    <p>  Despite adverse weather conditions, numerous animals live in the desert - a turtle, a <span>steppe cat,</span> various rodents, scorpions, snakes, etc.  In the northern part, in the clay deserts of the Turan lowland, saigas and gazelles live.  Perhaps the main attraction of the desert is the picturesque crater of Darvaz, which local residents compare with a real door to hell. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lake of the Turan lowland" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1178724.jpg" width="600"></div>  The fact is that after unsuccessful drilling operations and the drilling rig collapse underground, gas began to rise from the ground, threatening to poison nearby villages.  In order to avoid this, it was decided to set fire to gas.  So a flaming 60-meter funnel appeared, the height of the flame escaping from it sometimes exceeds 10 meters.

    <h2>  Kyzyl Kum </h2><p>  This is the largest desert in Central Asia.  On the territory of modern Kazakhstan is only its northern section. </p><p>  The desert, whose name can be translated as "red sand", is located in the interfluve of the Syr Darya and Amu Darya.  Her sands really have a reddish tint.  They are of aeolian and alluvial origin, have a Paleogene age.  The desert occupies 300 thousand square kilometers.  The endless sands here alternate with small remnant mountains (less than a kilometer high).  Sand massifs formed by the winds sometimes reach a height of 75 meters. </p><p>  Unlike her Turanian sister (Karakum), Kyzylkum is more favorable for life.  Small cattle are grazed here, and thanks to artesian water and a canal from the Syr Darya, in some areas it is possible to obtain crops of rice, grapes and fruits. </p>
