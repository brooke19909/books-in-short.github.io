    <p>  How good is food at Sealife Buket Beach Hotel 5 *?  Reviews of tourists indicate that there is absolutely no reason for concern.  It‚Äôs simply impossible to stay hungry at a hotel.  The food is very varied and satisfying.  A lot of meat dishes, fruits (melons, watermelons, bananas, plums, apples, cherries, apricots).  There is also a diet table.  According to guest reviews, at first the food seems a little spicy for our taste, but you quickly get used to it.  But the dishes from the children's menu are not always useful for kids.  So, for example, children can be served french fries, Turkish sausages, soy cutlets.  Of course, babies like all this, but not their stomachs. </p><p>  Special delight among visitors is caused by sweet dishes and pastries.  They certainly need to be tasted, even if you do not consider yourself sweet.  At a certain time (from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.) ice cream is handed out at the hotel, after which entire lines of not only children but also adults are lined up.  If you are lucky, you can have time to choose a few varieties of cold treats. </p><p>  In addition, on the beach you can enjoy ‚Äúcrumbs-potatoes‚Äù - these are boiled potatoes with butter and grated cheese.  Even leading an active holiday, it is simply impossible to stay hungry.  There is always the opportunity to eat something delicious.  The hotel takes care of its guests.  Sealife Buket Beach Hotel 5 *, whose rating is quite high, is considered a good complex.  Therefore, the hotel can safely be recommended for families. </p><h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  Sealife Buket Beach Hotel 5 * (Okurcalar) has its own beach (sand and pebble), on which there are free sun loungers with umbrellas.  On the shore there is enough space for absolutely everyone.  The beach is spacious and wide, so there is no need to take your place early.  But towels are issued on bail, but for free.  Sometimes they line up. </p><p>  Places near the pools are not as many as on the shore, so vacationers try to take sun loungers by 8.30. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sealife buket beach hotel 5 turkey alanya okurcalar" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1413580.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What attracts Sealife Buket Beach Hotel 5 * to itself?  Guest reviews of the complex are always full of enthusiasm for the sea.  The proximity of the hotel to the coast is an indisputable advantage.  For those who go on vacation for the sake of the sea, you should not look for a better place than the Sealife Buket Beach Hotel 5 *.  The reviews of tourists confirm this. </p><p>  The sea is warm, the coast has a gentle slope, in the morning the water is clear, and after lunch, algae occasionally appears, but they do not interfere at all.  Walking a bit along the coast, you can walk to the cape and take beautiful photographs there.  Those who truly love the sea will appreciate this place. </p><h2>  Children's animation </h2><p>  The administration of Sealife Buket <span>Resort Beach Hotel 5 *</span> takes care of its youngest guests.  For them there is a special pool with a depth of 0.3 meters.  The hotel has children's animators.  There is a mini club for young tourists under twelve years old, and for juniors - a junior club.  Daily for children discos are organized from 9 to 9.30.  In addition, the complex has a children's playground. </p><p>  Upon request, a cot is provided free of charge.  If desired, you can order babysitting services. </p><p>  According to hotel guests, children's animation has one drawback.  A lot of songs sound in German.  And this is due to the fact that a lot of Germans always rest in the complex.  Animators always try to captivate children with interesting games, yet the hotel is designed for couples with kids. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  For those tourists who find there is little sea and water entertainment, there is the opportunity to do shopping.  You don‚Äôt have to go far.  To do this, go to Alanya to the bazaar.  There are a lot of souvenirs and locally produced goods.  Only their prices can be very high, you need to be able to bargain well with merchants, but this is a tedious task and not everyone likes.  Therefore, if you just want to buy souvenirs for relatives, then you can use the bazaar near the hotel.  Prices there are much more modest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sealife buket beach hotel 5 pics" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1413590.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If this is your first time in Turkey, you can devote some time to excursions.  For example, ride a quad bike inland, and look at life away from the sea.  Tourists who visited sightseeing tours are very pleased.  By the way, they are advised to take them not from the street barkers, but from local travel agencies, where they are cheaper. </p><h2>  Sealife Buket Beach Hotel 5 *: visitor reviews </h2><p>  The hotel is a good holiday destination for those who love the sea.  The coast here is gentle, comfortable for relaxation.  But, according to tourists, the sea is too deep, which is not very convenient for kids.  In such a situation, a good solution to the problem may be bathing the child in the children's pool.  The beach of the hotel is quite spacious and clean, it is cleaned daily.  In addition, there is a bar on the shore where you can always eat.  There are no problems with sun loungers and umbrellas, there are a lot of them on the shore. </p><p>  Decent adult animators who will not let you get bored and will take a rest in the morning will be praised.  They will offer girls to learn belly dancing and or do aerobics.  Attending such classes is a very fun and rewarding affair.  Even if you do not participate in such events, but simply contemplate them from the side, then this is also exciting.  Many workshops take place directly by the pool or on the beach.  Therefore, it is difficult to resist, so as not to participate in them.  Rest in any case turns out to be active, fun and intense. </p><p>  As for children's animation, then, according to tourists, it is insufficient.  Those parents who plan to leave a child for a long time in the kids' club will not like it much.  The main time when animators organize games falls at a time when children are at sea.  But evening discos for kids are a great entertainment for young vacationers.  Not all parents after this event reach adult programs.  Still, outdoor activities take a lot of energy. </p><p>  For those tourists who want to see the local exotic, there are lots of excursions that will appeal not only to adults, but also to children.  As a rule, vacationers are completely delighted with such trips, which make it possible to get to know the country, local customs and customs.  Hotel workers are happy to tell guests where they can go and how to do it better.  Their advice is definitely worth using.  You will not regret the time and money spent on travel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sealife buket beach hotel 5 alanya" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1413593.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The food at the hotel is quite good.  Especially pleasing to our compatriots is the all-inclusive system.  It is very comfortable.  Throughout the day, you can have refreshments and drinks at any bar.  Ice cream is offered to guests in sufficient quantities, which pleases the children.  Chefs prepare delicious desserts that leave no one indifferent.  As for fruits, they are served quite a lot.  The menu contains a variety of dishes.  There is also porridge, which is very convenient, since they are usually loved by children.  We can safely say that the power system is well established here. </p><p>  The hotel area is not large, but very well maintained.  There are a lot of greenery and flowering plants around, it is always very nice to walk along the paths and admire their beauty.  Children can safely let go play in the complex. </p><p>  Some vacationers advise you to pay extra money at the reception at the settlement, then you will be accommodated much faster, and they will give the room better (10-20 dollars).  Other tourists do without such surcharges and are quite happy with the rooms.  So, judge for yourself. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are clean, not very spacious.  But, on the other hand, no one is sitting in them, because everyone is going to swim in the sea and sunbathe.  Some vacationers have some comments regarding the five-star status of the complex, since there are not many attributes inherent in this category.  In their opinion, the hotel is more in line with the four-star level (there are no cosmetics in the bathroom, plastic furniture on the terraces, etc.).  It is difficult to judge the validity of such judgments.  To form an objective opinion, you must visit this beautiful place yourself. </p><p>  Of course, the hotel has some drawbacks, but it must be borne in mind that all this is offset by fairly affordable prices for holidays in comparison with other similar complexes.  Therefore, you can not pay attention to some points. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  From the above, in our opinion, we can make an unambiguous conclusion that the hotel can be recommended as a place to spend a vacation.  The sea, the sun, good mood, fruits, a lot of impressions and entertainment - all this you will get here.  And what else is needed for a good vacation ... </p><p>  We hope that our information will be useful to those who are planning a trip and are busy choosing the right hotel.  Have a nice holiday. </p>
