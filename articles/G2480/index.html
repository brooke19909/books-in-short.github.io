Observers of the speaker segment note its expansion due to the coverage of new areas of application of this equipment.  At the same time, the basic characteristics of the devices are improved both in terms of sound and in functional content.  Traditionally, the JBL speakers featured in a wide variety of versions and configurations are featured in the lists of leading products in this segment. </p><h2>  Movie Solutions </h2><p>  The manufacturer is famous for <span>high-quality acoustics</span> , providing accompaniment to home theaters.  But in the brand's lineup there are a lot of compact installations, as well as massive production complexes that can serve a full-fledged cinema hall.  As a basic solution of this type, the SCS12 system with a power of 400 W is proposed.  This is a full-range two-way surround designed for medium-sized halls.  For less demanding tasks, you can offer the JBL SCS8 system.  <span>Speakers of</span> this class are distinguished by a power of 200 W and the ability to work in transformer mode. </p>

    <p>  Subwoofers are noteworthy, including the 4642A.  This is a 1200 W system, which has a frequency range of 25-500 Hz.  Accordingly, with a high power potential, the user of this acoustics can count on accuracy in transmitting the sound picture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Portable speakers JBL Charge </h2><p>  The Charge family is a line of small campers with simple controls and, most importantly, high-quality sound.  Of course, you should not compare this system with large traditional columns, but it stands out from its class.  As for the power supply, the JBL Charge speaker system in the basic version is powered by a 6000 mAh battery.  According to the manufacturer, this amount is enough for 12 hours of continuous operation in music listening mode.  At the same time, the system is not cheap - an average of 6-7 thousand rubles.  Given the decent sound quality, original design and long operating time, this model pays for itself. </p>

    <h2>  JBL Micro Wireless System </h2><p>  In a sense, the continuation of the Charge concept, but noticeably superior in a number of operational indicators.  This system is more focused on mobility, although with a clear loss in power and battery life.  The device is already a miniature column, which is based on a 40 mm speaker.  A feature of the model is the presence of a Bluetooth module that allows you to use JBL speakers in combination with iPhone and iPad devices.  Actually, the wireless capabilities between compact players and sources of sound files have not been anything special for a long time.  However, the JBL developers have significantly optimized the characteristics of the miniature speakers, which in practice was reflected in the clear bass reproduction without distortion. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Active System PRX Series </h2><p>  The niche of <span>active acoustics is</span> widely marketed by JBL.  Models of the PRX series are available both in the economy class and in premium versions.  Something in between is the PRX600 line, which is characterized by the efficient use of gain power, complemented by the reliability and versatility of the equipment.  It is noteworthy that the JBL active speaker system in the PRX600 modification was developed without the use of third-party and proven platforms.  In a way, this is completely ‚Äúpure‚Äù acoustics, the tests of which took place in non-laboratory, that is, as close to real conditions as possible.  The creators took into account the background noise effects of different environments, which allowed for effective sound insulation.  In addition, the physical protection of the system was separately considered for the possibility of its subsequent use in the most severe noise conditions. </p>

    <h2>  Studio complexes </h2><p>  For home studios, the company offers LSR systems costing an average of 17 to 30 thousand rubles.  One of the most striking models of this type is the LSR2310SP.  In essence, it is an active subwoofer with a power of 180 W, which is also provided with a magnetic screen, suspension points and volume control.  In the initial segment of this family, the LSR2325P model is also noteworthy.  In this case, a 2-band active JBL complex is considered.  <span>Loudspeakers of</span> this type operate at a power of 50 W and are also provided with suspension points.  The most powerful systems of this class are represented by the LSR6300 series.  Such settings are characterized by increased accuracy of sound reproduction, have an almost perfect frequency response, as well as the ability to flexibly adjust settings for the characteristics and conditions of a particular room. </p><h2>  Car speakers JBL </h2><p>  Especially for car enthusiasts, the manufacturer offers an extensive line of JBL Car systems, which includes subwoofers and amplifiers in various configurations.  The basic solution is the GT5 system.  This is a component <span>two-way acoustics</span> with a titanium tweeter, which ensures smooth and clean playback in the upper range.  To this, it is worth adding the diffuser function, due to which a good return in the low-frequency spectrum is achieved.  For more demanding car owners, the JBL GTO system is recommended.  The speakers of this family are not only distinguished by high-quality sound reproduction, but also by their original design.  These are enclosed subwoofers that use medium hardness MDF panels.  At the output, a stable study of the frequency range from 20 to 40 Hz is provided. </p>

    <h2>  The main criteria for choosing acoustics </h2><p>  The segmentation within the JBL range of products per se facilitates the selection of a suitable system.  But in certain categories, one should carefully approach the selection of optimal configurations.  It‚Äôs worth starting with determining directly the operating indicators in the form of power and frequency range.  For example, acoustics having a power potential within 100 watts will be enough for domestic needs.  For professional tasks or servicing large events, you may need a more powerful JBL active speaker system at 400-500 watts.  As for the frequency spectrum, it is individual and depends on the requirements for sound quality.  For example, standard installation systems of the JBL brand operate in the range from 32 to 250 Hz.  It is also worth paying attention to communication tools and interfaces through which acoustics are connected to adjacent equipment.  In the latest versions, for example, in addition to traditional channels, wireless technologies are also actively used. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The manufacturer JBL is constantly working on expanding its model lines and modernizing existing successful systems.  In parallel, developers are integrating new technologies.  So, among the latest developments, a waveguide system intended for JBL studio complexes can be noted.  <span>Speakers for home</span> use also receive many interesting options.  In particular, they are equipped with modern D-class amplifiers, and in order to increase the switching efficiency, balanced connectors of a new generation are used.  Along with this, branded requirements for the hardware components also increase, which also affects the quality characteristics of JBL brand products. </p>
