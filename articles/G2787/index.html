    <p>  <strong>The era of the <span>palace coups:</span> briefly</strong> <strong>about the reasons and features of the period</strong> </p><p>  So, palace coups are a change of monarchs as a result of some kind of conspiracy or similar action.  Distinctive features are: active participation of the guard, that is, on whose side the military power ultimately appears, he usually wins, as well as participation in coups of a narrow circle of people.  That is, the agitation was maximally reduced.  As for the reasons, there are several.  The main one is the publication by Peter the Great of a decree on succession to the throne.  Its essence was that the monarch, who rules, can himself, without any pressure from the outside, publish the name of his successor.  The era of palace coups, a summary of which can be found in any textbook, originates precisely from the moment when the first emperor dies without giving the name of the next monarch.  This became a fundamental component of all other subsequent events. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <strong><span>The era of palace coups:</span> briefly</strong> <strong>about the changing monarchs</strong> </p><p>  The successor of Peter the Great is his wife - Catherine.  She was not very concerned about state problems, and for this reason she created a special body - the Supreme Privy Council.  Catherine was in power for a short time - only two years.  Her grandson, Peter the Great, replaced Peter the Great <span>.</span>  The struggle for his entourage was fought seriously, and the princes Dolgoruky defeated it.  But this young creature is dying.  Now comes the time of Anna Ivanovna.  For ten years, the country falls into "Bironism" - this is the period of time when the German empress‚Äôs favorites actually ruled the state.  At the very beginning, she zealously tore the condition and dissolved the governing body created by Catherine the First.  After it, the throne passes into the hands of very dubious personalities, the so-called Braunschweig dynasty.  <span>Anna Leopoldovna</span> was regent under the young Ivan, but could not stay there for more than 9 months.  As a result, another coup.  And here Elizabeth Petrovna ascends the throne.  The guard provided the new empress with tremendous support, and she firmly took the throne for 20 years: this time can be called the heyday of Russian society in all respects.  After her, Peter III received power, a little-willed young man who was a fan of all of Prussia.  It is no coincidence that the era that took place in 1762, when Catherine II began to rule Russia, refers precisely to the era of palace coups.  That's who really stayed there for a long time and brought the country to a new level with its enlightened policy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refers to the era of palace coups" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/220089.jpg" width="220"></div>

    <p>  Thus, the era of palace coups, which were briefly discussed above, was a turning point in Russian history.  The people worthily withstood all these conspiracies and entered the new century as a strong power. </p>
