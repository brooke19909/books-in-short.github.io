    <p>  Each Zopo mobile phone will delight the owner with an elegant appearance.  The manufacturer has definitely worked on the type of its products.  Naturally, as with most Chinese firms, there is a borrowing of design ideas from more advanced companies.  The ZP950 model is very similar in appearance to Samsung devices.  However, the efforts of the manufacturer did not go unnoticed.  Almost every Zopo product has its own solutions. </p><p>  Although outwardly the company's devices look stylish, there are also weaknesses.  The main drawback was the uniformity of materials.  Almost every device released by the company is made of plastic.  That is why the strength and reliability of the devices are in doubt. </p><h2>  Availability </h2>

    <p>  First of all, the Zopo phone, like most Chinese devices, attracts with a low price.  The average cost is 6-9 thousand rubles.  Naturally, there are more expensive devices.  For some models, the price exceeds ten thousand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Convincing the future buyer and the "filling" of the smartphone.  The characteristics of the Speed ‚Äã‚Äã7 are more than attractive for a budget employee.  Although this model can be safely attributed to the middle class of devices. </p><p>  The Zopo Speed ‚Äã‚Äã7 phone is attractive not only for its availability, but also for its impressive functionality.  The manufacturer equipped his brainchild with an excellent screen with an <span>IPS matrix</span> and high resolution.  We also paid attention to the hardware.  The <span>smartphone has 8 cores</span> with a performance of 1.5 GHz each.  The device‚Äôs memory will surprise you with the presence of 3 GB of RAM and a 16 GB drive.  The camera, which received a 13 megapixel (main) and 5 megapixel (front) matrix, did not pass by. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The Chinese Zopo phone will surprise the user with an excellent display.  After examining the lineup, you can see that the manufacturer clearly does not save on its screens.  Owners of five inches receive a resolution of 1920 by 1080, and with a size of 4 "the pixels are 960 by 540. Of course, there are exceptions. For example, the ZP900S equipped with a 5.3-inch screen received only 960 by 540 pixels. </p><p>  Despite minor flaws, the Zopo phone looks much better than most Chinese devices.  A bright display, IPS matrix and excellent resolution are not common among budget Chinese. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2>

    <p>  The MTK processor has become a familiar solution for low-cost devices, especially companies from the Middle Kingdom liked this option.  Choosing a cheap "filling" significantly reduces the cost of the device, although it significantly affects performance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Such a choice of hardware did not pass by Zopo.  Having sacrificed part of productivity and giving preference to cheap "stuffing", the company significantly reduced the cost of devices.  However, the power of the company's devices should not be underestimated.  Any Zopo phone will cope with any daily tasks.  More advanced models, such as the ZP920 or ZP980, are comparable to the middle class of well-known brands. </p><p>  The presence of several cores in phones with a good frequency of operation is striking.  Even such a trifle as a native memory did not disappoint.  The company's smartphones have 4, 16 or 32 GB. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  Usually state employees disappoint with the ability to take pictures.  But Zopo succeeded in that direction.  A significant number of phones boasts the presence of 13 megapixels.  Such a camera received an elegant ZP920 and inconspicuous C3.  Of course, the matrices of Sony or Samsung are far, but the quality is very good. </p><p>  Additional cameras of both devices will especially appeal to lovers of self-portraits.  A 5 MP ‚Äúeye‚Äù was placed in C3, and the ZP920 acquired a front-facing camera of 8 megapixels.  A similar situation also occurred with other phones of the company. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  What did the owners of the Zopo phone like?  Reviews highlight the big screen.  Image quality is also given credit.  The display shows its best side in the sun, and the image without pixels further enhances the impression. </p><p>  The camera also appealed to users.  Perhaps the pictures do not reach the market leaders in quality, but the resulting picture is not bad.  In a Chinese device, such a camera looks more than unexpected. </p><p>  Good performance has become another trump card Zopo.  Core performance, RAM and a large amount of memory - what else does the user need?  The owners even compared Zopo with representatives of the Lenovo S-class of the company. </p><p>  Be sure to note the cost of devices.  Although the company's products are higher in price than some smartphones in the Middle Kingdom, but it is definitely worth the money. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The main drawback was the design, or rather the case material.  Zopo devices are incredibly fragile and get scratched and damaged even from a slight drop. </p><p>  A secondary, but no less important problem is a weak battery.  Many owners complained about the short duration of the work and a strong dependence on the outlet. </p>
