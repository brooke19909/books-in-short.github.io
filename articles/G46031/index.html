The article will provide you with patterns for children's t-shirts for the boy.  But that's not all.  When you understand how to build patterns correctly, you can easily remake them for a pattern of children's t-shirts for girls.  Enjoy the results of yourself and your child! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.picsnaper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="T-shirts for boys and girls" class="if uuid-2976783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109916/2976783.jpg"></div><h2>  What do you need? </h2><p>  To sew a t-shirt on your own, you need to prepare: </p><ol><li>  The cloth.  Well choose not only color, but also material.  It should be convenient in the first place, let air through, and not deteriorate when washing. </li><li>  Threads in tone of fabric. </li><li>  Scissors for cutting.  They should cut the fabric well, not tear it. </li><li>  Pins </li><li>  Needles. </li></ol><h2>  Necessary measurements </h2><p>  For the correct construction of the pattern, carefully take the necessary measurements: </p><ul><li>  POG - half chest; </li><li>  NAP - half neck circumference; </li><li>  Depth and width of the armhole; </li><li>  DI - product in length; </li><li>  DR - sleeves in length; </li></ul><p>  Of course, you can use universal (standard) measurements.  You can find them in the table of children's measurements.  But it will be better if you take measurements from your son or daughter.  You can build a pattern yourself, it is not as difficult as it might seem. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="olimpek.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="An example of children's measurements and sizes on them" class="if uuid-2976438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109916/2976438.jpg"></div><p>  Here are a few details that give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to take measurements for a children's t-shirt pattern from a child correctly: </p><ol><li>  To make it easier to take measurements that are associated with the waistline, tie a cloth inlay to the child‚Äôs belt. </li><li>  The centimeter tape should fit well and tightly to the body of the child, there should not be excess sagging, but do not overtighten it. </li><li>  When measuring the girth of the chest, measure by the most protruding points, not pulling, but not loosening a centimeter tape. </li><li>  We measure the waist at the narrowest point. </li><li>  When determining the volume of the hips, measurement occurs at the most convex points of the buttocks. </li><li>  The girth of the neck is measured at the base, closer to the collarbone. </li><li>  We measure the length of the product from the seventh cervical vertebra. </li><li>  The width of the shoulders is considered at the most convex points from one to the other shoulder. </li><li>  The width of the back is measured through the center, along the line of the shoulder blades. </li></ol><p>  By the measurements taken and the basis of the pattern below, make a pattern of a children's t-shirt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holycrackers.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern of a children's t-shirt (we substitute the sizes)" class="if uuid-2976771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109916/2976771.jpg"></div><h2>  What to do next </h2><p>  The pattern of the sleeve of a children's T-shirt is also easy to do.  Draw a vertical line and put a dot at the top of the sheet.  Three quarters (3/4) of the depth of the armhole and the length of the sleeve according to the measurements taken by you, set aside from the point down.  You got two points.  From them, draw two horizontal lines of arbitrary length. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the front of the t-shirt, measure the length of the armhole.  We transfer the value that we measured to the pattern from the side of the sleeve - we get a segment.  We call it VO.  From point O, lay to the right the segment OV 1 = VO. </p><p>  Next, we divide the obtained segments BO and OB 1 into 4 equal parts.  We construct the armhole of the sleeve as shown in the pattern.  You can narrow the sleeves along the bottom by about 2‚Äì2.5 centimeters on each side. </p><h2>  Sewing products from patterns of children's t-shirts </h2><p>  Getting to sewing: </p><ol><li>  Cut out all the necessary details from the fabric, according to your pattern of a children's t-shirt.  Before cutting out the elements, be sure to check the drawing again.  As the saying goes "measure seven times - cut once." </li><li>  Need to stitch the sleeves to the front of our t-shirt.  Face the sleeves, attach the sleeves and connect the pieces of fabric with pins. </li><li>  Attach the sleeves to the front of the product. </li><li>  We connect the free back of the sleeves in the same way with the back of the T-shirt and stitch it. </li><li>  We fix the free lateral edges of the T-shirt and the edges of the sleeves with the help of pins.  Firmware. </li></ol><p>  We process the edges.  From all edges, bend first by 0.5 cm, then another 1 cm and stitch.  If you wish, you can trim the edges with a ribbon or oblique trim. </p><h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  Carefully inspect the finished work and add the finishing touches.  Check that the threads do not hang loose.  If necessary, cut off the excess.  You can decorate the finished t-shirt.  For this, you can use all kinds of stripes or thermal stickers.  Are you done?  Now you can try on a T-shirt. </p><h2>  Sewing Tricks </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.hogyan-kell.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="machine sewing" class="if uuid-2976785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109916/2976785.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the work to turn out to be high-quality and accurate, you should know several nuances: </p><ul><li>  If you need to complete a stitch, then sew it with a zigzag tilt.  Then the fabric will not wrinkle and tighten. </li><li>  Use the ‚Äúsponge‚Äù on either side of the stitch, then it will be easy to move a long piece of fabric without shifting the stitch </li><li>  To flush the fabric evenly, use tracing paper.  Draw a straight line on it, fasten to the fabric and sew.  When done, just tear off a piece of tracing paper! </li><li>  You can use the line direction table.  It is very comfortable.  In addition, it looks beautiful and neat, especially on thin fabrics. </li><li>  If you need to stitch several layers of fabric at a time, fasten them with small clothespins or paper clips, then the fabric will not ‚Äúleave‚Äù. </li><li>  To bend the fabric evenly, use a sheet of paper and an iron.  Fold the fabric along the side line of the sheet and go over it with an iron. </li><li>  Place a piece of cardboard under the foot and even difficult to sew fabrics will ‚Äúgo‚Äù easily. </li><li>  To circle the pattern immediately with a countdown, add two pencils using clerical gum and circle them.  If the premium should be larger, you can put together three pencils.  Raise one of them, which is located in the middle, so that it does not leave extra lines. </li><li>  Remnant is one of the best means for leaving sketches on fabric. </li></ul>
