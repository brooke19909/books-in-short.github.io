Since it was not only sculptures of great figures that were officially immortalized in granite, marble and bronze, the masters seemed to compete with each other in originality.  One of the most unusual monuments in our country is a monument to the letter "e", installed in the city of Ulyanovsk.  How did you come up with the idea of ​​creating such a sculpture and why did its residents not like the first version?  The full story of the letter "" and her personal monument specifically for you in our article. </p><h2>  Complicated story letters </h2>

But already in high school they are told that the letter “e”, if necessary, can be replaced by “e” in a letter.  In electronic versions of documents and other texts, the letter “” is practically not used in principle.  Such an optional symbol appeared in Russian writing relatively recently.  The proposal to introduce a new letter in the alphabet was first put forward by Princess Ekaterina Dashkova, director of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, in 1783.  In Russian, letters are provided for all sounds, but the “” did not have its own graphic designation.  However, this innovation was called into question: re-equipment of printing houses at that time was very expensive.  But already in 1796, at the Moscow University Printing House, Nikolai Karamzin’s book “Aonids” was printed, where the word “tears” was found in the usual spelling with “” (previously, a combination of letters “io” was used to denote this sound).

In 1918, during the educational reforms, the letter "" was recognized as optional.  When writing it can be replaced by "e".  Today, a letter with an unusual history is taught at school, but in many official documents, on the contrary, it is recommended to replace it.  Many linguists do not like such a frivolous attitude to the spelling and culture of the Russian language.  And this is one of the reasons why a monument to the letter "" was created.  However, not everything is so bad, many modern printing houses use this symbol.  Often the correct spelling of words containing the letter “” can be seen not only in serious books and textbooks, but also in ordinary magazines and newspapers.  However, the question of the abolition of this symbol and its withdrawal from widespread use is periodically raised.

The monument was immediately dedicated to the printed symbol and its author - the person who first used the new letter - N. Karamzin.  The city of Ulyanovsk was defined as the site of the installation of the new sculpture.  In 2001, a competition was held, during which they chose a sketch of the future monument.  Approved by the work of local artist Alexander Zinin.  The monument to the letter "" was a stela of granite with a print of the symbol, repeating the first version of the printing press of 1797.  The sculpture was to be made of red granite.  However, the required material was not delivered on time, and had to use the available black stone.  Such a replacement allowed to make the sculpture on time.  The monument was unveiled on the anniversary of the installation of the monument in Ulyanovsk to N. M. Karamzin himself.

The opening was held in a festive atmosphere, addressing the guests of the event by representatives of the city administration.  Many people liked the idea of ​​attracting the attention of people, in particular young people, to the problem of literacy and recall the rules of spelling.  But few people liked the design of the monument.  <span>Residents of Ulyanovsk</span> expressed their opinion that such a monument is similar to a cemetery tombstone.  Of course, no one was going to "bury" the letter.  And according to the initial design, the monument was supposed to be made of red stone, more cheerful and noble.  Assessing the general appearance of the sculpture and the reaction of the townspeople, the creators of the monument decided to redo it and return to the original project. </p><h2>  New monument </h2>

This is a triangular stele of red and gray granite.  Curiously, the monument was erected on the night of November 3, 2005.  The city administration took this step consciously in order not to attract too much public attention.  The replacement of the monument was not previously covered in the media.  Journalists talked about her later.  Materials for the manufacture of sculptures were brought from Rostov.  The sculptor Alexander Zinin worked on the new monument, using the same project with which he won the competition.  The master personally supervised the work throughout the entire manufacturing period.  The monument was completed in record time, it took only about a month to create it.  The new stele looks much more positive and solid than its first option.  Today this is one of the attractions, thanks to which the whole of Russia knows the city of Ulyanovsk.  It is with this sculpture that many tourists seek to be photographed.  The updated monument also entered the numerous lists of the strangest and most unusual sights of our country.  But what happened to the first sculpture?  She was dismantled and transported to the warehouse of the War Memorial Company.  It is quite possible that sometime from this "mourning" stone they will really make a tombstone.

The monument was erected in front of the new building of the Ulyanovsk Regional Scientific Library.  Any local resident will tell you the right way to this sculpture.  Just ask: "Where is the monument to the letter"  "?"  It is impossible to pinpoint the address of the attraction; it is located on Novy Venets Boulevard.  The nearest building (library) is Karamzin Lane, building 3. The monument is erected near the intersection of Karamzin Lane and Novy Venets Boulevard, it is inscribed in the decoration of the landscaped area of ​​the library.  It is easy to get here by public transport or private car.  And let the monument is not distinguished by complex shapes and an abundance of colors, but it deserves attention due to its non-standard.  Be sure to personally inspect the monument with the letter "".  Ulyanovsk boasts a considerable number of other attractions, but this one is one of the most striking.
