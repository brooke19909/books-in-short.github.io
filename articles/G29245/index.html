    <h2>  Pillow history </h2><p>  The very first information about the appearance of the pillow refers to the rule of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs.  Although the pillows did not resemble modern ones, their function was performed by wooden planks on a stand.  To protect the pharaoh from the dark forces, they were depicted of the gods, so that the ruler could rest calmly after day cares.  In Japan, pillows made of wood, metal, stone or porcelain were used everywhere until the 19th century. </p><p>  <span>The story of the creation of the pillow told that in the territory of Ancient Greece they came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsewing the first soft products in order to conduct long philosophical conversations in a luxurious setting.</span>  <span>Pillows and mattresses served to ensure a comfortable pastime for noble citizens.</span>  <span>They judged the high status of the patrician, and the richness of the finish emphasized his financial capabilities.</span>  <span>Sewed pillows made of fabric or leather, gave a different shape.</span>  <span>Feathers or down of birds, as well as animal hair, were used as filler.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>In ancient Rome, pillows soon came into use.</span>  <span>Gradually, items filled with fluff gained unprecedented popularity among the Romans.</span>  <span>The military leaders liked to rest on them so much that they sent subordinates to get goose down for pillows.</span> </p>
