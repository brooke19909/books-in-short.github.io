Many considered this an advertising and PR step.  And others began to frantically fuss around in the piggy banks, looking for a precious trifle, for which almost nothing can be bought in the store.  Even matches and salt in stores are now so expensive that the buyer has to lay out a rather impressive pile of iron coins from his pocket. </p><p>  Whatever category of people you belong to: a cohort of grinning skeptics or supporters to make quick profits without making almost any effort - the information on which coins the bank buys will be equally interesting to everyone. </p><p>  So, let's start by answering the question: what year's coins are bought by banks.  It was announced that the most popular today are money issued in 2003.  Their denomination is limited to one, two and five rubles.  And they must be minted in the <span>Mint of</span> St. Petersburg.  And proof of this is the special monogram of this institution under the left foot of a two-headed eagle, which can be seen through a magnifying glass. </p><p>  People are interested not only in what kind of coins a bank buys, but also in how to sell them profitably.  Moreover, information about dishonesty not only of private buyers, but even of banks has leaked.  Therefore, the next part of our article will be interesting to many. </p><p>  So, if you have already figured out for yourself which coins the bank is buying, then follow the step-by-step instructions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Step one.  First of all, entering into the search engine a request about which coins the Bank of Russia is buying up, pay attention to the SKB Bank.  The convenience of this financial institution is that it has enough offices throughout the vast territory of our country.  You will find their addresses on the official website of the bank. </p><p>  Step Two  Remember that the promotion is limited in time from January 17 to July 17, 2011. </p><p>  Step Three  Do not be lazy and visit the famous forums of numismatic content.  There you will find a lot of useful information, with the help of which you can not only correctly assess the value of the coin sold, but also avoid some problems that arise due to amateurism. </p><p>  Step Four  You can sell your coins at a more impressive price to numismatists.  The game is worth the candle, since here a coin with a face value of 5 rubles costs about 16 thousand rubles, 2 rubles - up to 12 thousand rubles, <span>and 1</span> ruble can be sold for 5 thousand.  However, remember that the Internet is teeming with scammers who are ready to fool you.  And then you may not be the winner, but with a broken trough. </p><p>  Step Five  Post photos of your coins and wait for the best deals.  If they do not suit you, do not rush.  Remember that metal does not lose its price, does not deteriorate.  And this action is not the last.  The question of which coins the Bank of Russia is buying up never loses its relevance.  Just think about how to preserve your precious items, so that if possible, you can offer the buyer the goods in the proper form. </p><p>  And the sixth step.  Discussing the question of which year coins are bought by banks, with neighbors and acquaintances, do not rush to brag about the fact that you have coins that will allow you to get rich overnight.  This will allow you to remain calm and not become the object of attention of unscrupulous people. </p><p>  Remove the coins that could not be sold today, away, do not touch them without special need, treat them carefully.  If you find precious money in your piggy bank, do not rush to ring up all conceivable and unimaginable instances, asking the question which coins the bank is buying.  Approach a situation with professional calm, and then indispensable luck awaits you. </p>
