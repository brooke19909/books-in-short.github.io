This issue, as a rule, becomes relevant closer to winter, when most of our citizens begin to prepare for winter holidays, pick up ski equipment for themselves, book train or plane tickets and look at weather forecast sites. </p><p>  Is it possible to go there in the summer or, say, in the offseason?  All this will be discussed in this article. </p><p>  <strong>Section 1.

The map shows that it is not as far away as it might seem at first glance, and certainly not further than the well-known resorts of Switzerland or France.

    <p>  In this nature reserve you can relax perfectly, enjoying the unique beauty of nature, and at a very affordable price.  Endless white spaces will surround you, a bright mountain sun will shine from the sky, and frozen waterfalls will complement this picture.  Local residents of the North Caucasus will do everything to make you feel the most welcome and dear guest. </p><p>  This is a favorite place for skiers and snowboarders.  Dombay ... Where is this ski resort located?  It is located in the eponymous meadow at the foot of the <span>Caucasus Mountains.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It does not matter if you are a real pro or a beginner in one of the types of winter sports, there are trails of various difficulty levels. </p><p>  <strong>Section 2.

The thermometer column usually does not fall below the + 7 ¬∞ mark.  But the height of the snow cover can reach about 2 meters.  Forests on the slopes of the mountains mainly consist of coniferous trees.  Closer to the peaks they are replaced by alpine meadows and glaciers.

    <p>  The nature of the region is an ideal place for climbers and skiers.  Tourists during <span>their holidays</span> stay in hotels or ski resorts located in the Dombay glade. </p><p>  Dombay routes of various difficulty levels have a total length of 20 km.  Wide slopes and special lifts greatly facilitate the task for beginners.  The trails start at an altitude of 3000 m and have five different levels, which are interconnected by cable-chair and pendulum cableways. </p><p>  Without basic equipment at a ski resort can not do.  If you didn‚Äôt bring along special equipment, you can rent it at one of the rental points located at every step, or purchase everything you need at a local store. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>Section 3.

Wet and viscous snow, which lies on the peaks until the end of June, does not save the situation.  <span>May holidays</span> usually include the closure of winter vacations, which is invariably accompanied by rising prices.  In addition, with the advent of spring, many hotels begin repairs, and some <span>cable cars</span> and cafes are simply closed.  Activity growth is possible only on weekends.

    <p>  May is considered the beginning of tourism in Dombay.  A little confused only by the presence of snow in certain areas, but not too summer temperature levels on the tops of the mountains.  In such a period, preferable are short routes without overnight stays in tents; it is undesirable to climb too high into the mountains. </p><p>  The ideal time for tourism is September.  The number of vacationers is significantly reduced, the weather is warm in summer.  With the advent of October, the situation gradually begins to change, it often rains, snow is possible.  There is already a good time for photographers who have the opportunity to capture the crimson <span>colors of autumn, the</span> blue sky and the first snow on the tops of the mountains.  The most unsuccessful period of rest falls in November.  Off-season time greets vacationers with cold and wet snow.  We have to wait for December to enjoy the delights of a winter holiday again. </p>
