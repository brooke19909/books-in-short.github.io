    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to the "Second Capital" in various ways - depending on which country you need to go from.  You can fly from Russia by flight "Vladivostok (RF) - Busan Airport (South Korea)."  This is the fastest way to move.  It is easy to get from Seoul - from the Gimpo airport.  Flights depart every half hour.  You can use the railway from Seoul to Busan, it will take a little longer, but you can simultaneously admire the surrounding nature. </p><h2>  Things to remember for tourists </h2><p>  First of all, that it is necessary to stock up on medical insurance - the services of doctors in Korea are very expensive.  The mobile communication standard is CDMA-1800, which means that mobile phones of the usual standards for the Russian market will not work even in roaming.  As a way out of the situation, you can use a service such as renting a mobile phone. </p><p>  According to the Korean authorities, there is no crime in Busan.  However, they also acknowledge that there are cases of pickpocketing and petty theft (statistics on the number of such cases have not been disclosed, apparently so as not to scare away tourists).  However, fatal accidents are very frequent on the roads, so you need to comply with traffic rules and be careful. </p><p>  Criminal law is very strict and also applies to visitors.  When arrested, foreign citizens do not have any concessions, for violations or committing a crime they will be punished in all severity. </p><p>  All Busan institutions, both municipal and recreational, operate according to a strict schedule.  Moreover, the summer and winter time of their work is different.  Therefore, before you visit any attraction on your own, it is better to contact the tourist center and clarify the work schedule. </p><p>  If the food is unfamiliar or one of its kind or smell causes embarrassment, then it is better not to try it.  Unusual food can ruin the whole rest. </p>
