  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotel room categories: features, requirements</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When choosing a hotel in a foreign country, travelers, of course, first of all pay attention to its stardom.  However, it is equally important when buying a tour to take into account the category of hotel rooms.  Rooms for rent in hotels may vary in size, degree of equipment, ease of location, etc. </p><h2>  Room types by size and degree of comfort </h2><p>  When choosing rooms in a hotel, first of all, of course, it is worth paying attention to their size and equipment.  In this regard, there are only 6 main types of rooms: </p><ul><li><p>  standard (STD, Standard); </p></li><li><p>  studio (Studio); </p></li><li><p>  Superior (Superior); </p></li><li><p>  family ordinary and two-room (Family room and studio); </p></li><li><p>  Suite and Deluxe (Suite / Deluxe); </p></li><li><p>  apartments (Apartment). </p></li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Normal standard" class="if uuid-2555818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2555818.jpg"></div><p>  Also in hotels duplexes can be rented (Duplex).  This category of hotel rooms is rare and quite expensive.  Duplex is a two-story, very large room. </p><p>  In hotels of large cities, where people often come on business trips, Business class rooms can also be rented.  In such rooms, in addition to the standard set of furniture and household appliances, office equipment and Internet access are usually provided. </p><h2>  What are the standards? </h2><p>  It is this type of room that forms the basis of the room stock of two-, three-, and sometimes four-star hotels.  Cost of living in Standard is usually relatively inexpensive.  But at the same time, such rooms are equipped with only the most necessary - beds, wardrobes, bedside tables, tables, air conditioners.  Showers, with the exception of the cheapest hotels, are usually provided in the standards individually for each room.  However, the size of the bathrooms in such rooms is in most cases very small.  Typically, standard rooms have balconies.  But in some cases, they may not be in the rooms of this category. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sometimes in hotels, among other things, improved standards are leased.  In terms of equipment, they are no different from ordinary rooms of this type.  Such standards are usually called improved because they have a slightly larger area than simple Standard.  Also in these rooms can be installed new furniture and appliances or recently made repairs. </p><h2>  Requirements for standards in the Russian Federation </h2><p>  This category of hotel rooms in Russia can be further classified according to the degree of convenience.  There are five varieties of such rooms. </p><p>  In the standards of category I in our country should be equipped with full bathrooms with baths / showers, toilets and sinks. </p><p>  In standards of category II in Russia, according to the regulations, tourists should be provided with an incomplete bathroom with a washbasin and a toilet.  Otherwise, these rooms are equipped in much the same way as rooms of category I. </p><div class="photo" data-original="galavanttravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Superior Room" class="if uuid-2555796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2555796.jpg"></div><p>  Class I and II standards, according to the rules, should be designed for accommodation of no more than 1-2 people.  In the rooms of the 3rd category in hotels, the settlement of a larger number of guests is allowed.  At the same time, the bathroom in them is usually equipped with an incomplete one.  According to the standards, per person in rooms of this variety must have at least 6 m2 <sup>of</sup> area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A large number of guests can also be accommodated in category IV standards at once.  At the same time, a bathroom in such rooms is usually not provided at all.  For the convenience of residents, in this case only a sink is required. </p><p>  Category V rooms are mainly equipped in hostels.  These rooms often have bunk beds.  In hotels in such rooms for one person there should be at least 6 m2 <sup>of</sup> area, in hostels - 4.5 m2 <sup>.</sup> </p><h2>  How standards are equipped </h2><p>  Of course, in the rooms of this type for tourists should be provided with all the necessary furniture and appliances.  Below is a table of requirements in hotels for rooms of various categories of standard class. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="25%"><p>  Category / Facilities </p></td><td width="25%"><p>  Technical equipment </p></td><td width="25%"><p>  Furniture and interior </p></td><td width="25%"><p>  Inventory </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%"><p>  I </p></td><td width="25%"><p>  Phone, TV, alarm clock, computer (at the request of guests), minibar (3-5 *), </p><p>  mini-safe (4-5 *), sockets next to the desk and bed (3-5 *) </p></td><td width="25%"><p>  Bed, bedside table, </p><p>  a cabinet with shelves or a niche for clothes, at least 1 chair per person, a chair for each tenant (5 *), a coffee table (4-5 *), brushes, a sewing kit (3-5 *) </p></td><td width="25%"><p>  Washbasin, toilet bowl, bath / shower, mirror above the washbasin, shelf or table for toiletries, terry mat, bathrobe and slippers (4-5 *), bath hats, toiletries, trash basket, toilet brush </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%"><p>  II </p></td><td rowspan="4" width="25%"><p>  Radio </p></td><td rowspan="4" width="25%"><p>  Bed, bedside mats, bedside table, chairs for every occupant, table, one socket, trash basket, large mirror, brushes, decanter and glasses, bottle opener </p></td><td rowspan="2" width="25%"><p>  Washbasin, toilet bowl, mirror above the washbasin, 2 towels per guest, toilet paper, waste basket, toilet brush </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%"><p>  III </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%"><p>  IV </p></td><td width="25%"><p>  Washbasin, mirror, shelf, 2 towels per guest, toiletries, trash basket </p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%"><p>  V </p></td><td width="25%"><p>  Towels, trash basket </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  These requirements for standards must be observed precisely in Russia.  In other countries, slightly different rules may apply.  But in most cases, the requirements for rooms in different parts of the world are similar. </p><h2>  Studio and Superior Rooms </h2><p>  Superior rooms are essentially the same standards.  But the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch rooms is usually larger.  Most often the most original is the design of hotel housing of this type.  Superior can also differ from the standards in that better quality furniture and appliances are installed here. </p><p>  Studio is a category of rooms in hotels, which are quite spacious rooms with kitchens.  In such rooms, guests, among other things, can use, for example, a stove, microwave, toasters, a set of dishes.  According to the regulations, in Russian hotels the studio area should not be less than 25 m <sup>2</sup> .  These rooms are usually rented by tourists who want to save money in a foreign city or resort on food. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.loversiq.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Family apartment" class="if uuid-2555826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2555826.jpg"></div><h2>  Family rooms </h2><p>  Rooms of this class usually have a large area.  Most often tourists with children rent such rooms.  Family room in most cases consists of one room, and studio - from a bedroom and a living room. </p><p>  Sometimes in a family room in hotels combine two adjacent ordinary.  For ordinary tourists, such housing is rented as separate rooms.  If the family settles in the hotel, the administration opens the door in the wall between the connecting rooms. </p><h2>  Accommodation categories in the hotel rooms: deluxe and deluxe </h2><p>  The rooms of the class Suite and Deluxe are primarily distinguished by an increased level of comfort.  In most cases, a suite is a two-room, well-equipped room.  Such housing, in turn, can also be divided into several categories: </p><ul><li><p>  Normal Suite. </p></li><li><p>  Honeymoon suites for honeymooners. </p></li><li><p>  Presidential suite - presidential suite. </p></li></ul><p>  The last type of suites is equipped only in the most expensive 5 * hotels.  Rooms of this type consist of many rooms for various purposes and are equipped with the highest quality furniture and appliances. </p><p>  Deluxe is a category of accommodation in hotels that differs from Suite only in that it additionally has some ‚Äúfrills‚Äù - noise isolation, a large bed, etc. </p><h2>  What are apartments </h2><p>  This type of room has the largest area.  Apartments are whole apartments with many rooms.  Living conditions here are similar to home.  In addition to a separate kitchen, bedrooms and a bathroom, these rooms usually have a living room and a hall. </p><h2>  Classification according to the number of guests </h2><p>  In this regard, rooms handed over at the hotel can be divided into: </p><ul><li><p>  Single  So-called rooms equipped for only one guest.  This class of accommodation is not available in all hotels. </p></li><li><p>  Double  These rooms are designed for two guests.  Double twin are equipped with 2 single beds.  Simple Double - One. </p></li><li><p>  Triple.  These rooms are populated by three guests. </p></li></ul><p>  The majority of the hotel rooms in the world are based on Double rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.libertyvillagecondo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Room with view" class="if uuid-2555808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2555808.jpg"></div><h2>  Designation of numbers depending on the type of window </h2><p>  This feature may be important when choosing a hotel in a southern country by the sea or, for example, in the historical center of some old city.  Depending on the type of opening, rented accommodation in hotels can be classified into many types.  Most often, according to the standard, the categories of rooms in hotels are as follows: </p><ul><li><p>  Pool View - with windows overlooking the pool; </p></li><li><p>  Sea View - at sea; </p></li><li><p>  City View - on the city; </p></li><li><p>  Mountain View - on the mountains; </p></li><li><p>  Ocean View - on the ocean. </p></li></ul><p>  Indicated in the catalogs of tour operators of the room, depending on the opening types, respectively PV, SV, CV, MV, OV.  Run of house rooms can also be rented at hotels.  The view from the windows of such rooms can be opened absolutely by anyone. </p><p>  In southern hotels, it is best to rent SV and <span><strong>OV</strong></span> rooms <span><strong>.</strong></span>  It is from here that the most beautiful views open in such hotels.  Such rooms in hotels are usually somewhat more expensive than other rooms of the same category in terms of equipment and area. </p><h2>  Classification by location within the hotel </h2><p>  Of course, the convenience of living in a particular room may depend on where in the hotel it is located.  In hotels of different categories often surrender: </p><ul><li><p>  Bungalow (Bungalow) - separate one- or two-story buildings. </p></li><li><p>  Cabana - bungalows located near the pool or on the beach. </p></li><li><p>  Cottages (Cottage). </p></li><li><p>  Executive Floor. </p></li><li><p>  Villas </p></li></ul><p>  Sometimes in hotels only bungalows are equipped.  villas or cottages.  High-rise buildings on the territory of such complexes are not being built.  Hotels of this type are called club (Holiday Village).  In catalogs, they are referred to as HV.  HV1 at the same time - hotels 4-5 *, HV2 - 2-3 *. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelnepomuk.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Honeymoon Room" class="if uuid-2555802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2555802.jpg"></div><p>  If the room is rented in the main building of a regular hotel, it will most likely be marked as MB (Main Building).  Sometimes in hotels one or several floors can be reserved for rooms, the residents of which are provided with any additional services.  These numbers will be called Executive Floor. </p><h2>  Hotel Categories </h2><p>  Thus, which rooms can be rented in hotels, we found out.  What can be the categories of the hotels themselves?  The comfort level of ordinary hotels is determined, of course, primarily by stardom. </p><p>  Hotels "without stars" or 0 * provide their guests with a minimum of services.  But at the same time, residents of such hotels can count on access to hot and cold water, ventilation and heating.  The highest category rooms in a starless hotel are usually standards III or II class maximum. </p><p>  Hotels 1 * and 2 * are in most cases hostels, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãrooms in which is 8-10 m <sup>2</sup> .  Bathrooms in such complexes are located on the floors.  One toilet / shower room for 5 rooms is the usual level of equipment in this category of hotels.  Hotel rooms are cleaned no more than once a week.  There are no hotels of this variety and almost no amenities on site.  The maximum that their guests can count on is a dining room, bar or buffet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arthousehotelliverpool.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Room with original design" class="if uuid-2555798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2555798.jpg"></div><p>  3 * hotels offer tourists a slightly higher level of service.  The requirements for rooms of various categories in hotels of this class are higher.  In such complexes usually have a restaurant, swimming pool, parking.  The rooms for guests can, among other things, include hairdryers, safes, air conditioning, televisions, minibars or refrigerators.  This category of hotels is most popular among tourists.  For relatively little money, in complexes of this type you can relax more or less comfortably. </p><p>  The most common categories of rooms in hotels * 3 * - I class standards.  Superior rooms, studios and family rooms can also be rented here. </p><p>  4 * hotels offer guests rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãat least 14 m <sup>2</sup> .  In the bathroom in such hotels for tourists provides a constantly replenished set of household chemicals for swimming.  Cleaning and linen change in hotels of this category are made daily.  On the territory of such complexes often spas, baths and saunas work in addition, there is a separate infrastructure for children.  Most often, hotels of this type rent standards, suites, deluxe rooms, family rooms and apartments. </p><p>  5 * hotels offer tourists the same as 4 *, but higher quality.  The rooms here have a very large area and are serviced around the clock.  On the territory of such hotels should operate at least 4 restaurants.  In most cases, 5 * hotels operate on an all-inclusive basis.  The highest category of rooms in 5 * hotels is the presidential.  But most of all here suites, deluxes or villas are usually rented. </p><div class="photo" data-original="indonesia.tripcanvas.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Luxury rooms" class="if uuid-2555803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2555803.jpg"></div><p>  Hotels 6-7 * - this is a very high class of institutions, accommodation in which is prohibitively expensive.  The guests of such hotels can have, for example, a personal chef and driver, as well as a butler.  There are no more than a dozen hotels of this class around the world. </p>
