In common parlance, these are the Kamelia 1 and Kamelia 2 hotels. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  They can not be called beach, because both are located in the city, a few streets from the sea.  But, nevertheless, they offer tourists who come on vacation good housing, service and food for a price that does not bite at all.  Probably, therefore, some tour operators advertise them just for spending time at sea. </p><p>  "Camellia 2" - the hotel Camellia 2 Hotel Nha Trang 2 * - has two and a half stars according to the generally accepted classification, so it can be found under the guise of both "kopecks" and "three rubles".  Recently it was renamed so that there was no confusion, and it is called The World Hotel. </p><p>  Of course, you will not see here magnificent palaces, parks and a vast territory.  Everything is budget and compact, but clean and comfortable.  And the money that you would pay for a stay in a more expensive hotel can be spent on travel, entertainment or shopping.  Let's see what tourists say about these inexpensive options for an exotic vacation, and at the same time find out which one is more popular with travelers.  It is also advisable that travelers do not confuse these two hotels, but find out which one suits them best. </p>

    <h2>  Resort Center </h2><p>  Now let's talk about the area where both hotels are located.  "Camellia 1" is located in the so-called central sector of the city.  As for the Camellia 2 Nha Trang Hotel 2 * hotel <span>(Vietnam, Nha Trang), reviews</span> indicate that it is also not on the outskirts.  But the first is still closer to the ‚Äúparty‚Äù part of the city.  This is the European quarter, where literally at every step you can meet either a bar, a disco, or a night club. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are also many hotels designed for spa guests, and a variety of shops, including jewelry.  Almost everywhere there are signs in Russian.  Despite the central location of the area, the beaches are clean.  In the European quarter is also the Nha Trang Cathedral.  Two routes of city buses go here - the second and fourth.  Riding them is safe; they are comfortable, air-conditioned, with soft seats. </p><p>  In some ways, the center of Nha Trang, from the point of view of our tourists, is similar to the classic Soviet resorts.  Along the ocean there is a promenade, beautiful, equipped, with paths and playgrounds.  And the whole tourist life is concentrated between two streets running perpendicular to the sea. </p><p>  Of course, you will not always walk in one European quarter.  You will want to look at the <span>Chama towers,</span> and at the villas of Bao Dai - the last emperor, and much more.  Excursion bureaus and travel companies are in the hotels themselves and in the surrounding streets.  And some attractions can be reached on foot or by bus. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the hotel "Kamelia 1" </h2><p>  Now let's see what travelers say.  This "Camellia" has a very high rating among tourists, despite its two stars.  Although the hotel Camellia 2 and higher in classification, however, it has not so much popularity, at least among travelers from Russia.  Almost everyone recommends ‚ÄúCamellia 1‚Äù and assures that they will return here more than once.  The linen is clean, the rooms are spacious, the cleaning is good, the breakfasts are hearty. </p><p>  The location is great.  It is especially appreciated that it is not too far to walk to cheap cafes and shops on foot.  And having a supermarket nearby is an added bonus.  No one expects from this hotel, God knows what service and comfort.  People are well aware that they paid money for a place to sleep and so that there was a place where to put things.  At the same time, many rated the hotel services as very good for the "deuce".  The hotel is also suitable for lovers of "hanging out".  Not far from it there is a night club ‚ÄúWinter‚Äù, where Russian tourists often gather. </p><h2>  Camellia 2 Hotel Nha Trang 3 * Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists call Camellia 2 a good budget hotel.  Larger rooms are very comfortable.  But guests complain of poor sound insulation, because noise is heard from the street and from neighboring bars.  In addition, the hotel is far from the entertainment center of Nha Trang.  Gorky Park, for example, cannot be reached on foot.  But public transport does not pass by.  Need to take a taxi. </p><p>  But next to this hotel there is the Russian Information Center, where you can find out all the necessary information for vacationers and buy cheap tours.  All sights of Nha Trang are nearby.  Yes, and the hotel food is excellent, there are dishes for all tastes and wishes. </p>
