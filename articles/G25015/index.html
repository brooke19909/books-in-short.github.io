  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where can I exchange a torn bill?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Is it possible to change a torn bill?  Will the store accept money that has been torn?  Will it be possible to take the damaged currency to the bank?  Will the commission be withheld?  These and many other questions greatly concern those people who accidentally ruined their banknotes.  Answers to the above questions depend on a number of conditions that are described in the article. </p><h2>  Exchange at the store </h2><p>  Many times faced the situation when not the most friendly seller refuses to pay for goods with damaged banknotes.  And here we are not even talking about torn bills - in most cases, the store employee does not want to accept even a neatly and high-quality sticky tape or slightly cut piece of paper. </p><p>  Is this legitimate?  Not.  The seller must accept the bill in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  the banknote is simply worn out and slightly dirty; </li><li>  there are small punctures on the money, leaking oil stains, inscriptions; </li><li>  the banknote has no corners. </li></ul><p>  After the collection is held in the store, the bank employees themselves will remove the torn bill from circulation.  That is why the bill, the authenticity of which there is no doubt, should be accepted at the store without any questions. </p><p>  So do torn bills in a store accept in practice?  And the answer is no again.  You can spend much less nerves if you immediately take the damaged money to the bank, and not try to prove your case to the seller. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mogilev.online" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shop seller" class="if uuid-2658653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99258/2658653.jpg"></div><h2>  Exchange of torn banknote in Sberbank </h2><p>  If you doubt that the seller will not argue with you and does not look with a displeased look, then use the services of the bank.  In Sberbank, as well as in any other bank in Russia, you can exchange a torn note, heavily burned money, even half a banknote.  Of course, provided that more than 55% of it was preserved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Banks have their own interest in the fact that damaged money is withdrawn from circulation and not used in the future.  Firstly, this issue has an aesthetic component.  Secondly, after removing such a bill, the risk of technical nuances disappears.  Money is recounted by special machines, which always accept torn notes without problems.  A similar situation with infokiosks.  Such cash-operated ATMs often do not even respond to simply aged and slightly wrinkled banknotes. </p><p>  It is possible that a banknote will be taken from you, but a new one will not be issued in exchange.  This happens if it is not possible to determine the authenticity of the bill.  In the case when the authenticity of the banknote is clearly visible, no questions will arise, and new money will be issued in return. </p><p>  If the amount of money exchanged does not exceed 15 thousand rubles, then the exchange will be made without an identity document.  Simply put, you will be exchanged for money without a passport.  Larger amounts will have to be changed if documents are available. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bolshoyvopros.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="exchange bank" class="if uuid-2658652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99258/2658652.jpg"></div><h2>  Banknotes to be exchanged at a bank </h2><p>  You can easily return a torn note to the bank.  In addition, you will receive a banknote that is glued from several parts.  Even if you brought the so-called ‚Äúcollage‚Äù (a bill of three or more parts), the bank employee is obliged to accept it in the event that all the pieces will belong to one bill.  Paper money with tears is also accepted.  They can either be glued or left as they are.  The number of tears does not matter.  The main thing is that the bill was not all in them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you accidentally laundered money and bleached it, this will not be an obstacle to the exchange.  A bank employee will take from you any burned-out, stained, and written-out banknote. </p><p>  You can safely carry to the bank even a badly burned bill, if the remaining 55% of it does not have any damage. </p><p>  Well, and, of course, all bills with minor damage (scuffs, punctures, spots and missing corners) are subject to exchange. </p><p>  All of the above cases will allow you to exchange damaged money, and not just give it to a bank employee and not get anything in return. </p><p>  The exchange of Russian rubles is made on the same day without any delay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.finuse.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian ruble" class="if uuid-2658650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99258/2658650.jpg"></div><h2>  Questions with foreign currency </h2><p>  If the Russian rubles will be exchanged without any problems (of course, subject to the above conditions), then problems with foreign currency may arise.  And you will come across the first of them when you are informed about the commission.  It can make up to 10% of the amount exchanged.  Why so much?  Everything is explained easily and simply.  Often, an examination determining the authenticity of a bill is carried out at the manufacturer's bank at his expense.  The process can take from one week to several months. </p><p>  Another question arises when you present the bill itself.  If the bank takes dollars, euros and the currency of nearby European countries, then banknotes of ‚Äúdistant‚Äù states may simply not be available.  Therefore, complaints about such a refusal by the Central Bank will not be considered. </p><p>  And the requirements in foreign currency will be slightly tightened.  Euros and dollars should keep 50% of their surface, Belarusian rubles and Ukrainian hryvnias - 45%. </p><p>  In this regard, a low percentage of foreign currency exchange has been documented, both by Sberbank and other banks (both state and commercial). </p><div class="photo" data-original="dengi.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Torn dollar" class="if uuid-2660124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99258/2660124.jpg"></div><h2>  Commission for the exchange of Russian rubles </h2><p>  Before 2010, everyone who exchanged even Russian rubles faced withholding up to 5% of the amount exchanged in favor of the bank.  There is currently no such practice.  No bank can oblige to pay for the examination, withhold a commission. </p><p>  Similarly, banks do not have the right to refuse to exchange damaged notes when all the necessary aspects have been taken into account.  If you have been refused several banking institutions, but the banknote is suitable for the above requirements, you can leave your data and a complaint on the website of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  The complaint will be examined within 15 working days, after which a specialist will contact you and help to solve the problem. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rubliplus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="money collage" class="if uuid-2658651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99258/2658651.jpg"></div><h2>  Expertise </h2><p>  In the situation with the aforementioned ‚Äúcollage‚Äù, the bank may require an examination.  If your banknote is collected in more than four parts, then it will be sent for verification.  The same will happen with a large number of breaks.  Duration of examination - 10 working days. </p>
