It seemed as if this was not a device from China, but the developing Samsung just a couple of years ago.  However, the actions of the manufacturer, some buyers are not appreciably welcome.  This is due to the fact that new models come out literally with a gap of one year.  Moreover, their characteristics and design are largely the same.  That smartphone, which will be discussed later, is considered a ‚Äúseparator‚Äù between similar models.  Consider its parameters and reviews in more detail later in the article. </p>

    <h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The smartphone comes in a regular cardboard box.  The content is not impressive, as it is standard.  There is a cable, charger, clip and all the necessary documents.  There are no headphones.  In the reviews for the Meizu U20 they write good words about the configuration. </p><h2>  Design and usability </h2><p>  Before the phone was released, it became clear a long time ago: it was time to change the design.  It noticeably "become familiar" and has become too commonplace.  The U20 device immediately stands out from its "colleagues", primarily due to the design.  An attempt to make any changes on the part of the developers was 100% successful.  Buyers noticed successful and pleasant innovations, this is clear from the positive reviews on the Web. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you look back, the entire previous model range revolved around the body of plastic and metal.  Judging by the reviews of the Meizu U20, a frame that looks fresh is added to the new device.  The device is sold in black, gold and white.  But there is another interesting option.  Less common are models with a pink back panel and a white front panel. </p><p>  All other design nuances are made entirely in the style of the manufacturer.  The frontal part is as symmetrical as possible.  Below the screen is a key.  She controls the phone, a fingerprint is built into it.  Its functional purpose is ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúGo Back‚Äù.  The front camera is located next to the earpiece on the rear panel.  There you can find special sensors.  The event indicator "found a place" under the glass.  The owners note that in the off mode it is problematic to notice it. </p><p>  On the left panel is a slot for a memory card and external drive.  It is designed for the size of "nano".  On the right side you can notice a special button that is responsible for turning on the phone.  A little higher is the "swing" of the volume.  The top panel received a second microphone.  The speaker and other connectors are located below. </p><p>  If we consider the device from the side, then it is not in the best possible way.  But in general, as buyers write, tolerant.  The metal frame is not made whole, but from small overlays.  As a rule, such solutions are found in budget smartphones.  However, unlike these models, in the described phone the joints are invisible, and everything is perfectly adjusted. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Ease of use Meizu U20 at an average level.  Although the device is beautiful, it‚Äôs difficult to hold the device in your hands due to its rectangular shape and rounded corners.  Discomfort enhances the screen of medium dimensions - 5.5 inches. </p><p>  But buyers note some good points in ergonomics.  For example, many liked the physical type key below the screen.  In general, about the buttons - only the side details confuse.  In some models they are weak and have a bad move. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Almost the entire panel of the smartphone is a 5.5-inch display.  It is IPS-type.  Gives resolution of quality Full HD.  Reviews about Meizu U20 confirm this.  A special <span>protective glass</span> is located on the screen <span>.</span>  It received an oleophobic type coating, the edges are rounded.  The developer basically did not try to achieve the effect of joining the edges.  Accordingly, the screen matrix was surrounded by a black frame.  The front panel is white.  Thanks to this solution, the device looks neat. </p><p>  The display brightness varies from 2 to 345 cd / m2.  Contrast ratio changes from 1 to 740. It cannot be said that these numbers are ideal, but they are considered good indicators for the price category.  Thanks to these characteristics, you can choose a more or less successful and optimal level for using the device both in a dark room and in direct sunlight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Color reproduction at a good level.  The matrix copes with this task perfectly.  The picture does not seem too saturated, rather, the manufacturer tried to achieve the most natural transfer of each shade.  The brightness adjustment sensor works smoothly, but slowly.  In short, we should only clarify that the display is good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu u20 32gb rose gold reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2014975.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware Platform, Runtime </h2><p>  If we talk about the characteristics of the phone, then they are completely identical to the Meizu M3 Note.  For those who are not familiar with its filling, we give the basic data.  The reviews for Meizu U20 make it clear that the phones are really quite similar. </p><p>  The smartphone runs on the MediaTek chipset.  It is sold immediately in two versions: 2 and 16 GB of operational and internal storage, 3 and 32 GB, respectively.  The slot for SIM cards is also suitable for use instead of a second subscriber number - a flash drive.  Built-in bluetooth, internet and navigation modules.  There is no radio.  MicroUSB is selected as the connector.  The last two decisions can often be observed with <span>budget phones.</span> </p><p>  Such characteristics will be enough to play your favorite applications in comfortable conditions.  You can use it for normal viewing of sites in a browser or communication on social networks. </p><p>  In comparison with the above competitor (Meizu M3 Note), the battery capacity was reduced from 4100 to 3260 mAh.  Of course, this greatly affected the battery life.  If you load the phone at an average level, then it will last no more than a day.  Users claim that sometimes a device without recharging is able to work even less - one light day.  The battery consumption reflects the use of mobile Internet, instant messengers and other applications.  The operating time has not fallen so critically, but buyers believe that developers could increase the figure through optimization. </p><p>  If we talk about playback, it should be noted that the characteristics are identical to the M3 Note.  And we are talking about sound through both headphones and speakers.  Last explosive, quality is good.  The speaker has a decent volume margin.  However, for many buyers, its sound seems harsh.  This may affect the perception of the interlocutor‚Äôs voice ‚Äî he seems different.  The sound chip is not integrated. </p><h2>  Software platform </h2><p>  <span>The Meizu</span> U20 (32Gb) <span>phone</span> , whose owner reviews are described in detail below, works on the Android operating system version 6.0.  Often, buyers purchase Chinese modifications of the device in online stores.  They note that most of the sellers for Ukrainian owners specifically set up the phone - install Google services and change the firmware. </p><p>  Due to the use of a shell from the developer, the device differs from many other competitors in unique software.  At the same time, ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù works in the background - all functionality depends on Flyme OS. </p><p>  How is the shell different?  She is simple and concise.  The interface is as clear as possible.  Consumers note this as a virtue.  The system is easy to manage.  The mTouch key performs the ‚ÄúBack‚Äù function if you touch it.  Pressing sends to the desktop, and when held - the smartphone is blocked.  If you want to know which applications are open, you should swipe from the bottom of the screen. </p><p>  Users with experience may be surprised at certain nuances.  For example, the firmware does not work with the Google Now assistant.  Notifications either do not arrive at all, or are delivered with a huge delay.  Application icons are ugly. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The cameras are completely similar to those installed on the M3 Note.  This is confirmed by the reviews of the owners of Meizu U20 (32Gb).  The module is designed for 13 megapixels.  Built-in autofocus, there is a flash.  The front camera received a resolution of 5 megapixels. </p><p>  In principle, the matrices are ordinary, there are no features.  Technologies are standard.  The same ones are installed on many budget smartphones.  If the lighting is good, you get almost perfect shots.  The interface itself is fast and clear.  In difficult conditions, in which you sometimes have to take photos, unfortunately, the matrix will let you down.  Pictures will not be high quality.  This nuance should be considered when buying a device.  But if we draw a parallel with pricing, then the camera seems quite adequate and suitable in cost.  Better to expect and not worth it. </p>

    <h2>  Media and files </h2><p>  In principle, most Meizu phones were considered the leaders in the number of video formats played.  This model was no exception.  Utilities for working with video and audio are standard.  The headphones have excellent playback.  Distortion and interference can sometimes occur, however, all this can be solved by calibration. </p><p>  Buyers in reviews of Meizu U20 Rose Gold (32 Gb) note that sound testing is at a good level.  Of course, to more expensive options from the same manufacturer, the quality still grows and grows, but do not forget about the difference in price.  For a cost of 13 thousand rubles, the reproduction is ideal.  Ordinary music lovers will happily listen to music on this device, and the volume will be enough with a large margin.  Claims to implement this issue do not arise. </p><h2>  Wireless Modules &amp; Network </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the phone received standard wireless interfaces - no features and new products.  This is evidenced by user reviews of the Meizu U20.  Add-ons are also missing.  Only nano-type SIM cards can be used.  However, the second slot for the number is hybrid - it is suitable for a flash drive, so you have to choose. </p><p>  SIM cards are recognized instantly by the device.  At the same time, you can install them while the operating system is turned on.  The network runs smoothly, there are no problems, the signal level has a good indicator. </p><p>  All applications work well.  The only drawback is the 20 second launch of the navigator.  The start is cold and makes the user wait.  It copes with all its functions perfectly. </p><p>  You can directly say that the phone has no problems with the signals and the network as a whole.  The hybrid connector is no longer considered a disadvantage for a long time, since it is widely used.  And the start of the navigator in less than half a second few people will infuriate. </p>

    <h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The battery installed on the <span>smartphone Meizu</span> U20 (32GB) Rose Gold, reviews of which are positive, with a capacity of 3260 mAh, shows itself perfectly, although the figure is not a record. </p><p>  In browsing mode, the phone will last 7 hours.  Music - about 24 hours., Video - 9 hours.  If you use your smartphone in active mode, you will have to charge it after 5 hours. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Reviews about Meizu U20 let you know that it is created from high-quality and beautiful details.  Price is competitive.  The display is considered not bad - so say the buyers.  A fingerprint scanner is built into the key, which is also responsible for managing the operating system.  Accordingly, there are no unnecessary details - this is a separate plus. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Meizu U20 (16 GB) reviews say the software has minor bugs and can sometimes give out crashes.  There may be models with a bad move of the physical key.  The speaker is too sharp. </p>

    <h2>  General customer experience </h2><p>  Buyers mark this phone as one of the best in the assortment range of the manufacturer.  All reviews of Meizu U20 (32Gb) LTE confirm this.  In its characteristics, it is almost completely similar to the M3 Note variant.  Therefore, many have similar feelings when working with a new device.  On the territory of Russia and Ukraine, the cost between the models differs minimally.  If the owner is primarily important to the appearance of the device, then you need to pay attention to the U20. </p><h2>  Comparison with Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 </h2><p>  What should be noted first of all is the cost of a competitor of the described model.  If Meizu U20 can be purchased for 18 thousand, then the Redmi version for 13 thousand rubles.  Both phones are running the sixth version of Android.  RAM U20 is 2 GB, like Redmi Note 4. Standard modifications of the first model offer the buyer 16 GB of internal storage, while the second phone - 64 GB.  Meizu U20 (32Gb) LTE Dual Sim received good reviews. </p><p>  The resolution and diagonal of the screens for these smartphones are the same.  The same should be said about cameras and their matrices.  You can use a memory card and two mobile numbers.  Among the wireless interfaces, it should be noted the Internet and bluetooth.  Both phones support the navigation function.  Xiaomi's battery is larger than Meizu's: 4100 mAh.
