Many Russians try to go abroad on vacation, forgetting about their native expanses.  Perhaps they just do not know the best places to stay in Russia.  This error needs to be fixed urgently.  Admire together amazing places to relax in the homeland. </p><h2>  Time to relax - summer </h2><p>  In Russia, for a better beach holiday, it is not difficult to find a place.  Summer is a time of long-awaited vacation, unbridled fun and adventure.  Dancing until the morning, the sun, the sea, the beach, cold ice cream and, of course, chocolate tan.  Moreover, many people think that becoming a ‚Äúchocolate bar‚Äù is possible only at Mediterranean resorts.  But no!  A tan no worse than Mediterranean can be obtained in the native expanses.  So, the best places to stay in Russia in the summer are presented below. </p><h2>  Crimea </h2><p>  Sea, sun, summer, beach ... This is a unique place with an ideal climate.  In connection with the recent political events, tourists have not decreased a bit.  Quite the contrary!  Those who were once captivated by local beauties return again and again to their favorite places. </p><p>  The best seaside vacation spot in Russia is Crimea.  He is ready to receive tourists throughout the year.  Of course, the swimming season lasts from May to October.  But even in winter, a tourist will find something to have fun on the peninsula.  The list of attractions is simply impressive: </p><ul><li>  Golden Sands in Feodosia. </li><li>  The Swallow's Nest is a legendary architectural structure. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.dunyabulteni.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best places to stay in Russia" class="if uuid-2834564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/2834564.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The bays of Cape Fiolent are a picturesque place. </li><li>  Massandra Palace Museum. </li><li>  Cave city Mangup (Middle Ages). </li><li>  Marble cave Chatyr-Dag. </li><li>  The beautiful nature reserve Karadag. </li></ul><p>  And this is not the whole list of unique places.  They, of course, must see with your own eyes every tourist.  Massifs, palaces, temples of ancient times, mountain lakes, amazing waterfalls - and that‚Äôs all in the native Crimea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The best vacation spots on the Black Sea coast of Russia are concentrated on the peninsula, namely: Yalta, Balaklava, Yevpatoriya, Alushta, Sudak, etc. </p><p>  Crimea is an ideal place to relax with the whole family.  For children there is a lot of entertainment. </p><p>  But for active and courageous youth, we recommend visiting Cape Tarkanhun.  Surfers and divers gather here every summer.  And the highest peak of the Ai-Petri Peninsula in winter is a paradise for skiers and snowboarders. </p><p>  Of course, not all places for recreation are listed.  It all depends on your time, desires and material means.  And to see everything, everyone needs to come here again and again.  And every time the peninsula will surprise you. </p><h2>  Sochi </h2><p>  Of course, Sochi is not Egypt and not Turkey.  But the 2014 Winter Olympics transformed the city as it should.  Therefore, with each season, the flow of tourists increases. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.73790138009517" data-lng="39.7066884796875" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="8"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/0/7/9/9079.png"></div><p>  The warm sea, watermelons, kebabs, honey baklava - and this is their own flavor and charm, which many tourists will never exchange for ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù abroad.  Sochi is another best seaside vacation destination in Russia. </p><p>  In winter, in Sochi, you can freely snowboard on the snowy peaks, and after an hour to warm your bones on the beach. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Every tourist should see the Olympic Village with his own eyes.  It is located at 1,100 meters above sea level. </p><p>  Sochi has an adventure park at its height - Skypark.  All over the world there are only eight.  And one of them is in Russia. </p><p>  Agursky waterfalls - a cascade of waterfalls, which is located on the Agur River, in the Khostinsky district, just four kilometers from the Black Sea coast.  And the coast of Turkey is not even needed! </p><div class="photo" data-original="laurenceourac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best places to stay in Russia" class="if uuid-2834518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/2834518.jpg"></div><p>  Singing fountains, amusement parks, a huge arboretum, the largest oceanarium, caves, waterfalls, dolmens, lakes and rivers - and you will be guaranteed an unforgettable vacation experience in Sochi. </p><h2>  Top 12 interesting destinations for holidays in Russia </h2><p>  In order not to throw hard-earned money to the wind, we will consider vacation options in Russia.  The ranking of the best places, landscapes, attractions and cultures is presented below. </p><h2>  1. Karelia </h2><p>  The Republic of Karelia is considered one of the most beautiful places in Russia.  This unique region is located in the northwestern part of the country.  Often families come here from all over Russia to spend their holidays.  And not by chance.  In Karelia there are many beautiful picturesque waterfalls, lakes, powerful forests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="feel-planet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful places in Russia to relax" class="if uuid-2834161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/2834161.jpg"></div><p>  The largest settlement is Ruskeala.  It is in this place that an amazing park is located, which was built of marble. </p><p>  Extreme lovers will also find something to do here.  You can go diving. </p><h2>  2. Kabardino-Balkaria </h2><p>  This is a small North Caucasian republic, which is striking in its features and picturesqueness.  It is in this place - the highest point in Europe - Elbrus.  Therefore, tourists come here from all over the world. </p><p>  But this is not one attraction of Kabardino-Balkaria.  What is the Cherek gorge with its blue lakes, the Chegem waterfalls, the Baksan gorge leading to Elbrus - and these places of rest in Russia need to be seen firsthand. </p><p>  You can plunge into greatness, breathe in full with fresh healing air in the capital of the republic - Nalchik. </p><p>  Be sure to visit one of the oldest volcanoes of Mingi-Tau, the eternal mountain of wisdom, the national park and the tract of Jily-Su.  Of course, the vacation will not be complete if you do not climb the sacred Elbrus. </p><h2>  3. Mountain Ingushetia </h2><p>  Arriving in this country, every tourist as if plunges into a real fairy tale.  Unique mountain landscapes, original monuments, towers, ancient legends and myths.  Ingushetia is a ‚Äútime machine‚Äù country that allows you to return a thousand years ago. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wallpapersmania.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best seaside vacation destination in Russia" class="if uuid-2834184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/2834184.jpg"></div><p>  The real treasure of this mountainous country is the unique towers and temples.  The largest tower community is Egical.  It is called a ghost town.  Tagim is also the oldest village, but the "younger brother" of Egical.  Vovnushki - a place of military and majestic towers that once inflicted death on opponents. </p><p>  But the diamond of Ingushetia is the ancient temple of Christians - Thaba-Erda.  However, the history of its creation is far from Orthodox. </p><p>  Ingushetia is like another planet in which time stops and takes your breath away from the local beauties. </p><h2>  4. Kamchatka </h2><p>  The best places to stay in Russia are located in Kamchatka.  This is one of the most interesting places in his native country.  Travelers from all over the world dream of getting here. </p><p>  Kamchatka is not a Crimean resort.  Most likely, rest here will be active-extreme.  Due to the wild and harsh nature, Kamchatka has its own special appeal.  Volcanoes, geyser valleys, canyons, blue and acid lakes are the most picturesque and beautiful places on the peninsula. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wulkanyswiata.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best places to stay in Russia" class="if uuid-2834209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/2834209.jpg"></div><p>  Be sure to go fishing and try the real Kamchatka caviar!  Many tourists bathe in the Paratunka thermal springs.  And if you come to Kamchatka in the winter, don‚Äôt be afraid and from the bottom of your heart ride in a team with a husky. </p><p>  And for dessert - the Komandorski Islands, which seem to be lost in Kamchatka.  Here is a place for solitude with oneself, nature and thoughts.  Where else can you feel this? </p><h2>  5. Baikal </h2><p>  How much is hidden in this word!  This is the most picturesque and mysterious lake on the whole planet.  Great Baikal - more than 20 million years.  Can you imagine?  It is the deepest lake in the whole world.  Moreover, the most unique and precious in it is 19% of fresh water reserves. </p><p>  You can talk about the nature of Baikal for hours without a break.  No matter where you go, you won‚Äôt be disappointed anywhere.  You will fall in love with Baikal! </p><div class="photo" data-original="twigaten.204504byse.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best places to stay in Russia in winter" class="if uuid-2834281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/2834281.jpg"></div><p>  Be sure to visit the largest island of Baikal - Olkhon.  Do not forget to admire the legendary Shaman-rock, to taste delicious omul in the village of Listvyanka.

But, having been here once, you will definitely come back again. </p><h2>  6. The Republic of Komi </h2><p>  One of the best places to stay in Russia is concentrated in the Komi Republic.  However, not every tourist dares to come here on vacation.  There are no ski <span>resorts, resorts.</span>  The Komi Republic is harsh and wild nature, powerful forests untouched by man, pristine lakes - romance that is not understood by everyone. </p><p>  One of the main attractions is the weathering pillars on the Man-Pupu-Ner plateau.  There are seven of them, and the height is up to 42 meters.  In 2008, <span>this attraction was</span> included in the list of seven wonders of Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="steemit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best vacation spots in the south of Russia" class="if uuid-2834330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/2834330.jpg"></div><p>  You should definitely visit one of the largest reserves in our country - "Yugyd Va".  A huge territory with wildlife that has not been touched by man.

Lake Seliger, Tver and Novgorod regions </h2><p>  This is another place that needs no introduction.  Seliger is also called Ostashkovsky lake.

It has glacial roots.  Because of this, he has a peculiar form.  This is not an ordinary lake, but rather looks like a chain of lakes, which are connected by 110 channels.  This is one of the best places to stay in Russia. </p><h2>  10. Eastern Siberia </h2><p>  Sayans in the East and West - two mountain systems - the best places of rest in the south of Russia. </p><p>  Western Sayan up to 3971 m high is Mount Mongun-Taiga.
