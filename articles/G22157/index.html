This is not at all surprising, because the number of attractions in this city amazes any of its guests.  Therefore, travelers who intend to go to the northern capital need to familiarize themselves with the list of what to see in St. Petersburg in the first place. </p><h2>  Mosque </h2><p>  Any tourist who is looking for something to see in St. Petersburg in winter just needs to visit the mosque, which is located in the historical center of the city.  A huge turquoise dome and two minarets stand out clearly in the general panorama of the city, and the interior of the cathedral is completely mesmerizing with its luxury and elegance. </p>

The architects were elected N.V.  Vasiliev, S.S.  Krichinsky and A.I.  Gauguin.  They sought to create a structure that would be close to Muslim culture, but fit well into the panorama of the northern capital.  A solution has been found.  Some elements of the building were borrowed from Central Asian architecture, and the walls are faced with granite, which fits perfectly into the architecture of St. Petersburg.
