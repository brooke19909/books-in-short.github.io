Of course, most seek to buy tours to Sharm El Sheikh, but Hurghada is very popular.  Neither on beaches, nor in infrastructure, nor in the number of hotels, this resort is inferior to Sharm.  Both here and there are many fashionable hotels of both 5 and <span>4 stars.</span>  By the way, the latter are most popular among Russians.  So, more than 50% of vacationers using the Fortuna Hurghada 4 * system (see photo in the article) are tourists from different cities of the Russian Federation, as well as <span>CIS countries.</span> </p><h2>  Hurghada: A Short Excursion </h2><p>  From the <span>capital of Egypt,</span> this resort city is distant for 500 kilometers.  It is the capital of one of the twenty-six provinces of the country.  The shores of Hurghada are washed by the Red Sea.  The underwater kingdom near the coast is a real paradise for fans of snorkeling and diving.  The biggest advantage of <span>resorts in Egypt,</span> including Hurghada, is that here you can enjoy a <span>beach holiday</span> throughout the year.  No trade winds, storms or showers will not interfere with your vacation.  Hurghada as a settlement was founded at the beginning of the 20th century.  Of course, this was not a city, but an ordinary fishing village.  Today, beautiful buildings of hotel complexes and hotels rise here, which give the city a beautiful and modern look.  Among the hotels there are the most ordinary ‚Äúkopecks‚Äù and representatives of world hotel brands.  Tourists arriving through the Fortuna Hurghada 4 * system will be accommodated in one of the comfortable four-star resort hotels, besides at a very competitive price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fortuna hurghada 4" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/783092.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Tourists who choose a holiday on the Fortuna Hurghada 4 * system can take part in animations organized by instructors.  In some hotels, yoga, water aerobics, etc. are taught in the mornings.  Throughout the day you can play boccia, darts, etc.  Sometimes there are theme nights with belly dancing, live music and Arabian food.  On the territory of all hotels, without exception, there are several outdoor and, conversely, indoor pools.  Next to them are tanning areas, and in the winter, when the air temperature drops to 20-25 degrees, the water in the pools is heated.  The hotels have fitness centers with a gym, billiards and table tennis, for children there is a mini club, a playground, a sandbox and slides, a mini disco, etc. </p><h2>  Fortuna Hurghada 4 *: reviews and comments of tourists </h2><p>  Of course, those who like to relax on the highest level, it is better not to register in the "Fortune" system.  Although here you can find the perfect combination of price and quality.  The minimum price for the tour is 19,000 rubles per week (including air travel).  Despite this, in Egyptian 4 * hotels you will find the perfect combination of price and quality.  And this is evidenced by the comments of former guests.  In principle, this is a pretty profitable booking system.  However, many tourists are confused by the fact that before departure to Hurghada they do not know what awaits them upon arrival.  Someone is lucky and their reviews are positive, but someone is not very happy, and then we can meet a whole bunch of dissatisfied statements. </p>
