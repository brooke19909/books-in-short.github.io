    <p>  As for the prices, they are very high here.  On average, the bill for one vacationer is about 6-7 thousand rubles, but for this cost a lot of incredible emotions are provided that will remain in your memory for a long time. </p><p>  Address Soho Rooms: Moscow, 12 Savvinskaya Embankment, Building 8 (the nearest metro stations are Frunzenskaya, Kievskaya and Sportivnaya). </p>
