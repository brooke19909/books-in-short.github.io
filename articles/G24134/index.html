This device appeared on sale more than a year ago, but even now its performance makes it easy to solve most problems.  At the same time, its price has significantly decreased over this time, but the quality has not changed.  The reliability of the gadget is not satisfactory - the device works stably. </p><h2>  CPU </h2>

It consists of four cores of the ‚ÄúCortex A7‚Äù revision and each of them operates at a frequency of 1.2 GHz in the highest load mode.  If the device is not loaded or in standby mode, then their frequency decreases to 250 MHz.  With a minimum load, a situation is possible when in general only one of them is in operation.  This decision of Chinese engineers can significantly save battery life.  But all these are "dry" numbers, which are not clear for poorly informed buyers.  In reality, the resources of this CPU are enough for most tasks: watching movies, listening to music and radio, surfing the web, typing and editing office documents.  Even with toys should not be a problem with a few exceptions.  Only the most demanding applications of the latest generation of such a plan will not be able to work on the device in which the MTK 6589 processor with the ‚ÄúW‚Äù index is installed.

Screen resolution - 1280x720 pixels, that is, the picture on the screen is displayed in hd quality.  The pixel density in this case is acceptable today 312 PPI.  The type of IPS matrix used provides maximum viewing angles for the Lenovo S820 display.  The screen and quad-core processor are harmoniously complemented by a graphics card model SGX 544 developed by PowerVR.  In sum, all of the above allows you to provide a high-quality image on the display screen, which, moreover, moves smoothly, without jerking.

    <h2>  Appearance and usability </h2><p>  The impressive <span>overall dimensions</span> of this smartphone are: length 139 mm, height 69 mm and thickness 8.9 mm.  The weight of the device is only 143 g!  Despite the fact that the Lenovo S820 display has a diagonal of 4.7 inches, the device easily fits in your hand and allows you to safely control yourself even with one hand.  According to the characteristics, this smartphone belongs to the class of monoblocks with the possibility of touch input.  The front panel of the device is made of protective glass, which allows you to do without the protective film that comes with the device, so that there are no problems with protecting the front of the gadget.  In the upper part next to the earpiece is a camera for making video calls and a light sensor.  Under the screen there are three "classic" buttons: "Home", "Back" and "Menu".  Around the perimeter and on the back, the smartphone case is made of plastic.  On the left are the volume swings, on top, closer to the right corner, there is a button to turn off the gadget.  Next to it is a jack for connecting external speakers.  At the bottom in the middle is a micro-USB connector. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenovo s820 red" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/541692.jpg" width="500"></div>

On the back there is only the main camera with LED backlight.  The phone is available in three colors: white, red and gray.  The first option is not entirely practical - dirt is visible.  But Lenovo S820 RED <strong> </strong>  perfect for those women who like to wear a lot of red things.  It will harmoniously complement their appearance. </p><p>  The gray modification is universal.  She does not get dirty too much, and looks solid.  Suitable for everything that is possible. </p><h2>  Memory and its quantity </h2><p>  Lenovo S820 WHITE, like other modifications of this device, is equipped with 1 GB of RAM.  This volume is quite enough for comfortable work on this device.  4GB integrated flash memory.  It is distributed as follows: 1.2 GB is the operating system itself, 0.8 GB is used to install applications and utilities, and 2 GB is intended to store user information.  All this is clearly not enough for comfortable work, so you can not do without an additional micro-CD format drive.  This card is installed in the expansion slot and its maximum volume can be equal to 64 GB.  In the original configuration it is not - you have to buy separately. </p><h2>  Communications </h2>

At the same time, one important nuance should be noted.  With networks of the 3rd generation, only one SIM card works, which is installed in slot 1. But the second one can function in the gsm standard, that is, the 2nd generation. </li><li>  Bluetooth for sharing small files with similar devices. </li><li>  Micro USB, which allows you to exchange information with a PC. </li><li>  <span>GPS module</span> provides navigation. </li></ul><p>  Among the shortcomings, it is possible that there is no <span>infrared port</span> and support for networks of the 4th generation.  In the first case there is nothing to worry about.  This standard is outdated, both morally and physically.  He was replaced by bluetooth.  But the second point is significant.  Without the support of 4th generation networks, it is impossible to get high-speed access to the global web.  But so far this standard has not received wide distribution and it can not be used everywhere. </p><h2>  Battery and its real possibilities </h2>

According to the manufacturer, it will have enough capacity for 10 hours of communication in third-generation networks and for 22 hours of the second.  You can listen to music on one of its recharges for 12 hours.  In reality, with a non-intense load, this device will work autonomously for 3-4 days.  This is a pretty decent indicator for a device with such hardware stuffing and a large screen size.

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Like most similar devices, this device has two cameras.  One of them at 2 megapixels is brought to the front of the gadget and is intended for video communication.  You can‚Äôt expect high-quality images and flawless video recording from her.  But the second 12 MP is displayed on the back cover of the smartphone and is great for this kind of task.  In addition, for shooting in the dark, it is equipped with LED backlight.  An image stabilization system is also implemented.  The resolution of the video recorded using it is 1920 pixels in length and 1080 pixels in width, that is, in full hd quality. </p><h2>  BY </h2>

Responses of owners say that ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù with serial number 4.2 is now installed by default.  In general, there is nothing wrong with that.  Most programs can start without problems on this modern device.  It is not necessary to wait for system updates yet, although the leading Chinese manufacturer may release an upgrade.  The OS itself is installed with additional settings.  Among them, we can highlight the presence of Lenovo Launcher, which allows you to easily and easily customize the device interface to the needs of each user.  Among the preinstalled software, international social services can be distinguished.  But their domestic counterparts will have to be installed separately.  Also, the main Google applications were installed on this smartphone model (Gmail + social service, Gmail email client, Google maps).

    <h2>  What are the reviews talking about? </h2><p>  A year later, the Lenovo S820 smartphone still remains a fairly balanced device.  The feedback from the satisfied owners of this gadget is another confirmation of this.  The Chinese engineers did an excellent job creating the hardware.  The processor does not overheat.  Crash test results show high stability of the gadget.  The software component is also not satisfactory.  There were no "glitches" and freezes on the device by users.  In general, an excellent product that will last you more than one year. </p>
