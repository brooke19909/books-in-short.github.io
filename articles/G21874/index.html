Moreover, the peninsula has such a rich and ancient history that representatives of various religions can find holy places here. </p><h2>  Cathedral in Chersonesos </h2><p>  And to start studying them, probably, it would be worthwhile visiting the Ancient Chersonesos.  Its birth dates back to the sixth century BC, for two millennia, during the time of Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome and the Byzantine Empire, it was a great cultural center.

There is an assumption that here Prince Vladimir received holy baptism, and in the place where the Cathedral is now located, Russia was once baptized.  This is stated in one of the most ancient literary sources, The Tale of Bygone Years.  For the first time, the ruins of three Christian temples were discovered in the first quarter of the nineteenth century.  The cruciform basilica, according to historians of that time, was that temple of the Nativity of the Mother of God, in which an event occurred that changed the history of Russia.

The walls of the temple were erected around the ruins of an ancient building.  In place of the ancient remains, a font was made and the <span>relics of Prince Vladimir</span> were placed <span>,</span> which were transported from the Small Church, located in the Winter Palace.  A list of the miraculous <span>icon of the Korsun Mother of God</span> was kept in the cathedral <span>.</span>  In Soviet times, the temple was closed and transferred to the Kherson Museum, as well as all its utensils.  Only in 1992 the cathedral was reopened. </p><h2>  Church of St. John </h2><p>  You can continue to visit the holy places of Crimea in Kerch.  They say that here is the <span>oldest temple.</span>  It is called the Church of St. John the Baptist.  According to historians, it was built around the eighth or eleventh century.  This is the only Byzantine temple that has survived to our time.  The most interesting thing is that at some time it was even a mosque.  In Soviet times, it housed a museum of the art of antiquity, and in the nineties it was reopened. </p><h2>  Church of the Ascension of Christ </h2><p>  Another amazing temple worth visiting is the Foros Church, or the Church of the Ascension of Christ.  This cathedral is unique - it was built on a steep rock.  The altar in it does not look to the east, but to the sea. </p>

    <h2>  Holy Assumption Monastery </h2><p>  What other <span>holy places of</span> Crimea are there?  Every year, a huge number of pilgrims visit the Holy Assumption Monastery in Bakhchisarai.  The uniqueness of it and eleven other monasteries lies in the fact that they are all cave.  They are located on the rocks among the pristine nature, and only the ruins and ancient fortress walls are sometimes nearby. </p>

It is assumed that the monastery most likely existed here from about the twelfth to the fifteenth century.  This is evidenced by excavations conducted in caves.  But this is not accurate data.  Scientists have not come to a consensus.  Some pointed to the ninth century, which has been criticized by other archaeologists.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Chelter-Coba </h2><p>  Another complex of premises, interesting from a religious and archaeological point of view, is Chelter-Koba.  It is believed that the monastery existed and operated, according to V. Danilenko, from the eighth to ninth centuries.  Yu. Mogarychev, however, believes that this statement is erroneous.  They attribute the existence of the cathedral to the period from the fourteenth to fifteenth centuries. </p><h2>  "Shuldan" </h2><p>  The Monastery of Christ the Savior "Shuldan" is located in Sevastopol.  It consists of two cave temples and many utility rooms.  This monastery is dated by the eighth century.  It was founded by monks who fled from Byzantium due to persecution.  It is assumed that they were from Athos.  The monastery existed, most likely, until the fifteenth or sixteenth century before the Ottomans arrived in these places. </p><h2>  City of Doros (Theodoro) </h2><p>  Extremely rich in historical and religious monuments is a mountain called Mangup.  The most ancient archaeological finds date back to the Eneolithic era.  As early as the third century AD, settlements that were already fortified were located here.  Then the population only arrived.  In the fifth century, during the reign of Justinian I, a fortress was erected here and the city of Doros was founded.  In the vicinity was the country of Dory.  In the tenth century, the city fell into decay.  Scientists attribute this to an earthquake that occurred during that period.  Then the country around and the city itself was called Theodoro. </p><p>  The cave monastery complex is also interesting here.  In appearance it is a grotto, where from different sides there are cells and a temple.  There, on Cape Teshkli-Burun, is the Citadel of the Mungup Princes, and behind it is an octagonal temple.  Later, the Turks turned it into a mosque.  There are also the Church of St. George and the Cathedral of St. Constantine nearby.  Scientists suggest that they existed until the seventeenth century.  The Ottomans rebuilt and renamed the city.  Until the end of the eighteenth century, the Karaite community lived here.  Whoever occupied the caves located on the peninsula, one thing can undoubtedly be said: these are the holy places of Crimea. </p><h2>  Blagoveshchensky cathedral </h2><p>  At the end of the twentieth century, the southern monastery complex again began to settle in the monks.  Now the Annunciation Cathedral is operating here.  Here, as many centuries ago, services are performed.  This place is very revered by believers, and many pilgrims come here every year. </p><p>  By the way, here is a miraculous icon of the Mother of God the Naughty, which helps to fight various diseases.  So those who want to visit the holy places of Crimea healing people can come here. </p>

The cathedral is a cathedral.  He gained special fame and respect thanks to St. Luke, a professor of medicine, a doctor who in recent years devoted himself to religion.  Once awarded the Stalin Prize for his scientific work, he subsequently spent 11 years in prison and exile for his attitude to religion.  In the last years of his life, he was the archbishop of Simferopol and Crimean.  Now there is a convent at the cathedral, the inhabitants of which opened the Museum of St. Luke.  It is generally accepted that Saint Luke fulfills the desire of infertile women to become pregnant.

    <p>  No less interesting for believers is the temple in the cave of Iograph.  It is located in Yalta.  Instead of the ruined temple of the Holy Martyr, Eugraphia decided to build a new one.  And they decided to build it elsewhere.  Built it in Yalta.  They called it the Church of St. John Chrysostom.  It has a tall and slender white bell tower with a golden dome.  Currently, Iograf cave has again become a temple. </p><h2>  Church in the name of Saints Constantine and Helena.  Alexander Nevsky Cathedral </h2><p>  Visiting the Holy places of Crimea, you can recall other temples that are in Simferopol.  For example, the church in the name of Saints Constantine and Helena.  It was opened in the house, which was bought by the commander of Russian troops from the Crimean Tatar.  The whole time the Russian troops lodged there, the church worked.  Of interest is the fact that the temple is completely different from the others in architecture.  They say that Catherine II, who visited Crimea at that time, was praying here.  Apparently this is precisely what gave her the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral.  This is another interesting place in the Crimea.  The temple was built only in 1829.  He served exactly one hundred years, after which he was, like many temples of the Soviet era, closed.  In the year nineteen thirty, they blew him up and destroyed a square in his place.  Only at the beginning of the twenty-first century did construction begin on its restoration.  Currently, the temple is almost finished. </p><h2>  Other cathedrals </h2><p>  One of the main temples of Simferopol was also the Peter and Paul Cathedral, built in the early nineteenth century.  He, like most cathedrals, was closed in Soviet times.  Currently, the temple is operating again. </p><p>  In place of the former Greek gymnasium with a small church, the Holy Trinity Monastery was opened in our time.  Inside the temple is decorated with the image of the evangelists and the image of the Lord. </p><p>  The Church of the Three Saints is interesting in that a theological seminary was opened and worked here in the nineteenth century.  The school taught not only theology, but also a lot of scientific knowledge. </p><p>  The highest temple in Crimea is the church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  It is located in the village of Malorechenskoye.  This is an active temple.  It is a lighthouse temple.  Since it is visible far from the sea.  It is part of a memorial dedicated to all those who died at sea.  The height of the temple is sixty-five meters, and a lighthouse lamp is located in the tower.  The ground floor is a museum of disasters on the waters.  At his stands posted information about the largest and most resonant disasters. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know the holy places of Crimea.  In addition to Christian and Orthodox, on the peninsula there are a huge number of centers of other religions, no less interesting.  They belong to Muslims, Karaites, Jews and members of other faiths. </p>
