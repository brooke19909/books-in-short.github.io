    <h2>  Mobile Bank </h2><p>  So, if you are thinking how to top up your phone account with a bank card, then let's start with you with the most interesting approach.  For example, use the Mobile Bank.  This is a very convenient service that helps you work with plastic. </p><p>  In order to deposit money into your account, you just need to write the payment amount in SMS, and then send the generated letter to the number 900. After the request is processed, you will receive a notification about the successful operation.  So it‚Äôs not so difficult as it seems. </p><p>  True, there are several more approaches that help us figure out how to top up a phone account with a bank card.  Now we recognize them.  It‚Äôs always good to have several alternatives, right? </p><h2>  Not myself </h2><p>  The second scenario is nothing more than using the same "Mobile Bank" in order to deposit funds to a third-party number.  This method helps when there are no payment terminals nearby.  Let‚Äôs see how to recharge a phone account from a bank card that is not tied to plastic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Everything here is not as scary as it might seem at first glance.  If you are going to transfer money to a friend or relative on your mobile phone, then create a message in which write the recharge number, and after the space - the amount of payment.  After everything is ready, send a request to the short number 900. That's all that is required of you.  It remains to wait a while - you will receive a notification about the successful processing of the operation.  This means that the money has reached the recipient.  That's all the problems.  As you can see, they really are not.  But that is not all.  You can top up your phone account with a credit card without using a mobile phone.  How?  Let's get it right. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="add credit card to your phone account" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/807082.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  ATM / terminal </h2><p>  And here is another rather interesting and quick method of replenishing your phone with a card.  Most customers use it.  In order to answer the question of how to recharge a telephone account from a bank card (MTS, Beeline and other operators), we need an ATM or Sberbank payment terminal. </p><p>  Take your plastic with you, and then go to the "car".  Insert the card into the special hole (receiver), and then dial the pin code.  It will give you access to the main menu of the system.  There you will have to find the item "Recharge mobile phone."  Click on it, and then dial the payment amount, as well as the number to which we will transfer the funds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After that, check if everything is done correctly.  If so, you can confirm the operation and wait for processing.  As soon as the money is credited to the phone, you will receive a message about the expenditure of funds from the card.  As you can see, nothing complicated.  This approach is perfectly implemented both in ATMs and in Sberbank payment terminals.  Nevertheless, there is another rather interesting approach that will help us get rid of the mobile phone bill.  Which one?  Let's get to know him. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  If you are thinking of how to top up your phone account with a credit card, you can always turn to the Internet.  It is he who quite often helps us in many life situations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to top up your pay phone with a credit card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/807081.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  If we consider Sberbank, then it has a special service, Sberbank-Online.  With it, you can easily and simply control your funds on the card without leaving your home.  Go to the site and enter the username and password in the appropriate fields (they are issued when you receive the card), and then dial the special security code.  He will come to your mobile.  Now just go to the "Operations" section, and then - "Recharge mobile."  There, in the appropriate fields, dial the required number and payment amount.  Confirm action.  That's all.  Now it remains to wait until the money arrives in the account. </p>
