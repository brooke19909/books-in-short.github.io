This may be affected by a railway line or a new highway, the opening of a museum or the construction of a palace.  Garibaldi Castle (Samara) is just such an object.  Its appearance is already beginning to attract interest among lovers of antiquities and fairy tales. </p><h2>  History of Khryashchevka </h2><p>  Only after the construction of the city of Samara in the 17th century began a large-scale settlement of the right bank of the Volga.  The first settlers in these parts were runaway peasants who were looking for a better life.  By the end of the 17th century, large monasteries - Novodevichy and Gorodishche were already built on the right bank of the Volga.  At the beginning of the 18th century, the entire Syzran Territory was so densely populated that people began to move to the left bank of the Volga. </p><p>  Khryaschevka, like several other settlements, appeared on the land of the monastery and was originally inhabited by monks.  In 1705, it was presented to Alexander Menshikov, but after his disgrace he again transferred to the royal estates. </p>

    <p>  Since 1851, the village of Khryashchevka has been part of the Stavropol district of the Samara province, which remains to this day.  More than 3 thousand people live in modern Khryashchevka, and the main attraction of this place was the Garibaldi castle built here.  In Samara and Tolyatti, the local population knows him very well, but the rumor about the Gothic castle has gone far beyond the borders of his native land. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Castle value for the area </h2><p>  It is difficult to overestimate the importance of building a whole tourist complex, which will occupy an area of ‚Äã‚Äã6.5 hectares on the shore of the "Zhiguli Sea", as the inhabitants of this region called the Kuibyshev Reservoir.  This will take the tourism business to a whole new level. </p><p>  The Garibaldi castle (Samara), which is part of the complex, is the first constructed facility that already attracts travelers to these places.  The influx of tourists into Khryashchevka will give new jobs and an influx of funds for the development of the region as a whole. </p>

    <p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa <span>Gothic castle</span> in these parts belongs to Oleg Kuzichkin, as well as the structure itself.  Its erection began in 2006 according to the plans of architects Valery Seglin and Yuri Guryanov.  Their joint work with the designer and facade artist Sergey Karengin and Alexei Cheboksarinov, as well as the sculptor Viktor Shuvalov, led to the appearance of a neo-Gothic castle in the small village of Khryashchevka. </p><h2>  Castle style </h2><p>  Although, in essence, the Garibaldi Castle (Samara, address: Khryashchevka, River Lane) is a hotel with seven VIP rooms, the style of this building was developed very carefully.  The owner of the complex wanted the building to look ancient "for real." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Designers had to come up with their own building legend.  So, its base and foundation were ‚Äúlaid‚Äù back in the 10-12th century, and the 1st and 2nd floors were completed in the 13-14th century.  The third floor was, as it were, ‚Äúbuilt‚Äù by another architect already in the style of the 15-16th centuries, and the final reconstruction of the building, in which the same style was respected, was carried out in the 19th century.  To do this, we used the best modern materials, "aged" by the latest technologies.  For realism, even such trifles as bas-reliefs on basement stones, similar to those that were found in Denmark at excavations dating from the 10th century, were thought out. </p>

    <p>  The difference in the "stones" between the old and later masonry also "inspires" the audience that the castle was completed in different eras, maintaining the basic Gothic style.  The various components of the building - arches and bas-reliefs - as if were "removed" from the ancient ruins and transferred during construction to this area.  Here you can find the motives of ancient Russian architects and the "work" of the masters of the early Middle Ages. </p><p>  The annex on the west side dates from the 15th century, although stones from the ruins that were as old as the foundation of the castle itself were obviously used for it.  Garibaldi Castle (Samara), the photo of which can hardly convey the very atmosphere of this place, nevertheless demonstrates the skill of modern architects who are in no way inferior to their medieval "colleagues". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Castle observation deck </h2><p>  The entire ensemble of the castle is divided into several zones.  The main building is a hotel, the kitchen is located in the outbuilding, the place for entertainment is in the ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù, and for outdoor events, a playground is built in the form of a courtyard of a medieval castle, paved with stone. </p><p>  Garibaldi Castle (Samara) is completely built by hand, without the use of conventional construction equipment, and its courtyard is no exception.  Each tile was laid in accordance with the colors and motives of medieval castles. </p>

    <p>  By its size, the square is quite suitable for public festivals and theatrical performances for up to 300 guests.  When the construction is completed in 2018, the entertainment center will be able to host even more guests. </p><h2>  Dungeon </h2><p>  Initially, during the construction of the underground entertainment complex, there were no plans to build a medieval building.  Garibaldi Castle (Samara) ‚Äúarose‚Äù as an idea as the foundation of the hotel was erected. </p><p>  In the "dungeon" are two levels for entertainment.  On the upper floor there is a swimming pool and a hall with a "sunken" old ship.  The floor of this room is made of glass, under which there is a large aquarium.  Fishes in this unusual place swim among the wreckage of the ship over <span>old weapons</span> and chests with "gold". </p>

    <p>  The castle platform became the roof for the dungeon, which was quite difficult to perform technically, but the masters successfully coped with it. </p><p>  If you go down the stone stairs even lower in the dungeon, you can get into the modern bowling alley and the billiard room.  In between games, guests will spend time at the bar.  All rooms are made in the spirit of medieval dungeons. </p><p>  In 2014, the first visitors were already able to fully enjoy the beauty and unusualness of this place. </p><h2>  First events </h2><p>  The most interesting place for holding various levels of events was Samara - Khryashchevka, Garibaldi Castle.  Built among old firs and oaks, overlooking the "sea", an unusual building for these places is already attracting the attention of advertisers, fashion houses and travel agencies. </p><p>  The castle‚Äôs first event in 2014 was a gift to the residents of Togliatti and Samara in honor of the 50th anniversary of the renaming of the city.  On a sightseeing bus, the first tourists arrived to explore the new attractions of the district.  For the sake of this event, construction work was interrupted.  Guests were able to inspect the outer walls and towers of the castle. </p>

    <p>  As work progressed in the building, more and more activities began to take place in it.  When the court venue was finished, the famous Tolyatti boutique REKA rented it for its photo shoots and fashion shows.  Defile of beautiful girls in modern fashionable outfits against the backdrop of the "old" walls made a splash.  This event was attended by twice as many people as was stated on the list.  So, the glory of an unusual place was ahead of the end of its construction. </p><p>  Before the closing of the complex for the final work, wedding photoshoots, a contest for the best photograph of the castle, a ball and festive events of various groups were held in this place. </p><h2>  Port construction and opening </h2><p>  Of course, you can also take a bus to the castle of Garibaldi.  Everyone knows how to get from Samara by public transport - with transfers.  First, you have to go 2 hours to Tolyatti, and then transfer to the route towards Khryashchevka and get another hour. </p><p>  But the entire entertainment complex was conceived so that guests could get to it by water.  For this purpose, the construction plans included the construction of a port on the shore of the Kuibyshev reservoir. </p>

    <p>  In order not only yachts and boats, but also oversized vessels, to enter the port, the bay was completely refitted.  Now, all yachtsmen and those traveling by water along the Volga can anchor in the waters of the Zhiguli Sea.  They will be met by a cozy gazebo with a restaurant, which offers a beautiful view of the Volga.  The port opened on June 11, 2014. </p><h2>  Sightseeing route </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the final construction of the castle will happen only in 2018, Russian travel agencies have already included it in their tours of the Samara region.  Thanks to the Internet and photographs of those who have already been there, information about the unusual Gothic castle spread throughout the country. </p><p>  Judging by the interest in it, the entertainment complex, designed for residents of the region, can become as popular as the famous amusement parks in other countries (Disneyland in the USA, Euro-park in Germany and others).  This is evidenced by the excursion routes of the leading travel agencies of the country. </p><h2>  Construction completion </h2><p>  All finishing and construction work in the castle will be completed in 2018, but today you don‚Äôt have to guess where the Garibaldi castle is.  In Samara, everyone knows his whereabouts - from small to large.  Now, not only old Europe, but the Samara region in Russia has its own medieval castles. </p>
