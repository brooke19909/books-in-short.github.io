Admiral Levchenko is a real figure, a significant personality in Russian history.  He was born and lived in the days of the emergence of Russia as a world power and an all-Union state, and became the person who created its future. </p><h2>  The beginning of the way </h2><p>  The future admiral Levchenko Gordey Ivanovich began his swift career at school.  A native of Belarus, a very young boy, Gordey entered the school of naval affairs - from this day on his story of his life became inseparable from the pages of the military history of Russia. </p><p>  After graduating from college in 1913, he was immediately "lucky" to become a participant in the First World War.  The shells of military battles fired a genuine love for military affairs in a very young boy.  That is why, after the events of the civil war and the entry into the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), he decided to continue his studies. </p><p>  In 1922, Gordey Ivanovich graduated from the Higher Naval School and joined the officer ranks of the Russian Navy. </p><h2>  Admiral's swift career </h2><p>  The discipline, diligence, ambitiousness and diligence that Gordey Levchenko was endowed with helped him to soar rapidly up the career ladder, and 22 years after graduation to receive the rank of admiral. </p><p>  A couple of years after the call to the fleet, Gordey Ivanovich was appointed commander of the famous cruiser Aurora, and in 1933 he was promoted to commissar of the Caspian flotilla.  His track record was full of many positions, including the commander of battleships in the Baltic, the commander of a brigade of destroyers in the Black Sea, and others. In 1939, Levchenko was appointed commander of the Baltic Fleet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Gordey Ivanovich had a difficult time - war, revolution, change of lifestyle of the country.  However, he always had a gallant spirit.  During the Great Patriotic War, the future admiral Levchenko participated in the defense of the Crimea, Leningrad, provided the troops with supplies during the breaking of the blockade. </p><p>  The courage and courage shown by him during the war played a significant role for career growth.  Since 1953, he was appointed to the post of admiral inspector of the naval forces of the USSR, and then deputy commander in chief for combat training.  However, this was the final period of his lightning career.  In 1960, Admiral Levchenko resigned. </p><h2>  History of the ship </h2><p>  Ironically, planted in them.  Zhdanov's ship originally had the name of one of the cities of the Far East - Khabarovsk.  However, fate prepared for a <span>large anti-submarine ship</span> an outstanding fate filled with success and victories, in connection with which the name was required for him accordingly.  3 months after the bookmark - at the end of May 1982, it was decided to rename the Khabarovsk BPC and give it the name of the Admiral Levchenko BPC.  The specified date coincided with the anniversary of the death of the admiral - Gordey Ivanovich died at the end of May 1981. </p><p>  On October 30, 1988, the captain of the 2nd rank ‚Äî the future rear admiral ‚Äî Yu.
