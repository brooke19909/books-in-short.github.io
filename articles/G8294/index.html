An ideal option would be to invest, since the funds will not just lie somewhere in the envelope, in the box.  They will start working for their owner.  Only here is the question: "Where to invest a small amount of money?"  After all, contributions are usually quite impressive.

    <h2>  Deposits </h2><p>  Perhaps the most popular way to get your money to work is with <span>deposits.</span>  In fact, this is a proven method that is considered reliable and risk-free.  If the question arises of where to invest a small amount of money, then the option with a deposit investment comes to mind first.  From a variety of offers put forward by the bank, one's eyes run wide.  These can be non-refillable deposits, as well as those that can be increased during the deposit period.  Interest is accrued either every month or quarterly.  Or they can be received by the account holder only at the end of the period for which the deposit was created.  By the way, it should be noted that the interest is quite substantial.  Each bank offers its own, but in general, the average rate is 11% per annum.  Thus, if the contribution is 100 thousand rubles, then at the end of the term a person will receive another 11,000 from above. A pretty good increase.  By the way, many banks accept deposits starting with small amounts - for example, from a thousand rubles.  Of course, you need to understand that you won‚Äôt be able to get much from this amount, but the famous Russian proverb comes into force here - a little better than nothing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  Of course, when thinking about where to invest a small amount of money, a person first of all takes into account such a factor as the reliability of a bank.  Accordingly, he considers several options, choosing the best.  Today there are a huge number of such organizations, and because of the great competition, they often organize a variety of campaigns to attract customers.  However, reliability in this matter is above all.  Therefore, before deciding where to invest a small amount of money, you need to know that a good bank must exist for at least two years and have state status.  The five most reliable banks in the country include Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank, RosSelkhozbank and Alfa Bank. </p><h2>  VTB is a reliable investment partner </h2><p>  Many people choose one of these options, thinking about where to invest a small amount of money.  VTB is a bank that I would like to note with special attention.  This organization provides a very wide range of services regarding investment.  Moreover, this applies to both the foreign exchange and stock markets.  These are <span>operations with securities,</span> and transactions with options and futures, as well as providing access to trading, the acquisition of <span>units of mutual funds</span> and their sale, as well as much more.  The bank uses proven and effective tools and offers the best strategies for managing its assets.  The list of services offered does not end there.  VTB also provides brokerage services, creates special conditions for its clients, and also provides them with access to Forex trading on the most favorable terms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Securities and precious metals </h2><p>  Not all people like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãopening their bank account and putting money into it.  And they are looking for other options.  A good alternative is investing in precious metals.  By the way, some even invest in coins.  But this is a rather risky option, since the rate associated with metals is rather unstable.  And further.  Jewels need to be provided with appropriate conditions so that they do not lose their presentation.  Moreover, this is a long-term investment.  But it, nevertheless, is successful and profitable.  Not without reason, in many banks there are so-called metal accounts - purchased metals are stored there.  But with securities a little differently.  To make a successful contribution, you need to know the specifics of bonds and stocks.  There are consultations for this.  It is worth noting that stocks can cost quite a bit (at least one ruble), and can be very expensive (they require several tens of thousands of dollars for some securities). </p>

    <h2>  Modern investment </h2><p>  These include PAMM accounts.  They appeared in Russia not so long ago, only a few years ago.  However, the income that can be extracted from investments of this kind is impressive.  Many people who wondered where to invest a small amount of money online have come up with this.  The principle is that the funds of several private clients are deposited into the general account, and the appropriate specialist (trader) manages the money.  In the end, income is generated, and it is distributed among those people who invested in the PAMM account.  The benefits are many.  First, savings are in control.  Secondly, they can be quickly withdrawn.  Thirdly, you can monitor the work of the manager.  And most importantly, you can make small contributions, which is an undoubted advantage, since everyone can try themselves in this matter. </p>

    <h2>  Deposits by city </h2><p>  The question of where to invest a small amount of money in 2014 is no longer relevant, since a new one is coming in 2015. It is time to think about the future and decide which deposits will be more profitable to make this year.  It must be said that this or that investment may be suitable for residents of one region, but not for others.  Where to invest a small amount of money in Penza, for example?  In real estate!  This is a small city, but recently it has been actively built up.  A good idea would be to buy a room and rent it.  Or even try investing them in a business.  In general, there are a lot of ways to invest, albeit a very modest one.  The main thing is to choose the most suitable option for yourself and first familiarize yourself with all the conditions. </p>
