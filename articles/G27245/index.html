Its length is so great that in some <span>part the river</span> captures the capital itself.  It is worth noting that most of the reserve is located in the city.  This fact became the reason that on its outskirts there are all kinds of buildings, both residential and domestic.  The Setun River Valley, a photo of which can be seen in this article, will be described below. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Setun Valley" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1194519.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nature reserve </h2><p>  The territory of the reserve is quite diverse for the presence of not only the plant, but also the animal world.  The forest belt has at its disposal both ordinary plants and those that, due to extinction, were listed in the Red Book.  Unfortunately, these plants were able to survive only on the territory of the reserve itself and were able to continue to exist only along the banks of the river. </p><p>  The variety of tree species, which the Setun River Valley is so rich in, cannot but impress.  Oak, ash, maple and many others that can be found both in the city itself and in the reserve.  But there are also those who cannot be seen anywhere else.  The reserve also has architectural and historical buildings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Special views of the plant world </h2><p>  Do not forget about the herbs located on the territory of the Setun River Valley.  Here you can find a sufficient variety of plants, which are often used in folk medicine.  The herbs used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases are especially popular.  The total number of plant species is more than 380. And most of the vegetation belongs to the category of healing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Setun river valleys" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1194524.jpg" width="600"></div>

You can also meet other representatives here, of which about 40 are considered rare and are protected by the state.  If you try to count all the species that live in the reserve, this figure will almost reach 100. </p><p>  Amphibians, birds, herbivores - there is no reliable information about the exact amount.  But in order to understand the scale - there are more than 69 species of birds alone, not to mention all the others.  Do not forget about the vertebrates, which became the Setun River Valley home.  There are more than 5 species.  Due to the fact that hunting in the reserve is prohibited, many animals were able to maintain their appearance only here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The uniqueness of this place is not only in the plant and animal world.  Here you can admire the remains of ancient settlements and the monuments of various cultures and peoples.  By studying them, many new facts and historical events are discovered.  The buildings themselves, which are not only historical, but also spiritual, can transfer vacationers to a completely different era. </p><p>  In fine weather, local residents and guests of the city often stroll through the old manor parks: Troekurovo, Spasskoye and Troetsk-Golenishchevo.  Various excursions are organized here, thereby allowing you to plunge into centuries-old memories. </p><p>  Setun River Valley also has various ancient-built churches.

    <p>  Getting to the reserve is not particularly difficult: several buses go from Universitet metro station (routes No. 103, 130, 187, 260), and only one No. 11 from Kuntsevo.  There are several options with which you can easily reach the reserve.  You can also book a short excursion to the area, where you can learn more about such a beautiful and magnificent place. </p>
