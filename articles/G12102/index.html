Especially for such readers, we have prepared the current article.  In it, we will consider the features of the technology and present unusual and original crafts ideas. </p><h2>  What is an unusual box? </h2><p>  The craft studied in the article is made using the scrapbooking or scrapbooking technique, which literally translates as "clippings book".  This type of decorative art has appeared relatively recently and consists in the interesting design of photo albums.  For example, family or personal.  Although, if you wish, you can also make a greeting card decorated with stickers, clippings, greeting inscriptions and other decorative elements.  Do-it-yourself box with photos is very simple.  You can even say that the child will cope with the work.  But in any case, this craft will be a great gift for family and friends.  After all, it will bring a lot of delight and will certainly cause tears of happiness! </p><h2>  Materials required for work </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY photo box" class="if uuid-2966380" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2966380.jpg"></div><p>  So, if the reader is interested in the technology of making boxes with photographs with their own hands, we offer a detailed and step-by-step master class, which begins with a listing of the necessary tools and materials.  It: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  ordinary cardboard for needlework; </li><li>  corrugated, colored or wrapping paper; </li><li>  paper tape; </li><li>  satin ribbon; </li><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  ruler; </li><li>  a simple pencil; </li><li>  comfortable scissors. </li></ul><p>  In addition, you need to prepare various decorative elements.  For example, beads, satin ribbon bows, paper decorative elements and more.  It is also important not to forget about the many most interesting, beloved and memorable photos. </p><h2>  Work time on the craft </h2><p>  It is impossible to say unequivocally how long it will take to complete the box with photographs yourself.  Because it all depends on the design of the idea.  Of course, if the reader does not decorate the craft too much, they will be able to finish it in a few hours.  But if you want to create a very beautiful, highly artistic and perfect gift in all respects, you can spend a week or even a whole month.  Especially a lot of time is spent on the development of parts.  Therefore, people who have already managed to do the studied thing for their loved ones write in reviews that it is important to think about your box in advance.  So that you don‚Äôt have to rush at the last moment, not knowing how to create a conceived masterpiece, figuratively speaking, in 60 seconds. </p><h2>  What you need to complete a surprise box </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="mk box with photos" class="if uuid-2966324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2966324.jpg"></div><p>  This workshop on a photo box is ideal for those who want to give, in addition to an album, a small gift - a gift card, money, jewelry (for example, a ring) or any other memorable thing.  According to reviews, the size of the product can be any.  Many even use ready-made corrugated boxes.  If the product is made of cardboard intended for needlework, we prepare everything you need and get to work! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to make a surprise box </h2><p>  MK "box with photos with your own hands" implies fairly simple steps.  First, determine the size of the largest box.  Using a ruler and a simple pencil, draw 5 squares of the right size.  Cut out.  After we prepare several more sets of squares, each of which should be 2-3 cm less than the previous set.  Then we lay out each set as shown in the photo below.  The joints are glued with paper tape on both sides.  They are marked with a red line. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="box with photos" class="if uuid-2966304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2966304.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, there is nothing complicated in the instructions on how to make a box with photos with your own hands.  Therefore, we proceed to the next step.  We glue the resulting crosses with corrugated paper.  To save materials, you can not touch the central square.  We prepare covers for all the resulting boxes.  Each should be one centimeter larger than the side of the square.  We supplement them with the sides as shown in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a box with photos" class="if uuid-2966306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2966306.jpg"></div><p>  The joints are also glued with paper tape, but only on one side.  Then we fold the lid with glued joints inward, so that the sides fit together as tightly as possible.  Paste with paper tape.  Next, decorate the resulting cover with paper.  By analogy, we carry out the details for the remaining boxes. </p><h2>  Build a surprise box </h2><p>  When all the details are ready, we proceed to the final stage of MK "Box with photos with your own hands (in stages)."  We add the prepared crosses to one another, starting with the largest.  They need to be glued together.  We decorate the four free sides of each box at our discretion.  Do not forget to add photos!  This creative process will be different for everyone and, accordingly, will take a different amount of time.  When it is finished, put a gift in the smallest box.  Then we lift the sides of the box and put the lid on top.  So do the rest.  In the reviews, people recommend that, having gathered the entire box with a surprise, bandage it with a ribbon so that it does not open ahead of time.  That's all! </p><p>  However, I would also like to note that, if desired, you can make an original box with photos with one common lid.  Which is put on the largest box.  This will significantly reduce the time.  Otherwise, the technology will be similar to the described actions. </p><h2>  Clamshell box </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="master class photo box" class="if uuid-2966313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2966313.jpg"></div><p>  Another interesting master class will appeal to those who, for various reasons, want to spend less time on work.  However, the product will not become worse or more uniform from this.  And then the reader will be able to verify this.  The technology for performing such a box of photographs does not involve complex actions.  After all, we need to make only one main box.  We ‚Äúcarve out‚Äù it, relying on the previous master class.  We prepare the base and the lid, do not forget about the decor.  Then we take photographs of the same size, fold them down with a vertical ribbon.  Then we glue the joints with paper tape.  Ponytails are carefully trimmed with scissors.  As a result, we should get an accordion in which the first and last photo are turned with the image inward.  If everything turned out right, mask the ‚Äúpatches‚Äù with decorative paper.  Next, glue the bottom photo to the bottom of the box, and the top to the inside of the lid.  Close the craft and, if desired, tie it with a ribbon. </p><h2>  Box with photos and wishes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="scrapbooking box with photos" class="if uuid-2966307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2966307.jpg"></div><p>  The following great idea is also made in scrapbooking technique.  DIY box with photos is done as follows: </p><ol><li>  We draw an arbitrary circle on a sheet of cardboard. </li><li>  We are preparing a template a little smaller. </li><li>  Cut out both parts. </li><li>  We use the first as the bottom of the box. </li><li>  We supplement it with a strip, which will become the side of the craft. </li><li>  On the second, we cut out photographs and plain circles.  The number of parts must match. </li><li>  Glue the tape to the photos laid vertically in a row. </li><li>  At the top we make a loop and glue to the inside of the lid. </li><li>  Then mask the tape with plain circles. </li><li>  We write wishes on them when the craft dries. </li><li>  Finally, put the tape from the photos into a box. </li></ol><p>  Many people prefer to congratulate loved ones with homemade souvenirs and gifts.  According to reviews, the best gift will be a box with photos. </p>
