    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Tsambika Sun 2 * is located in the village of Archangelos, famous for its crystal clear beaches and indescribable beauty of nature.  Historically, the province (and later the municipality) of Archaggelos was considered the pearl of the island.  According to legend, the patron saint of the city is the Archangel Michael.  The village is located 30 km from the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Rhodes.</span>  You can get to it both by buses plying from the village or airport, and taxi services for a nominal fee of 25 ‚Ç¨. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel is in the heart of the old town.  This will certainly delight travelers, as they can go for a walk along the ancient streets and get acquainted with the sights of Archangelos.  Judging by the visitors' opinions, the skillfully decorated walls of the houses, many of which are more than 200 years old, thin paved paths, flowering rose bushes and many cats walking along the streets will not leave anyone indifferent.  From anywhere in the city and directly from the windows of Tsambika Sun 2 * rooms (Rhodes, Greece) you can see the ancient Orthodox bell tower of the Archangel Michael, built back in 1845! </p>

    <h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  Directly at the hotel you can arrange a rental car or organize excursions.  Although, as a rule, tourists prefer self-rest.  <span>Nissan Micra</span> along with a 10-day insurance policy, according to tourists, costs 400 euros.  And since many beautiful places on the island cannot be visited on foot, this is a great option to diversify your own leisure.  The owner of Tsambika Sun 2 * Kostas is happy to organize an excursion for tourists or will tell you independently what places to visit in Rhodes. </p><p>  Also, staff can help with the purchase of return tickets in case of unforeseen circumstances, since the Greek and Greek, as they say, will agree much faster.  In addition, the client has the opportunity to have breakfast at the hotel.  The cafe operates on the basis of the "buffet", which means that for 5 euros a guest can eat at a convenient time for him until 12 in the morning.  However, do not despair if suddenly you do not have time.  Archangelos is famous for its huge number of restaurants, both Greek and many other cuisines of the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  The island of Rhodes has a rich history and a huge number of attractions.  The inhabitants explain even the origin of its name by two myths.  One is associated with the Greek gods, and the second with the first settlers.  But you will certainly be more interested in hearing them from the Greeks!  Now we list the most popular local attractions: </p><ol><li>  The residence of the Catholic Order of Hospitallers is the Rhodes Fortress.  With her beauty, she conquered many people, one of which is the Italian dictator Mussolini.  In the 30s of the last century, he rebuilt it for King Victor Emanuel III.  Inside the fortress, the ancient square of Hippocrates, dotted with restaurants and tourist fairs, has been preserved. </li><li>  Valley of Petaludes.  It is an interesting natural refuge for butterflies.  In the summer months there are so many that it seems that they are everywhere! </li><li>  Lindos and the Acropolis are the ancient ruins of ancient cities with architecture erected before Christian times.  They are striking in their scope.  There is also the Olympic Stadium - the last surviving analogue of the Olympia Stadium! </li><li>  Natural Park "Seven Springs".  It is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. </li><li>  The medieval castle of Castello and the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin. </li></ol><p>  All this attracts tourists from all over the globe.  Nowhere else in the world can you find such a large number of attractions on such a tiny piece of land! </p>
