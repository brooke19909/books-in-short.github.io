The town organically merges with the natural groves of nature.  Along almost the entire fantastically rugged coastline with its many bays and capes, many hotels have been built with different levels of comfort.

The resort center, where vibrant nightlife boils, is only twenty minutes walk from it.  The traditional Greek village called Astomatos is only fourteen kilometers away.  Here you can taste delicious fish caught a few minutes ago in the waters of the Aegean Sea. </p><p>  The territory on which Palm Beach 3 * (Kos) is located is small.  However, there is no free space not planted with surprisingly beautiful flowers or palm trees.  Clean paths, nooks under the shade of trees, benches, signs, lighting devices installed everywhere - all this was done to make tourists comfortable not only in the rooms, but also in the fresh air. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2>
