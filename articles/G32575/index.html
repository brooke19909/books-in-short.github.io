The biography of this person is literally riddled with philanthropy and constant creative searches.  The future famous writer and teacher in the whole country was born in the family of a painter at the railway workshops.  In addition to him, a sister and brother later appeared in the family.  The latter subsequently became a White Guard officer, so he was forced to leave his homeland after the Bolshevik victory in </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="biography of Anton Semenovich Makarenko" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/230577.jpg" width="363"></div>  civil war.  Actually, it is only thanks to his memoirs that the early biography of Anton Semenovich Makarenko is known.  However, this is quite a bit.

    <p>  <strong>Biography of Anton Semenovich Makarenko: young years</strong> </p><p>  Being seventeen years old, the future teacher successfully completes the Kremenchug city school and begins his <span>pedagogical activity.</span>  Since 1905, he has been working as a teacher in the same Kremenchug at the railway school.  In general, the biography of Anton Semenovich Makarenko contains a lot of gaps.  In particular, not so much is known about his young years.  In 1914, the teacher decides to continue his own education and enters the Teacher Institute in Poltava, which he subsequently successfully graduates in 1917.  In 1920-1930, our hero receives invaluable pedagogical experience, leading a labor colony in Kharkov, where juvenile prisoners are kept.  The biography of Anton Semenovich Makarenko indicates that it was during this period that he became </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Makarenko Anton Semenovich biography" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/230576.jpg" width="260"></div>  widely known as a talented teacher and educator.  After all, it was during his work in the Kharkov colony that the most famous fruit of his pen was published - ‚ÄúPedagogical Poem‚Äù.  In 1935 he moved to Kiev for a short period.  And in 1937 - to Moscow, where he devotes himself to socio-pedagogical and literary activities.  Here he receives the Order of the Red Labor Banner.  And in 1958, the achievements of the great teacher were recognized by the establishment in the USSR of the medal of his name, which was awarded to particularly distinguished teachers and other employees <span>of the educational system.</span>

An important point of this philosophy was the idea that pedagogical means or their complex cannot be permanent and effective equally in all conditions.  Anton Semenovich </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Makarenko Anton Semenovich pedagogical ideas" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/230580.jpg" width="600"></div>  He insisted on the flexibility of using such techniques.  Among other things, he emphasized that during the upbringing through the collective, each pupil in this collective demands the same share of attention from the head of the process.  The great teacher saw the key to successful upbringing in prompting a person to show his best qualities and inclinations.  He often emphasized the importance of the upbringing process, justifying it already by the fact that otherwise later problems of an adult with society would inevitably arise.  And to reeducate, as you know, is always more difficult.  The main method in the entire <span>pedagogical system of</span> Makarenko was the method of high demands on himself, which literally meant total self-control of his actions by the teacher (or parents).  He insisted that a simple, serious and sincere tone in the relationship between the teacher / parent and the children would ensure the success of pedagogical tasks.
