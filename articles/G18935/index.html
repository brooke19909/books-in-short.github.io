Space rockets of Russia and the USA</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To date, the Russian Federation has the most powerful space industry in the world.  Russia is the undisputed leader in the field of manned space exploration and also has parity with the United States in matters of space navigation.  Some lags in our country exist only in studies of distant interplanetary spaces, as well as in the development of remote sensing of the Earth. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  A space rocket was first conceived by Russian scientists Tsiolkovsky and Meshchersky.  In 1897-1903 they created the theory of its flight.  Much later, foreign scientists began to master this area.  These were the Germans von Braun and Obert, as well as the American Goddard.  In the peaceful interwar period, only three countries in the world dealt with issues of jet propulsion, as well as the creation of solid-fuel and liquid engines for this purpose.  These were Russia, the USA and Germany. </p>

    <p>  By the 40s of the 20th century, our country could be proud of the successes achieved in the development of solid fuel engines.  This allowed during the Second World War to use such formidable weapons as the Katyusha.  As for the creation of large rockets equipped with liquid engines, Germany was the leader here.  It was in this country that the V-2 was adopted.  These are the first short-range ballistic missiles.  During the Second World War, the V-2 was used for the bombing of England. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the victory of the USSR over Nazi Germany, the main team of Werner von Braun, under his direct leadership, launched its activities in the United States.  At the same time, they took with them from the defeated country all previously developed drawings and calculations, on the basis of which a space rocket was to be built.  Only a tiny fraction of the team of German engineers and scientists continued their work in the USSR until the mid-50s of the 20th century.  They had at their disposal individual parts of technological equipment and missiles without any calculations and drawings. </p><p>  In the future, both in the USA and the USSR, the Vau-2 missiles were replicated (we have R-1), which predetermined the development of rocket science aimed at increasing the flight range. </p><h2>  Theory of Tsiolkovsky </h2><p>  This great Russian self-taught scientist and outstanding inventor is considered the father of astronautics.  In 1883 he wrote the historical manuscript "Free Space".  In this work, Tsiolkovsky first expressed the idea that moving between planets is possible, and for this a special <span>aircraft,</span> called a ‚Äúspace rocket,‚Äù is needed.  The very theory of a jet device was justified by him in 1903. It was contained in a work entitled "The Study of World Space."  Here, the author cited evidence that a space rocket is the device with which you can leave the Earth's atmosphere.  This theory was a real revolution in the scientific field.  After all, mankind has long dreamed of flying to Mars, the Moon and other planets.  However, the pundits could not determine how the aircraft should be arranged, which will move in absolutely empty space without support, capable of giving it acceleration.  This problem was solved by Tsiolkovsky, who proposed the use of a <span>jet engine</span> for this purpose <span>.</span>  Only with the help of such a mechanism could space be conquered. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Operating principle </h2><p>  To date, space rockets in Russia, the United States and other countries have entered the Earth‚Äôs orbit with the help of rocket engines, proposed at the time by Tsiolkovsky.  In these systems, the chemical energy of the fuel is converted into kinetic energy, which is possessed by the jet ejected from the nozzle.  A special process takes place in the combustion chambers of such engines.  In them, heat is generated as a result of the reaction of the oxidizing agent and fuel.  In this case, the combustion products expand, heat up, accelerate in the nozzle and are thrown out at a tremendous speed.  The rocket at the same time moves thanks to the law of conservation of momentum.  She receives acceleration, which is directed in the opposite direction. </p>

    <p>  Today, there are such engine projects as space elevators, <span>solar sails</span> , etc. However, in practice they are not used, as they are still under development. </p><h2>  First spacecraft </h2><p>  The Tsiolkovsky rocket, proposed by the scientist, was an oblong-shaped metal chamber.  Outwardly, it looked like a balloon or airship.  The front, head space of the rocket was intended for passengers.  Control devices were installed here, as well as carbon dioxide absorbers and oxygen reserves.  In the compartment for passengers, lighting was provided.  In the second, main part of the rocket, Tsiolkovsky located combustible substances.  When they were mixed, an explosive mass formed.  It was ignited in the space allotted to it in the very center of the rocket and was thrown out of the expanding pipe with great speed in the form of hot gases. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  For a long time, the name of Tsiolkovsky was little known not only abroad, but also in Russia.  Many considered him an idealistic dreamer and an eccentric dreamer.  The true appreciation of the works of this great scientist received only with the advent of Soviet power. </p><h2>  Creation of a missile system in the USSR </h2><p>  Significant steps in the development of interplanetary space were taken after the end of World War II.  It was a time when the United States, being the only nuclear power, began to exert political pressure on our country.  The initial task that was set before our scientists was to build up Russia's military power.  For a worthy rebuff in the conditions of the Cold War unleashed during these years, it was necessary to create an atomic, and then a <span>hydrogen bomb.</span>  The second, no less difficult task, was to deliver the created weapons to the target.  For this, combat missiles were required.  In order to create this technique, already in 1946 the government appointed the chief designers of gyroscopic devices, jet engines, control systems, etc. S.P. became responsible for linking all systems into a single whole.  Korolev. </p>

    <p>  Already in 1948, the first of the ballistic missiles developed in the USSR passed successful tests.  Similar flights to the United States were carried out a few years later. </p><h2>  Artificial satellite launch </h2><p>  In addition to building up military potential, the USSR government set itself the task of exploring outer space.  Work in this direction was carried out by many scientists and designers.  Even before an intercontinental-range missile flew into the air, the developers of such equipment realized that by reducing the payload of the aircraft, it was possible to achieve a speed exceeding space.  This fact spoke about the likelihood of an artificial satellite entering the earth's orbit.  This epoch-making event took place on 10/04/1957. It was the beginning of a new milestone in space exploration. </p><h2>  The creation of Soviet rockets </h2><p>  The work on the development of airless near-Earth space required tremendous efforts on the part of numerous teams of designers, scientists and workers.  The creators of space rockets had to develop a program to put the aircraft into orbit, debug the work of the ground service, etc. </p>

    <p>  The designers had a difficult task.  It was necessary to increase the mass of the rocket and make it possible to achieve its second <span>cosmic velocity.</span>  That is why in 1958-1959 a three-stage version of a jet engine was developed in our country.  With his invention, it became possible to produce the first space rockets in which a person could go into orbit.  Three-stage engines also opened up the possibility of flying to the moon. </p><p>  Further, the launch vehicles were more and more improved.  So, in 1961, a four-stage model of a jet engine was created.  With him, the rocket could reach not only the Moon, but also reach Mars or Venus. </p><h2>  First manned flight </h2><p>  The launch of a space rocket with a man on board took place for the first time on April 12, 1961. The Vostok spaceship, piloted by Yuri Gagarin, detached from the surface of the Earth.  This event was a landmark for mankind.  In April 1961, space exploration received its new development.  The transition to manned flights required designers to create such aircraft that could return to Earth, safely overcoming the atmosphere.  In addition, a human life support system, including air regeneration, nutrition, and much more, was supposed to be provided on a space rocket.  All these tasks have been successfully solved. </p><h2>  Further space exploration </h2><p>  Missiles of the Vostok type for a long time contributed to maintaining the leading role of the USSR in the study of near-Earth airless space.  Their use continues to the present.  Until 1964, Vostok aircraft exceeded all existing counterparts in their carrying capacity. </p><p>  Somewhat later, more powerful carriers were created in our country and in the USA.  The name of this type of space rockets designed in our country is Proton-M.  The American similar device - "Delta IV".  In Europe, the Arian-5 launch vehicle, a heavy type, was designed.  All these aircraft allow you to display 21-25 tons of cargo to a height of 200 km, where low Earth orbit is located. </p>

    <h2>  New developments </h2><p>  Within the framework of the project of manned flight to the moon, LVs belonging to the superheavy class were created.  These are such US space rockets as the Saturn 5, as well as the Soviet N-1.  Later in the USSR, the superheavy rocket "Energy" was created, which is currently not used.  The Space Shuttle has become a powerful American launch vehicle.  This rocket allowed to put into orbit spacecraft weighing 100 tons. </p><h2>  Aircraft manufacturers </h2><p>  Space rockets were designed and created at OKB-1 (Special Design Bureau), TsKBEM (Central Design Bureau of Experimental Engineering), as well as at Energia Scientific Production Association (NPO).  It was here that domestic ballistic missiles of all types saw the light of day.  From here came the eleven strategic complexes that our army adopted.  Through the efforts of the employees of these enterprises, R-7 was also created - the first space rocket, which is considered the most reliable in the world today.  Since the middle of the last century, these industries have initiated and conducted work in all areas related to the <span>development of astronautics.</span>  Since 1994, the company received a new name, becoming OJSC RSC Energia. </p><h2>  Today's space rocket maker day </h2><p>  RSC "Energy" named after  S.P.  Koroleva is a strategic enterprise of Russia.  It plays a leading role in the design and manufacture of manned space systems.  Much attention is paid at the enterprise to the creation of the latest technologies.  Specialized automatic space systems are being developed here, as well as launch vehicles for launching aircraft into orbit.  In addition, RSC Energia is actively introducing high-tech technologies for the production of products not related to the development of airless space. </p>
