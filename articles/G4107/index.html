  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Noosphere is the sphere of mind</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The term ‚Äúnoosphere‚Äù was first proposed by a professor from the Sorbonne, Eduard Leroy, who interpreted it as a ‚Äúthinking‚Äù shell, which forms the consciousness and activity of a person.  The noosphere is literally translated as "the realm of the mind."  Leroy said that <span>this idea</span> is the fruit of working together with his friend, the famous French philosopher Teilhard de Chardin.  At the same time, they relied on lectures on geochemistry, which V.I.Vernadsky read in the Sorbonne in the 1922-23s.  In his speeches, the Russian scientist considered the relationship of everything that happens on our planet and in space.  In the concept of V.I.Vernadsky about the noosphere, a deep and comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the Earth as a result of a single cosmic, biogenic and anthropogenic processes is carried out.  Noosphere is <strong>&nbsp;</strong>  the sphere of interaction between nature and society, where the rational <span>activity of man</span> begins to become the main determinant of development.  The human mind, which manifests itself in scientific and technical achievements, is an important factor in the further development of planet Earth.  The concept of the noosphere believes that the appearance and development of man is a logical, sequential stage in the evolution of the biosphere. </p><p>  At the same time as V.I.Vernadsky, other scientists expressed similar ideas.  The appearance of similar ideas at the same time among various scientists is not accidental.  V.I. Vernadsky believed that for the emergence and development of life, at least three conditions must be met: the existence of water, solar radiation and the phase boundary.  The concept of ‚Äúnoosphere‚Äù includes the sphere of rational human activity, when it gradually becomes the main, dominant factor in development. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to V.I. Vernadsky, the main conditions for the appearance of the noosphere can be: </p><p>  - the dispersal of the entire <span>population of the Earth</span> evenly on the surface of our planet and the destruction of all species that "compete with humans"; </p><p>  - fundamental improvement of communications, the creation of a unified information system and a system for controlling people; </p><p>  - the emergence of fundamentally different sources of energy; </p><p>  - equality of people on Earth; </p><p>  - the creation on the planet of a single Marxist-Leninist state; </p><p>  - Attraction of "the broad masses of the people" in the pursuit of science. </p><p>  V.I. Vernadsky wrote that these social reforms will make the evolution of the transition from the biosphere to the noosphere irreversible. </p><p>  The noosphere is a new, highest stage in the development of the <span>biosphere, the evolution of</span> which is associated with the formation of the <span>social community of</span> people, which has a significant impact on the processes occurring in nature. </p><p>  V.I. Vernadsky wrote that mankind in the process of its maturation becomes a new powerful ‚Äúgeological force‚Äù, with its thoughts and work it transforms the face of planet Earth.  Therefore, for the sake of preserving itself, it must take full responsibility for the evolution of the biosphere, which is gradually turning into the noosphere.  This will require humanity to unconditionally organize society and a new humanistic and <span>environmental ethics.</span> </p><p>  Sometimes he spoke of the ‚Äúnoosphere‚Äù as something that had already taken place and exists in reality, sometimes as a future that was inevitable.  He wrote that the biosphere has repeatedly passed as a result of evolution into a new state.  This is what we are experiencing now, in the last few thousand years, when a person creates a completely new geological force in the biosphere.  The biosphere is gradually moving into a new state - the noosphere and is processed by the scientific thought of man. </p><p>  The significance of the ideas and works of V.I.Vernadsky as the author of the doctrine of the noosphere is that he first scientifically substantiated the unity of man and the biosphere.  Today's ideas about these ideas are as follows: the noosphere is a kind of shell of the planet Earth, which contains the totality of living organisms, including humans, and a part of the planet‚Äôs substance in constant exchange with them. </p>
