    <h2>  Nikon Church reform.  Its consequences </h2><p>  Three centuries ago, Old Believers fled here from church reform.  As a result of Russia's victory in the Russo-Turkish war, its position was strengthened.  The <span>lands</span> united <span>, Moscow</span> became the single center of Russia.  There was a need to create a centralized church, because the Orthodox faith was a single core of the state.  It was decided to come to a single prayer, the same forms of worship and rituals.  For this purpose, Nikon reform was carried out, the basis of which was laid the church practice of Byzantium. </p><p>  It so happened that over the years since the baptism of Rus, a lot has changed in the rites.  <span>Patriarch Nikon</span> decided to eradicate this fragmentation, enlisting the support of the king.  But in reality, everything turned out to be more complicated - not everyone accepted the changes with enthusiasm.  There were many disagreements: a significant part of the boyars, merchants, representatives of the clergy and peasants.  So the split began.  The confrontation intensified, there were many victims, and the Old Believers realized that they had no chance to survive and win.  Some considered the solution to the problem to run, others staged self-immolation protests, while others went underground.  These are the fleeing Old Believers, Lipans, who came to the marshy shores of the Danube. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The base of Vilkovo and the feat of Lipovan </h2><p>  The founders of Vilkovo in 1746 literally rebuilt the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãon the water</span> and pulled out ‚Äúland from under the water,‚Äù namely, they removed the sludge and laid it in the base of future houses and streets, fencing artificial islands with chopped reeds.  The town is literally conquered by the river. </p><p>  During the Russian-Turkish war, Lipovans made an invaluable contribution to the victory.  Their merits were highly appreciated and noted in the reports of Kutuzov.  Without the help of Lipovans, it would be impossible to realize one of the most striking victories in history - the capture of the impregnable fortress of the Ottoman Empire, the city of Izmail.  According to Suvorov, personally inspecting one of the most powerful fortifications in Europe before the assault, "this fortress has no weak points."  Lipovans themselves did not participate in hostilities for religious reasons, but agreed to help Suvorov in organizing the transfer of troops along the Danube.  They provided their boats with excellent propulsion, maneuverability and spaciousness.  Still, over the years of life on the river, the settlers took into account all the nuances of navigation.  Their long narrow boats had noses on both sides, which saved time on turns. </p><p>  The winning commander rewarded the Lipovans with the right to own the waters of the Danube, which was recorded on paper and sealed with the appropriate seal.  In the 20th century, Romania tried to deprive them of this right, but the Hague International Court of Justice left for the rulers of the Danube the right received from Russia.  The act of lipovan is not only a military feat, but also a Christian step of goodwill.  These people have shown that they do not remember old insults, put the common cause above their own interests and can help, not hoping for a bribe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Most of the population of Vilkovo are Russians.  There are 70% of them in the town, and most of them still profess the ancient Old Believer faith.  25% are Ukrainians, as well as Romanians, Moldavians, Bulgarians and representatives of other nationalities.  The population of the city of Vilkovo, according to the 2001 census, amounted to 9.4 thousand people.  Also, according to the same census, Russian is the native language for 84% of the population. </p>

    <p>  The Danube flows into the sea with several separated channels, ‚Äúsleeves‚Äù that resemble a fork, which explains the name of the city.  Parts of this plug were manually connected by numerous channels - "eric", and now it is a town on 72 islands.  Together with the river ducts, man-made canals created the unified water system of Vilkovo.  Photos of the village are clearly demonstrated by canals, alternating with small islands.  And if you look at the city map from the air during the Danube flood, we will see neat rectangular islands of land amid endless water. </p><h2>  The amazing nature of Vilkovo </h2>

    <p>  Ukrainian Venice has every right to be called a paradise.  All nature lives here at the junction of the sea and the river.  The region is characterized by rare species of plants, birds, animals.  Nearby are a <span>pine forest</span> and lakes.  As in ancient Egypt, silt gives plants strength, being the best fertilizer.  Standing in the water, residents take out the sludge, lay it to dry, and then deliver it in wheelbarrows to the right place.  Do-it-yourself land is always transformed into a wonderful neat garden with vegetable beds or a garden with fragrant flowers.  Small reed houses of residents are buried in fragrant gardens and vineyards.  Basically, all the gardens are on the islands.  Imagine only - to get to visit a neighbor, you have to go through the bridge or swim in a boat!  Indeed, Vilkovo is the Ukrainian Venice.  A photo of an ordinary street, the movement of which is carried out by boat, makes it possible to present the usual everyday life of Vilkovites. </p><h2>  Local business </h2><p>  In addition to agriculture, local residents are engaged in fishing.  Moreover, this town is rightly called the capital of the Danube fishermen.  Fish farming in the sea and the river is the main industry for the population.  Also recently, reeds have been in good demand for export.  Vilkovites sell fish, local strawberries, grapes, homemade wine and other products to tourists. </p><h2>  sights </h2>

    <p>  What can you see on vacation in Vilkovo?  Ukrainian Venice is the only city in Europe that is located on the territory of the Danube Plavni Biosphere Reserve.  This is a state-protected territory where natural complexes unique to the area are located and <span>environmental monitoring is</span> carried out in conjunction with scientific research.  The nature here is full of life, many species of plants, animals, birds, waterfowl and even aquatic invertebrates are listed in the Red Book. </p><p>  At the confluence of the Danube in the Black Sea there is a symbolic sign "0 km".  They say that to be here and go under it is considered a good omen - it will bring good luck and health.  Just think - over 2.5 thousand kilometers is the path of the Danube, which flows into the sea right here, in a small man-made town - Vilkovo. </p><h2>  Ukrainian Venice.  Relaxation </h2><p>  There are several recreation centers, a hotel and mini-hotels.  Judging by the reviews, this is an ideal place to relax as a couple, a large company or a family with children.  By the way, in many yards there are playgrounds with swings and slides.  During the day you can take a boat or boat ride along the picturesque river delta, go fishing, visit the best fish market in the region.  Of the national dishes, it is worth trying, as experienced travelers assure, a real fish soup, the famous Danube herring, smoked bream, Salamur sauce, Lipovan herbal tea and, of course, a glass of local Novak wine.  Vilkovo - Ukrainian Venice, it is certainly worth a visit! </p>
