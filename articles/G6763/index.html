The phone attracted many users not only with the filling, but also with their appearance. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  There were no significant changes in terms of the location of external parts.  Behind the smartphone, a speaker, a main camera, a flash and the usual company logo were sheltered.  There were no changes on the front side, where the display, sensors, earpiece, front camera, control buttons and, of course, the company sign are located. </p>

    <p>  The device looks quite compact due to the 4.7-inch display.  Among the overall smartphones C660 stands out nicely. </p><p>  On the side of the right are buttons for controlling sound and turning on the device.  At the top is the headphone jack, and the bottom end has become a haven for USB input. </p><p>  But then the fun begins.  Fantastic changes have occurred in terms of the material used for the Lenovo S660.  Housing specifications have changed from bored plastic to aluminum.  Now the device is completely metal, and this enthralls.  The main drawback of the aluminum case is fingerprints, but they are quite easy to wipe.  So a slight minus is completely covered by the solid look and durability of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The newcomer got an IPS-display with a good 4.7-inch size.  It may seem that the screen is somewhat small, but it is quite enough for comfortable use of the smartphone.  A bit disappointing in the <span>"Lenovo S660"</span> characteristic resolution.  The manufacturer installed only 960 x 540, of course, I would like more.  Despite the lack of resolution, the screen turned out to be deep and bright. </p>

    <p>  Complaints about the behavior of the display in the sun will not arise.  Automatic brightness control copes with difficulties.  It is also important that the angle of inclination does not distort the image. </p><p>  The company also took care of the screen protection.  The installed <span>Gorilla Glass</span> solidly performs the functions assigned to it.  You can not be afraid to damage the display in your pocket or when dropped. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  The company installed pretty good hardware in the Lenovo S660.  The characteristic of the filling will only please with its performance.  The smartphone runs on the MTK processor, which is already familiar to most Chinese devices.  The presence of four cores, each of which operates at a frequency of 1.3 GHz, colors the picture.  The use of the already bored Mali-400 video accelerator was a little disappointing.  Of course, I wanted something more modern. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite the use of a few outdated parts, performance is good.  In fact, the filling comes to the perfect balance and works as efficiently as possible. </p>

    <p>  Cuts at the root of the impression of the existing picture, the meager RAM "Lenovo S660".  The memory characteristic is only one gigabyte, which looks like a black sheep against a solid processor.  Actually, this parameter does not allow the processor to show everything that it is capable of. </p><p>  The situation with the built-in memory is slightly better.  The device has 8 GB, but in fact you can only use 6. As much as 2 GB goes to the Android system installed in the device.  You can expand the memory by installing a flash card up to 32 GB. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The speaker present in the smartphone does not stand out among the mass of the company's devices.  It can not be said that it is bad, but it will not cause much enthusiasm.  Improvements in sound quality compared to previous devices did not happen.  As for the device on Android, the quality is acceptable. </p><p>  The situation is similar with headphones.  Something terrific is not worth the wait, but you can count on the sound with a pleasant sound with all frequencies in full. </p><p>  The speaker is also not good.  The lack of noise reduction is somewhat alarming at first, but you can hear through it well. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Only 8 megapixels, but excellent resolution - this is the opinion about the Lenovo S660.  The characteristics of the camera are really good, although only on paper.  In reality, these 8 megapixels can be compared with 5 megapixels.  Even the huge resolution of 3264 x 2448 does not save. </p>

    <p>  The camera takes rather mediocre shots, most likely due to a lack of sharpness.  Video recording is carried out in HD, but there are also few advantages. </p><p>  The front camera with the data of 0.3 megapixels given to her will not cause either.  Such a camera will fit only for video communication, and the picture will not turn out very good. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The installed battery is enough for the Lenovo S660.  A review of the entire S line makes it clear that the reinforced battery is not just here.  The entire range of models consists of powerful devices designed for entertainment.  Accordingly, to attend to the duration of the work was the right decision. </p><p>  There can be no complaints about the battery, although the 36 hours of operation announced by the company are somewhat overstated.  In reality, the phone will work in the active use of 6-7 hours. </p><p>  Of course, you can install a reinforced version of the battery, but this is when the need arises. </p>

    <h2>  System </h2><p>  The smartphone operates on the basis of Android with version 4.2.2.  Such a system maximizes the potential of the device.  Naturally, the device will not pull very demanding games, but average applications by their requests will work perfectly. </p><p>  If desired, you can flash the <span>Lenovo S660</span> phone <span>.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> on the Web will help you choose the most suitable official system or a good build. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  No new items appeared in the delivery set.  Options "Lenovo S660": instructions, USB cable, network adapter and, of course, headphones.  Not the richest set, but quite decent. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  Just want to note the wonderful stuffing "Lenovo S660."  Owner reviews about her are excellent.  The hardware really turned out to be powerful and productive.  There are some minor flaws, but they are smoothed against the general background. </p><p>  Pleased with the concern of the company about the duration of the device.  A battery with a capacity of 3000 mAh looks like the most successful option for a smartphone. </p><p>  If you discard the old video accelerator, the screen can safely be attributed to the merits.  Image quality has always been a strong point of the S series, and the company has once again proven this. </p><p>  To ignore the appearance of "Lenovo S660", reviews of which are left by most owners, will be inappropriate.  The use of aluminum definitely brings a twist to the already good design.  Reliability of the case and high-quality assembly are the strengths of the device. </p><p>  The price of a smartphone is also one of the strengths.  Despite the fact that the device is quite functional, its cost turned out to be budgetary. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The device could not do without minuses.  For example, not the most successful implementation of the camera somewhat reduces enthusiasm.  Of course, medium-quality images will be enough for the small needs, but you don‚Äôt have much to hope for. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>
