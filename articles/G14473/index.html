The population of <span>Mytishchi district</span> is 186.1 thousand people. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  In ancient times, on the site of this city was the village of Loshakovo.  Over time, other settlements joined it, thus, a volost was formed. </p><p>  At the end of the XVIII century, Catherine II issued a decree, according to which it was necessary to lay a gravity water supply system from Mytishchi to Moscow.  For a long time he supplied the city with water from Mytishchi springs.  Water supply began to work in 1804.  In the XIX century, the first textile factories appeared here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mytishchi sights" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1023524.jpg" width="567"></div>

    <p>  In 1860, Mytishchi turns into an important transport hub near Moscow, and the substation village acquires the characteristic features of a future city.  In 1896, one of the largest Russian railcar manufacturing plants, which belonged to a group of industrialists, began operating in Mytishchi.  In 1909, in Mytishchi, the country's first viscose silk factory was commissioned.  Soon a working village appeared near her. </p><p>  In 1925, Mytishchi received the official status of a city.  A few years later, the neighboring villages - Sharapovo, Taininka, Rupasovo, Perlovka, Zarechnaya Sloboda - were attached to it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today Mytishchi is a modern, actively developing city.  Its industry is represented by many industries: mechanical engineering, the production of finishing and building materials, light and food industries, instrument making, metalworking and others. </p><h2>  Sights of Mytishchi and description </h2><p>  We begin our acquaintance with the natural monument of the city - the Yauza River.  This is the left tributary of the <span>Moscow River.</span>  <span>The river is</span> small, its length is 48 kilometers.  It originates in the Moscow region, in the swamps of Elk Island.  The mouth is located in the center of Moscow, near the Bolshoi Ustinsky bridge.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Yauza basin is 452 square meters.  km </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mytishchi sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1020461.jpg" width="600"></div>  At the beginning of the XVIII century, from the mouth to Sokolniki, the banks of the Yauza were actively built up, its channel was blocked by numerous mills and dams.  This greatly polluted her water.  In the 30s the riverbed was leveled and almost doubled, granite embankments were erected along the reservoir, and new bridges appeared.  The entire undeveloped part of the Yauza Valley in 1991 was declared a natural monument.

    <h2>  Pestovsky reservoir </h2><p>  Another natural monument, which is famous for Mytishchi.  The sights of the city, to which the Pestovsky reservoir belongs, are created by human hands.  This is an artificial reservoir, built in 1937 during the construction of the hydroelectric complex on the Vyaz river. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The waterworks complex consists of a dam, the length of which is 707 meters, a catchment and a bottom drainage.  The reservoir area is 11.6 square meters.  km, volume - 54.3 million cubic meters.  The length of the artificial reservoir is more than six kilometers, the width exceeds two kilometers, the depth is 14 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mytischi city sights" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1020449.jpg" width="410"></div>

    <p>  Pestovskoe reservoir is part of the canal system.  Moscow, the reservoir intersects with other reservoirs - Ikshinsky, Pyalovsky and Uchinsky.  On its picturesque shores there are several marinas - Lesnoye, Tishkovo, Khvoyny Bor. </p><h2>  Church of the Annunciation of the Virgin </h2><p>  Sights of Mytishchi are, of course, unique religious buildings.  A monument of church architecture can be seen in amazing beauty in this city near Moscow - the snow-white church of the Annunciation of the Virgin.  The stairs were originally made - they resemble the entrance to a wooden fairytale tower.  Two symmetrical spans rise to the platforms that crown the tents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mytischi city sights photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1023534.jpg" width="529"></div>  This magnificent stone cathedral appeared in 1677 on the site of a wooden structure.  In 1812, the temple was badly damaged.  And in Soviet times, his fate was not easy.  Like the main attractions of the city of Mytishchi related to religious architecture, it was closed in 1924.  Its premises were used as a meat shop, and as a warehouse, and as a hostel.  The church returned to the Orthodox Church in 1989.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Church of the Trinity </h2><p>  Residents of the city of Mytishchi are very kind to monuments.  Attractions of interest to tourists appeared here at different times.  For example, the Trinity Church of the Life-Giving is located on the site where the Don Church was built in 1896.  After it was closed in the 30s, for a long time it was empty and gradually collapsed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the main attractions of the city of Mytishchi" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1020453.jpg" width="600"></div>  In October 1994, the Orthodox parish of the church was again officially registered.  The new one-story building was built in 2004 from wood.  Next to it stands a bell tower.  The temple is crowned with a dome with a cross.  Today it houses a house church and a cultural and educational center. <br><br>  The church has a Sunday school.  Here you can do choral singing, embroidery, beadwork, icon painting.

    <h2>  Drama theatre </h2><p>  Everyone who comes to Mytishchi, attractions can choose to your liking.  Theatergoers will surely enjoy visiting the FEST Theater.  He appeared in 1977.  This is the main theater of Mytishchi, which has been professional since 1988. <br><br>  Its history began in 1976, when the committee of the Komsomol MLTI announced an amateur art competition, in which faculties of the Forestry Engineering Institute took part. <br><br>  Students of the Faculty of Electronics gave their team the name "FEST".

Grishin were engaged in the performance.  The guys took first place in the competition.  Since that time, the FEST propaganda team appeared in the city. </p><h2>  Water supply monument </h2><p>  There is a monument in the city that amazes everyone who comes to Mytishchi.  Sights of the city (photos you can see in this article) can claim the title of the most original.  First of all, this concerns the structure erected in honor of the bicentennial of the first water supply system. </p><p>  An unusual monument was erected before entering the city, from the Volkovsky highway.  It was conceived as an object of street design, as it has interesting viewpoints at the entrance to it from different sides.  When approaching him, it seems that he is growing out of the ground, and the closer you get to him, the more he gets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mytischi attractions and description" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1020450.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The composition is 18 meters high and consists of three pipes, which are crowned by <span>water valves.</span>  The design is installed on a circle with a diameter of sixty meters.  A hill is poured on this territory.  On one side, a shrubbery planted on it.  The rest is planted with a variety of plants, so the hill constantly blooms. </p><p>  The monument still causes controversy about its architectural and aesthetic value.  Nevertheless, the main goal set for its creators has been achieved, the monument does not leave anyone indifferent.  Today it is not only a visiting card of the city, but also one of the most original monuments of the country. </p><h2>  Kva-Kva Park </h2><p>  Guests of the city enjoy visiting its main attractions.

    <p>  A six-meter wave pool shakes adults and children on artificial waves, like an ocean surf.  Children love amusement rides in Detsky Gorodok most of all, and adult lovers of a relaxing holiday like relaxing in a spa complex with a Finnish sauna, a Japanese font, a Russian bath and a solarium.  At the "Floor" bar you will be offered light snacks, and for those who are thoroughly hungry, we recommend that you go to the "Troy" restaurant, where you can have a tight and inexpensive lunch. </p><h2>  "Mytishchi Arena" </h2><p>  Arriving in Mytishchi, the sights of which are diverse, you will probably want to relax after the excursions in the modern sports and entertainment complex Arena Mytishchi. </p><p>  The palace seats nine thousand spectators.  Here, conditions have been created so that people of any age can engage in sports such as hockey or figure skating. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="main attractions of Mytishchi" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1020459.jpg" width="600"></div>  The first stone of the Mytishchi Arena was solemnly laid in the spring of 2002.  And it was commissioned in mid-October 2005.  The building of the complex is distinguished by an original architectural solution.  The facades are made of metal with a large glazing area.  The project of Skanska East Europe Oy (Finland) was the starting point for the start of construction, but then it was finalized by the Mosoblstroyproekt design institute.  As a result, a complex was built that meets international standards.
