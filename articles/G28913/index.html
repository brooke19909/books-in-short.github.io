    <p>  Sooner or later, each of us has free money, but how can we manage it?  Unfortunately, there are not enough of them at the penthouse near the ocean, putting it into a bank for deposit is too banal and simple, and besides, it is not so profitable.  Everyone knows that money should not be idle, their task is to work and bring income to their owner.  In connection with this problem, a key question arises about how to increase your <span>money?</span>  <span>How to</span> make the funds ‚Äúmultiply‚Äù themselves?  It will be enough to successfully invest them! </p><p>  In fact, everything is not so complicated as it might seem at first glance.  To start investor activity it will be enough to learn a few simple rules and never go against them.  Is it possible to take specialized courses?  Do not miss her! </p><p>  First, remember: no one will do anything for you and tell you company secrets about how to increase money, and from just thoughts or desires there will be no more money.  Secondly, you do not need to contact a broker right away and buy one type of securities, the name of which is most liked, because the market is an unpredictable thing.  What does it mean?  Everything is very simple: in five minutes you can earn a fortune if you are very, very lucky.  But quite unexpectedly for an investor, it could happen otherwise: at one moment, absolutely everything that was acquired by excessive labor will be lost.  Thirdly, if you are a very gambling person, then it is better to forget about this type of earnings and not to recall its existence, because the most important thing here is to be able to stop in time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After these three points, you are still wondering how to increase money?  Then let's continue!  First of all, it is necessary to clearly define the period by which funds will be invested.  With long-term investments, short-term drops in well-known <span>stock market indices</span> will not particularly affect the <span>profitability of investments</span> <span>,</span> but this method will not allow you to quickly withdraw money from circulation, whatever the urgent reason.  Short-term investments are easy to convert back to currency, but it‚Äôs more difficult to earn money.  Then you need to clearly determine the amount of money for investment - available funds.  This is necessary for your own safety, because you are concerned about the question of how to increase money, and not about how you can quickly launch all the property into the air. </p><p>  The next step is awareness of responsibility.  At the very beginning of the path there can be both victories and failures, but the main thing is to be able to accept this, to gain experience and to be ready for everything.  But there are two extremes: if you are afraid to conduct transactions, being careful not to lose your savings each time, it will be very difficult to earn at least a penny.  Everything should be in moderation and the risk should be justified.  Only after understanding all this, you can try to answer the question of <span>how to invest</span> money. </p><p>  We select a bank management fund and, if necessary, get advice from a specialist.  After analyzing the information received and the statistics on the profitability of various funds, you need to contact a broker.  It will help to place money in the appropriate direction: interbank deposits, <span>government securities,</span> precious stones or in any other.  The last step is to monitor the statistics of changes in the value of stocks or resources. </p><p>  So, decided on a risk?  Want to get adrenaline and make money on it?  Then you simply must know all the subtleties of how to increase money!  The most popular way is to invest in income funds for various purposes.  Having studied just a few simple rules, you can safely move on and learn the intricacies of this matter in practice.  The result will depend not only on the investor‚Äôs knowledge, but also on the state of the market in which he trades. </p>
