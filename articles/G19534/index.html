Veterans of this war are held in high esteem among modern people no less than participants in the Second World War.  Military operations in Afghanistan are inextricably linked with the history of the 66th brigade in Jalalabad. </p><h2>  66th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade </h2><p>  During the Afghan war, there was the 66th separate motorized rifle Vyborg Red Banner Order of Lenin of the Order of Alexander Nevsky Brigade.  An invaluable contribution was made by 66 brigade in Jalalabad, the Afghan city where active military operations were conducted.  The brigade was a military unit, existed from 09.25.1941 to 01.06.1988 in the Soviet Union and was subordinate to the commander of the 68-1 motorized infantry division from 1969 to 1980 and under the command of the 40th combined arms army from 1980 1988 to 1988 </p><p>  From 1969 to 1980, it was part of the 68th motorized infantry division of SAVO and the 40th combined arms army of TurkVo.  It consists of departments and units. </p><p>  It was located in Alma-Ata from 1947 to 1979, being the 186th motorized rifle division.  Later 66 brigade in Jalalabad was deployed from 1980 to 1988. These years were one of the most difficult in the history of the brigade.  66 brigade excelled not only in Jalalabad.  She took part in many operations. </p><p>  The abbreviation DShB is 66 brigade, Jalalabad. </p><h2>  Awards 66 MHI brigade </h2><p>  For participation in other conflicts, the team was awarded such significant awards as: </p><ul><li>  Order of Lenin. </li><li>  Order of the Red Banner. </li><li>  Order of Alexander Nevsky. </li></ul><h2>  How it was: the story of the 66th motorized rifle brigade </h2><p>  At the very beginning of World War II, the 1236th regiment of the 372nd SD was formed in Barnaul.  The 186th motorized rifle regiment of the 68th MD becomes its successor.  Later, the 66th separate motorized rifle brigade will be formed from it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As part of the 372nd SD, the 1236th regiment participated in the Tikhvin, Malovisher, Luban, Sinyavinsky, Leningrad-Novgorod, Novgorod-Luga, Vyborg, Vyborg-Petrozavodsk, East Prussian, Mlav-Elbing, East Pomeranian, Berlin, Stettinsky Rostock offensive operations, Mginsky, Baltic, Tallinn operations and in breaking the blockade of Leningrad. </p><p>  When the Second World War ended, the division was present in Germany as part of the Soviet occupation. </p><p>  In 1946, the 372nd Division was reorganized into the 46th Rifle Brigade.  This decision was associated with a reduction in the USSR Armed Forces.  But the division was not completely transformed.  Some of its parts were reorganized into infantry battalions.  From 1949 to 1953 there was an active restoration of rifle divisions and brigades.  For a while, all of them were returned to their previous numbers.  In 1955, finally began to fill the military corps, empty until this time.  Eyewitnesses admitted that the sight of the empty barracks was terrifying, recalling the number of losses. </p><p>  Only in 1957, the 372nd SD was transformed into the Motorized Rifle Novgorod Red Banner Division and received the number 68. Then, the 186th Motorized Rifle Regiment appeared in Almaty, which was converted from 1236 rifle regiment. </p><h2>  Afghan war </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="photo 66 of the jalalabad brigade" class="if uuid-3212676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64872/3212676.jpg"></div><p>  War veterans remember that day as it is now.  Their stories are more piercing and emotionally colored than news bulletins, news items and documentaries.  Members of those years still remember how on December 27, 1979, just before the New Year, the regiment woke up an alarm.  For a long time, not quite understanding what was happening, the soldiers march along the railroad tracks in order to gather in the Termez area by the evening of January 1, 1980. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Below you can see in photo 66 of the Jalalabad brigade. </p><div class="photo" data-original="srimalfernando.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="66 motorized rifle brigade jalalabad" class="if uuid-3212661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64872/3212661.jpg"></div><p>  After 2 days, the regiment is withdrawn from the 68th MSD and transmitted 108-1 MSD, TurkVo. </p><p>  On January 4, 1980, the regiment was introduced to Afghanistan for military operations.  Battles are fought in several <span>Afghan provinces:</span> Talukan, Kunduz, Nakhrin, Baghlan and others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="incredibleimages4u.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Afghanistan jalalabad 66 brigade" class="if uuid-3212656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64872/3212656.jpg"></div><p>  Not all soldiers withstand harsh conditions and fierce battles.  Many of them are exhausted physically and psychologically.  On January 9-10, an armed rebellion erupted among the personnel, as a result of which part of the soldiers sided with the opposition.  The forces of the regiment manage to crush the rebellion. </p><p>  For two days, from February 23, 1980, the 168th motorized rifle regiment overcomes the distance from the city of Puli, through Salang and Charikar, to Kabul.  The path is very difficult due to the strong gas contamination of the tunnel.  But by the end of February, the regiment was gathering and settling in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city of Kabul. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  66th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade, Jalalabad, Afghanistan (1979-1989) </h2><p>  Jalalabad was the place from which it was easiest to manage combat units throughout the territory of warfare.  However, for this it was necessary to create a special headquarters, scattering the rest of the composition of the Afghan provinces.  But for this, a combat unit was needed, including the units required for the effective conduct of hostilities. </p><p>  The management decided that the eastern part of the DRA needs to be strengthened.  Then it was ordered to form a tactical unit OKSVA.  On the basis of the 186th motorized rifle regiment, 66 motorized rifle brigade was formed, which was the military unit numbered 93992. Separate units of the brigade were located in the cities of Nangarhar, Kunar, Lagman.  Determining the location of the headquarters, the command decided that there was no equal in choosing the ideal location for the organization of the 66th Jalalabad brigade. </p><p>  On March 1, 1980, a directive was adopted, according to which a number of some enhancements were made: </p><ul><li>  Combined various brigades and battalions, for example, the airborne assault 48th battalion and part of the 39th airborne assault brigade, adding to the composition of paratroopers. </li><li>  There was an increase in artillery. </li><li>  Actively increased combat and rear support, which consisted of an increase in the staff of the regimental ammunition. </li><li>  The 66th brigade contained units that controlled the territory of Jellalabad Airport.  In order to remove the extra load from them, at the end of 1981 it was decided to form a separate 1353th security battalion for this. </li></ul><p>  To block the supply of weapons and ammunition to the Mujahideen, the command ordered to block the routes connecting Afghanistan and Pakistan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rarehistoricalphotos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="66 brigade jalalabad engineering sapper company" class="if uuid-3212670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64872/3212670.jpg"></div><p>  To accomplish this, a separate 15th Special Purpose Brigade was introduced. </p><p>  The 66th brigade was sent to the city of Jalalabad immediately after re-registration. </p><h2>  The composition of the brigade </h2><p>  All of these units worked harmoniously and clearly: </p><ul><li>  Management and Brigade Headquarters. </li><li>  Propaganda and Propaganda Squad (BAPO). </li><li>  The 856th post-courier station. </li><li>  1417th bath and laundry point. </li><li>  Commercial and household enterprise. </li><li>  Orchestra. </li><li>  Bakery. </li><li>  Platoons: flamethrower, chemical protection, commandant. </li><li>  Battalions: air assault, tank, artillery, 3 motorized rifle. </li><li>  Batteries: anti-tank, anti-aircraft missile. </li><li>  Companies: reconnaissance, signalmen, engineer-engineer, repair, automobile convoy, which performed the role of material support, and, of course, medical-sanitary, engineer-engineer company 66 of the Jalalabad brigade. </li></ul><p>  The personnel of 66 motorized rifle brigade in Jalalabad and other provinces in total totaled 3,500 fighters.  It was an almost unique combat unit. </p><p>  The commanders were Smirnov O.E., Ozdoev S.G., Tomashov N.S., Posokhov A.G., Zharikov A.N., Avlasenko V.V. </p><h2>  Withdrawal from Afghanistan and the dismantling of the brigade </h2><p>  The brigade‚Äôs final withdrawal from the war zone began on May 15, 1988 and lasted 12 days.  She was immediately returned to her previous number and assigned the Battle Banner of a separate motorized rifle brigade. </p><p>  In the photo below: parting 66 brigade.  Jalalabad, Afghanistan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2013ritemail2014.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="photo 66 of the jalalabad brigade" class="if uuid-3212665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64872/3212665.jpg"></div><h2>  Awards </h2><p>  The titles of heroes of the USSR were awarded: Shornikov N.A., Demchenko G.A., Stovba A.I., Igolchenko S.V.  Ranks of Heroes  were awarded: Amosov S.A., Gadzhiev N.O.  The title of the hero of Kazakhstan was awarded Ertayev B.E. </p><h2>  Memories </h2><div class="photo" data-original="islam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="66 separate motorized rifle brigade jalalabad afghanistan 1" class="if uuid-3212673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64872/3212673.jpg"></div><p>  The 66th separate motorized rifle brigade was deployed in the city of Jalalabad.  In mid-May, Captain Garin, who at that time commanded the battalion, was killed.  The losses were colossal.  During the first two years - 52 dead soldiers, and even more wounded.  Statists lost count, according to confirmed data, there were more than 200 people. </p><p>  The period from 1949 to 1953 was the restoration of infantry divisions.  All of them, leaving the brigades, again received their previous numbers.  At the end of February, 186 motorized rifle regiments were ordered to concentrate in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city of Kabul, since the 70th and 66th separate motorized rifle brigades at that time were, in principle, the only motorized rifle brigades in the USSR Armed Forces, which included airborne assault battalions. </p><p>  In addition, these were the largest brigades in terms of the number of personnel.  Veterans recall that after the disbandment of the 787th Motorized Rifle Regiment received the Battle Banner of the 66th Brigade.  He was stationed in Termez and took part in hostilities in Jalalabad and Assabad. </p><p>  The first losses occurred at the end of March.  03/30/1980 Lieutenant Turchenkov died.  The training of the battalion took place in Termez throughout February and March 1980. </p><div class="photo" data-original="incredibleimages4u.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="66 jalalabad brigade" class="if uuid-3212654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64872/3212654.jpg"></div><p>  Later death became more frequent, many soldiers died.  Veterans remember their combat exits.  How they walked in chains, how their comrades ran into mines.  These terrible memories left their mark on the fate of people who fought so that others could live. </p>
