    <h2>  What is a </h2><p>  This is a fairly young complex, opened in 1999 and equipped with the latest technology.  You will definitely like it here.  "Hope", the resort of Togliatti, is located in a forest, not simple, but coniferous, evergreen.  One hour spent in such a zone enriches the body with pure oxygen.  Phytoncides secreted by conifers have a powerful healing effect, help to cure acute respiratory infections, pertussis, tuberculosis and many other diseases. </p><p>  Especially fresh air ensures the proximity of the reservoir: "Hope", the resort of Togliatti, overlooks the sandy shore of the Zhiguli Sea.  Its waters can not boast of medicinal properties, but this does not in the least reduce the pleasure of basking in the warm sand and taking a leisurely swim. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What is included in the standard program </h2><p>  If you paid a ticket, then you have already assigned a number and the right to three meals a day.  In addition, you are provided with a fairly extensive range of medical services.  Treatment begins with a reception by a therapist.  He will listen to complaints and tell you which specialists still need to be passed in order to get a complete picture of the state of the body.  It is the qualified doctors that the Nadezhda sanatorium (Togliatti) is famous for.  The official site contains all the necessary information about each of them. </p><p>  In addition, you can undergo an examination by a gynecologist, urologist, department heads and use the services of a physiotherapist.  But that is far from all.  You can choose from a course of <span>dry carbon dioxide baths,</span> iodine-bromine, coniferous, pearl, turpentine, sea.  Each of them has its own indications, so in the treatment of the musculoskeletal system vortex, four-chamber and Jacuzzi bathtubs are widely used. </p><p>  Already interesting, but that is far from all.  The procedures of heat therapy (paraffin) and electric mud, massage: manual, underwater, using a special chair, magnetotherapy and laser therapy, reflexology, physiotherapy exercises are considered very effective.  With many diseases, speleotherapy, aromatherapy, inhalation, and herbal medicine help well.  All this, plus the opportunity to walk in the fresh air, swim and sunbathe, you can get without spending extra money. </p>

    <h2>  What can be obtained additionally </h2><p>  But not only the standard set provides the sanatorium "Hope", Togliatti.  The official site contains more material, but we will briefly indicate a list of paid services.  These are services of an ENT doctor, endocrinologist, mammologist, gerudotherapist and even a psychotherapist.  You can return home not only in excellent health, but also in peace of mind.  The program also includes therapy for smoking and obesity. </p><p>  Beauticians work at the sanatorium, whose services include, among other things, <span>hardware figure correction.</span>  The pressure chamber and the rehabilitation capsule will help to conduct a comprehensive program to improve the body.  A dentist will easily give you a "Hollywood smile."  For treatment and relaxation, there is a sauna with a pool and a solarium.  We must pay tribute to the high requirements that Nadezhda puts forward to its specialists.  The Togliatti sanatorium rarely opens vacancies for the selection of specialists, here the staff has been working for years, but if this happens, only the best can withstand the competition. </p>

    <h2>  Beach activities </h2><p>  All vacationers tend to get here.  Can a pool with the open sea be compared, where there are no coasts, the sun shines and the sand glistens?  Sanatorium "Nadezhda" (Tolyatti) is located just a few steps from the equipped city beach.  The highlight is the presence of your own yacht club.  Have you ever dreamed of taking your own ship to the sea, becoming a brave captain and embarking on an adventure?  Here it becomes reality. </p><p>  On the way to the beach, you can take a walk through a beautiful park with an interesting landscape design.  In the evening, fountains with color music become a favorite place for walking. </p><h2>  Required documents </h2><p>  There are not many of them: this is, first of all, a ticket that you issued through a travel agency.  It is imperative that you have your passport or other <span>identification document with you: an identity card</span> or birth certificate.  In addition, you will need a spa card.  It is issued by your attending physician, who usually initiates referrals for treatment to a sanatorium.  The local therapist must make notes about the current state of health, past illnesses and general recommendations for medical procedures.  Collecting documents does not take much time. </p><p>  The Samara sanatorium "Nadezhda" is a corner of paradise peace and magnificent nature.  Here, sleep is normalized, the nervous system comes in order, and health improves.  Against such a background, treatment of even the most severe, chronic diseases is much better.  The resort operates all year round, without breaks for the holidays. </p>
