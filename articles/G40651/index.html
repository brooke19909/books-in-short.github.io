It is with this organization that you can be completely calm and confidently expect positive results. </p><p>  The most important thing is a conversation even before the start of construction work, in which all the nuances and preferences of the client are discussed - this is what almost everyone who contacted this organization claims.  Employees carefully listen to the requirements and help with difficulties in choosing.  A huge number of questions are immediately considered: from the construction site to the model of the outlet in the bedroom.  The client will immediately be shown the full cost and construction technology used.  Provide a plan and deadlines. </p><p>  Further, the client and company employees meet directly at the site, where they are once again negotiating and summarizing.  A number of expenses and calculations are determined.  It should be noted that the company is calmly working both with a mortgage and with the use of certificates.  The company deals with all negotiations with the bank. </p><p>  After that, all the necessary documents are collected and an agreement is signed, which clearly indicates the rights of the client, the subtleties of design, construction and other, no less important points. </p><p>  To build a house, the best specialists are hired to work in four shifts.  First, the site is prepared, then, the frame, roof, insulation and exterior decoration are mounted.  Then create a neat appearance of the building.  And already at the end they are going to repair inside the house. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Customers say that upon completion of construction, the company will make many pleasant surprises, leaving this day in the memory for many, many years to come. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="large construction companies in Krasnoyarsk" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57358/1896689.jpg" width="600"></div>
