    <h2>  Fundamental differences from its predecessor </h2><p>  If you look at the characteristics of the camera as a whole, you can safely say that the modernization was very successful.  It is not surprising that the camera is currently considered the most technologically advanced and expensive model from Nikon.  Whether it is worth the money requested for it will only become clear with time. </p><p>  The following are the key differences between the <span>Nikon D4.</span>  First of all, <span>Nikon D4S</span> got a shocking range of photosensitivity (ISO value ranges from 50 to 409600).  Thanks to this, shooting in poor lighting conditions has reached a different level.  The camera boasts new features regarding manual preset <span>white balance</span> and a large selection of options for video recording. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The novelty has become compatible with lenses that are of type E, and the user can independently adjust the brightness of the display.  It should be noted that the developers have significantly improved protection against the influence of various external factors on the Nikon D4S model.  Reviews from the pros are a vivid confirmation that, among other things, the device has acquired some other abilities and functions that provide the ability to receive images of the highest quality, as well as settings for more convenient management.  In more detail about all this we will go further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="differences Nikon D4 Nikon D4S" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1013772.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  Against the background of a wide range of other mirror-type cameras available on the market, the novelty stands out with its original appearance, which resembles its predecessor.  The camera has an all-metal body.  Its dimensions in width, height and length, respectively, are 160 x 156.5 x 90.5 mm.  Taking into account the battery and memory, it weighs 1.35 kilograms.  An ordinary amateur photo enthusiast or a novice in this field will probably be scared by the abundance of controls on the Nikon D4S body.  Reviews of professionals, on the other hand, call this feature a great advantage of the model.  Moreover, they indicate that this fact is intriguing and attracts the attention of experienced photographers.  According to representatives of the manufacturer, this they sought to facilitate the shooting process, as well as speed up access to the settings.  Be that as it may, most of the most commonly used buttons remained in the same places familiar to Nikon brand connoisseurs.  Particular attention was paid by Japanese engineers to the strength of the new items.  Thanks to this, the user does not need to worry about its use in extreme conditions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  For photographers accustomed to classical photographic equipment, something remotely similar to a square box model may seem huge and uncomfortable.  However, in reality this is completely wrong.  According to the reviews of the owners of the device, its ergonomics are thought out so well that they can be easily controlled while holding in one hand, despite the heavy weight (the Nikon D4S camera without a lens weighs more than one kilogram).  This is greatly facilitated by the presence of honed contours of the protrusion for the fingers and a comfortable grip.  The creators of the camera also improved the streamlining and shape of the control keys, which facilitated its operation in conditions of high humidity.  Thanks to the rubber gasket at the bottom, it does not slip on inclined surfaces. </p>

    <h2>  Matrix </h2><p>  A 16.2-megapixel CMOS-type upgraded image sensor lies at the heart of the Nikon D4S.  The sensor‚Äôs specifications provide superior-quality still images and also provide flexible options for cropping images.  In addition, according to the developers, it boasts a wide range and speed of reading information.  One cannot fail to note the excellent image clarity when setting high sensitivity values ‚Äã‚Äã(the maximum available ISO indicator is 409600, which is a record figure in the global photo industry).  An image with a resolution of 4928 x 3280 pixels is displayed on the viewfinder. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The EXPEED-4 processor is responsible for the performance of the Nikon D4S.  The characteristics of this device, according to Japanese engineers, make it 30% more effective than the previous version.  Thanks to him, the shooting speed also increased while maintaining automatic focus, which reached 11 frames per second.  It should be emphasized that the processor is equipped with advanced algorithms for reducing noise during operation. </p>

    <h2>  Optics </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a proprietary Nikon F mount, which is compatible with almost every F-lens released after 1977.  The device also supports any optics developed by the manufacturer for mirror devices with a DX-matrix.  When you install it, the image is automatically masked on the viewfinder.  In addition, 5: 4 and 6: 5 modes are also available, which are equivalent for 30 x 24 and 30 x 20 pictures, respectively. The ability to use heavy lenses for shooting at long distances is another serious advantage of the Nikon D4S.  The reviews of professionals indicate that, due to the competent distribution of the weight of the camera, their use does not cause absolutely any discomfort. </p><h2>  Auto focus </h2><p>  The camera boasts the fastest auto focus in the history of Nikon.  In particular, an improved <span>Multi-CAM</span> 3500FX <span>system</span> consisting of 51 points is used here (15 of them are cross-shaped).  At the same time, the operating range of the sensor is in the range from -2 to +19 EV.  The user can use focus modes at 1, 9 or 21 points. </p><p>  Improved locking, high functionality and the availability of a fundamentally new group mode are key features of the Nikon D4S auto focus system.  Expert reviews point out the model‚Äôs capabilities regarding the control of its five zones, their size and movement, depending on the layout of the frame.  Background isolation and guidance have significantly improved compared to the predecessor.  Even small objects that move quickly over long distances can be tracked very accurately, which makes the device an ideal solution for performing photo stories during sporting events. </p><h2>  Gate </h2><p>  A completely new shutter mechanism has become another important technical specification of the model.  It is characterized by a smooth ride and works almost instantly (the delay is about 42 ms).  This feature is able to pleasantly surprise even professional photographers.  The shutter is made of an alloy of Kevlar and <span>carbon fiber.</span>  As for the shutter speed range, it is in the range from 1/8000 to 30 seconds, while its standard resource is 400 thousand operations.  All this in combination is the key to a stable image displayed on the viewfinder. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D4s Camera" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1013775.jpg" width="557"></div>

    <h2>  Displays and viewfinder </h2><p>  The model is equipped with three displays at once.  A 3.2-inch LCD with a resolution of 921,600 pixels is the main one in the Nikon D4S.  Its overview is excellently ensured even at an angle of up to 170 degrees both vertically and horizontally.  In addition, it boasts one hundred percent frame coverage.  The screen supports the ability to manually and automatically adjust the brightness.  It should be noted that a similar display was used in the previous modification.  Along with this, the novelty received a modernized version of it.  It differs in deeper detail and high-quality display of colors.  The fact is that the corresponding light sensor automatically adjusts the contrast, gamma, brightness and saturation of the screen, thereby ensuring that a realistic picture is displayed on it.  In order to prevent the appearance of unnecessary glare, as well as fogging the display inside, the developers filled the space between it and the protective glass with special transparent rubber. </p><p>  In addition to the main one, there are also two additional information displays of a monochrome type with blue backlight.  They are located on the back and top panels.  The main purpose of these screens is to control the key parameters of shooting in the dark. </p><p>  The device is equipped with an optical viewfinder, created on the basis of an expensive pentaprism.  The mirror has a smooth stroke, so that photos taken with the Nikon D4S model are displayed on it with the least dimming, even at high shooting speeds.  The viewfinder window is covered by a glass insert having an anti-reflective coating that can be easily removed for cleaning if necessary. </p><h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  Even video reporters will surely like the model, since it is capable of creating videos with a frequency of up to 60 frames per second in Full HD format.  The image for viewing on a TV screen or its subsequent processing can be displayed directly from the camera via the HDMI connector.  Compared with the previous version of the device, developers have improved sound quality.  In particular, additional settings for controlling the sound range were added here.  The operator has the ability to independently select and vary the ISO value, shutter speed, framing format, as well as control the electric drive and aperture.  The Nikon D4S model is equipped with a direct-start movie button, which is located on the handle.  In addition, you can activate this mode by pressing the shutter button or at a distance using the remote control.  Thus, it is safe to say that this camera allows you to fully reveal the creative potential of the user in terms of video. </p>

    <h2>  Data storage </h2><p>  Two types of high-speed memory cards are used for storing captured photo and video material - XQD and CompactFlash.  It should be noted that when using the first of the options indicated, the length of the serial shooting is approximately 20% higher.  This is very important when using the Nikon D4S as a reporting camera.  There are three ways to work with slots.  In the first of them, recording is carried out alternately on the media until it is full, in the second - simultaneously on both drives, and in the third, the video and photos are stored separately.  All this, the user can configure as he wishes independently.  Information about photos is divided into seven pages.  In addition to general basic information, additional information is also provided here (brightness histogram, GPS data, as well as other shooting parameters). </p><h2>  Data transfer </h2><p>  The model uses technology for accelerated information transfer, which is especially important when conducting photo reports.  For the ability to quickly connect to peripheral devices, the usual HDMI and USB 2.0 interfaces are provided here, as well as a special Gigabit 100 / 1000TX Ethernet port.  You can easily connect a twisted pair cable to the Nikon D4S camera, as well as a router using proprietary special software (this allows you to control all the camera's capabilities through a computer).  In this case, the user does not need to install additional software.  It is enough for him to enter the page under his name from a smartphone, tablet or computer, and enter the password.  Among other things, it should be noted that the model is compatible with the WT5 wireless transmitter. </p><h2>  Other interesting features and functions </h2><p>  An interesting feature of the camera is the ability to manually adjust the white balance or the use of automatic modes provided to the device owner.  In this regard, the Nikon D4S model creates high-quality and clear images in mixed and poor lighting conditions. </p><p>  Thanks to the built-in intervalometer, shooting can be done non-stop.  After that, it‚Äôs enough to glue the appropriate images into one video.  The user sets the number of frames and the exposure step.  The only flaw in this regard, experts call the lack of the ability to save individual frames from the series. </p><p>  Nikon is constantly improving the Picture Control system.  The <span>Nikon D4S</span> camera was no exception <span>.</span>  Expert <span>reviews</span> indicate that this model, compared with its predecessor, significantly improved the transmission of shades and tones, as well as the color rendering curve. </p><p>  The user customizes any mode depending on his own preferences.  This applies to brightness, color, sharpness, contrast and saturation.  Moreover, there is a special button for quickly changing the shooting mode. </p><p>  In the model, the automatic value of photosensitivity without fail takes into account the distance at which shooting is carried out.  In other words, the camera itself selects a combination of ISO and shutter speed at which blurring is not allowed in the current zoom position of the lens. <!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype id="_x0000_t75" coordsize="21600,21600"
