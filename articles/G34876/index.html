  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The origin of the Slavs. The influence of different cultures</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Slavs (under this name), according to some researchers, appeared in history only in the 6th century AD.  However, the language of the nation bears archaic features of the Indo-European community.  This, in turn, suggests that the origin of the Slavs has deep sources. </p><p>  According to some researchers, the tribes populated the land from the Dnieper to the <span>Western Bug.</span>  At the same time, the settlement time is called 1 millennium BC.  e. </p><p>  Theories of the <span>origin of the Slavs</span> are based on the presence of tribal characteristics in different cultures at different times.  So, for example, some researchers pay attention to the Tshinets culture of the <span>Bronze Age</span> (about 1450-1100 century BC).  She occupied the region from the Oder to the Dnieper.  Judging by the linguistic features, the Tshinets culture was in close proximity to the Balts.  In civilization itself, researchers note the presence of two different ethnic formations with different rites of burial ("corpse" and "corpse burning").  At the same time, the rite of ‚Äúcorpses‚Äù is close precisely to the Baltic culture. </p><p>  A more detailed study of the Tshinets culture allows us to conclude that, perhaps, the <span>Slavic tribes</span> and the Balts first came into contact in it.  <span>This civilization</span> points to various facts of the proximity of two nationalities.  However, along with this, the question arises of where the Slavs came from.  It should be noted that for the first time this culture (Slavs) was discovered by Polish scientists.  However, they did not assume that civilization spread to the Dnieper.  Subsequently, it was here (on the Dnieper) that the most significant signs of culture were revealed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to some authors, the spread of civilization did not take place from west to east, but rather, from east to west.  But this conclusion was somewhat erroneous.  Historical facts confirm the presence of a logging culture in the eastern territories.  Within the framework of this civilization, there was no place for Slavic or Proto-Slavic tribes.  Thus, researchers drew attention to the southwestern territories. </p><p>  Given the archaic nature of the language, historians have suggested that the origin of the Slavs is associated with the development of Indo-European tribes.  According to scientists, these nationalities had a significant impact on the development of Slavic culture. </p><p>  The origin of the Slavs, the composition of their culture, was influenced by tribes with burial rites in stone boxes.  Of particular importance is the civilization of bell-shaped cups. </p><p>  According to some researchers, the Slavic culture combined several races, including the North Caucasian, light pigmented, dark pigmented, dolichocephalic, South European brachycephalic type. </p><p>  Today, it is difficult for researchers to determine the stages of language development.  It is not clear to the end whether the <span>Slavic language</span> came to <span>Central Europe</span> in a ‚Äúready-made form‚Äù or whether it was formed as a result of a mixture of nationalities of the culture of bell-shaped cups and representatives of other nationalities connected with tribes from the civilization of cord ceramics. </p><p>  Of course, the long neighborhood has influenced the interpenetration of the Proto-Slavic, Celtic and Illyro-Venetian languages.  Thus, continuous mutual assimilation took place and intermediate dialects arose within the framework of various tribal formations. </p><p>  The conclusion that the origin of the Slavs is connected with the territory on which Indo-European civilization originated is based on books on craft terminology (among the Slavs it was close to the ancient Roman), on the names of rivers and other toponyms on the territory of the Dnieper Right Bank, where Illyrian nationalities are also found .  In addition, there is evidence of chroniclers that the Rus and Slavs left the territories of the Subunavia. </p>
