Village Blagoveshchenskaya - recreation center</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On the sandy spit between the two estuaries of the Black Sea - Vityazevsky and Kiziltashsky - is the village of Blagoveshchenskaya.  Some tourists believe that the village on the coast is ideal for a relaxing family vacation with children, while others here seem too quiet compared to the noisy embankments of the main resorts of the <span>Black Sea coast of the Caucasus.</span>  In the village itself and on the sandy spit (from the village of Vityazevo in the southeast and to the cape beyond Veselovka in the northwest) there are recreation centers, mini-hotels and guest houses. </p><h2>  The village of Blagoveshchenskaya </h2><p>  The village is the center of the rural district of the same name, it is included in the municipal formation of the resort city of Anapa (Krasnodar Territory, Russian Federation).  The year of foundation of the village coincides with the heyday of the Cossack movement in the Russian Empire (1836).  The name of the village is given in honor of the Orthodox Day of the Annunciation - a holiday that is dedicated to one of the primary Gospel events.  According to legend, from the <span>archangel Gabriel,</span> Virgin Mary received the news of the future birth from the flesh of her baby Jesus Christ. </p><p>  The Blagoveshchensk village is located on the northern shore of the <span>Vityazevsky estuary</span> and is located approximately in the center of the spit, which in ancient times separated this reservoir from the Black Sea.  Precipitation here is much less than in areas of humid subtropics south of Anapa.  Arid conditions for natural vegetation have developed in this steppe zone, but the village is very well-maintained and green.  Hardworking villagers tirelessly take care of this.  The well-kept courtyards of the private sector attract guests with an abundance of fruit trees and vineyards.  The streets of the village are stretched from east to west, the extreme lanes smoothly pass into the beach area, where recreation centers are located. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Healing peloids of the Vityazevsky estuary </h2><p>  In the vicinity of the Vityazevsky estuary, those who seek to improve their health not with the help of medicines, but because of the healing factors of nature, which the village of Blagoveshchenskaya is so rich in, will find many useful things for themselves.  The recreation center, closest to the estuary from the northwest, is called "Ladoga".  Vityazevsky estuary is a salt-free drainage pond, its depth is 1.5-2 m. Treatment with its bright gray and black bottom sediments has a long history.  As a result of the study of silt sediments, the therapeutic properties of muds that have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and bactericidal effects were confirmed.  Under the influence of peloids, the state of individual organs and the whole organism improves;  metabolic processes are activated;  increased resistance to infections;  skin is cleared of the manifestations of chronic dermatoses. </p>

    <p>  To get to the village, you need to catch the bus or minibus at the <span>Anapa bus station</span> , get off at the station "Blagoveshchenskaya Stanitsa".  The map will tell you in which direction the coastal zone is located from the village, where the recreation centers are located.  You can get from Anapa by personal transport and leave it in the parking lot. </p><p>  The coastal zone of the village back in Soviet times was equipped for tourists to live and relax.  On the spit that separates the estuary from the sea, multi-story dormitories, one-story houses are built, and its own sandy beaches are fenced off.  The recreation centers are designed to receive 100-200 guests at a time, three meals a day are organized, tours are conducted. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the dormitories are shops, a market and a cafe.  On the territory of most recreation centers there are free parking lots, children's sports grounds, baths, pools. </p><h2>  Accommodation for vacationers in the private sector </h2><p>  In recent years, comfortable mini-hotels, guest houses and courtyards have appeared in the private sector of the village.  Usually they receive a small number of guests at the same time, since they have only a few rooms.  The cost of rent is affected by the level of service, distance from beaches and other factors. </p><p>  The conditions of accommodation in the private sector are most consistent with the modern concept of comfortable relaxation: there are separate terraces for each room, equipped kitchens, exercise machines, swimming pools, shady courtyards, which the village of Blagoveshchenskaya is famous for.  The guest house can be located in the center of the village, then tourists spend about 15-20 minutes on a walk to the sea, if the mini-hotel is closer to the coast, it takes 5-10 minutes. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the rest in the village of Blagoveshchensk </h2><p>  According to the reviews of many guests of the village, in a vacation on a sand spit near the estuary there are pros and cons.  A drawback is that some consider it necessary to overcome the very 1.5 km by which the village of Blagoveshchensk is separated from the sea.  In the evening and at night, little ruthless hunters appear - mosquitoes.  This forces people to constantly be on the alert, taking with them repellents and aerosols from annoying insects.  Of the benefits of relaxing in Blagoveshchensk called cheap rooms and houses in the private sector. </p>

    <p>  Many tourists liked the clear sea, the shallow depth of the coast, a wide long beach, strewn with sand.  In Blagoveshchensk there is no crush and noise, as in high season at other Black Sea resorts.  It rarely rains in this part of the coast in summer, which means that it is less likely that bad weather will take away the days of long-awaited rest on the beach. </p>
