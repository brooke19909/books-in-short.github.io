    <p>  Some guests are critical of the Golden Lion service.  They note that in the rooms (even in the suite) here in the closet there may not be a single coat rack, TV and telephone may turn out to be inoperative.  There is no restaurant menu in the guest rooms, which complicates the order of food in the room.  The presence of faulty plumbing in the rooms, poor quality service is also noted.  Guests regret that in the morning there is no opportunity to drink coffee.  Many vacationers come to the conclusion that the level of service at the hotel does not quite correspond to the rates. </p>
