Such a dismissive attitude to this characteristic is connected with the fact that most of the devices showed approximately similar capabilities, and the developers attracted the audience with newer and brighter and more obvious abilities.  Nevertheless, specifically for music lovers, each manufacturer sought to offer a separate model with improved musical qualities.  Today, a <span>phone with good sound</span> in some versions is able to compete with budget options for portable speakers.  Of course, we are not talking about a full-fledged comparison, taking into account all the parameters of sounding, but the tendency to increase the level of such indicators is becoming more apparent.  Along with this, a more responsible task arises of choosing a suitable solution from existing proposals. </p><h2>  What determines the sound quality? </h2>

    <p>  The example of compact digital audio players shows that a small-sized device can also provide good sound quality.  Of course, in such gadgets, the entire filling is focused on this function, but engineers also offer very decent playback modules for phones.  To begin with, it is worth separating two categories of phones - classic push-buttons and smartphones.  The second category initially demonstrates a higher sound level, since it is equipped with a separate processor that processes acoustic signals.  This is in some way a special audio chip, equipment which improves the quality characteristics of playback.  But here, not everything is unambiguous, since the range of parameters is very extensive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Quality Sound Features </h2><p>  To understand which phones have good sound, you can turn to an analysis of indicators such as the sampling rate and the power of the integrated amplifier.  According to experts, the optimal sampling spectrum is from 8 to 96 kHz.  As for the amplifier, the most advanced modern developments are equipped with two-channel components with a potential of 3.8 mW.  Now you can move on to a more detailed acquaintance with specific representatives of the class of audiophile phones. </p><h2>  Reviews about the model Meizu MX3 </h2>

    <p>  This model just belongs to the category of phones in which a high-quality technological basis for processing sound has been implemented.  In terms of the ability to work with frequency spectra at different levels, the model provokes rather positive reviews.  Serious processor training based on two chips strengthened the low frequencies, but at the same time provided details at the top.  In general, the reproduction is clean, devoid of noise intrusions and third-party distortion.  Again, according to users, soft transitions with pronounced balancing are also clearly visible, which makes it possible to listen to complex compositions with pleasure.  But this option is more suitable for those users who need a phone with good sound and without playback through the headphones.  This is due not only to the lack of an appropriate headset in the kit, but also, in principle, to high demands on the earbuds, which can not spoil the transmitted sound picture.  As an addition, it is worth noting the ergonomic organization of the multimedia file system, which facilitates the process of controlling the phone player. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sony Xperia E1 Reviews </h2><p>  For the high quality of any function you have to pay the corresponding money.  Practice shows that improving the sound characteristics does not justify itself in low-cost models, so the same audio processors are used in multifunction devices with many other advantages.  Such devices cost about 20 thousand rubles, and an example of one of them is the above-described Meizu MX3 model.  However, the Japanese model Xperia E1 for only 6 thousand offers a very attractive solution, which caused a lot of rave reviews from fans of Sony.  The fact is that the budget filling of the device is fully focused on the musical accent.  In practice, the use, according to the owners, noted the detail and clear signal processing.  It is important to recall here the advantages that phones with good sound quality of the old Walkman series possessed.  The Xperia E1 implements the interface of the same system - its users praise for its simplicity and ease of management.  By the way, switching songs is possible even through a special physical shake of the phone. </p>

    <h2>  Oppo Clover R815 model reviews </h2><p>  Another budget solution, in the system equipment which uses a combination of a 4-core processor and a graphics accelerator.  Moreover, in this version, music lovers note one feature that is absent in many even premium models.  The developers divided the sound amplification system into two components.  One module is responsible for reproducing sound through the headphones, and the other provides the function of two built-in stereo speakers.  Actually, if there is a question about which phones have good sound in headphones, then the described concept of separation of playback channels will be an indicator of a worthy option.  As for the working qualities of the R815 modification itself, the owners of the device note the volume, cleanliness, and also a good study of the low and middle frequencies, which is not often in models costing up to 10 thousand. This phone, by the way, can be purchased for 7-8 thousand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  HTC One M8 Reviews </h2><p>  HTC did not pass by the audience of music lovers either, having offered an interesting modification of the M8 in the One family.  I must say that sophisticated connoisseurs of quality sound were disappointed with this model in the sense that it had serious potential to become one of the best music phones.  But the developers did not make a serious bias in this direction, meanwhile, providing the device with good Boom Sound technology.  What did this development give to the device?  As the manufacturer promises, the sound relative to other representatives of the family has become louder by 25%.  According to the users themselves, the sound differs in depth, detail and balance.  If you need a phone with good sound to play through the headphones, then this option is also suitable.  The owners of the device indicate that with a high-quality headset, the potential of this mobile phone is practically indistinguishable from the broadcast source in the form of a laptop or a specialized player. </p>

    <h2>  Philips Xenium W7555 Reviews </h2><p>  The range of Xenium in recent versions shows very modest success in a wide range of performance.  Owners of models also note useless graphics, and the lack of effective energy saving, as well as weak shooting modules and uncompetitive performance.  Nevertheless, in terms of sound model W7555 shows good results.  This is explained by the use of the Wolfson audio chip, supplemented by an amplifier.  The practice of using detects such sound qualities as surround, volume and detail.  Many point to an organic combination of cleanliness at higher altitudes and a good study of the mid-range.  Moreover, this is not just a mobile phone with good sound, but also an ergonomic tool for handling a digital media player.  In the list of tools that the user controls acoustics, you can select the equalizer, a convenient menu and an optimized file cataloging system. </p><h2>  The best models with a speaker </h2><p>  Previously, the Nokia models showed the best indicators in terms of the purity of conversational reproduction, but the time of the Finnish manufacturer has passed, and it is rather difficult to name the obvious leader by this criterion.  In particular, companies such as BlackBerry, Xiaomi and some representatives of the already mentioned HTC One line can compete with each other.  I must say that BlackBerry products and, for example, its modification 9105 rather give a notorious feeling of a person standing nearby while talking on the phone. However, if you need a phone with good sound during a conversation and the ability to record, then this and other modifications of this brand will not work .  Accordingly, an alternative may be the version of Xiaomi Mi2S.  If you turn to the offers of the iPhone, Sony or HTC, then, firstly, you have to prepare a substantial amount for the purchase, and secondly, you will not have to rely on the special characteristics of the overall sound. </p><h2>  The best models for reproducing sound in headphones </h2>

    <p>  Two models are worth highlighting that are optimally suited for working with a high-quality headset, but at a different level.  We are talking about a more advanced version from Meizu in the form of MX4 Pro, as well as the Highscreen Boost 3 model. As for the first option, it will suit those who are looking for a phone with good sound in high-end headphones.  The fact is that the phone itself has a fairly high level of filling with a Hi-Fi Sound system, provided by the progressive amplifier Texas Instruments.  Therefore, using such a source in combination with budget headphones simply does not make sense. </p><p>  A slightly different approach is implemented in the Highscreen Boost 3 model.  This unit also has a special basis for music playback, but its potential is enough for those music lovers who need a phone with good sound in mid-range headphones. </p><h2>  The best button models in terms of sound </h2>

    <p>  If in the smartphone segment the largest giants of the market could not surprise the consumer with the sound qualities of their products, then Samsung with the S5611 model dominates in the class of traditional button devices.  The model provides high-quality sound reproduction both through the speaker and using headphones.  Moreover, if you need a push-button telephone with good sound and a high-quality camera, this option will be especially suitable.  The 5 megapixel matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãimplemented in conjunction with autofocus and by itself produces images that compare favorably even with the materials of some 8-pixel smartphones.  If, for one reason or another, this option does not suit you, then you should pay attention to the <span>BlackBerry Q5</span> model <span>,</span> which is also praised for high-quality sound. </p><h2>  How to choose the best phone with good sound? </h2><p>  Obviously, the choice should be based on the cost of the model, its technological sound equipment and ergonomics of the media player.  The last indicator, by the way, in all the described options is at a high level and can be determined with the interface simply by taste preferences.  Otherwise, the choice is also generally clear.  In this review, the phone with the best sound will cost at least 20 thousand - these are MX3 models from Meizu and One M8 from HTC.  Smartphones in these versions really provide high performance in relation to acoustics, but at the same time they also differ in the presence of other attractive parameters that are not related to sound. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Progress towards improving the musical abilities of mobile devices does not stand still and the active introduction of the same audio processors, even in low-cost models, indicates the serious intentions of the manufacturers themselves to improve this feature.  However, users are increasingly guided by a combination of several high-level operational qualities.  For example, a <span>phone with a good camera</span> and sound is the most common requirement of an average user.  And companies have something to offer in different segments.  If we are talking about the traditional form factor, then it will be the <span>Samsung S5611,</span> and the most technologically advanced segment of smartphones, for its part, will offer the successful music model Meizu MX3.  Another thing is that not only these characteristics are of interest to the mass consumer, therefore, one cannot do without compromises in the choice. </p>
