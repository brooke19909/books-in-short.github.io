    <p>  Paphos, due to the general level of service, as well as the improvement of infrastructure, is considered the most elite resort on the island.  Here even four-star hotels provide tourists with the highest quality service.  A great example of this hotel is Aktibeach Village Resort.  Cyprus, unlike its neighboring neighbor, Turkey, is considered an expensive country in terms of recreation, however, in resorts you can rarely find hotels operating on an all-inclusive basis. </p><h2>  Aktibeach Village Resort 4 * (Paphos, Crete) </h2><p>  On the seafront promenade of Pafos resort, 11 kilometers from the international airport, there are beautiful landscaped gardens that are famous for their exotic plants, unique trees and flowers.

The city center is only 4 km away.  It is a family hotel in type.  It is located on the seashore, just above the coastline.  Almost all the windows of the hotel look at the turquoise surface of the sea, the rest - at the beautiful landscape of the garden. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aktibeach village resort 4 paphos" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/455201.jpg" width="600"></div>
