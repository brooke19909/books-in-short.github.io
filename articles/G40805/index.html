  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Victorian era</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Victorian era, like any other, is characterized by its inherent features.  When people talk about it, then, as a rule, there is a feeling of sadness, because it was a time of high moral standards, which is unlikely to return. </p><p>  For this period, there was a typical flowering of the middle class, high standards of relations were established.  For example, qualities such as: punctuality, sobriety, zeal, industriousness, thrift and thrift became a model for all the inhabitants of the country. </p><p>  The most significant for England at that time was the absence of hostilities.  The country did not wage wars at that time and could concentrate its funds for internal development, but this was not the only characteristic feature of that time, it was also distinguished by the fact that just in this era the rapid growth of British industry began. </p><p>  During this period, the young <span>Queen Victoria</span> ascended the throne <span>.</span>  She was not only wise, but also a very beautiful woman, as her contemporaries noted.  Unfortunately, we mostly know her portraits, where she is in mourning and already middle-aged.  She wore life-long mourning for her husband, Prince Albert, with whom she lived happy years.  Their marriage was called ideal by the subjects, and the <span>royal family was</span> revered.  <span>The court ladies</span> dreamed of being like a respected queen. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that during the reign of Queen Victoria there was a custom for Christmas to decorate a Christmas tree and give children presents.  The initiator of this innovation was <span>Prince Albert, the</span> Queen's husband. </p><p>  What is the Victorian era famous for, why do we often recall it, what was so special about it?  First of all, this is an industrial boom that began in England and led to rapid changes in the country.  The Victorian era in England forever destroyed the old, familiar, old and very stable way of life.  There was literally no trace left of him, he was breaking up irresistibly, changing the attitude of the inhabitants.  Mass production is developing in the country at this time, the first photo studios, the first postcards and souvenirs in the form of porcelain dogs appear. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Victorian era is also the rapid development of education.  For example, in 1837 43% of the population in England were illiterate, but in 1894 only 3% remained.  Polygraphy was developing rapidly at that time.  It is known that the growth of periodical popular publications has grown 60 times.  The Victorian era is characterized by rapid social progress, it made the inhabitants of their country feel in the very center of world events. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that at that time, writers were the most respected people in the country.  For example, Charles Dickens, a typical Victorian writer, left a huge number of works in which moral principles are subtly noted.  Many of his works portray defenseless children and necessarily show retribution to those who have treated them unjustly.  Vice is always punished - this is the main direction of social thought of that time.  That was the Victorian era in England. </p><p>  This time was characterized not only by the flourishing of science and art, but also by a special style in clothing and architecture.  In society, everything is subject to the rules of "decency."  Costumes and dresses, both male and female, were strict but sophisticated.  Women, going to the ball, could wear jewelry, but they could not afford to make up, as this was considered the lot of women of easy virtue. </p><p>  Victorian architecture is a special asset of the time.  This style is loved and still popular.  It has luxury and a variety of decorative elements, it is attractive to modern designers.  The furniture of that time was solemn, with stucco moldings, and many chairs with high backs and bent legs are still called ‚ÄúVictorian‚Äù. </p><p>  A lot of small tables with bizarre ottomans and, of course, paintings and photographs were an indispensable attribute of every decent home.  There were always long lace tablecloths on the tables, and heavy, multi-layered curtains covered the windows.  It was a style of luxury and comfort.  So roughly lived in the Victorian era, a stable and prosperous middle class, which for many years ensured the prosperity of England. </p><p>  Victorian architecture is, first of all, a successful mixture of such styles as: neo-Gothic, styles of the <span>Roman Empire,</span> and also it has elements <span>of Indian architecture.</span>  The architects gladly used rich details, used bright decorative techniques.  This style is characterized by very high windows that resembled an inverted shield, elegant wooden panels, traditional granite fireplaces, as well as fences with magnificent Gothic spiers. </p>
