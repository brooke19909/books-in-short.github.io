    <h2>  A few words about compulsory medical insurance </h2><p>  The policy is issued to foreigners only if they are officially employed at domestic enterprises.  The employer enters into an agreement with the insurance company and the city health insurance fund.  The policy is limited by the duration of the employment contract.  To obtain a document, a citizen should contact the personnel department and write a statement.  Unemployed foreigners with a residence permit can also get a compulsory medical insurance policy, but already through an insurance company (UK).  Children under one year of age, pregnant women receive medical care without insurance.  This also applies to ambulance and ambulance.  In case of loss of a document, you can get a duplicate either through the personnel department or in the UK.  To gain a foothold at a particular clinic, you need to write a statement to your local health department.  A copy of the passport and policy is attached to the document.  Non-working persons can use the services of paid medical care or arrange a voluntary medical insurance policy for foreign citizens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Who is the program for? </h2><p>  VHI can be used by foreigners temporarily or permanently located in the Russian Federation.  Moreover, under the law, employed citizens are required to purchase a policy not only for themselves, but also for all family members.  Without this document, it is impossible to draw up an <span>employment contract</span> or a residence permit to qualified specialists. </p><h2>  Voluntary Health Insurance Policy for Foreigners </h2><p>  To draw up a document, you need to contact the UK and choose one of two maintenance programs: </p><ul><li>  Specialized - the provision of highly targeted services. </li><li>  Generally directed, within the framework of which the treatment is carried out by a general practitioner. </li></ul><p>  <span>Voluntary medical insurance</span> for <span>foreign citizens in Moscow</span> is far from all institutions.

Therefore, if a person was admitted to the hospital without a policy, he will have to compensate all the costs on his own.  You cannot backdate a document.  It is better for pregnant women to purchase a policy at the maximum price.  It will cover not only diseases, injuries, dental, diagnostic procedures, but also possible complications during childbirth.  Note that pregnancy is not a disease, so it is not included in the insurance.  Births themselves in the territory of the Russian Federation are free. </p><h2>  Algorithm </h2><p>  The VHI program applies to people aged 18 to 60.  The policy can be purchased for a period of 3 to 12 months.  Migrants are not served in the district clinic.  In case of malaise, a person turns to the UK, which sends him to a medical institution with which a cooperation <span>agreement is</span> concluded <span>.</span>  If a person experiences acute pain, an ambulance must be called.  This team serves foreigners for free.  This is how <span>voluntary health insurance</span> works <span>for foreign citizens.</span>  The law, which entered into force in January 2015, obliged all persons arriving in the Russian Federation for the purpose of employment to purchase VHI policies. </p>

    <h2>  How much do you have to pay </h2><p>  The cost depends on the set of services.  For registration, you need to provide <span>an identity document.</span>  According to statistics, a voluntary medical insurance policy for foreign citizens is 1.5-2 times more expensive than for residents.  This is because most of the country's guests do not know Russian.  They have to turn to specialized institutions in which the staff speaks a foreign language. </p><p>  The basic package includes obtaining outpatient, inpatient medical services in emergency situations.  Starting price - 1.3 thousand rubles.  This is three times cheaper than previously voiced by local authorities.  Initially, it was planned that voluntary medical insurance for foreign citizens and pensioners will allow participants not only to receive advice at the clinic, but also to take sick leave, take an X-ray, ultrasound, ECG, and consult a dentist.  But at this price, coverage is minimal. </p>

    <p>  Even at maximum cost, it does not apply to oncological, sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, mental disorders, hepatitis and type I and type II diabetes.  The most expensive packages allow you to get physiotherapeutic treatment, sick leave, prescriptions for drugs, MRI, ECG, RVG, REG and other types of diagnostics. </p><h2>  Where to buy a policy </h2><p>  This product is offered in such insurance companies: ‚ÄúMax‚Äù, ‚ÄúReso‚Äù, ‚ÄúVTB Insurance‚Äù, ‚ÄúRosgosstrakh‚Äù and others. Coverage - 100 thousand rubles.  The basic package includes outpatient and inpatient care in case of emergency (exacerbation of existing diseases, the presence of acute pain).  Maternity assistance, routine care and other services may be included in the voluntary health insurance policy for foreign citizens for a surcharge.  The cost of the package ranges from 1.3 to 5.5 thousand rubles and depends on the period and region. </p><p>  Visitors can buy insurance at the Migration Center.  This has already been done by 1.3 thousand foreign citizens.  From the capital budget in 2015-2017, 5.3 billion rubles will be allocated for medical care for unidentified patients.  Costs will be recouped after 1.6 million migrants acquire VHI policy at an average price of 3.3 thousand rubles.  Legally employed in the capital - 400 thousand people. </p>

    <h2>  Statistics </h2><p>  Most often, migrant women seek help in the treatment of gynecological diseases, men with gastrointestinal problems.  A little less recorded complaints due to toothache and infectious diseases.  Experts say that voluntary health insurance for foreigners helps to reduce the risk of serious infections.  Now visitors come to clinics only with acute pain.  Doctors provide emergency assistance.  But they have no right to treat without a policy.  After the introduction of legislative changes, migrants will often see doctors.  This will prevent the occurrence of serious diseases.  Climate change, changes in living conditions can contribute to exacerbation of mental disorders, tuberculosis, syphilis.  Now doctors can not only relieve acute pain, but also conduct an examination, identify signs of serious illness at an early stage. </p>

    <p>  Not all experts consider legislative changes justified.  Some claim that there is no need to introduce mandatory VHI for foreigners.  Migrants are used to being served in paid medicine.  They are treated either by acquaintances of compatriot doctors, or in hospitals, but only if absolutely necessary.  Non-residents have to pay for a patent (4 thousand rubles), an exam in the Russian language (4.5 thousand rubles), and now also for a policy. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Since 2015, voluntary medical insurance for foreign citizens ‚ÄúReso‚Äù has been a prerequisite for employment and obtaining a residence permit in the Russian Federation.  The cost of the policy varies depending on the region and the set of services.  Basic package for 1.3 thousand rubles.  allows you to get outpatient and inpatient services.  In emergency cases, an ambulance and an ambulance help all those in need, but further treatment is paid. </p>
