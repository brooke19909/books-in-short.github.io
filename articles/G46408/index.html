    <p>  In recent years, there is a need for specialists in the field of logistics.  This is a new profession that seems strange to some.  But in reality there is nothing complicated in the work of the logistician.  This <span>specialty is in demand,</span> and the number of vacancies on labor exchanges occupies from 2 to 10 percent of the total.  Almost every company in any field of activity needs a logistics department.  It can perform various functions depending on the specialization. </p><p>  Large companies usually have a logistics department as an independent unit.  It presents all the specialists in this field.  It may include drivers, dispatchers, ordinary logisticians, and logistics directors.  Smaller organizations are limited to small units or individual employees who perform the functions of logisticians and are listed in a department that is close in purpose (transport department, warehouse, etc.) </p><p>  Sometimes the logistics department can act <span>as</span> external relations <span>managers</span> or engage in the processing of customs documents. </p><p>  The manager for <span>foreign economic relations</span> deals with document management related to sales or deliveries, establishes relations with transport companies, suppliers, insurance companies, banks, etc.  Therefore, this position is called the "Logistics and External Economic Relations Manager." </p><p>  The logistics department cannot be considered an auxiliary structure.  This is one of the activities of any company.  There are companies that provide services in this area.  They are engaged in organizing logistics activities in other companies. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The logistics department has a certain structure.  Usually at the head of each of them is a leader who belongs to the highest level of management.  These are directors, vice presidents, bosses, etc.  They are engaged in the organization and control over the work of divisions, the formation of a company policy that meets the functions and criteria of logistics. </p><p>  Followed by logistics managers.  They are divided into two links.  Logistics system engineers are involved in the development of cargo movement routes, and they are working on storage operations at low cost.  Logistic users are engaged in the direct solution of tasks using developed programs. </p><p>  The next category of employees of the department in question are dispatchers, drivers and employees of the transport department and warehouses.  They are engaged in the shipment of products or the reception of raw materials, as well as the delivery of goods to customers. </p><p>  Having examined the concept of ‚Äúlogistics‚Äù, what kind of structure it is and what its functions are, it is necessary to dwell on the responsibilities of the employees of this department. </p><p>  The Director of Logistics, who can act as the head of the transport department, is engaged in general management, monitoring the implementation of tasks, and searching for optimal route schemes. </p><p>  Mid-level employees analyze the schemes and routes, choosing the most profitable.  They organize and manage the <span>logistics process</span> within the warehouse and other departments of the department.  These professionals should develop new schemes and offer them to their superiors for consideration. </p><p>  The leading logistics manager is involved in the planning of the procurement and sale of goods necessary for the continuous production process.  His responsibilities include sales market analysis, pricing policy development, and preparation of reporting documents. </p><p>  Dispatchers of the <span>transport department</span> are involved in organizing a permanent schedule of transport, preparing documentation for the transport of goods, taking into account fuels and lubricants and working hours of forwarding drivers. </p><p>  This is all that a logistician does to ensure a continuous production process and uninterrupted product delivery to customers. </p>
