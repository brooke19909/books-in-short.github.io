FTTx Technology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now this is the stage of providing users with access to the Internet, when many companies began to use advanced technologies, for example, FTTx.  It has ceased to be as expensive and complicated as it was 5-6 years ago.  The market is already saturated with offers of such services.  Therefore, it is worth considering the concept of FTTx in more detail.  What is it, it will become clear if you delve into the technology itself. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="FTTx what is it" class="if" height="157" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2710/705659.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The use of any new technology requires the involvement of certain resources, in which case FTTx is no exception.  What it is and how it works will be described later. </p><p>  FTTx is a general term by which a general approach to how the formation of a network cable infrastructure takes place, in which an <span>optical fiber is</span> stretched from <span>a communication node</span> to a certain point designated as ‚Äúx‚Äù <span>,</span> and then a copper cable is laid directly to the subscriber equipment.  You can lay optics directly to a device or device that works on the Internet.  Usually only the physical layer is considered when FTTx is connected.  What is it?  This is just the line itself.  However, the concept itself implies the use of a number of technologies of the data link and network layer.  Thanks to broadband access, companies are able to provide customers with a range of services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Why are such networks interesting? </h2><p>  As the main engine for the development <span>of FTTx technology,</span> there is currently a massive consumer demand for broadband access, which is incredibly difficult to achieve using traditional ADSL.  Optics began to be introduced more and more actively in large cities, and now it is possible to trace the tendency to merge operators of different levels.  This technology is also actively used in villages, where initially access to the Internet was built on the basis of the optical path. </p><h2>  Market Development Prospects </h2><p>  To better understand the essence of this technology, FTTx development prospects should be considered.  What is it?  On the Russian territory, the formation of a market for such services depends not only on the demand for high-quality content, but also on the number of large-scale construction projects, as well as increased competition among broadband service providers.  The dynamic development of the construction of apartment buildings has led to the fact that FTTx connection is carried out much more often than all other types of <span>network connections.</span>  This is justified in an economic sense, and the presence of competition makes access to the network much cheaper.  Not so long ago, operators looked exclusively towards the corporate subscriber, and now they are increasingly showing interest in ordinary subscribers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Construction Features </h2><p>  Until recently, FTTx technology was used by operators who did not have their own infrastructure of older generations.  But in recent years, more and more companies are looking towards new networks.  Among the reasons for this phenomenon are opportunities for expanding the range of services provided, expanding passive networks based on fiber optic (PON), as well as distributing Metro Ethernet, reducing the cost of equipment, and the success of many operators in building networks of this type. </p><h2>  New Content </h2><p>  FTTx Internet is becoming increasingly popular due to the fact that modern users are attracted to new types of content with high-quality graphics and high-definition video.  As the main catalyst for the growth of demand for such systems, there has been an increase in interest in video services.  After the center of gravity shifted from group to individual broadcasting, the needs of subscribers in allocated bandwidths increased, which will very soon be up to 100 megabytes per second per household. </p>

    <p>  High-definition liquid-crystal televisions are now actively sold, which makes it necessary to provide customers with access to better quality television programs than what analogue television can offer.  The most logical development stage, many experts consider IP-TV.  This will allow users to choose films of interest, programs and shows, as well as the time when they will be most convenient to watch.  That is why we can say that the mass connection of FTTx xPON is just around the corner.  At the moment, any Internet provider is betting on investing in optical fiber, since this is an investment for decades to come, the profit will exceed costs many times.  This is the only way to explain such an active purchase of fiber lines, as well as many pilot projects, including such an innovation as laying optics directly to the subscriber‚Äôs equipment. </p><h2>  Existing risks </h2><p>  Connecting FTTx xPON in the coming years will not be the only option guaranteeing the provision of broadband access services, but the potential of the fiber-optic structure is so high that you can be absolutely sure of the return on invested funds.  Nowadays, work is most actively carried out in the field of modernization of backbone networks, and the FTTx technology market, equipment and other components are at <span>the design,</span> study and gradual testing stages. </p>

    <h2>  What architectures exist? </h2><p>  Rostelecom FTTx technology can work in one of several types of architectures: </p><p>  - FTTN (Fiber to the Node) - the optical fiber is laid to the network node; </p><p>  - FTTC (Fiber to the Curb) - the optical fiber is pulled to a neighborhood, block or several houses; </p><p>  - FTTB (Fiber to the Building) - the optical fiber enters the building; </p><p>  - FTTH (Fiber to the Home) - optical fiber is laid to the home. </p><p>  Their difference consists only in the proximity of the optical cable to the user terminal.  The first two solutions came first.  The first of them is used now, but only as a budget and quickly implemented where there is already a copper distribution infrastructure, and laying an optical cable is simply unprofitable.  Everyone knows the difficulties that accompany such a solution: poor <span>quality of services</span> associated with the special properties of copper cables, limitation on the number of connections and speed in one cable.  The second type is an improved and modified version of the first, which does not have these drawbacks.  The laying of copper cables in this case is carried out exclusively inside the buildings, so they are not subject to all sorts of destructive factors, while the length of the lines is not so great.  All these factors make it possible to achieve an improvement in speed in a section that does not use fiber.  A similar offer applies if FTTx xPON is used.  This is aimed at ADSL operators, as well as cable television operators.  The implementation of such an architecture gives them the opportunity for significant savings while increasing the number of connected users.  Each of them will be allocated a large bandwidth.  Most often in Russia, this type is used by small network operators. </p>

    <h2>  Factors </h2><p>  Issues related to the placement of equipment operating on this technology depend on a whole range of reasons: </p><p>  - is there any kind of alternative infrastructure, or has nothing been used before; </p><p>  - whether it is possible to place active equipment in the house, or there are certain restrictions for this; </p><p>  - how many subscribers are supposed to be connected to the new network; </p><p>  - a set of less important factors. </p><p>  End-to-end FTTx devices can be classified according to very specific criteria, tied specifically to the ‚Äúx‚Äù point.  The set of services offered by companies depends on the number and type of interfaces that the equipment uses, as well as the mechanism that controls traffic.  If you want to maintain the existing infrastructure, the best option would be to use FTTC / FTTB systems with an optical uplink interface.  They are appropriate to use in large enterprises, in business centers and residential complexes, where there is previously used copper infrastructure.  To do this, you need to place an FTTx router on each device. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In economic terms, the organization of networks based on fiber-optic technology is most justified when there is a significant concentration of solvent customers or the construction of new residential complexes, when organizational issues regarding cable laying are at the decision stage.  The network must be planned so that the endpoint is as close to the subscriber as possible.  The construction of new areas is most correctly accompanied by bringing it directly to the building, which will be convenient both at the beginning and in the future. </p>
