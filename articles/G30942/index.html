    <p>  <span>Another popular science book is Myths of Ancient Scandinavia.</span>  <span>Petrukhin Vladimir Yakovlevich released it in 2012 at the publishing house AST.</span> </p><p>  <span>It tells in a popular form about the picture of the world that the Scandinavian pagans imagined.</span>  <span>It appears to us the same in the primary sources - "Elder Edda", sagas, myths and the epic of the Scandinavian people.</span> </p><p>  <span>In his work, Petrukhin focuses on the study and analysis of monuments of ancient fine art, as well as religious worship, discoveries made by archaeologists in recent decades.</span> </p><p>  <span>Vladimir Petrukhin carefully studies the culture of the German people during the era of the Great Migration of Peoples, as well as the Scandinavians during the Vikings.</span>  <span>Then, according to the author, their culture was closely connected with the culture of the Slavs who lived in Russia.</span>  <span>That is why much attention is paid in the book to comparing and comparing the myths of the Scandinavians and the ancient Slavic peoples.</span>  <span>Petrukhin finds a lot in common in them.</span> </p><h2>  "Slavic antiquities" </h2><p>  One of Petrukhin‚Äôs main works is the scientific encyclopedia Slavic Antiquities: Ethnolinguistic Dictionary.  5 volumes of this work were published from 1995 to 2012.  The encyclopedia was published under the general editorship of the doctor of philological sciences Nikita Ilyich Tolstoy.  Petrukhin was one of the most active authors. </p><p>  This publication details the theme of Slavic studies, Slavic culture and mythology. </p><p>  This dictionary sums up a peculiar result of the study of Slavic culture, language, folklore and mythology over the past half century.  Initially, it was supposed to be exclusively scientific reading, but it turned out to be interesting to a wide range of readers. </p><p>  From this encyclopedia we can learn the features of the spiritual life of the Slavic peoples.  Separate articles are devoted to their ideas about the world order, natural forces and phenomena, saints of that time, a place in the world of sorcerers, witches and other evil spirits. </p><p>  In all its glory, Ancient Russia appears.  Petrukhin Vladimir Yakovlevich pays special attention to rituals, holidays, customs and family life, which was adopted in the families of the ancient Slavs. </p><h2>  Petrukhin and Zadornov </h2><p>  The topics that Vladimir Petrukhin raises in his works have recently been extremely popular in Russian society.  Actively discussed not only by scientists, but even by pop artists. </p><p>  The famous satirist Mikhail Zadornov has recently paid much attention to Slavic history.  Even he calls himself a non-academic researcher of the history of Slavism.  Moreover, the scientific community is skeptical and frivolous about its conclusions. </p><p>  For example, in 2012, Zadornov released the film "Rurik. Lost Real Estate."  Professional historians have criticized the picture for pseudoscience and populism.  In the film, Zadornov adheres to anti-Norman ideas, many considered it amateurishness.  Among them was an ardent supporter of Norman theory - Petrukhin Vladimir Yakovlevich.  Zadornov was criticized by him. </p><h2>  Movie "Viking" </h2>

    <p>  Adherence to Norman theory was revealed when working on the film "Viking" by <span>Andrei Kravchuk.</span>  The main historical consultant of the painting is Petrukhin Vladimir Yakovlevich.  "Viking" is a film about the history of Russia in the X century.  The events described in The Tale of Bygone Years, in particular, the rise to power of Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavovich, are taken as a basis. </p><p>  The film was released on the screens of Russian cinemas on the eve of the new year 2017. It became the main film event at the long New Year holidays.  At the box office, the picture collected more than one and a half billion rubles.  With a budget of one billion 250 million, this can be considered a definite success. </p><p>  The film was actively advertised in all sorts of ways.  Its producers were <span>Konstantin Ernst</span> and Anatoly Maximov. </p><p>  In addition to Petrukhin, the creators of the painting were advised by a specialist in Russian anthroponymy and linguist Fedor Uspensky, a major researcher of Slavism. </p><p>  In total, about three thousand people were involved in the work on the project.  Work began in 2008. </p><p>  To give maximum historical authenticity, the shooting took place in the Crimea, on the Taigan reservoir, in the Genoese fortress, in the village of Shkolnoye in the Simferopol district, in Bakhchisarai and on the cape Fiolent in Sevastopol. </p><p>  For the film, a special cinema park was even built in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Red Caves in Crimea.  According to the creators, these landscapes corresponded to the events described in the picture. </p>
