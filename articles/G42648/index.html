It was formed in the 9th century as a result of the internal development of <span>Slavic tribes.</span>  Kievan Rus played a significant role in the history of East Slavic peoples.  Throughout the entire existence of the state, the <span>Old Russian nationality</span> developed <span>,</span> which became the ethnic basis of 3 peoples - Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian.  The unification of Slavic tribes contributed to the development of the economic, cultural and <span>political sphere.</span>  Kievan Rus took a leading place in the international arena.  Close contacts were established with the Czech Republic, Georgia, Poland, France, Byzantium, and England. </p><p>  The heyday of Kievan Rus </p><p>  For a long period, the largest state in Europe was characterized by fragmentation.  The princes could not come to an agreement in resolving simple issues. </p><p>  The heyday of Kievan Rus was largely connected with the religious reforms carried out by Prince Vladimir.  He understood that paganism did not meet the interests of such a powerful state.  Belief in the forces of nature implied the worship of many gods.  And Vladimir decided to strengthen his power with the help of Christianity.  Thus, the population of Kievan Rus understood - if there is only one God in heaven, then they can only have one sovereign - Vladimir.  He accepted the Christian faith.  Right after that, almost the entire population was baptized.  With the <span>adoption of Christianity,</span> princely power strengthened. </p><p>  The heyday of Kievan Rus continued during the reign of <span>Yaroslav the Wise.</span>  Under him, much attention was paid to strengthening the position of Christianity.  In addition, culture and education have reached the highest level.  During this period, a large number of books were translated from Greek into Old Russian.  In Novgorod, a school was created in which three hundred students learned to read and write.  In Kiev, at the St. Sophia Cathedral, the <span>first library in Russia</span> was founded <span>.</span>  It not only translated books, but also wrote chronicles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The heyday of Kievan Rus was characterized by the development of architecture and painting.  A striking example is St. Sophia Cathedral.  It has no analogue in any state.  The cathedral is distinctive.  Unlike the architectural masterpieces of that time, Kiev Sofia did not rise above the ground.  In painting, an important place belonged to the fresco and mosaic. </p><p>  Foreign policy of Kievan Rus </p><p>  The main tasks facing the Old Russian princes were: </p><p>  - protection of trade routes; </p><p>  - struggle with the steppe nomads; </p><p>  - Strengthening ties with the Byzantine Empire. </p><p>  In the face of constant attacks, threats from the nomads, the princes of Russia strengthened the line of defense.  So, under Vladimir, powerful lines were formed on such rivers as Desna, Sula, Struna.  Fortresses and fortifications were built along the entire line of defense. </p><p>  Starting from the 10th century, frequent wars took place between Byzantium and Kievan Rus.  In many ways, they were associated with the struggle for trade routes, a reduction in duties for merchants, and increased power.  Only in 1046, two powerful states of Europe concluded a final peace treaty, which was sealed by the wedding of the Kiev prince Yaroslav and the daughter of the Byzantine emperor Monomakh. </p><p>  Princes of Ancient Russia </p><p>  According to Norman theory, the ancient Slavs until the 9th century lived in small tribes without centralized control.  Then they invited to the reign of the Varangian princes, who laid the foundation for the formation of the Old Russian state.  During this period, lands were attacked by nomads.  As a result, one of the Varangian princes (Rurik) died.  The place of the Kiev prince was taken by Oleg.  After the death of Oleg, Igor began to rule the state. </p><p>  A large role in the development of Kievan Rus belongs to Vladimir.  He not only united all the lands, but also adopted Christianity. </p><p>  An equally important place in the history of the ancient Russian state is assigned to Yaroslav the Wise.  Under him, Kievan Rus reached its peak: ties with many countries of the world strengthened, a breakthrough in the cultural sphere took place. </p><p>  After the reign of Yaroslav the Wise, the throne passed to Vladimir Monomakh, and then to Yuri Dolgoruky. </p><p>  Of course, with each ruler, Kievan Rus reached a different level of development, but one cannot deny the fact that it was under Vladimir and Yaroslav that the Old Russian state reached the peak of its development. </p>
