The Kingdom of Denmark is the smallest state in Scandinavia, but definitely one of the most interesting for travelers.  This country is filled with the breath of meadows, salty sea spray, the aroma of the stones of ancient castles warmed in the sun and amazing technical inventions that are not found anywhere else in Northern Europe.  Today our article is dedicated to the Kingdom of Denmark, which we look at with the delighted eyes of an average tourist. </p>

    <h2>  What do we know about Denmark? </h2><p>  Many Russians want to visit the northern kingdom, but not everyone imagines how much interesting the state expects in this territory.  Denmark is an amazing country, offering tourists a unique combination of historical monuments and modern technologies that turn the kingdom into the most fashionable and stylish piece of Northern Europe. </p><p>  Denmark can safely consider itself an island state, it is located on four hundred islands and <span>the Jutland peninsula.</span>  Of the large number of islands, only ninety are inhabited, but this is enough to accommodate a population of five million people.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe country is forty-three thousand square kilometers.  In the kingdom, they speak two <span>languages: Danish</span> and German.  Among the religious preferences of the inhabitants of the island are Catholicism and Lutheranism. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Kingdom of Denmark made itself known around the eighth century AD.  It was during this period that future Danes glorified themselves with numerous military campaigns and adopted Christianity, which contributed to the consolidation and development of state power. </p>

    <h2>  Kingdom of Denmark flag </h2><p>  Anyone who has once visited the northern kingdom knows for sure that the Danes really love their flag.  He even has a name - Danneborg, and the inhabitants of the country sincerely believe in the mythical story of his appearance.  It is noteworthy that in Denmark there is even a special celebration of the flag, celebrated on the day when, according to legend, it came down from heaven. </p><p>  In the nineteenth year of the thirteenth century, the <span>Danish king</span> was blessed and sent to war with the Estonians who lived next to today's Tallinn.  These tribes were pagans, and Voldemar II planned to convert them to the Christian faith in order to help the colonists from Germany.  However, the bloodthirsty ests on June 15 made an unexpected attack on the king‚Äôs troops, which had already thinned significantly in the first moments of the battle.  Then several bishops climbed the hill and began to pray.  In response to their appeal to God, a red cloth with a white cross fell from heaven.  Inspired soldiers that day were able to defeat the enemy.  From that moment on, Danneborg became the official flag of the state and acquired its own holiday. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kingdom of Denmark: History </h2><p>  Denmark is considered the southernmost of the Scandinavian countries.  Around the sixth century, tribes of Danes came here, who firmly settled on this earth by the eighth century.  Tribes united in clan unions, where everyone had the right to bear arms.  It is worth noting that the dans were quite warlike and, until the eleventh century, together with the Vikings participated in military raids. </p><p>  From the eighth century Christianity began to enter <span>Denmark,</span> three hundred years later the first archbishopric was formed here.  By the end of the fourteenth century, thanks to a successful monarchical union, virtually all of Scandinavia fell under the rule of the Kingdom of Denmark.  Around the same time period, Copenhagen received the status of the place where the king lived. </p><p>  New time is associated with the constant confrontation of Sweden, which was considered the main military opponent of the kingdom.  Armed conflicts led to the fact that at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Denmark was forced to cede part of its territories to Sweden and Great Britain. </p><p>  The second half of the nineteenth century was filled with peace for the country and was accompanied by the development of science, art and a number of liberal reforms.  The monarchy was somewhat limited; a Danish constitution and a bicameral parliament appeared. </p><p>  During the Second World War, the state was occupied by German troops.  Initially, Germany did not conduct active actions in Denmark, and life in the occupation was not much different from peacetime.  But later, the persecution of Jews and demonstrations began, which caused massive protests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Today, the Kingdom of Denmark, a photo of which tourists of all ages cannot ignore, is a constitutional monarchy.  The <span>unicameral parliament</span> helps the king in government <span>.</span>  It is noteworthy that Denmark was one of the initiators of the creation of the UN and NATO.  Now the kingdom is part of the European Union, but does not seek to enter the Eurozone. </p><h2>  Do I need a visa to Denmark? </h2><p>  When planning your trip, keep in mind that you will need a visa.  Since Denmark is a member of the Schengen Agreement, the procedure for obtaining the coveted stamp in the passport is quite understandable and already familiar to our compatriots.  The Embassy of the Kingdom of Denmark is located in Moscow, there are also numerous visa centers where you can submit the necessary package of documents.  You can also get a visa in eighteen Russian cities, where the relevant centers have already been opened. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that any existing Schengen is suitable for traveling to Denmark.  The visa application period does not exceed ten days.  However, many Russians claim that obtaining permission to enter the kingdom is much more difficult than in other countries.  Of course, this is just a purely personal opinion of travelers, so you should not tune in to failure by submitting a document to the visa center of your city. </p>

    <h2>  Museums in Denmark </h2><p>  The sights of the Kingdom of Denmark are very diverse.  It is amazing how rich this land is in historical monuments, ancient architectural structures and unusual places, interesting for tourists of any age.  You can go to Denmark, tuning in for a romantic trip, a big noisy company, wanting to spend time in an unusual atmosphere, or with a child who can be shown here all the diversity and beauty of our world.  But every tourist must visit at least several museums of the kingdom.  There are an incredible amount of them, but those located in Copenhagen deserve more attention: </p><ul><li>  National Museum.  The main exposition is divided into three parts.  Here you can see rare specimens of ancient weapons, works of art and objects found during archaeological research.  Unusual exhibitions are regularly held in the museum building, which will be interesting to attend. </li><li>  State Museum of Art.  This place will be interesting to people who are fond of art in any of its manifestations.  The walls of the museum contain unique masterpieces of the great masters of Europe.  The Danes are especially proud of the canvases of Rembrandt and Matisse. </li><li>  Ordrupgard.  This museum is dedicated to the work of the Impressionists of French descent.  If you consider yourself a connoisseur of such art, then the exposition will make a lasting impression on you. </li><li>  Louis Tussauds Wax Museum.  He is rightfully considered one of the best in Europe.  Before tourists will appear more than two hundred figures in intricate design.  Here you can choose a hall of horrors or, for example, politicians.  But most visitors prefer to go through the entire museum. </li><li>  Parliament of Denmark.  Do not be surprised that you will be offered an excursion into this realm of politics.  Here you will get incredible pleasure from contemplating the cartoons of politicians of different eras, placed on the walls of the building.  It is noteworthy that excursions are held regularly and many tourists perceive the parliament as a museum. </li></ul><p>  Naturally, the museums we have listed are far from the only ones in Copenhagen.

    <h2>  Little mermaid </h2><p>  The tale of the little mermaid was the reason for creating another attraction of the Kingdom of Denmark.  A photo with a description of this sculpture has long been the most common in Copenhagen, and the Danes themselves consider the pensive beauty a symbol of their country. </p><p>  <span>Monument "Little Mermaid"</span> was created at the beginning of the twentieth century.  It was ordered by the son of the owner of the Carlsberg brewery.  The young man had a weakness for this fairy tale from Andersen since childhood, and after watching a ballet of the same name, he literally fell in love with a ballerina dancing the main character.  Ellen Price, the name of Prima, was invited to pose as a prototype.  But the sculptor planned to portray the girl naked, which she opposed.  As a result, two women posed for the Little Mermaid sculpture: Ellen Price for the head, and Elina Erickson for the body. </p><p>  Now a bronze monument is placed over the harbor of Copenhagen.  Tourists and locals come here to make a wish and to see with their own eyes a sad fairytale beauty who gave almost everything that she had for her pipe dream of love. </p>

    <h2>  Kronborg Castle </h2><p>  It was in this magnificent building that Sheskpirovsky Hamlet lived, so tourists try to visit the ancient castle without fail and take a couple of photos against its background.  In fact, there is no reliable information that Shakespeare at least saw this ancient castle.  However, this fact does not in the least reduce the historical value of this fortification, created to protect the country from the Swedes. </p><p>  The first stone in the foundation of the structure was laid in 1420, since then it has been repeatedly rebuilt and reconstructed.  Now the castle appears before tourists, as it became at the end of the eighteenth century. </p><p>  It is difficult to list all the sights of Denmark, because this unique country attracts lovers of adventure and fairy tales.  Therefore, be sure to come here yourself, believe me - your trip will be simply unforgettable. </p>
