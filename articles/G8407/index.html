Today, any admirer of a recognized genius can visit the place where he was born and lived most of his life.  The Tolstoy family estate "Yasnaya Polyana" is located in the Tula region.  The setting of 1910 was preserved in the old estate and the memorial museum of the great writer was opened. </p><h2>  History of Yasnaya Polyana </h2>

    <p>  In historical documents, the first mention of the estate, located 14 km from the modern borders of the city of Tula, dates from 1652.  In the middle of the eighteenth century, the estate became the property of the Volkonsky family - the ancestors of the famous maternal writer.  Several generations of princely bearers have been diligently engaged in the improvement of the estate.  It was during the Volkonskys on the territory of Yasnaya Polyana that gardens were broken, ponds dug up, many architectural buildings erected. </p><p>  In 1828, Leo Tolstoy was born in a family estate.  The local nature and measured provincial life from an early age inspired the future writer.  Tolstoy Estate Yasnaya Polyana is the place where Lev Nikolaevich lived for about 50 years of his life.  He never hid his love for the estate and often mentioned his native place in his works. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Life L.N.

In the days of Lev Nikolaevich, this building (previously the main manor house) was used for household purposes.  The Tolstoy family rebuilt one of the wings for their own residence.  The master's <span>house of the writer is</span> relatively small in size, but incredibly cozy.  Inside, it is distinguished by simple decoration, and the main value in it is the extensive library of Lev Nikolaevich.

    <p>  During his lifetime, Tolstoy became famous not only thanks to his mind and talent, but also to his incredible philanthropy.  At the estate, a school was opened for peasant children.  Tolstoy Manor "Yasnaya Polyana" is a unique place where the owner was close to ordinary people like no other.  Leo Tolstoy died in 1910.  In his will, the writer indicated to bury him without honors in the forest on the edge of the ravine.  The last will of Lev Nikolaevich was fulfilled. </p><h2>  Yasnaya Polyana during the Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  After the death of Lev Nikolayevich, the Tolstoy estate was not plundered, as peasants from the surrounding villages respected the writer and his family.  In 1921, a museum was opened in Yasnaya Polyana.  To a large extent, this is the merit of the daughter of Lev Nikolaevich Alexandra Lvovna, who became the first director of the memorial and cultural center.  Despite the state status, the descendants of the great writer were always directly involved in the museum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the very beginning of World War II, a significant part of the exhibits was evacuated to Tomsk.  The old manor was occupied by enemy troops for 45 days.  The Nazis inflicted significant damage to the museum, stole and spoiled many ancient objects.  Restoration work began immediately after the liberation.  What is noteworthy, the Tolstoy Museum-Estate was opened before the end of the war, already in 1942. </p><h2>  The modern history of the museum </h2>

In the house of L.N.  Tolstoy retained the furnishings of the 1910 model and exhibited many genuine personal belongings of the writer and his family.  The museum collection is listed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.  Today, Yasnaya Polyana is a place that is popular among tourists from all over the world.

A variety of exhibitions, festivals, festive festivities and other events are regularly held in Yasnaya Polyana.

Tolstoy.  The internal situation is fully consistent with the time when the writer lived here with his family.  The estate is decorated atypically for its period, inside the guests expect a minimum amount of luxury goods.  In most rooms, the walls are light plain and the furniture has simple shapes.  The pride of the museum (and once the owner of the house) is the writer‚Äôs chic library.  In addition to the working and reception rooms, museum visitors will see the living rooms of Lev Nikolaevich and his family members.

Tolstoy "Yasnaya Polyana" is a whole complex of historical buildings surrounded by a picturesque park.  Volkonsky's house is today the main administrative building of the museum.  In one part of it there are guided tours for tourists.  The Kuzminskikh wing was once a school building, and later turned into a guest house.  Today it houses temporary exhibitions.

    <p>  More than a century after the death of its famous owner, Yasnaya Polyana continues to live in the usual mode.  On the territory of the museum complex, greenhouses and ancient stables have been preserved and are functioning, next to which there is a carriage shed building.  Other outbuildings look no less atmospheric: the coachman, the carpentry, the forge, the grain, Riga and the garden house.  Birch bridges, the writer's favorite bench, and a swimming pool are favorably complemented by park landscapes.  The grave of a famous writer has been preserved in the historical estate.  For the convenience of tourists in the park there are signs to all local attractions. </p><h2>  Museum opening hours and excursions </h2>

Ticket price is 200-300 rubles, depending on the selected program.  For those who want to just walk around the territory of the historical park, the entrance costs about 50 rubles.  Tickets of all kinds are sold at the box office at the entrance.  The walk time is unlimited, which is especially nice - you can take pictures in the manor park for free.

    <p>  The situation is quite different when visiting exhibits located on the premises.  The Tolstoy Museum-Estate, the photo of which is presented in the article, stores many exhibits.  Tourists are not allowed to take photographs inside the writer's house and Volkonsky‚Äôs house.  It is also forbidden to touch most exhibits with your hands.  Despite these rules, the Tolstoy estate is a great place to visit.  It will be interesting to visit this unique museum not only to fans of Leo Nikolaevich‚Äôs work, but also to everyone who loves beautiful natural places. </p>
