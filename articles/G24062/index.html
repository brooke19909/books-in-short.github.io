You must admit that each of us had to hear about it at least once in a lifetime.  Someone was even lucky enough to visit this amazing resort, well, while someone is only satisfied with the descriptions and enthusiastic reviews of relatives, friends and just work colleagues.  One way or another, have you ever wondered where such a very popular place is?  What is so unusual about that?  And why does it annually attract not even hundreds, but thousands of vacationers from all over the world? </p><p>  <strong>Section 1. Abkhazia.</strong>  <strong>Pitsunda.</strong>  <strong>Nature and climate</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia pizunda" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/296615.jpg" width="600"></div>  Only 18 km from the famous resort town of Gagra is this relatively small village.  From Sukhum to Pitsunda, 90 km, however, by modern standards, such a distance, you will agree, cannot be called great, and the healing effect and wonderful rest are provided to everyone who comes to these fertile lands.

    <p>  Geographically, Pitsunda is located in places characterized by a unique combination of natural and climatic factors.  The Black Sea is warm and gentle, as if it was specially created for vacationers who come here in the summer.  The therapeutic effect of sea water and air saturated with its vapors allows very many to restore their health.  The beautiful pine grove of Pitsunda helps to saturate the atmosphere with phytoncides and essential oils.  It breathes really well here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The climate in Pitsunda is subtropical humid.  Winter is mild, there is usually no snow.  And the summer is warm, but not sultry.  You can swim from May to October. </p><p>  In some, especially warm, years, the swimming season continues even until mid-November!  It offers a truly unforgettable vacation in Abkhazia <span>(Pitsunda).</span>  <span>The private sector,</span> hotels, rented apartments, a campsite and campgrounds - each tourist will eventually find the most suitable option for himself. </p><p>  Experienced tourists are still advised to give preference to the private sector.  Why?  Well, first of all, it is quite financially profitable (250-400 rubles per day, depending on location), and secondly, in the yard you can always leave your car safe and sound.  And finally, each of us, even on vacation, dreams of having dinner in the yard, relaxing in the shade of trees, and lying on the grass. </p><p>  There are so many sunny days in Pitsunda that this resort enters into this competition with the <span>resorts of Crimea</span> and the French Riviera. </p><p>  <strong>Section 2.

    <p>  Well, let's start in order. </p><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A visit to the Patriarchal Cathedral is highly recommended.  This is a magnificent cross-domed structure, which has 3 protruding apse and cartex.  The time of construction of this temple dates back to the X century.  In a later period it was renovated and decorated with frescoes. </p><p>  Experienced travelers are advised to visit in Pitsunda a private museum called the "Old Mill".  Here you can see the Abkhaz agricultural tools that were used in these places in ancient times.  The exposition allows you to carefully examine all the features of the hunter‚Äôs house and the tavern located here, which is called the same as the museum - ‚ÄúThe Old Mill‚Äù.  Interestingly, the owner of the museum collected exhibits in different regions of the Soviet Union.  There is also a collection of samovars.  The museum exposition is currently the largest in terms of the number of exhibits in Abkhazia. </p><p>  <strong>Section 3.

    <p>  The <span>New Athos Cave is</span> no doubt admirable <span>.</span>  This karst cavity is one of the largest in the world.  It is believed that her age reaches 2 million years!  Six cave halls can be seen during the tour.  Amazing natural beauty: <span>stalagmites and stalactites,</span> petrified waterfall, gallery, which presents stone flowers.  This should be seen with your own eyes! </p><p>  We have listed far from all the interesting places to visit in this amazing place.  Everyone here reveals something of their own.  One could be sure, as they say, of 100%: a photo album entitled "Holidays in Abkhazia 2013. Pitsunda" has already become a worthy collection in the family archive of a thousand enthusiastic tourists.  Many of them will return here in the next, and in a year, two or five years.
