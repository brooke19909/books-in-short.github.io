One of its most famous monuments is the Kumzhensky memorial.  Rostov-on-Don is one of the few cities in Russia that survived two occupations during the Great Patriotic War.  And the <span>memorial complex</span> in the Kumzhenskaya grove is a living reminder of the difficult but heroic period in his biography. </p><h2>  Hero City on the Don </h2><p>  In 2008, Rostov-on-Don received the honorary title "City of Military Glory."  The crucial strategic importance of the ‚Äúgate of the Caucasus‚Äù was understood by everyone: both Stalin and Hitler.  Having occupied this city, fascist troops gained access to two important resources at once: the Kuban fields and the Caucasian oil. </p><p>  For the first time, German troops came close to the lower reaches of the Don in mid-November 1941.  For three days, young and inexperienced fighters held back the onslaught of the enemy.  But on November 21, the Germans entered the city.  The first occupation of Rostov lasted only a week.  However, this week went down in the history of the city as "bloody".  The enraged fascists carried out more than one punitive operation here, shooting people right on the streets. </p><p>  The counterattack led by Marshal Semen Tymoshenko allowed the enemy to be squeezed out of the city.  By the way, this was one of the first major victories of the Red Army in that war. </p>

    <p>  Soviet Rostov-on-Don remained until mid-July 1942.  On July 24, Wehrmacht troops entered the city again.  The second defense of Rostov was no less fierce.  And she, having pulled back a significant share of German troops, gave time to prepare for the battles of Stalingrad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second occupation of the city lasted about seven months.  During this time, up to 40 thousand citizens died, about the same was sent to forced labor in Germany.  In February 1943, a large-scale military operation began to liberate the city, which later historians will call "real hell."  Indeed, for this, the Soviet troops needed to go to the opposite bank of the Don along the frozen and uncovered terrain. </p><p>  On February 14, 1943, Rostov-on-Don was completely liberated from the Nazi invaders. </p><h2>  Where is Kumzhenskaya grove located? </h2><p>  One of the monuments of modern Rostov-on-Don, which remind its residents of those bloody battles, is the Kumzhensky memorial.  It is located in the Zheleznodorozhny district, on the southwestern outskirts of the city. </p><p>  Geographically, this is a cape (or ‚Äúarrow‚Äù) between the channels of two rivers - the Don and the Dead Donets.  The townspeople this place is known as Kumzhenskaya grove. </p><p>  Grove is not only the Kumzhensky memorial, but also a great place for a summer vacation.  It is famous for its spacious green glades, which offer a picturesque view of the river and the city. </p>

    <p>  The monument is decorated with a sculptural composition consisting of several figures of Soviet soldiers going into battle.  Interestingly, it shows the real faces of people who took an active part in the operation to free Rostov in 1943. </p><p>  Kumzhensky memorial was opened in 1983.  The authors of the project were R. Muradyan (architect), E. Lapko and B. Lapko (sculptors).  In the mid-90s, the memorial complex was gradually declining.  Only in 2015 it was thoroughly restored and improved.  Now the territory of the memorial is decorated with beautiful lawns, flower beds, equipped with lighting and video surveillance systems. </p>
