Sony RX 100 digital camera - specifications, prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When <span>choosing a camera,</span> modern users are primarily interested in the quality of the resulting images.  The cost of the device itself and its accessories, compactness and ease of operation are also considered important.  After the mirrorless camera segment appeared on the market, the problem of successfully combining all of the above characteristics in the device was only partially solved.  The fact is that not all amateur photographers can satisfy their compactness.  A successful practical solution to this request is designed to become the Sony RX100.  An overview of this miniature device that creates frames of good quality is presented in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony RX100" class="if" height="465" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/558028.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  External parameters </h2><p>  The weight of the device is 213 grams, taking into account the installed battery.  The external dimensions of the model in this case are 10.2 x 5.9 x 3.6 centimeters in width, height and thickness, respectively.  If we compare the modification with its main competitors, then we can conclude that the Sony RX100 is the lightest and most compact.  The review and analysis of the market is an additional confirmation of this.  The main material for the manufacture of the case is aluminum. </p><h2>  Basic controls and connectors </h2><p>  To the right of the display on the back you can see the Fn keys, videos, enter the menu, view images, and delete files.  The operating disk is also located here, in the center of which a consent button is installed.  One cannot but focus on the fact that each of the mentioned governing bodies has an additional purpose.  The left end of the device is empty, while on the right side only a USB port is provided, which is covered by a rubber plug.  <span>The</span> developers placed the <span>HDMI connector</span> on the bottom side, next to the tripod thread.  In the upper part there is an on / off key, a built-in flash, a switch for shooting modes, as well as a trigger for selecting the focal length of the lens.  As for the slot for installing a memory card and the shaft of the battery, they are also located at the bottom of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony RX100 review" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/558048.jpg" width="600"></div>

He is able to control one of the eight selected modes (starting from the shutter speed and ending with the focal length). </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The main part of the space on the back side is occupied by the information screen, which also plays the role of a viewfinder.  The diagonal size of the display, which has a Sony RX100 camera, is three inches, and its resolution is 1.228 megapixels.  As for the matrix used for the display, it is based on TFT LCD technology.  In general, in terms of its characteristics, the device‚Äôs monitor is considered to be of higher quality and modern, compared with its main competitors.  On the other hand, one cannot fail to note one of its significant drawbacks.  The fact is that the screen of this device is not equipped with a rotary mounting mechanism (as, for example, the Canon PowerShot G1X model). </p><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  It should be noted and high ergonomics Sony DSC RX100.  The reviews of experts and owners of the device indicate that it is very convenient to lay down in your hands and has a thoughtful arrangement of controls.  The design of the device can be called very concise and convenient - the case has rounded edges, and the retractable lens shaft is clearly in the center of the front part. </p><h2>  Matrix </h2><p>  The Sony RX100 is based on a photosensitive CMOS sensor.  Her physical parameters are 13.2x8.8 mm.  In this indicator, the device surpasses all its main competitors.  Image sensitivity (ISO) ranges from 100 to 25600 units.  As for the maximum image size, it is equal to 5472x3648 pixels.  The camera takes photos with a resolution of 20.2 megapixels.  The density of the image is 1741 pixels per square centimeter.  Be that as it may, the final quality of photos is significantly affected not only by the basic parameters of the matrix, but also by the complexity of the optics and the functioning of the processor algorithms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony DSC RX100 reviews" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/558045.jpg" width="600"></div>

The transfocal lens is capable of covering a range of equivalent focal lengths, which ranges from 28 to 100 millimeters.  The lens of the device is equipped with a SteadyShot system, which provides optical stabilization of the resulting image.  This model, like almost any other Sony camera, is equipped with the BionZ processor, which belongs to the latest generation.  Thanks to this, the device boasts a high data processing speed.  This is mainly due to the use of modern clear-cut algorithms in combination with some new functions. </p><h2>  Testing Key Features </h2><p>  As numerous tests show, the level of detail from the center of the frame, where it is quite high, drops slightly towards its edges.  In addition, mild optical distortions (both in the body position and at wide angles), as well as moderate chromatic aberrations, became characteristic of the Sony RX100 lens when shooting in JPG format.  In such an indicator as the level of color rendering and detail with increasing ISO values, the model can be called one of the best compact cameras of all that are on the market.  More specifically, the camera is able to create printable photos in the format of 90x60 centimeters even at the lowest light sensitivity value.  If you select the highest possible ISO, the print format can be up to A-4 inclusive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony RX100 Camera" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/558035.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Shooting </h2><p>  As practice shows, the reviews left by Sony DSC RX100 camera owners regarding the practical shooting capabilities are overwhelmingly positive.  This is not surprising, since the device boasts a high speed serial shooting (2.5 frames per second) and the presence of a large number of creative modes, including panoramic shooting.  A full charge of the battery is usually enough to create up to 330 frames, which can be called a worthy indicator in this segment of cameras.  Do not forget the good quality of videos that are recorded at a speed of 60 frames per second. </p><p>  According to experienced users of this kind of device, almost its only significant drawback is the built-in flash, which does not differ in high power.  In addition, it is equipped with a very slow charging mechanism, which leads to far from its most efficient operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony camera" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/558043.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Image Quality </h2><p>  In terms of image quality, the Sony RX100 is able to please both amateurs and experienced photographers.  In general, the camera is most suitable for landscape photography.  Color reproduction can be called neutral (the model itself does not embellish the picture and does not blur it).  In the case of shooting in bright sunlight, the high quality of images is greatly facilitated by the function to optimize the dynamic range.  If you create a frame, for example, opposite the window, then the colors in the photo will turn out to be slightly whitened.  To enhance shadows, experts recommend reducing the flash output.  Speaking about the macro capabilities of the Sony RX100 camera, one can not fail to note the nuance that according to the technical passport of the device they are very good, because the smallest focusing distance is five centimeters.  At the same time, do not forget that the device is able to focus exclusively when the lens is in a wide-angle position.  As a result, the final proportions may be distorted, which makes you stop thinking about serious subject photography. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony DSC RX100 Black" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/558036.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Making a conclusion about the model, first of all, it is necessary to focus on the fact that, as of today, it is rightfully considered one of the best compact cameras.  The device is available in a black aluminum case, so it can often be found under the name Sony DSC RX100 Black.  Due to the fact that the developers equipped the camera with a lens with excellent optical data, as well as a large matrix, it is able to seriously compete not only with some mirrorless modifications, but also with the ‚ÄúDSLRs‚Äù in the basic configuration related to the initial level.  Functional features of the camera can be safely called quite solid.  With all this, do not forget about the compactness of the device and the ergonomics of its controls.  As for the cost of the Sony RX100, the price of the device in Russia is about twenty thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Second generation: key differences </h2><p>  After the success of the model mentioned above, the manufacturer presented an updated version of the device.  The well-proven aluminum case has remained the same, but the display has become hinged.  The 2-generation Sony RX100 also acquired a so-called hot shoe (it provides the ability to connect an additional flash), a microphone and a rotary viewfinder.  The weight of new items increased by 68 grams.  All other innovations are not so significant, but have become quite useful.  For example, the microHDMI port was moved to the left side, making it much easier to find it now.  It is not necessary to get the battery from the new one, since it can be charged via the USB connector.  Moreover, the developers have provided for the camera an auxiliary power supply. </p><p>  Some changes have occurred in the technical equipment.  In particular, the device uses a new Exmor R matrix with twenty megapixels, characterized by an extended ISO range up one level and the presence of backlight.  The noise level in the pictures is negligible.  As for the lens, it was inherited from its predecessor. </p><p>  Video recording deserves separate words, which this modification carries out with a frequency of 24 or <span>25 frames.</span>  Movies are recorded in 1080p format.  The user selects the encoding format at his discretion.  During video shooting, it is also possible to use manual modes, which allows not only to set the appropriate aperture value, but also to adjust the exposure.  All kinds of vibrations, as in the previous version of the device, are smoothed out due to the SteadyShot technology.  The only drawback when shooting a video is that digital zoom cannot be disabled during its implementation.  This can lead to the fact that the recording slightly slows down, and a pause is formed on the clip at the appropriate moment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony RX100 II" class="if" height="490" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/558046.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Without a doubt, the manufacturing company was able to significantly improve the already good camera.  There is practically no tangible difference between photos created using the Sony RX100 II and its previous version.  If it exists, it is very insignificant.  The main argument in favor of the device usually becomes its highest functionality and simplicity.  In addition, do not forget about the improved technical equipment of the new product, namely, the presence of a folding screen and a "shoe".  On the other hand, such innovations have led to an increase in its value.  Be that as it may, the model deserves only positive recommendations and feedback. </p>
