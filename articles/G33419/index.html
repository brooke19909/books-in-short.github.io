All the beauty of this city is a combination of modernity and the spirit of the East. </p><p>  If you want to get acquainted with the area that modernity did not have time to touch, it is worth visiting the old part of the city - Eski shahar.  Here there is an opportunity to walk deeply along small streets among ancient clay buildings and mosques. </p><p>  Organizing holidays in Tashkent, it is impossible to do without <span>oriental bazaars,</span> museums, theaters and other cultural monuments. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li data-leveltext="ÔÇ∑" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  Mustakillik Maidoni, the local Independence Square, is the main attraction of the city.  This place is loved not only by tourists, but also by the townspeople themselves, who gather here for the holidays, and just take a walk.  The vast territory pleases with picturesque fountains and green alleys, colonnades and monuments, state buildings and a park.  Of modern buildings, it is worthwhile to devote time to the television tower - the tallest building in Central Asia.  From the observation deck Tashkent is clearly visible. </li><li data-leveltext="ÔÇ∑" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1">  Uzbekistan is famous for its beautiful oriental buildings of a religious nature.

The most popular are the Historical, State and Museum of Applied Arts. </li><li data-leveltext="ÔÇ∑" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1">  Bazaars of Tashkent are like illustrations for oriental tales and legends.  Particularly popular among tourists is the oldest in all of Central Asia, Chorsu.  It is located in the old city, under a huge blue dome.  Once in the market, the tourist immediately plunges into the aromas of spices and oriental sweets.  Most of them are groceries, but there is also a department with things and souvenirs.  Here you can meet the Uzbek craftsmen and watch their work. <div class="photo" data-original="21asr.uz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Variety of Chorsu Bazaar in Tashkent" class="if uuid-2565070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90810/2565070.jpg"></div></li><li data-leveltext="ÔÇ∑" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="6" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1">  As in any major city, the capital of Uzbekistan has many parks.  The most visited are the botanical and Japanese gardens, the central park and the zoo. </li></ol><h2>  Mountains of Tashkent </h2><p>  Holidays in the mountains of Tashkent attract thousands of visitors.  Chimgan mountains are especially popular.  In Soviet times, they were a recognized tourist center.  Bards spread rumors about these places around the world, and thousands of athletes went to the Olympics from all Soviet countries. </p><p>  A similar winter recreation area is available in the Beldersay Mountains.  These two points are located within 90 km from Tashkent.  You can count on a variety of ways to spend time: </p><ol><li data-leveltext="ÔÇ∑" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="7" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  Skiing.  The best season is February. </li><li data-leveltext="ÔÇ∑" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="7" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  In Beldersaysk there is the longest cable car (3017 m). </li><li data-leveltext="ÔÇ∑" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="7" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  A similar path can be done in the Chimgan Mountains, but with a length of 800 meters.  The route does not pass through avalanche hazardous areas, so it can be called safe. <div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chimgan mountains in Tashkent" class="if uuid-2560123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90810/2560123.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2 aria-level="2">  Water recreation </h2><p>  Charvak is a real find for admirers of the turquoise smooth surface of crystal clear waters.  Sea tour in Tashkent is possible only thanks to a man-made reservoir.  The pictures here are simply amazing: aquamarine waters are surrounded by green shores, a little further visible snow caps of the mountains.  On the territory of the lake there are many camps and pensions. </p><p>  For lovers of fishing in Tashkent, there is the Syr Darya River and the rich in fish lakes Arnasay and Aydarkul. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  Where to stay in Tashkent </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.remotelands.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Tashkent" class="if uuid-2560085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90810/2560085.jpg"></div><p>  There are no problems with living in the capital - there are enough free places in hotels.  The city is designed for a very wide audience.  It is possible to rent an apartment or house - it will cost between $ 20-50 per day per person. </p><p>  Holidays in Tashkent "all inclusive" are many times more expensive, but you will not need to worry about anything.  Hotel prices are around $ 50-200 per day. </p><p>  Those who have visited this fabulous city have the most pleasant experience.  Everyone notes the unusual eastern flavor of the city, the good-naturedness of the locals and their hospitality.  A big plus is quite a cheap vacation and the lack of a huge flow of tourists.  If there is an opportunity to visit the capital of Uzbekistan, be sure to use it. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Visitors to the city leave the warmest reviews about vacations in Tashkent.  Many praise the famous TV tower - they say that it is worth to climb it only in order to see the impressive sweep of the city and get more general information about its geography.  It is worth noting that at the entrance they are asked to present a passport. </p><div class="photo" data-original="traveluzb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV tower in Tashkent" class="if uuid-2560119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90810/2560119.jpg"></div><p>  Others greatly praise the Chorsu market, which impresses with its diversity and variety.  Most visitors really like that you can try anything you want, completely free.  And if you decide to buy something, you can bargain with the seller and get the goods 30 percent cheaper than the cost. </p>
