Chelyabinsk is growing in the most beautiful <span>areas,</span> its infrastructure is developing, museums and theaters are appearing.  At the same time, great importance has been attached to preserving the ecology and natural resources in recent decades. </p><h2>  From idea to embodiment </h2><p>  The first ideas about the development of the North-West district of the city towards Lake Shershni were voiced in the early 2000s.  By 2007, the district had already been worked out by architects and carefully studied by builders for the most correct use of land resources and existing by that time highways. </p><h2>  Young area </h2><p>  The mere fact that the Topolina Alley microdistrict in Chelyabinsk is considered the most environmentally friendly of all the city’s new buildings is a great reason to look at it for housing.  It is separated from the center of the southern Ural capital by a beautiful pine forest and a resting place for all the townspeople <span>Lake Shershni.</span>  Nevertheless, the distance is not as significant as it seems at first glance. </p><p>  The very name “Poplar Alley” in Chelyabinsk has been known for a long time, and it came from the once existing tall poplars that grew along the road in this area.  This road in those days was rather unpaved.  She looked almost fabulous.  The tops of the trees intertwined somewhere high above the passing cars, and it seemed that you were getting into a little fairy tale. </p>

    <p>  Beyond these poplars were fields.  The wind walked where playgrounds are now installed, there are tall, modern houses.  There are no those trees, the road has become asphalted, and cars, buses, minibuses run along it every minute.  And only the name remains the same - "Poplar Alley." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The location of the Topolina Alley of Chelyabinsk relative to the city center is very convenient - only 15-20 minutes by car, transport accessibility, the availability of developed infrastructure, large chain stores, restaurants and cafes, beauty salons, sports clubs, bank branches.  All amenities for residents of the new district were created very quickly. </p><p>  During the construction of the Topolina Alley in Chelyabinsk, they did not forget about the younger generation.

New yards require attention no less than others.  Arrangement of playgrounds, cleanliness in the adjacent territories, because there is a clean forest nearby, order at the parking lot, adherence to the cleaning schedule for the entrances and many more little things that need to be controlled.  Mostly young families live here, most often with children, and for them all these nuances are important. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Although it is worth paying tribute to the operational service of the management company "Topolina Alley" of Chelyabinsk, which serves the area.

If we consider the option of buying an apartment in Chelyabinsk on the “Top Alley”, then this is an investment in the future, since the area is young and developing, the houses are built with high quality and safe.  Those who have already acquired residential meters there are thinking about increasing, and often these are already thoughts about their house, and not just about the apartment, but in this area. </p><p>  Many young families, having bought housing for themselves, acquire apartments for their parents.  Fresh air, the opportunity to take a walk in the forested area without long trips, the proximity of shops, the availability of transport, spacious apartments at an affordable price - all these are reasons to think about such a good investment. </p>

    <p>  The central districts of the metropolis are already overloaded with transport, noise, exhaust fumes, crowds of crowds, all the while standing by houses.  The absence of often simple playgrounds in the courtyards, the remoteness of park areas for walks - this is our reality. </p><h2>  Apartment Options </h2><p>  Buying an apartment on Topolinka will be a good acquisition.  Here they are offered with any finish.  “Draft” if future owners want to make a plan themselves and subsequently realize all their interior dreams in reality. </p><p>  Partial decoration is possible, where it is also possible to create a unique interior, but with less investment than with a “rough” one. </p><p>  And for those who do not want to think about the repair yet, they will be “finished” - plastic windows, glazed balconies, metal entrance doors, vinyl wallpapers on the walls, tiles in the bathroom and toilet, “apron” tiled in the kitchen.  Electricians have sockets and switches, fire alarms, water and electricity meters.  It remains only to choose a suitable environment and you can call in and live. </p><h2>  Business development in the area </h2><p>  It is also beneficial to invest in commercial real estate here, in the “Top Alley” of Chelyabinsk.  The city will continue to grow in a north-west direction, and as a result, there will be a need for service centers, entertainment facilities, shops and shopping centers. </p><p>  The more residents there are, the wider the infrastructure will develop.  After all, no woman will refuse to do a manicure in a beauty parlor, which is located in her own house or in a neighboring one.  Few people want to go to a remote store, if exactly the same is within walking distance. </p>
