    <p>  <strong>A sociological study</strong> is a process that consists of successive methodological, methodological, organizational and technical actions that are linked by a common goal - obtaining accurate data on the phenomenon being studied, which can be used in the future for practical purposes. </p><p>  <strong>A case study</strong> consists of three stages.  This is the development of the program and the choice of research methods;  conducting empirical research;  data processing, analysis, formation of conclusions, writing a report. </p><p>  <strong><span>Applied case</span> study is</strong> usually empirical.  It focuses on the practical solution of the problems of society, often limited to finding a way to resolve a particular problem in specific conditions and on a specific social object.  In the course of such a study, the previously obtained theoretical knowledge is used in finished form when analyzing the data collected, interpreting concepts, compiling a program, a scientific report on the study, etc.  The main role is played by quite specific business recommendations, not theory. </p><p>  <strong>A specific case study</strong> is understood as the systematic use of <span>scientific methods</span> to study a specific fragment of reality relating to the life of society.  Such a study is carried out at all levels of sociological science. </p><p>  At the basic level of sociology, such studies are called concrete.  They have a clear practical orientation.  Moreover, they may well be subordinate to the goals of the scientific study of society. </p><p>  There are three types of case studies in sociology: intelligence, descriptive, and analytical. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first type, <strong>intelligence -</strong> is a study of the most elementary level, which allows you to solve a fairly narrow range of tasks.  During this type of research, tools (documents) are tested: questionnaires, questionnaires, cards, etc.  As a rule, groups of individuals with a maximum of one hundred people are examined.  This case study usually precedes a more serious study of the problem.  In its course, hypotheses, goals, questions and tasks are specified. </p><p>  <strong>Descriptive</strong> is a study of a more complex level of analysis.  In this way, empirical information is studied, which can give a more holistic view of the phenomenon of social life under study.  The object of analysis is a large group of individuals of society (for example, a large <span>labor collective).</span> </p><p>  In such a study, many methods of collecting information are used, which significantly increases their reliability and completeness, allowing you to draw deeper conclusions. </p><p>  <strong>Analytical</strong> - a sociological study of the highest and most serious level.  It not only describes the phenomena being studied, but also finds out the reasons that underlie them.  In the course of such a study, a set of factors that substantiate a particular <span>social phenomenon</span> is studied <span>.</span>  In most cases, studies of this nature complete the intelligence and descriptive stages. </p><p>  This <span>type of research</span> as re-comparative is also singled out as a separate group.  It is carried out in order to determine the dynamics inherent in the course of social processes. </p><p>  A special type of research is monitoring.  It should be comprehensive, planned and periodic.  This is how information is collected and systematized. </p><p>  The results obtained after the study are reflected in a special report.  The structure of this report follows the logic of the main stages of the study.  The number of sections of the report is usually equal to the number of hypotheses that are indicated in the research program.  First of all, the report is given on the main hypothesis. </p>
