    <h2>  Track "Don" </h2><p>  Each track has its own characteristics, from which its features are added, talking about the quality of the road surface, safety in bad weather conditions, the beauty of the surrounding landscape and high-quality service. </p><p>  The M4 ‚ÄúDon‚Äù highway, the most controversial reviews about it, has a length of 1,589 km, and drivers have their own opinions about each kilometer of the road.  This quite a long way from Moscow to Novorossiysk runs right through several large areas: Moscow, Tula, Lipetsk, Voronezh, Rostov, and also the Krasnodar Territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="track m4 dong reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/979239.jpg" width="274"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It can be seen that the M4 highway on the map crosses such large rivers as the Oka, Don, <span>Beautiful Swords,</span> Pine, <span>Seversky Donets,</span> Kuban, and the Voronezh reservoir.  In reality, bridges with a lifting capacity of up to 80 tons are thrown across these rivers.  For faster movement built bypass roads to leave such big cities as <span>Voronezh, Rostov-on-Don</span> and Krasnodar, behind check-in without them.  Naturally, the question is urgent for truckers and motorists: "Where to stay for the night on the M4 highway to eat well and have a good night's sleep?" </p><h2>  Road and Traffic Quality </h2><p>  The quality of the road is determined by several factors: </p><ul><li>  Firstly, the road surface itself.  On <span>the M4 highway,</span> it is of high quality and allows you to reach speeds of up to 130 km / h where it is allowed. </li><li>  Secondly, security, which is determined by how clearly visible the dividing strip, <span>fences, pedestrian</span> crossings and traffic lights in poor visibility.  The presence of steep turns also matters.  The M4 ‚ÄúDon‚Äù highway (reviews of regular travelers confirm this) has several dangerous sections where an avalanche may descend or where blockage may occur due to heavy snow drifts.  It happened several times when this route was closed for several days due to bad weather. </li><li>  Thirdly, traffic load at different times of the year.  Although the M4 track on the map looks large and safe, but in reality it is also very high quality, nevertheless it does not cope with the loads, especially in the summer.  On the one hand, cars are driving tourists in a continuous stream to the sea, and on the other hand, trucks from the south are transporting vegetables and fruits to Moscow and other cities.  Traffic jams, crowded hotels and emergencies - all this greatly affects the condition of drivers, so their main question during this period is where to stay for the night on the M4 highway. </li></ul>

Since the road from Moscow to the Black Sea is long, refueling, overnight, canteens or cafes, hospitals or emergency assistance points should be located along the route of the car or a few hundred meters from the road.  A tired driver is a threat to the entire traffic flow of the highway.  Because of the accident, not only do people die, but all traffic stops until the circumstances of the accident are fully clarified. </li></ul><p>  These are the main indicators of the quality of the route, but in fact there are many more, and the main factor that speaks about the state of the path is human. </p><h2>  Dangerous sections of the M4 highway </h2><p>  Although the M4 highway is equipped with 4 wide lanes with dividers, there are sections where they are replaced by 2 lanes where speed is limited and overtaking is prohibited.  For traffic safety, road cameras stand along the entire path, which transmit everything that happens during traffic to the traffic police posts.  If a driver decides on a dangerous stretch of the road to overtake, they just confiscate the rights that will have to be returned after the trial and payment of the fine. </p><p>  As the drivers themselves note, sections with poor visibility are located at the 26th, 49th, 95th and 364th km, and these are the most reliable data from those who travel there regularly. </p><h2>  Paid areas </h2><p>  Part of the path along the M4 highway is paid sections, but there are few of them and they are short.  The fare depends on the time of day, category and vehicle capacity: </p><ul><li>  Cars with a trailer up to 2 m or without it, as well as motorcycles will be able to drive for 30 and 50 rubles. </li><li>  Pickups, vans, mini-vans and medium-sized vehicles will pay 45 and 75 rubles each. </li><li>  Buses of any category, cars for transportation of large cargoes will pay 60 and 100 rubles, and if these are bulky vehicles and class 2 buses, then the rate will be 120 and 200 rubles. </li></ul>

Since the road from Moscow to the Black Sea is not a short one, it is important that the driver receives the maximum necessary, without wasting time on this. </p><p>  The M4 highway, the refueling of which every year improves the quality of customer service, makes the driver's journey enjoyable.  If earlier it was only possible to refuel at gas stations, today it is also a place with a mini-model where you can replenish supplies of water and food, with a toilet and shower cabins to refresh yourself and put yourself in order. </p><p>  Approximately every 20-30 km, there are gas stations, car services, cafes, rest parking lots, motels and hotels on the M4 highway.  First-aid posts, unfortunately, come across much less frequently than DPS posts. </p><p>  For traffic safety, the M4 highway is checked not only by security cameras that transmit signals to road service points, but also by inspections of cars and personal property of passengers and drivers.  All this is carried out to suppress the possible transport of smuggled or prohibited goods. </p><h2>  Infrastructure M4 </h2><p>  When drivers think about <span>where to stay for the night on the M4 highway,</span> they expect to find a place with delicious home-made food, a clean comfortable room with a soft and comfortable bed. </p><p>  Not all places along the route from Moscow to Novorossiysk can be proudly called a hotel, motel or hotel.  According to drivers, there are a lot of places designed for the fact that a tired driver will not be fastidious and demanding, and passengers are here today, tomorrow there, so they can not be called serious customers. </p><p>  But there are a number of leisure establishments that are pleasant to visit more than once, and they always have guests. </p><h2>  Motels in the Tula region </h2><p>  On the territory of the Tula region there are several establishments for recreation that deserve the attention of motorists.  Motels are located not far from each other, providing travelers with not only hot water and a toilet, but also comfort, attention and care. </p><p>  At the 238th km is the Ryabinushka hotel complex.  Here motorists can regain their strength in a Russian steam room, and then take their souls to a game of billiards after a delicious meal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov highway M4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/980212.jpg" width="600"></div>  A large cafe provides a wide selection of dishes at an affordable price; there is a car service in the complex where you can tidy up the car.  Laundry allows you to put things in order, and the staff tries to ensure that every vacationer leaves the hotel rested, refreshed and alert.

    <p>  1-4-bed rooms have all the amenities for a comfortable sleep and pastime. </p><p>  On the 241st km of the road, the Rus Motel is located, which also takes customers' needs seriously.  Here you can not only stay for an overnight stay, but also just take a shower and have a bite to those who are in a hurry. </p><p>  Bright and comfortable rooms with all amenities, a Russian bathhouse, a wide variety of home-made dishes make the Rus Motel a pleasant place where you want to return again. </p><h2>  Motels in the Lipetsk region </h2><p>  In the Lipetsk region, the M4 highway will also please drivers.  The Pearl and Airplane hotels located here have their own zest, well known to experienced travelers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="track m4 motels" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/979282.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main ‚Äútrick" of the Pearl is that it is located behind a small forest, which creates the illusion that the track is somewhere far away.  There is a cafe with home cooking around the clock (borsch, noodles, okroshka in the summer, fries, chops and much more).  The rooms are double, with separate amenities, triple, with toilet and shower on the floor.  Upholstered furniture, clean linen, a TV and a round-the-clock bar give the driver the opportunity to sleep, and passengers have a good time. </p><p>  The real An-24 is the face of the hotel complex "Airplane".  The institution is successful due to delicious and inexpensive cuisine, comfortable rooms, a beautifully landscaped area with flower beds and a fountain.  Here you can listen to live music and sleep well. </p><h2>  Motels in the Voronezh region </h2><p>  Voronezh highway <span>M4, the motels of</span> which are located from the 477th to the 679th kilometer, has in its collection the Galkino hotel complex with a wide range of services.  In this world of coziness and comfort there is a swimming pool, upholstered furniture, which guarantees a good sleep, delicious food, a sauna and billiards.  What else does a tired traveler need for a good rest? </p><p>  Hotel "Maximum" on the 518th km of the highway fully lives up to its name.  Modern comfortable rooms, each with its own style, good food, a sauna, high-quality upholstered furniture - all this creates the desire to come here again and again to relax. </p><h2>  Motels in the Rostov region </h2><p>  The Rostov M4 highway offers lovers of bikes and rock, and not only them, a surprisingly comfortable and decent cafe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highway m4 refueling" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/979271.jpg" width="600"></div>  You can say about this place that it has everything to have a good rest, eat well and tasty, put in order itself and transport, and all this in a bike-rocker style.  I remember not only the original motel, but also its wonderful staff.

    <p>  For travelers who want to not just spend the night and leave, but have a good rest, the M4 highway (Rostov Region is one of those that it crosses) offers the White House Hotel.  Here everyone can choose a cottage to their liking or just a room in it, eat homemade dishes, and you can order everything in advance, so that hot and tasty food will be waiting for customers upon arrival.  Clean cozy houses from a log house at an affordable price allow you to not only spend the night here, but also fully rest for several days. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Among the holy places that you can visit while driving along the M4 highway, it is worth noting the Kostomarovsky Women's Cave Monastery and the Divnogorsky Assumption Monastery for men.  Those who want to enjoy the beauty of nature will forever remember the mysterious dolmens in the Krasnodar Territory, which are more than 6000 years old, and waterfalls on the river Janet. </p>
