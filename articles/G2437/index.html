At first glance, it seems that organizing it is quite simple.  However, a couple in love can immediately face financial problems: where to get money for the wedding? </p><h2>  Plan development </h2><p>  If for couples who work and have regular earnings, organizing a wedding will not be a particular problem, then for young newlyweds, students who recently got a job, the problem of where to find money for the wedding is relevant. </p><p>  Experienced specialists recommend calculating the estimated costs at the initial stage.  To do this, it is advisable to draw up a detailed plan in which to reflect the wishes, the number of guests, the venue of wedding events and other significant aspects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="attorneyatlawmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wedding Cost Calculation" class="if uuid-3053081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3053081.jpg"></div><p>  After that, you need to explore the proposals that are available in those places where wedding events will be held.  Get information on existing prices for services, which, as a rule, include: </p><ul><li>  Car rent; </li><li>  banqueting hall; </li><li>  toastmaster; </li><li>  musicians; </li><li>  photographer; </li><li>  hairdressers, etc. </li></ul><p>  Only after future newlyweds determine the amount that the planned solemn event will cost, is it worth starting the budget formation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Currently, there are a number of ways to help you find money for your wedding.  Some of them are given below. </p><h2>  Independent earnings </h2><p>  It is usually difficult to predict in advance how much a future wedding will cost.  As a result of this, it is advisable to begin the process of collecting funds long before it takes place.  As a rule, the main expenses are borne by the groom, however, the future bride can help in this matter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alfa.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The joy of the groom from the gift" class="if uuid-3053066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3053066.jpg"></div><p>  If the future husband and wife are working, then by joint efforts to accumulate the necessary amount of money is quite possible.  In this case, and remain indebted to no one.  Therefore, the question of where to get money for the wedding, you need to answer - from your earnings. </p><h2>  Help from parents </h2><p>  A common way to get money for a wedding is help from parents when future newlyweds apply to them with a corresponding request.  At the same time, they provide calculations on the amount of costs that the parents of the bride and groom usually divide in half.  At the same time, it is reasonable to persuade them that the parental expenses will be a wedding present.  With this solution to the issue, the newlyweds will provide themselves with a wonderful holiday.  And gifts will surely follow from friends and family. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Borrow money </h2><p>  The source of where to get the money for the wedding can be friends or relatives.  You can apply for a favor of a certain amount.  At the same time draw up debt receipts indicating the terms of payment.  Subsequently, the debt can be closed at the expense of the donated wedding money. </p><h2>  Piggy bank - a place where to get money for a wedding without a loan </h2><p>  Usually, future newlyweds do not wedding immediately after the decision is made.  This is preceded by the time period in which they live together, recognizing the characteristics of each other.  It can be devoted to saving money in a piggy bank for a future wedding celebration.  Practice shows that a significant amount cannot be collected, however, they may be enough to pay for certain services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Piggy bank for a wedding" class="if uuid-3053072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3053072.jpg"></div><p>  An alternative option to the piggy bank may be a plastic card, on which free funds are periodically deposited.  For the year, the necessary amount for a wedding celebration can be gained. </p><h2>  Help guests </h2><p>  In the modern world, there are also peculiar wedding events, when guests pay for refreshments and festive attributes on their own, as in a restaurant or cafe.  In this case, the wedding banquet takes place at home, outdoors or in a restaurant.  From the point of view of economy, this option is optimal.  The problem of where to get money for the wedding disappears. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kvirispalitra.ge" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wedding and money are interconnected" class="if uuid-3053085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3053085.jpg"></div><p>  However, the older generation (parents) is unlikely to approve.  They prefer a classic wedding, with a rich feast and all relatives sitting at the table. </p><h2>  Investments </h2><p>  If the future spouses are specialists in the field of buying and selling shares (traders) and if the wedding is planned not in the near future, but in one and a half to two years, then you can invest in the available funds.  However, thoughtlessly buying stocks is a rather dangerous undertaking, since you can be left without money.  And you have to forget about the wedding. </p><p>  One of the options for investing may be the acquisition of currency, taking into account the fact that over time its value in ruble terms only increases. </p><h2>  Realization of Valuables </h2><p>  For some newlyweds, this option is the only solution.  In this case, some material values ‚Äã‚Äãare sold.  And the proceeds go to a wedding celebration.  Typically, the objects of sale are antiques, real estate, vehicles, etc. </p><h2>  Wedding loan </h2><p>  One of the options for obtaining the necessary amount of money is a loan at a banking institution.  In this case, you can consider some of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.advisorsmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loans for newlyweds" class="if uuid-3053078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3053078.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Target loan.  Quite a lot of banks provide a service for issuing a loan (loan) for a wedding.  It is called targeted.  The advantage is that the service is provided for a fairly short period with minimal coordination.  The requirements for the borrower in this case are less stringent.  Cash can be received in a short time, usually within three to five days.  Typically, such loans from banks have fairly low interest rates.  To obtain a loan, you need a certificate from the registry office, which indicates the fact of the application. </li><li>  Consumer loan.  A loan in a classical form is also a worthy option for obtaining the necessary funds.  Moreover, its design speed is quite high.  Loan amounts are usually enough for all wedding events.  During its execution there are no requirements for the submission of additional documents.  If a consumer loan is secured, then the amount of funds given in debt will be much higher.  Therefore, the option to get money for the wedding on bail may be considered more preferable. </li><li>  Loan at the MFC.  It is possible to get the necessary funds quickly and without going to banks.  There, as a rule, money is allocated during the day by transferring to an account or to a bank card.  However, interest rates on loans at the MFC are significantly higher than at banks, and the term for repayment of the debt is short, usually two to three months. </li></ol><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of loans </h2><p>  If the newlyweds come to the decision that they need to take a wedding loan, then they should first consider the options for repaying the debt, evaluating all the advantages and disadvantages of their act. </p><div class="photo" data-original="themaineventcolorado.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The joy of the bride from the gift" class="if uuid-3053060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3053060.jpg"></div><p>  Positive aspects of the loan: </p><ol><li>  Parents and relatives, of course, will try to help the newlyweds in solving problems with paying for weddings, even if they themselves have financial problems.  However, in case of taking a loan, the borrowed funds for the wedding save future spouses from moral inconvenience to their relatives. </li><li>  Bank loans for wedding events are issued in cash and in significant amounts, which will pay all costs.  In this case, the wedding does not have to be postponed for a long period, and the organization of the celebration is feasible in a short time. </li><li>  Significant amounts of credit debt can be repaid at the expense of funds received in the form of cash gifts from guests.  As a result, there is no need to worry about upcoming loan payments. </li></ol><p>  Negative points: </p><ul><li>  borrowed funds in the form of a loan will have to be paid with interest, as a rule, these are quite large amounts; </li><li>  taking a loan imposes on the newlyweds the obligation to constantly monitor payments to exclude delinquency in payments; </li><li>  the presence of debt obligations from the first days of married life can be an unpleasant factor for the start of cohabitation. </li></ul><h2>  Crowdfunding platform </h2><p>  One of the solutions to the problem of where to get money for the wedding is to collect it using crowdfunding. </p><p>  Currently, on the Internet there are a sufficient number of different sites (sites), which raise funds for a variety of purposes, including weddings.  In this case, future newlyweds need to get their own pages.  They should inform about their problems, explain the reasons for seeking help, indicate the requested amounts, terms and details for transfer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="majestic.events" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wedding and money" class="if uuid-3052976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102597/3052976.jpg"></div><p>  Practice shows that there are enough people in the world who are ready to assist in allocating the necessary amounts so that loving hearts reunite in marriage. </p><p>  From the above it follows that to solve the problem of where to get money for organizing a wedding event, you need to be purely individual.  However, during the whole process of organizing the event, one should not forget about the main thing - excellent relations that united future newlyweds. </p>
