Hotels in Ayia Napa (Cyprus)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among young people, the Cypriot beach Nissi <span>Beach has</span> recently been extremely popular <span>.</span>  <span>Hotels</span> located near the sea are in great demand.  Every year young people come here from all over Europe who want to not only relax on the sea, but also have fun. </p><h2>  Nissi Beach </h2><p>  Hotels located along the sea are most convenient for relaxation.  They are suitable not only for couples with children, people aged, but also for young people who strive to always be aware of what is happening on the local beach.  The fact is that in the summer, Nissi Beach turns into a party place.  Summer is a time of foamy discos and DJs. </p><p>  It is for this reason that the hotels on the Nissi Beach are so popular among those who already have 16, but have not yet turned 50. What could be better than living by the sea and participating in all the holidays being in the center of events. </p><p>  On the ‚ÄúNissi Beach‚Äù (hotels located in the immediate vicinity, we will discuss further) amazing blue water and white silk sand.  No one will be bored here: there are catamarans, bananas, and parachutes. </p><p>  I would like to note that the eastern part of the Nissi Beach bay itself is smaller, and therefore perfect for vacationers with children.  But the noisy western Nissi Beach will surely appeal to more active and young tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nissi Beach Hotels" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1357365.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the summer, at the height of the season, it is better to arrive early.  At this time, a slight breeze from the sea is felt, vacationers enjoy calm warm water.  And by noon, the south-west wind, as a rule, picks up waves, on which it is so fun to jump.  Fortunately, the weather in Ayia Napa never lets tourists down, pleasing with warmth and sun. </p><h2>  Hotel Nissi Beach <strong></strong></h2><p>  A great place for a summer vacation can be Cyprus.  Hotel "Nissi Beach" 4 * is always very popular among tourists.  This is due to its advantageous location. </p><p>  Not every hotel can boast that it is located on the Mediterranean coast.
