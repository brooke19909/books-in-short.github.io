    <h2>  Opinion on the location and own territory of the hotel </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, you can get from the airport to the hotel in about an hour and a half (taking into account the arrival of the bus to other hotels).  Many tourists note the very comfortable climate of Kusadasi.  So the rest here will be not only pleasant, but also good for health.  In the vicinity of Alish Hotel 4 * there are mainly small hotels and villas.  Everything here is surrounded by greenery and flowers, so it is very pleasant to walk around the district.  Near the hotel there is a supermarket where you can buy everything you need, and a bus stop.  Shopping centers and a bazaar are also nearby.  A great advantage of this place is its relative proximity to one of the main attractions of Turkey - the ancient <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Ephesus.</span>  You can get to it even by minibus.  By the way, many tourists who come here often do this in order to visit Ephesus, while not spending a few hours on the road. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The territory of Alish is very compact.  So, in addition to the residential building and the spa center, there is a swimming pool, an outdoor restaurant terrace, a green lawn, a small sun terrace, a bar and a small playground with a couple of swings. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews on housing stock Alish Hotel 4 * (Kusadasi) </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, due to the fact that the hotel is quite new, everything here is fresh and in good condition.  The rooms seemed small, and the bathrooms were a bit cramped.  However, this does not cause any inconvenience.  However, those who lived in family-type rooms claim that the bathrooms in their apartments were very spacious, and in addition to the shower, they also had a jacuzzi. </p><p>  Each room, according to guests, has a furnished balcony (in some apartments there are even two).  Wi-Fi signal in most rooms is weak.  If you need good internet, you can use it in the lobby.  According to our compatriots, there are two Russian-language channels on TV.  So, if you wish, you can always watch the news and programs.  The apartments have a fairly large safe (installed in the closet).  It is easy to put not only money and passports into it, but also tablets if necessary.  You can use it for free. </p><p>  As for cleaning the rooms of the Alish Hotel 4 * (Kusadasi), it is carried out every day.  Towels are also changed regularly.  However, according to the guests, sometimes the maids for some reason forgot to clean some rooms.  But in this case, the reception can quickly solve the problem. </p>

    <h2>  Impression of food and hotel staff </h2><p>  The Alish Hotel's restaurant has both an indoor room and a terrace with outdoor tables.  In the midst of the season, according to some tourists, it can be difficult to find a free spot.  As for the food itself, on the whole the guests were satisfied with it.  According to them, there were few meat dishes: most often on the menu were chicken, turkey and fish.  Also, always on the table were a variety of side dishes, snacks, fresh fruits and vegetables, excellent pastries and sweets.  In general, according to most tourists, food here is without frills, but you will not remain hungry and dissatisfied. </p><p>  As for the personnel of Alish Hotel 4 *, according to the statement of vacationers from our country, there are practically no Russian-speaking employees here.  Therefore, it is desirable to have a basic knowledge of English or Turkish.  From time to time, a Russian-speaking representative of a travel agency is present at the hotel, so if necessary, you can try to resolve any issues with its help. </p><p>  In general, the staff at the hotel, according to tourists, is good: everyone is kind and attentive.  Especially the guests praised the waiters and bartenders.  According to them, they did an excellent job with their work.  Receptionists at the front desk always try to accommodate guests faster, realizing that they are tired after flying and traveling from the airport.  As for the animators, travelers positively respond only to one of them.  The rest, in their opinion, did not really strive to entertain holidaymakers with high quality. </p><h2>  Comments on beach vacations and entertainment at the Alish Hotel </h2><p>  According to the guests, you can walk to your own Alish Hotel 4 * beach (Kusadasi) in just ten minutes at a leisurely pace.  It is small, but sun loungers and umbrellas, as a rule, are enough for everyone here.  There is a shower.  The beach is clean enough, the sand is shallow, the entry into the water is gentle.  Between the beach and the hotel there is a small water park where you can have a good time.  <span>Beach towels are</span> provided and changed at the hotel free of charge (contact the spa for this).  Some guests complained that there was no bar on the beach. </p><p>  As for entertainment at the hotel, for example, adult animation among most guests did not cause much enthusiasm.  Children, according to tourists, were entertained very well. </p><p>  Many guests of Alish Hotel 4 * were pleased with the fact that the hotel had a spa center.  A sauna is also included.  Many guests also praise the local hammam and excellent massage. </p>
