This settlement was not always an island.  He became him in 1956 after the Kama reservoir was opened.  After this event, many residents left the city, because you can get to it on the ship, which departs from the <span>river station of Kazan.</span>  A few years ago, the construction of the bulk road began, which continues to this day.  The city has a rich history, which is reflected in the monuments and buildings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions of sviyazhsk" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/318547.jpg" width="600"></div>  The sights of Sviyazhsk, despite everything, attract a huge number of tourists.  And you can really see a lot in this city.

    <h2>  The main attraction of the city </h2><p>  Sights of Sviyazhsk are, first of all, <span>historical and architectural monuments of the</span> 16-19th centuries.  The main ones are <span>monasteries: the female</span> John the Baptist and the male Assumption-Virgin Mary.  They rise in the western part of the island and are quite visible from the right coast of Sviyaga, where the Kazan sports and fitness complex is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sviyazhsk sights 2013" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/318549.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Churches that make up the monastery </h2><p>  Continuing to consider the sights of Sviyazhsk, you can dwell in more detail on the three churches included in the architectural complex of the monastery.  Trinity Church is the only wooden structure preserved from the fortress of Ivan the Terrible.  Here, every corner, every log is saturated with history.  Even a simple bench may turn out to be the one on which Grozny himself was sitting.  The main value of the temple is a fresco, which depicts <span>St. Christopher</span> with a horse's head.  There are many legends around <span>this fresco</span> , one of which tells about a handsome young man who was constantly tempted.  To save himself from many sins, he asked the higher powers to make themselves ugly.  The church cast doubt on this legend, so the Trinity Monastery is practically the only place where such a fresco has been preserved. </p><p>  Sviyazhka sights include in their list the second church of the complex, Sergievskaya.  It is the first stone building in the monastery, which was erected in the 17th century.  In the central part of the monastery complex stands the third temple - the cathedral of the icon of All Sorrows of Joy.  It was built in the 19th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sviyazhsk sights" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/318548.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But this is not all that the island of Sviyazhsk can offer for inspection to its guests.  Sights include 21 federal monuments on their list.  Agree, a lot for such a tiny territory.  One cannot fail to note such a magnificent building as the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin, built in the 16th century.  Its main value is not architecture, but frescoes on the wall.  The church of Konstantin and Elena, built in the 16th century, has still survived from ancient architectural structures. </p><h2>  Other sights of Sviyazhsk </h2><p>  What else to see when arriving in the city of Sviyazhsk?  Sights (excursions confirm this in 2013) are also modern buildings.  It is interesting to walk along the River Station.  A variety of walks is available at the information center.  In addition, there are several museums in the city that will also be of interest to guests. </p>
