    <p>  Vacationers highly appreciate the hydromassage provided at the hotel (thalassocenter).  The effect after it, according to reviews, is excellent.  Guests are enthusiastic about the fitness program for 4 days in thalasso, which includes: massage, body wraps, hydrotherapy.  Here, any day you can use the sauna and swimming pool with sea water.  During the break between the procedures, the client is brought delicious green tea.  The authors of the reviews advise everyone who wants to visit the center to immediately find out exactly how this or that procedure will take place, so as not to get scared.  For example, the pressotherapy procedure is as follows: a <span>"cosmonaut costume" is</span> put on the client <span>,</span> which begins to be pumped up at various points with the help of a pump.  In the first session, uninformed visitors are scared. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel provides natural, rich, tasty, varied food.  Lots of fruits, yogurts.  Vacationers note especially delicious pilaf, paella, meat, turkey sausages, fish, various side dishes, wonderful soups.  They also serve freshly squeezed juices, ice cream, and alcohol - wine (three types), whiskey, gin, and vodka. </p><p>  Alcoholic beverages, according to vacationers, are saved here: they pour wine in half a glass.  If you want to drink more, you have to go through the entire hall and stand in line for one more half.  If you ask to pour a full glass, most likely you can get a refusal.  Russian tourists such a position regarding the dosage of alcohol is very incomprehensible. </p><p>  Another important detail.  According to vacationers, in the rooms the water flowing from the tap is salty, "almost like in the sea."  Salt water from the tap is also poured into titanium for tea.  For those who cannot live without tea, tourists are advised to bring a boiler with them.  It will be possible to draw water from the cooler (there it is unsalted) and boil in the room. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The hotel has a large, clean and well-groomed, green area.  In the evening, lights are lit along the tracks, you can take a walk with pleasure.  Hotel vacationers call the place where life is in full swing, referring to bars, restaurants and a disco working on the territory. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  But the beach, as vacationers say, is dirty.  The sea, in their opinion, is shallow, but for small children it is very convenient.  To get to the present depth, you need to walk 60-80 m, to the very buoys. </p><p>  Many sunbeds, as noted by vacationers, are broken.  They should be taken from 6.30, because at 9.00 it is already difficult to find free.  Sometimes there is no umbrella above the sunbed, however, you can still lie under a canopy. </p><p>  In the evening, at about five, workers begin to collect inventory.  ‚ÄúYou are sunbathing,‚Äù the guests complain, ‚Äúand the servants carry loungers past you.  It seems that you are being expelled from here.  It‚Äôs unpleasant when the sand is flying at you, and the workers rush past with such speed, as if evacuation has been announced. ‚Äù  And in the morning, vacationers have to carry these same sunbeds along the beach.  "Why have they been collected since the evening?"  - vacationers ask. </p><p>  At night, the gate to the beach closes with a castle.  Guests have no opportunity to sit by the sea under the stars. </p><p>  The mood is spoiled by jellyfish, which usually appear in the evening.  If someone gets stung by a jellyfish, you need to rub the problem area with a tomato.  The burn will pass the next day. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><ul><li>  <em>Zoo.</em>  The authors of the reviews advise to visit excursions, visit the zoo, having previously stocked up fruits for treating animals.  The zoo in Sousse is huge, the impression is extraordinary.  All African animals are represented here. </li><li>  <em>Sea fishing.</em>  An adventure that allows tourists to "understand what happiness is."  The happiness, according to some vacationers, is to go fishing for about five hours, catch a bunch of small fish, then treat yourself to the world's most delicious watermelon, and stand on the boat ladder, holding on to the handrails tightly, feeling splashes of sea water on your face. </li><li>  <em>Carthage.</em>  According to many, this is another "real Tunisian happiness."  You can‚Äôt go to Tunisia and not see Carthage, they say.  The tour is not tiring.  The presentation of information always depends on the guide.  Mostly excursions are conducted by true experts in their field. </li><li> <em>Sidi Bou Said.</em>  Another amazingly beautiful town, which, according to the authors of the reviews, should definitely be visited.  Many regret that this tour does not have enough time - 1 hour.  Tourists during this time do not have time to get around all the narrow alleys of the city, to consider the beautiful doors and shutters. </li><li>  <em>Sahara.</em>  Many do not find words to describe it.  Everyone should go and see her in person, say the authors of the reviews.  These places, in their expression, are ‚Äúcompletely outlandish," they just don't get tired of being amazed: Mat Mata, oases, El Jem, Kairouan, growing pomegranates, berbers, salt lakes and much more. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel tour knalef marhaba thalasso" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/1431212.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Animation </h2><p>  As vacationers evaluate, the animators are great here: they are trying hard, a friendly team of guys.  The animation in the hotel is varied: exercises on the beach, water aerobics, evening shows.  Sometimes they arrange magnificent fire shows, after which everyone bathes at night in the pool.  There is a night disco.  You don‚Äôt have to get bored. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  According to the authors of the reviews, the hotel staff is very friendly, welcoming.  The rooms are cleaned regularly, towels are changed, the territory is cleaned in good faith. </p><p>  A lot of reviews contain information that hotel employees in Tunisia are not good with Russians.  But the same can be read or heard about Egypt and Turkey.  Many reviewers draw attention to the insufficiently high level of culture of our tourists: they forget to say hello, thank, show excessive claims, allow themselves to be rudeness towards staff and other guests.  In this regard, experienced travelers are ready to give future guests of Sousse an excellent recommendation, tested by experience.  They advise their fellow citizens not to forget that, wherever they are, those around them will relate to them the way they relate to people. </p><p>  And many more tourists are outraged that some vacationers complain about the dirt and riots in Tunisia.  But it is well known that poverty and devastation reign in the country.  Those who value luxury and comfort, they say, should not go to Tunisia.  They should choose European countries for recreation, but they should be prepared for the fact that the cost of recreation will be completely different. </p><p>  According to the authors of the reviews, Tour Khalef Marhaba Thalasso in terms of quality of service can compete with many analogues with 5 stars. </p>
