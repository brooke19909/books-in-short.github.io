    <h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  The historical city center, where the city's attractions are located, such as the Hermitage, the Summer Garden, the cathedrals: Kazan and the Savior on Spilled Blood, also includes the Majestic Hotel (St. Petersburg).  Near the hotel there is Nevsky Prospekt, on which city guests love to walk.  Opposite the hotel you can see another attraction - Gostiny Dvor.  Staying at the hotel, you will find yourself in the center of the cultural life of the city, which will help you plan your vacation and spend your time in the Northern capital of Russia. </p><h2>  A small historical background </h2><p>  Majestic, a deluxe boutique hotel (St. Petersburg), was opened in 2015. It is located in a building dating back to the 18th century.  The original architect sank into oblivion, his name did not reach our times.  The building was made in the style of classicism.  The history of this building is quite interesting.  It changed the owners several times, while the purpose of the building changed, but one detail remained unchanged - the building was the center of the cultural life of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Its first owners were Korovin and Gavrilov.  The room was allocated for a tenement house.  Soon after, Nemenchinsky (a famous restaurateur of that time) rented part of the building with the goal of opening his own restaurant.  This restaurant was named in the same way as the shopping arcade of Empress Elizabeth - ‚ÄúGostiny Dvor‚Äù.  In the establishment, merchants of the Gostiny Dvor became regular customers.  After some time, the restaurant was renamed, it could be found under the name ‚ÄúSuite‚Äù. </p><p>  The reconstruction of the house in 1847 was undertaken by the architect Robin.  The building has acquired a new, more interesting appearance.  Half a century later, the restaurant was sold to the first partnership of waiters and cooks in the city.  This happened due to the bankruptcy of its previous owner.  And a new redevelopment - in 1910, engineer Gavrilov provided for the decoration of the building with a grand staircase to give the room elegance. </p><p>  The nationalization of the institution in 1931 led to another change of name.  Metropol appeared, whose clients were party leaders and the country's elite.  Often the restaurant was visited by Leonid Brezhnev himself. </p><p>  Soviet time was a period of innovation.  The confectionery ‚ÄúMetropol‚Äù is located in the room.  All the townspeople were familiar with the delicious confectionery products produced at the Metropol.  Cakes and pastries have become a kind of symbol of Peter, part of his gastronomic culture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="majestic hotel spb" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43719/1433086.jpg" width="600"></div>
