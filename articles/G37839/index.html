  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coins of 1812. Cost and appearance</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, due to strong inflation in the Russian Empire, the rate of the paper ruble plummeted to 20 metal kopecks.  The Ministry of Finance was forced to take extreme measures.  The country has increased all types of taxes.  The issue of paper notes was completely discontinued.  They began to gradually withdraw from circulation.  Excess money supply was destroyed.  All transactions were recommended using coins.  For all denominations of copper coins, the stop was increased one and a half times (24 rubles from the pound).  It was forbidden to import foreign currency into the country.  These measures helped to stabilize the ruble and reduce the cash deficit in the treasury before the Patriotic War of 1812. </p><h2>  Coins of Alexander the First </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trial release" class="if uuid-2626852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88575/2626852.jpg"></div><p>  During the reign of Emperor Alexander the First, a record number of silver coins were issued.  In 1807, the construction of the <span>mint was</span> completed in St. Petersburg <span>.</span>  It was equipped with the most modern English equipment.  New coins were different from old ones.  When <span>minting, the coins</span> were placed in a smooth ring.  The emperor refused to decorate the coins with his image.  Trial issues of three types of portrait coins were made.  But not one of the sketches with the <span>portrait of Alexander the First</span> was approved.  Instead, coins with the image of a double-headed eagle were approved.  From gold coins of 5 and 10 rubles were printed.  They depicted four patterned shields and the Russian coat of arms in the middle.  The cost of the coin of 1812 (5 rubles) is from 68 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  1 ruble of 1812 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Silver coin" class="if uuid-2626869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88575/2626869.jpg"></div><p>  The coin is made of silver of the 868th test.  In the center of the obverse of the coin is the emblem of the Russian Empire.  The shape of the wings and tail of the double-headed eagle has changed slightly compared to old coins.  Under the paws of the bird are the initials of the Mitzmaster Fedor Gelman.  The numbers -1812 are stamped below.  There are two inscriptions ‚ÄúCoin‚Äù and ‚ÄúRuble‚Äù around the coat of arms.  The inscriptions are separated from each other by six-pointed stars.  Relief elements were made in the form of teeth.  On the reverse in the center the inscription ‚ÄúState Russian coin ruble‚Äù. Later it was replaced by an indication of the mass of silver.  Under the inscription is the designation of the St. Petersburg Mint.  A crown is located above the inscription.  On the edges of the laurel wreath, at the bottom tied with a ribbon.  Some coins have traces of date etching.  The cost of the coin of 1812 is from 3 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Half and Half </h2><p>  These are coins worth half and a quarter ruble.  Their design was almost no different from the appearance of the ruble coin.  The cost of coins of the war of 1812 is from 3 thousand rubles. </p>
