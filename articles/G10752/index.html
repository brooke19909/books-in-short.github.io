Other marble lakes of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Once upon a time there was a mountain.  Now there is still clean air, blue sky during the day, at night starbursts overhead, and under this splendor - a canyon, the result of human intervention.  It is about the Marmara Lake in Karelia.  Although this is not the only body of water in Russia that has such a name. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The landscape of these places is pleasing to the eye.  The mind forgets about all the worries and seeks to explore every detail of the landscape.  The canyon rises about 20 meters above the clear water surface of an amazing emerald color.  The white walls of the canyon are dotted with cracks and are constantly changing, because there is high tectonic activity in this place.  Stone rocks are covered with trees, everything around breathes natural wild beauty.  It is incredible that man had a hand in creating this attraction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marble lake" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1151236.jpg" width="600"></div>  Such a wonderful lake is located near the border with Finland in Karelia, twenty kilometers from the village of Ruskeala, in the Sortavala region.  About 300 km from St. Petersburg on the A-130 highway, the path by car can be overcome in 4-5 hours.  The last section of the <span>road is dirt,</span> winding and goes through the forest.  To overcome this last distance is also an adventure, according to the reviews of tourists who visited there.  But they do not regret it at all.

And the first data on the small settlement that appeared here date back to 1500.  Then these places belonged to the Swedes, who began to extract marble.  By 1632, the village had grown so much that a church was built. </p><p>  After the conclusion of the <span>Nishtadt peace, the</span> area began to be populated by Russians.  Development all this time was not very active.  Marble was then mined for laying foundations and burning building lime. </p>

The village pastor Samuel Alopeus invited experts from the Academy of Arts to study samples of marble mined on the Ruskolka River.  Marble aroused admiration, and it was necessary for the implementation of royal projects in large numbers.  Therefore, since 1768, the quarry expanded, and mining went at an accelerated pace.  Builders, architects, <span>mining engineers</span> gathered here <span>, the</span> village flourished.  In the same year, the construction of St. Isaac's Cathedral was begun.  The well-known <span>architect Montferrand</span> personally came to Ruskealu to select marble for cladding the floor and walls of the church.

And also for facing the windows of the Kazan Cathedral and the Marble Palace, facing the facade of the <span>Mikhailovsky Castle.</span>  Marble was used to build an obelisk for the victories of Rumyantsev and the pedestal of the monument to Peter I, the Oryol Gate, the <span>Chesme column</span> and the pedestal of the Chesmensky obelisk, for the columns of the Gatchina Palace, the windowsills of the Hermitage were also made from it.  The most recent projects that used Ruskeala raw materials were the building of the Savings Bank in Helsinki and in St. Petersburg in Soviet times, the Primorskaya and Ladozhskaya metro stations. </p><p>  These are the fruits of the amazing union of human labor and nature.  We have many cultural monuments and a great place on earth.  But so far it has not been said how the quarry turned into Lake of Marmara.  There are two versions.  One at a time, the Finns, leaving here, flooded the mines, which served as their refuge in the war.  According to another version, groundwater was opened during development, and even the elements did their job. </p><h2>  Things to do on Marmara Lake </h2><p>  Now here is the "Ruskeala Mountain Park", well equipped to receive guests.  And Marmara Lake is part of it.  Here you can romantically stroll along the shore or go to explore the grottoes on the surface of the water on a boat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marble lake photo" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1151280.jpg" width="600"></div>  Or, loudly reporting on their impressions, jump from a bungee, or try to cross from shore to shore using the "Indian Bridge".  Of course, the flooded adits are of interest to divers who are frequent visitors here.  And in winter, special entertainment is offered - an ice rink in a cave, illuminated by multi-colored lamps.

    <h2>  Marble Lakes of Russia </h2><p>  The Marmara Lake in Karelia is not the only body of water in Russia that has such a name.  In the Krasnoyarsk Territory, in Ergaki, not far from the waterfall of the same name, there is a second such lake.  The third Marmara lake can be seen only once a year, because there are ongoing developments.  This one is on Open Day. </p>
