One of them is an ancient city located in the Yaroslavl region.  Tourists will not be bored here - many attractions of Rybinsk will allow spending leisure time with interest and benefit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sobory.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rybinsk - weekend excursions" class="if uuid-2458924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2458924.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  The city of Rybinsk is a symbiosis of several small villages, which are also called neighborhoods.  The population of the town is a little more than two hundred thousand people.  Rybinsk is conveniently located at the confluence of the Volga, Cheremukha and Sheksna rivers. </p><p>  Tourists are offered walking excursions with a visit to the Rybinsk Museum-Reserve, the historical center of the city, where you can see architectural structures dated from the eighteenth to the twentieth century. </p><p>  In addition, the city has memorable places of the famous Russian poet <span>Lev Oshanin,</span> a large private collection of Musin-Pushkin is stored here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mulierchile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Rybinsk" class="if uuid-2458907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2458907.jpg"></div><p>  Residents of the city like to spend days off on the shore of the reservoir - this place is a haven for fishermen, especially since there are plenty of fish here.  Everyone can get all the necessary equipment at recreation centers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For those who are not fond of fishing, they offer weekend excursions in Rybinsk, during which you can go around all the historical places of the town. </p><h2>  Fire Tower </h2><p>  2012 was another round date for the fire tower of Rybinsk - it turned one hundred years old.  This forty-eight-meter building is one of the tallest in Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="da.advisor.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rybinsk Museum-Reserve" class="if uuid-2458914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2458914.jpg"></div><p>  It began its history on the corner of Theater Square and Stoyalnaya Street in 1841, when a stone building of the police station was built on this place, which later became the basis of a wooden superstructure - a tower.  The latter was erected two years later, the project was provided by the architect P. Ya. Pankov. </p><p>  The fire of 1907 destroyed a wooden tower, seizing at the same time the archive of the police station.  The fire occurred due to the workers themselves, who threw a smoldering cigarette butt into the bin.  All newspapers of the Yaroslavl province laughed at the mountain firemen. </p><p>  The new history of Kalancha, which is now a landmark of Rybinsk, began in the late summer of 1912, when in just a year, a new Art Nouveau building was constructed from monolithic reinforced concrete, designed by architect I.K.  The idea was implemented by a Rybinsk contractor, engineer Stepan Buketov. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Monuments of Rybinsk </h2><p>  One of the memorable places is the monument to <span>Ludwig Nobel,</span> which was opened in the middle of summer 2013.  The sculpture is dedicated to the scientist, Russian and Swedish engineer, philanthropist, older brother and business partner of the founder of the Nobel Prize Alfred Nobel. </p><p>  The construction of the monument is connected with the fact that the activities of the Nobels for the most part took place precisely in the Yaroslavl province - the brothers‚Äôs oil refinery and the largest oil base on the Upper Volga functioned in Rybinsk. </p><p>  The initiative to erect the first monument in Russia to Ludwig Nobel belongs to the foundation of his name.  The author of the pedestal in the green zone of the city near Cathedral Square was the sculptor from Moscow Yaroslav Borodin.  Later, an alley of Nobel laureates was defeated nearby. </p><p>  Near the monument, tourists can visit the house of artists.  In Rybinsk, he is one of the visited places. </p><p>  There is another sculpture in the city - a bronze monument to the songwriter L. I. Oshanin.  It is installed on the observation deck of the Volga embankment and opened in 2003.  The poet is an honorary citizen of the city.  The author of the monument is the laureate of the Yaroslavl Region Prize M. M. Nurmatov. </p><h2>  Bread exchange </h2><p>  Another historical attraction of Rybinsk, which residents are proud of, is the new magnificent building of the bread exchange, erected in 1912 according to the project of the Moscow Kremlin architect A.V. Ivanov in the neo-Russian style. </p><p>  The building was erected on the site of the old exchange.  The reason for the update was an increase in its credibility in the trading circles of Russia.  Higher government agencies have repeatedly requested the opinion of the exchange committee on emerging economic issues. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mologa village on the Rybinsk reservoir" class="if uuid-2458921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2458921.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, the Rybinsk Museum of Art and the Historical and Architectural Museum are located inside the building. </p><h2>  Russian Atlantis </h2><p>  This mysterious name is called the ghost town of Molog, whose ruins periodically appear above the surface of the Rybinsk reservoir.  He disappeared from the face of the earth for almost sixty years ago as a result of flooding in connection with the construction of the dam. </p><p>  The first mention of the settlement is found in ancient chronicles of the twelfth century, and in the fourteenth it already became the center of the principality with the largest fair in Europe.  In the eighteenth century, Mologa became a city.  Two hundred years later, there were about one thousand houses and five thousand people in the city. </p><p>  In the city were built two cathedrals - Epiphany and Resurrection, three churches - Resurrection, All Saints, Vozdvizhenskaya and not far from the city - Afanasyevsky monastery for women.  Libraries and colleges, gymnasiums and parish schools functioned in Mologa.  The city had a cinema, post office, telegraph, hospital, pharmacy, and outpatient clinic.  There were such factories as glutinous and bone-grinding, chemical, brick-making, for the production of berry extracts.  Agricultural production was very well developed. </p><p>  In the summer of 1995, the Museum of the Mologsky Territory was opened, which presents the history of the village of Mologa on the <span>Rybinsk Reservoir.</span> </p><h2>  Cathedrals and churches </h2><p>  The pearl of the historical center is the Transfiguration Cathedral, the basis of which was the wooden church of the Apostle Peter, who was the patron saint of fishermen.  It was built in the seventeenth century and rebuilt in the eighteenth with the addition of a five-tier stone bell tower directed towards the sky. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House of Artists in Rybinsk" class="if uuid-2458919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2458919.jpg"></div><p>  When visiting the cathedral, you can see <span>marble walls</span> and granite floors, stunningly decorated with gilded silver, a four-tier iconostasis with ancient icons.  In the center of the cathedral there is an elegant armchair under a velvet canopy, made by the arrival of Catherine II. </p><p>  Another attraction of Rybinsk is the St. Nicholas Chapel, consecrated in the name of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  It is located on the embankment of the Volga River. </p><p>  The chapel was erected by the headman Eltekov I.I.  in 1867 in honor of the miraculous salvation from the death of Tsar Alexander II in April 1866. </p><p>  In 2010, the St. Nicholas chapel was restored: the main and additional crosses covered with gold leaf were installed in the amount of twelve pieces that adorned the dome of the chapel.  The chapel is a list of objects of excursion routes in Rybinsk. </p><p>  The ensemble is complemented by the church of the Great Martyr George the Victorious with the St. George Cemetery, in which eminent merchants, famous figures, clergy and business leaders are buried.  The author of the temple is still unknown. </p><p>  In Soviet times, the building of the building housed a branch of the State Archive of the Yaroslavl Region, and in May 1991 the church was returned to the community. </p>
