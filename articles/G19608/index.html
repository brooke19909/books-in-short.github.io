    <p>  Further, in terms of luxury, there are apartments called a senior suite, there are 14 of them. Their area is slightly smaller (up to 150 sq. M) and there is no room for a servant.

The view from the windows is just as beautiful and bewitching.  One such room can accommodate 6-8 people at a time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The junior suite rooms, 9 of them in Rixos Bab Al Bahr 5 *, amaze with their beauty and grace.  Reviews about them are also only wonderful, because such a room consists of two bedrooms and three bathrooms.  There is a living room and a huge terrace.  The sea view will exceed all expectations and will forever fall into your memory.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a room is 78 square meters.  m, that is, 4-6 guests can fully accommodate. </p><p>  Most of all, guests with children liked family room apartments with two bedrooms and two bathrooms (although in such rooms the bathroom is equipped with a shower only, while the apartments described above have bathtubs everywhere).  Its own living room, huge king size beds and a terrace (sea, pool or garden view) allow a large family of four or six people to relax in a similar room.  Area - up to 80 square meters.
