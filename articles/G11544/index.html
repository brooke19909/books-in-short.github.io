    <h2>  About the resort </h2><p>  By far, the most popular tourist city is Pattaya: endless sandy beaches, hotels, lots of entertainment for every taste, a comfortable climate - what you will find here.  Of course, do not forget that Thailand is an exotic state.  Yes, tourism is developed here, but the condition of some hotels is far from ideal.  Moreover, often they are radically different from the description provided by the tour operator.  That is why it is necessary to get acquainted with potential accommodation options in advance, read reviews of real vacationers, so that later you do not encounter an unpleasant surprise that can spoil the whole vacation and impression of it.  So, for example, the Land Royal Residence 3 * hotel can hardly be called popular in Pattaya, and all that it opened relatively recently for visiting.  What living conditions can he offer tourists, how do they respond about him?  This is what we will talk about in our material. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Land Royal Residence 3 * Hotel (Pattaya) is a city-style hotel, located in a fairly lively area, close to the center.  It is here that the whole nightlife of the resort is concentrated, so it certainly will not be bored.  Like most other hotels, Land Royal Residence 3 * is removed from the coastline, that is, the beach, is located more than a kilometer from it.  In fact, this feature can hardly be called a drawback, since in Pattaya you basically will not find a hotel located on the coast, all the beaches here are municipal, are public in nature. </p><p>  The hotel opened relatively recently - in 2014, so it boasts a modern interior, new furniture, sanitary ware, which creates the most comfortable conditions for tourists to stay in the hotels Royal Royal Residence 3 * (Pattaya).  The south of Pattaya is the most attractive area for tourists, because it is here that is close at hand to the coast, respectively, the sea and the beach.  Tourists can spend the whole day on the beach or choose for themselves a more informative and active leisure.  Those who want to buy souvenirs and locally made goods will be able to stroll through the night market and the largest shopping centers of the city - they are within walking distance here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Due to the small number of rooms in the hotel, it can be called quite quiet and calm.  A great place for those who, after a day full of excursions, want to stay in peace and tranquility. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Some tourists believe that the location of the hotel is its main drawback.  In fact, it all depends on what kind of vacation you want to receive, in what amount to keep within.  Real vacationers note that remoteness from the sea in this case is insignificant: only 5-10 minutes - and you are on the coast.  Please note that the hotel is located near the famous Walking Street. <strong> </strong>  - A place of accumulation of nightly entertainment, so in the evening here, including on the coast, is quite lively.  But just the remoteness of the hotel from the main street and the beach helps all vacationers to relax and fall asleep in the most comfortable environment for themselves. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Many say that they populate rooms rather quickly, even if tourists arrive somewhat earlier than they should be for rooms.  In the event that the room is not ready, tourists will be offered to use the luggage storage room, offered to wait in a comfortable lobby. </p>

    <p>  The apartments have a small but comfortable balcony with stunning views of the city, some of the rooms are facing the sea, which allows you to enjoy the sound of the surf and enjoy the evening sunset with a glass of aromatic wine.  In fact, there are not so many reviews about the hotel on the Internet, and all because it opened to visitors only two years ago. </p><p>  The room has two twin beds, which if necessary can be moved together.  Things can be placed in a sufficiently large and roomy closet.  The safe is ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù for the safety of personal belongings, documents and money, for Thailand this is actually a familiar phenomenon.  The TV is small, but in order to get to know the news or watch a movie before going to bed, this is quite enough.  In the end, it is unlikely that tourists come to Thailand in order to spend a day in the room. </p><p>  Now for the climate equipment: air conditioning is responsible for the freshness and coolness of the room - it is quite powerful and efficient.  You should be extremely careful, turn it on only as needed, so as not to catch a cold. </p>

    <p>  Tourists will also be pleased with the good condition of the plumbing, the presence of a boiler in each room, which eliminates problems with the supply of hot water. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Land Royal Residence 3 * hotel offers tourists a varied breakfast.  For Thailand, this is traditional rice, meat and cheese slices, sausages, toasts, fruits and vegetables, aromatic coffee, tea, juices.  If you want more fresh fruits and vegetables for breakfast, it is better to arrive early when the table is literally bursting with mango ripe pineapples and watermelon. </p>

    <p>  Of course, after a few days at the hotel, breakfast can be fed up, but you certainly will not stay hungry.  Local restaurants, cafes and bars will help diversify your menu.  Some tourists buy food on the street - tasty and colorful. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The hotel has an indoor pool with cold water.  If you arrive in Thailand during the rainy season, when the sea is raging, you can have a good time at the pool.  Children just love this place. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  During a vacation in Pattaya, many tourists rent bikes - a great way to travel around the city and the opportunity to get acquainted with all its sights, beautiful and interesting places, as well as visit beaches remote from the city.  So, the administration of the Land Royal Residence 3 * hotel provides all vacationers with free parking services on site, so you do not have to worry about the safety of the rented transport. </p><p>  All tourists can count on the 24-hour reception of the Land Royal Residence 3 * hotel.  The reviews of tourists emphasize the courtesy and attentiveness of all the hotel staff, who are ready to come to the aid of tourists, if necessary, to solve the problems encountered, to answer questions related to the organization of leisure, excursion program. </p><p>  And, of course, every tourist will be able to use a luggage storage room.  Why is it necessary?  Everything is extremely simple: flights are not always adapted in such a way that upon arrival a tourist can immediately check into a room.  That is why you can completely safely transfer your luggage to the storage room, without waiting for the room keys, change clothes and go to the beach, since it is not so far here.  Luggage storage of Land Royal Residence 3 * will be a real salvation for those tourists who are forced to leave the room, but are forced to wait a few more hours for a return transfer. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Many tourists sincerely believe that Asian hotels cannot boast of first-class service, such as Turkey or Egypt.  But in fact, this definitely cannot be said about Land Royal Residence 3 *.  Description of the hotel demonstrates good service. </p><p>  First of all, on the territory of the hotel, tourists can use wireless Internet for free - they will receive a password upon check-in.  By the way, the signal is not only enough to exchange messages with relatives and friends, but also to watch movies.  At the information desk you can find out everything about the resort city, its infrastructure, get acquainted with entertainment and even sign up for an excursion - and all this is Land Royal Residence 3 * (Pattaya).  Customer reviews confirm excellent service. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned daily, towels and bed linen are changed as they become soiled and so require vacationers.  Many vacationers notice the quality of cleaning - the room is not only swept, the floors are cleaned daily and all the plumbing is cleaned.  Each tourist is given a bottle of water with a capacity of 0.5 liters per day. </p>

    <h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  If you had the opportunity to get to know Land Royal Residence 3 *, the description of the hotel must have pleased you with many additional services.  So, for a fee, you can order a transfer to the airport - quite often, this service is used by those tourists who go on an independent trip without the services of intermediaries, that is, tour operators.  Here you can also get a plane ticket in the necessary direction. </p><p>  For a small fee, the hotel staff will tidy up your things: wash and iron them. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  To summarize, I want to say that the hotel is fully consistent with its "star".  It is perfect for those tourists and vacationers who want to access the resort infrastructure, live at the same time, and in the center, and be remote from it.  The hotel is new, clean, gradually winning the hearts of tourists.  There are not so many reviews about it, but for the most part they are positive, they emphasize the excellent service and the attentive attitude to vacationers on the part of the administration and staff. </p>
