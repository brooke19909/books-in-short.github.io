Of course, you can give them to your mom to use them as a rag during cleaning.  However, you are unlikely to want to do this when you find out what can be made from old T-shirts. </p><h2>  Fashion scarf </h2><p>  Want to know what you can do from old T-shirts without any sewing skills?  "Folk" designers suggest trying to make an original scarf that will revive any boring outfit.  To make it you need ... sharp scissors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can be made from old t-shirts" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1319011.jpg" width="600"></div>  Necessary:

    <ul><li>  cut off the top of the shirt, starting with the line under the sleeves; </li><li>  flip the resulting "ring" with the processed edge up; </li><li>  cut from below into vertical strips of the same width (1.5-2 cm), trying to get the fringe of the same length. </li></ul><p>  When the scarf is almost ready, it can be decorated.  For this, multi-colored beads are suitable.  They need to be put on fringe strips and tie tight knots at the ends. </p><h2>  Pencil skirt </h2><p>  Thinking about what you can do with an old T-shirt?  If it is from a fairly <span>dense knitwear</span> that holds its shape well, and you can sew, you can try turning it into a fashionable skirt with a tight silhouette. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First of all, you need a pattern.  If you can‚Äôt find her, then take some pencil skirt that fits your figure well.  Using the chalk, transfer the silhouette of the pattern to the t-shirt.  Cut the front and back parts with minimal seam allowances.  Connect them with pins.  Sew in a zigzag machine.  In this case, it is better to set a small step with a large stitch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can you do with an old t-shirt" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1318653.jpg" width="547"></div>

    <p>  Sew a belt from the remaining strips of fabric with a side seam.  If the shirt was quite long, then you will get a belt with one seam connecting it to the ring.  Otherwise, you need to take two side strips, cut from them a pair of identical parts with a length of ¬Ω waist circumference and sew them together.  Next, you need to connect the belt with the skirt with the same zigzag.  Since the hem of the t-shirt serves as the hem of the t-shirt, he does not need processing.  If the belt does not sit loose, then you can thread an elastic tape of suitable color and width into it. </p><h2>  Pillows </h2><p>  And it occurred to you that you can make bright pillowcases from original T-shirts with original prints for pillows for a sofa or ottoman?  Are you interested in such an idea?  Then what are you waiting for?  The manufacture of such textile decorations for the home does not require much effort.  The main thing is that the pillows are smaller than the t-shirts themselves.  To make pillowcases easier to wash in the future, you can choose zippers to match the color of the fabric.  The procedure is as follows: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  measure the pillow in length and width; </li><li>  2 rectangles or squares are cut from a T-shirt with an allowance of 3 cm + 1 cm to the seams; </li><li>  connect parts from three sides with double seams; </li><li>  sew on the zipper. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="can be made from old t-shirts" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1318809.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  What can be done from an old little t-shirt </h2><p>  Did you know that in the wake of the struggle for ecology, the fashion industry has recently recalled the so-called string bags?  If you are not ready to flaunt your purchases, then from a small T-shirt in bright colors and with an original print you can get an original bag.  She will help you out at the supermarket and will completely replace the plastic bags that environmentalists have been fighting fiercely for a long time.  Such a practical accessory is also convenient because it can always be folded and hidden in a bag or jacket pocket. </p><p>  The manufacturing process is very simple and depends on the model chosen.  For example, you can: </p><ul><li>  cut off the top and unscrew the t-shirt; </li><li>  flash it along the cut; </li><li>  use trimming for making pens; </li><li>  sew them to the top. </li></ul><p>  By the way, a string bag using the same technology can also be made from a knitted T-shirt.  Just in this case, it will be enough, just turning the product, stitch it along the bottom edge.  In this case, you do not even have to make pens! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="can be made from an old little t-shirt" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1318865.jpg" width="378"></div>

    <h2>  What can be done from an old white t-shirt </h2><p>  Such an ordinary wardrobe item can be turned into a very original summer blouse.  To do this, you need: </p><ul><li>  cut off the bottom edge of the shirt so that it reaches the waist; </li><li>  make a deep neckline on the back; </li><li>  cut out long strips from the excess parts of the T-shirt and sew straps from them; </li><li>  to process the lower edge of the product; </li><li>  sew one shoulder strap in the back horizontally, backing 2 cm down from the shoulder seams; </li><li>  measure and cut 4 straps of different lengths, each should be 8-10 cm less than the previous one; </li><li>  sew them in a semicircle to the ‚Äúcrossbar", with an indent of 2 cm on each side. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Blouses with lace </h2><p>  You will probably be surprised when you learn that you can make very beautiful feminine tunics from old T-shirts, having only a few meters of wide lace on hand. </p><p>  We offer two options: </p><p>  1. For t-shirts, vertical stripes are cut from both sides along the entire length, departing from the side seams by a distance equal to the width of the lace.  The result should be something like a poncho.  Sew a piece of wide lace braid along the edge of the entire cut on the right side.  Do the same on the left.  Leaving room for the sleeves, connect the parts with side seams from the wrong side or from the outside, backing 3-4 cm from the edge.  In the latter case, you can draw on the sides of the little thing, if you slightly pull the thread and pick up the lace. </p><p>  2. Unhook the shoulder seam at the T-shirt and cut the sleeve along the upper fold.  Align the top of the front half in a straight line.  Sew one strip of lace to the cut of the sleeves.  As a result, they should become wider.  Sew lace on the top edge of the blouse so that a ‚Äúboat‚Äù is obtained.  If there is a desire, and the shirt is long, make a drawstring at the waist and put on the braid there. </p><h2>  Some more ideas </h2><p>  From strips cut from t-shirts of different colors, you can weave braids that will become the basis for bracelets.  Of these, using brooches and beads, you can also collect jewelry for the neck.  T-shirt braid is also suitable for making a bright belt.  From it you can make an original rim. </p><p>  Now you know what you can do from old T-shirts (see photo above), and you can turn them into stylish wardrobe items or a fashion accessory.  Good luck! </p>
