This resort is located near Anapa, but began to develop on its own only a decade ago.  Many people liked the place of rest, and thanks to the positive reviews of tourists who spent their holidays here, the village of Blagoveshchenskaya, the recreation centers located here began to gain unprecedented popularity. </p><h2>  Resort Feature </h2><p>  The village is located near the world famous resort town of Anapa.  From two sides it is washed by the estuaries of Kiziltash and Vityazevsky.  However, this is not only attracted by local recreation: the <span>village of Blagoveshchenskaya,</span> recreation centers located here have access to the open Black Sea.  It is very welcoming, pampers with clean water.  A good place for families with children.  If you want noisy parties and cultural pastime, then transport will quickly deliver to Anapa, where discos, bars, restaurants and other benefits of civilization are at your service. </p><p>  The settlement is obliged by its historical name to immigrants from Ukraine, who founded it.  Rumor has it that the name was given in honor of the great feast of the Annunciation.  However, from locals you can hear a more simplified name - just ‚ÄúAnnunciation‚Äù. </p><h2>  Rest in the village </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the world-famous resort of Anapa, the village of <span>Blagoveshchenskaya, is</span> very close <span>, the recreation centers</span> here are distinguished by relative silence and tranquility.  There are practically no noisy discos and parties, everything is designed for a quiet and relaxing holiday.  The population here is also not very large, mainly the employment of local residents is aimed at renting out housing and providing services to vacationers.  Income from the holiday season is the main type of earnings for the locals, so guests and vacationers are very friendly here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
