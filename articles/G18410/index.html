    <h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Sinclair Mark - this name will not say anything to ordinary movie buffs.  But Vin Diesel is a name that can promote even the most ordinary tape.  Mark Sinclair Vincent was born in 1967 in New York.  Together with him saw the light of his twin brother, who did not at all look like Mark.  Children were brought up by their mother.  The father was never interested in boys and did not take part in their upbringing. </p><p>  Little Mark was able to demonstrate his first acting talent at the age of three.  On that day, the child made his way to the theater in order to fool around with props and play hide and seek with the caretakers.  The director noticed the tricks and made them recite a small script for the roles.  Mark coped best with this task and was accepted by the director for several remarks.  So Mark Diesel earned his first 20 dollars. </p><p>  He played in productions and matinees in various children's centers.  Later, the mother remarried, and the older sons had stepbrothers and sisters.  Vincent's stepfather taught acting at a local university.  In addition, he was the head of the amateur theater and staged interesting productions, gathering friends and like-minded people.  Little Mark was pleased to go to the theater premieres with his new dad.  So the boy developed an artistic taste, and the desire to become an actor took shape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Overcoming complexes </h2><p>  As a child, Mark Sinclair was practically no different from his peers.  But because of too fast growth, he did not have time to catch up on muscle mass - he grew thin and bony.  A tall thin teenager was ridiculed by peers - his friends even gave Mark the nickname Worm.  But along with growth, the boy shows persistence, rare for his age, - he begins to work in the gym.  A few years later, a <span>thin teenager is</span> replaced by a young man with a pumped figure - the dream of all the girls. </p><p>  The second significant drawback Mark Sinclair considered his shyness.  He was embarrassed to answer lessons, embarrassed by strangers, didn‚Äôt even want to ask unknown passers-by for directions.  But he gradually dealt with this problem.  The acting lessons provided to him by his stepfather helped to overcome this shortcoming, and Sinclair could become more open.  So, he was even able to confess his first sympathy to love. </p><p>  What was surprising was that there seemed to be no two people as dissimilar in the world as Mark Sinclair Vincent and his brother.  Oddly enough, Paul grew up completely the opposite of Mark.  He became a fun, sociable guy, spending time in clubs and discos.  Despite opposing characters, the brothers got along with each other and helped each other. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Adulthood </h2><p>  The actor‚Äôs debut took place in the short film ‚ÄúThe Door for the Dinosaur‚Äù.  But his talent went unnoticed.  In order to earn a living, Mark Sinclair got a job at a nightclub.  Pumped up muscles and good athletic form helped him to work as a bouncer.  Then he shaved his head baldly and changed his name.  So Vin Diesel was born.  At the club, he enjoyed a certain popularity, but soon wanted more.  He felt like an actor: he breathed in the theater and could not imagine himself not in the movies.  Mark attends Hunter College, taking acting classes there, and writes scripts for his future work.  Saying goodbye to his family, Mark Sinclair Vincent moved to Mecca for all future actors - Los Angeles. </p><h2>  Jobs in Hollywood </h2><p>  The city, in which the number of beautiful people per square meter is the highest in the world, met the future star rather unfriendly.  An endless series of film screenings, theater impresario receptions and failures, refusals, refusals, stretched ... For some time he managed to earn extra money on a mass scale - but even this did not bring a constant source of money.  I had to get a job as a seller in a telemarket and give all my best to make a good impression.  The tall polite guy markedly increased sales, and Vin Diesel could no longer worry about tomorrow.  But the seller of household appliances from television screens is not at all what he was striving for. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mark sinclair actor" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1281248.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  First success </h2><p>  Vin Diesel eventually caught his wave of success.  His attempts to break into the world of cinema and numerous portfolios were noticed by director Penny Marshall.  Sinclair managed to get a small role in her film Awakening.  But more than a modest fee and the complete absence of the actor‚Äôs name in the credits prompted Vin Diesel to take up the script for his own movie. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúMany Faces‚Äù </h2><p>  In 1995, Mark Sinclair presents the film, made in its own script.  The main role Vin Diesel wrote specifically for himself - maybe that is why the tape turned out so successful for the beginner that it was even presented at the international film festival in Cannes.  After a short moment of success, V. Diesel comes back to California, where he continues to work in a telemarket. </p><h2>  "Save Private Ryan" </h2><p>  But even modest success is a chance to fulfill your dream.  The actor‚Äôs work on creating his own film impressed the eminent Stephen Spielberg, and he invited M. Sinclair to star in the film ‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan.‚Äù  Full reincarnation as Private Adrian Kaparzo did not go unnoticed - critics spoke well of the new actor - this made it possible to get good roles.  The actor was so real able to play Caparzo that his acting work was noticed by serious masters of the film industry.  He deservedly received the US Screen Actors Guild Award.  The films Vin Diesel plays have become popular with viewers outside the United States of America. </p><p>  Gradually, even relatives began to forget that the real name of Vin Diesel is Mark Sinclair.  Posters from the films "Black Hole", "Boiler Room" occupied the walls of fans in all corners of the world.  And the famous "Fast and the Furious", where Diesel played a major role, brought unprecedented fame and fees to the creators of this blockbuster.  Yes, and Mark Sinclair himself, whose photo flaunts in all the popular tabloids, was not in the loser - the role made him a famous actor and movie millionaire. </p>

    <p>  In 2006, Vin again engaged in "Fast and the Furious" and starred in the next part of the blockbuster.  The name that the film later received was ‚ÄúFast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.‚Äù  Vin is no longer the main character, his role lasts only a few minutes.  The fourth part of the film "Fast and the Furious" is produced by the actor himself.  In it, he plays with actor Paul Walker, who becomes his close friend.  Just a couple of years - and then Fast and Furious 6 comes out on the movie screens. </p><p>  March 26, 2015 - the date of the premiere of the next part of the epic "Fast and the Furious 7".  At the completion of the film, Paul Walker dies in an accident.  But the creators of the film were able to solve the problems with the completion of the film - at the end of the tape, the character of the deceased actor does not die in the story, and Walker himself is "resurrected" using modern computer graphics.  The doubles were also needed - the Walker brothers became them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The real name of diesel wine is Mark Sinclair" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1281233.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Novels </h2><p>  In the personal life of Vin Diesel there were many dizzying hobbies, but in the end he did not make an offer to any of his friends.  During the shooting of ‚ÄúFast and the Furious 5,‚Äù Diesel met dazzling Michelle Rodriguez.  This was the beginning of a stormy romance, but after a few weeks the girl said that they had nothing in common.  Michelle left no trace in the fate of the actor. </p><p>  Sinclair's hobby was also the Czech model Paola Harbkova.  Young people met in the Czech capital when Mark Sinclair (actor) starred in the film "Three X".  The model at that time only celebrated its 18th, but the Diesel did not pass by a surprisingly beautiful and refined girl.  This hobby lasted for a short time - Paola was not satisfied with Mark's constant absence, and the photos taken by the paparazzi showed either one or the other girl, next to which Mark Sinclair flaunted.  His career was in its prime, but his personal life was accompanied by failures. </p><h2>  First child </h2><p>  In 2007, Diesel conquered Paloma Jimenez, a popular fashion model who, a year later, presented the actor with the long-awaited daughter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mark sinclair biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1281247.jpg" width="469"></div>
