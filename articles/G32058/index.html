Tourists will find here everything necessary for a good rest: gentle, transparent and warm sea, cliffs overgrown with pine trees, peace and tranquility.  Well, of course, if you get bored, you can always plunge into the world of fun entertainment, shopping and interesting trips around the peninsula.  And if you have already decided which type of vacation you like, it's time to choose a hotel in Halkidiki that would be convenient for you.  And it depends not only on your tour operator, but also on what you are going to this peninsula for.  Now we will figure out where it is better to settle down so that the rest leaves only positive impressions. </p><h2>  Choosing a hotel for your holidays in Halkidiki </h2><p>  This peninsula consists of three resort areas.  Athos, Kassandra and Sithonia - everywhere there are beautiful beaches, amazing landscapes, as well as accommodation for tourists.  Halkidiki hotels can take guests to rest almost all year round. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travel365.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="All inclusive Halkidiki hotels" class="if uuid-2343925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2343925.jpg"></div><p>  Choosing a hotel, you can consider different options: budget and luxury, near the sea and at a distance from the beach, without food and ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù, only for adults and for families.  It all depends on your preference.  But no matter what hotel you choose, the cleanest beach, the azure sea, the air filled with the scent of pine trees and excellent service will be provided to you. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Halkidiki (all inclusive) hotels </h2><p>  The famous Sani chain is very good in this regard.  It unites not just hotels, but chic five-star complexes operating on the ‚Äúultra all inclusive‚Äù system.  Halkidiki hotels of this line are located in the territory of this reserve.  A variety of restaurants, bars, taverns and pubs will allow vacationers to feel the diversity of Greek cuisine, as well as make it possible to feel like a real gourmet.  Often in such hotels themed gastronomic evenings are organized, where the best chefs of the country compete. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ikosresorts.swapsystems.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels of Halkidiki 5 stars" class="if uuid-2343902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2343902.jpg"></div><p>  But tourists warn that if you want to use this food system even at sea, choose hotels with ultra all inclusive.  Otherwise, drinks in the beach bars will be paid for you.  The all-inclusive system often includes not only food, but also the use of sports and spa centers, golf courses, as well as yoga classes and fitness clubs. </p><h2>  The most popular 5 star Halkidiki hotels </h2><p>  Such hotels include many hotels in Kassandra.  Halkidiki hotels of a premium class differ not only in luxury, but also in a very high quality service.  For example, guests are absolutely delighted with Oceania Club &amp; Spa.  Here you are waiting for more than just luxurious rooms, a varied cuisine with fresh products and a huge territory.  The whole service concept is designed so that the staff not only guessed, but even warned almost any desire of the traveler.  In 10 bars and restaurants of the hotel you will find food and drinks for every taste.  Very enthusiastic reviews about the complexes "Sani Beach" and "Hill Studios". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.aegeanmelathron.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best hotels of Halkidiki" class="if uuid-2343898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2343898.jpg"></div><p>  The most fastidious customers were satisfied with the exclusive service at these hotels.  Large, like for European hotels, rooms, great views, including the sea, private exits to the kindergarten and pool, spa and the ability to rent a yacht or a helicopter - this is only a small part of what these beach complexes can offer tourists.  Often such hotels have such vast territories that electric cars drive between the buildings.  In restaurants, as a rule, tourists are required to follow the dress code.  There are also rooms for people with disabilities.  For a more relaxing family holiday among the premium hotels, the Porto Carras hotel chain is located in Sithonia. </p><h2>  Halkidiki: 4 star hotels </h2><p>  Such hotels are mainly located in the Kassandra area.  It is here that the majority of tourists come to rest on the peninsula of Halkidiki (Greece).  4 star hotels can, of course, be found on Sithonia and Mount Athos.  Among Russian-speaking travelers, Pallini Beach on Kassandra is most popular.  The level of service and comfort in this hotel is not much inferior to five-star luxury complexes.  It offers spacious rooms with a huge area (over 40 meters), bungalows right on the beach, a summer cinema, good windsurfing and water ski instructors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.beleontours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels of Halkidiki 4 stars" class="if uuid-2343935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2343935.jpg"></div><p>  Near the town of Uranopolis is a good "four" - "Aristotels Holiday Resort".  Its tourists appreciate not only the opportunity to choose a duplex room, studio or apartment with a kitchen, but also because of its proximity to various Orthodox shrines.  In addition, this hotel is famous for its spa, and the fact that it is the only hotel in Halkidiki with a water park.  And if you want to get acquainted with the traditional culture of Greece, welcome to Hanioti Grandhotel, where they regularly organize evenings of national music and dance. </p><h2>  Budget hotels </h2><p>  Three or two star Halkidiki hotels are suitable for tourists who want to save on accommodation and explore local attractions.  But one cannot say that it‚Äôs bad to rest there.  "Treshki" of this Greek peninsula will provide you with standard European comfort and a range of services.  As a rule, they are not on the shore, although some may even have their own access to the beach. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.beleontours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece Halkidiki 3 star hotels" class="if uuid-2343940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2343940.jpg"></div><p>  The best economy-class housing options are located in Kassandra and Sithonia.  More often than not they offer their guests a dinner-breakfast system and very good rooms.  On their territory there are playgrounds, small shops, swimming pools.  Hotels like Akrafos, Hanioti Grand Victoria and Sithonia Village have the highest ratings. </p><h2>  Where is better to relax with children </h2><p>  If you are traveling to this Greek peninsula with kids, then the choice of hotel should be treated with special responsibility.  The Oceania Club &amp; Spa hotel is very good for families with children, where there are swimming pools for very young guests - up to 20 centimeters deep, three mini-clubs broken down by age, as well as special entertainment programs and menus in restaurants.  On the beach there is a specially fenced children's area. </p><p>  The hotel complex ‚ÄúPorto Carras Sithonia‚Äù differs in terms of quantity and quality of services for young guests, even from the best hotels in Halkidiki.  On its territory there are water slides, and an amusement park, and sports centers for teens, and riding lessons, and bike rental, and much more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.potidea-palace.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels for families with children" class="if uuid-2343945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2343945.jpg"></div><p>  But the most important thing is the location of the hotel.  It is located in a pine forest, whose air has a very beneficial effect on health and immunity.  There is a road train throughout the complex, which kids really like.  Of the "fours" for families with children, tourists would choose the "Kassandra Palace" with a clean beach and good animation, as well as the "Blue Bay" near Kallithea.  The latter hotel is popular with tourists for the opportunity to relax quietly and measuredly, as well as the proximity to a very clear sea.  It is only necessary to take into account that most of the beaches of Halkidiki are pebble, and kids may need special shoes. </p><h2>  For a romantic getaway </h2><p>  If you are going to any hotel in Halkidiki (Greece) to spend a honeymoon or just enjoy spending time with your loved one, tourists recommend hotels such as Ikos Oceania, Pommgranate Wellness Spa, Ostria Seaside, Danai Beach Resort and Villas. "  The windows of these complexes offer breathtaking views of the sea and mountains, the bars offer free drinks, the rooms have high-quality wooden furniture and facilities for making tea or coffee.  You can rent secluded bungalows with access to a private garden with sun loungers.  Almost everywhere there are spas, and chefs will offer you delicious dishes.  You can order breakfast in bed.  But tourists are advised to be careful with food, otherwise you can quickly gain extra pounds. </p><h2>  Are there any hotels in Halkidiki with their own beach? </h2><p>  The coast on the peninsula has a Blue Flag for its cleanliness.  Therefore, the condition of most of the local beaches can be considered ideal.  Many hotels have their own access to the sea.  Their beaches are sandy or pebble.  They are equipped with toilets, changing rooms, showers, special areas for children, sun loungers, umbrellas and sunbeds.  The beaches are cleaned by special staff. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.acrotel.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Halkidiki Hotels with Private Beach" class="if uuid-2343951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2343951.jpg"></div><p>  According to tourists, the best private coast at the hotels "Pallini Beach", "Grekotel Pella", "Annamaria Resort" on Kassandra, as well as "Antemus", "Blue Dolphin" and "Danai" in Sithonia.  Vacationers also say that the hotels of the Sani and Porto Carras chain are also not inferior to the above.  The sand at their seaside is usually very shallow and white, and the entrance to the water is gentle.  Even if some hotels on the peninsula are not on the first line, they still have their own beach.  You can mention all the same hotel ‚ÄúOceania Club‚Äù.  A special bus takes tourists to the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãtourists.  Sun beds, umbrellas and towels on the hotel beach are free. </p><h2>  Reviews of Hotels Halkidiki </h2><p>  Tourists positively evaluate different hotels of this Greek peninsula: both luxurious ‚Äúfives‚Äù and budget ‚Äúthree rubles‚Äù.  Clean, clean food, bedding is always fresh.  Beautiful well-kept area.  But the guests argue that, unlike Turkish and Egyptian hotels, many programs for children, especially adolescents, are paid, and the animators practically do not speak Russian.  In addition, during the season, Greek beach hotels are usually very noisy, and soundproofing in rooms often leaves much to be desired. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotel-paralio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Halkidiki hotels reviews" class="if uuid-2343892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2343892.jpg"></div><p>  Nevertheless, the staff is always friendly and tries to solve all problems without delay.  As for luxury complexes where "all inclusive", they usually do not cause complaints, especially for those travelers who come with children.  Ideal beaches, inconspicuous, but high-quality service, excellent cuisine and plenty of entertainment - after this, you will not even notice how all the days measured for rest fly by. </p><p>  In reviews of Halkidiki hotels, tourists are also advised to pay attention to who this hotel is for: for young people who are accustomed to relaxing actively and having fun, or for those who want to spend their holidays calmly and serenely. </p>
