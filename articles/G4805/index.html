    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel complex under consideration is located seven kilometers from the center of Side in the small resort village of Sorgun.  The famous local landmark, Manavgat Waterfall, is just five kilometers from the hotel. </p><p>  The nearest international airport is in Antalya, 70 kilometers from Side Ally Hotel 4 * (Side).  After your plane lands in this air harbor, it takes about 1.5 hours to get to the hotel complex.  This time you can spend interestingly and profitably, listening to the guide‚Äôs story about the history, culture and features of the region (in case the transfer is organized by a travel agency), as well as admiring the picturesque scenery from the window of the bus or car. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This hotel has its own beach.  It is located five hundred meters from the hotel complex.  The path to it passes through the promenade.  We draw your attention to the fact that it is not necessary to overcome this distance on foot, since a special bus regularly runs between the hotel and the beach, delivering guests to the very shore of the sea. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to the hotel yourself </h2><p>  If you plan your trip to Side yourself, we recommend choosing flights that land at <span>Antalya Airport.</span>  From here you can easily get the intercity bus to Manavgat.  The distance from it to the hotel is only a few kilometers, which can be overcome either by taxi or by minibus.  If you want to travel independently to different regions of Turkey, then in the summer there will be no problems with this.  So, between Side and Alanya, Istanbul, Izmir and other cities regular bus service is established. </p><h2>  Side Ally Hotel 4 *: description and photo </h2><p>  This hotel, formerly called Belinda, was built in 1989. In 2014, large-scale renovations were carried out here.  Thus, guests have the opportunity to stay in comfortable, stylishly decorated and equipped with all necessary rooms, located in a large five-story main building and a one-story additional unit. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In total, the hotel has 149 rooms, which can accommodate 320 guests.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãown territory Side Ally Hotel (ex. Belinda) 4 * is 13 thousand square meters.

Also, there are all conditions for children. </p><p>  If you want vivid impressions and stormy fun, then you can always go by taxi or shuttle bus to the city of Side or Antalya. </p>

    <h2>  Side Ally Hotel 4 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  It should be noted that the hotel in general leaves a positive impression on our compatriots.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><p>  So, tourists like the location of the hotel complex.  It is located away from the bustling city streets, so you can sleep well at night.  The hotel itself, although not new, is in good repair.  All equipment in the rooms works.  If there are any malfunctions, they are very quickly eliminated after contacting the reception.  However, some tourists recommend to settle in the main building of the hotel, if possible, because, in their opinion, the rooms in the bungalow are slightly worse.  So, they do not have laminate flooring, and tiles, balconies are not so large, and they are also located closer to bars and restaurants, where the noise does not subside until late in the evening. </p><p>  As for food, almost all travelers are satisfied with it.  So, in the restaurant here both adults and children are happy to eat.  The menu is quite varied, the food is tasty and of high quality. </p><p>  I liked our compatriots and the beach of the hotel.  Despite the fact that it was several hundred meters away, many enjoyed walking along the road surrounded by eucalyptus trees and other vegetation.  Alternatively, you could always get to the beach with a hotel car, which constantly runs between Side Elli and the coastline. </p>
