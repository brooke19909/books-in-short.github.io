Perhaps setting <span>up a campground</span> on the shore of the lake, you can get your share of romance among the surrounding beauty, but that’s where the charm of a savage rest ends. </p><p>  Popular with Russian tourists are tours to Lake Akakul.  Recreation facilities, "Forest Estate", for example, are located on its shores and offer high-quality European service at domestic prices. </p><h2>  Akakul Lake </h2><p>  Only 80 km from Chelyabinsk and 7 km from the town of Kyshtym is the most popular pond for recreation in these parts.  Akakul is a relatively small lake.  Its maximum width reaches 3 km and a length of 4.8 km.  The depth is also attractive for recreation and fishing: the minimum is 3 m, and the maximum (in the central and southern parts) reaches 9.6 m. </p><p>  These places are well known to fishermen, since there are pike, bream, perch, ruff, roach, perch, whitefish, gold and <span>silver crucian carp,</span> tench and chebak.  Therefore, in the summer you can see the whole tent camps, but there are practically no parking lots with comfortable, clean and free beaches. </p>
