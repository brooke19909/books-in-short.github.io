The main bridges of Venice</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Venice is a city of contrasts and illusions.  She was sung by poets of the Renaissance, Russian writers wrote about her, in this city are the most beautiful palaces in Europe.  But its main attractions are, perhaps, rivers and canals.  How many bridges are there in Venice?  Not everyone can answer this question.  How many bridges in Venice and how the most famous of them are called are described in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="de.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Venice, Italy" class="if uuid-2543419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2543419.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  In Roman times, Venetian tribes lived on the territory of modern Venice.  Hence the name of the legendary Italian city.  By the way, he was far from always Italian.  In the 9th century, the Venetians had to defend their lands from Hungarians, Slavs, and Arabs.  In those days, it was a large trading hub and was the center of the republic of the same name.  At the turn of the 17-18th centuries, Venice crossed Austria.  It became part of Italy in 1866. </p><h2>  Venice and St. Petersburg </h2><p>  This Italian city is often compared with the northern capital of Russia.  How many bridges are in Venice and St. Petersburg?  Which of these cities has more channels?  There are about eight hundred bridges in St. Petersburg.  The city founded by Peter occupies an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1400 km <sup>2</sup> .  Venice is three and a half times smaller than St. Petersburg.  So, there are less bridges here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These cities are often compared due to the abundance of water channels.  However, they have not so much in common.  How many bridges in Venice are described below. </p><h2>  Perishing city </h2><p>  In Venice, floods often occurred.  Similar natural disasters occurred in St. Petersburg.  About the first thing that happened in 1824, Pushkin wrote in The Bronze Horseman.  The second terrible flood occurred that year when St. Petersburg ceased to be the capital.  That is, a hundred years after the first - in 1924. </p><p>  However, Venice suffers from floods more than a city on the Neva.  Throughout the 20th century, it catastrophically plunges into the lagoon.  The main reason is the industrial withdrawal of water from artesian wells.  It may seem that the question of how many bridges of Venice will soon lose relevance.  After all, the city in a certain number of years will simply disappear. </p><p>  But not so bad.  The city of carnivals will last a long time.  To save Venice, a special project was developed, which provides for the construction of special barriers around the city.  This project was approved by experts.  In 2003, <span>Silvio Berlusconi</span> laid the first stone.  True, construction work is often criticized.  Some experts believe that barriers are ineffective and unable to protect the city from flooding. </p><p>  How many bridges are there in Venice?  The number of these structures has changed over the 20th century.  There are new facilities.  Today, the exact answer to the question "How many bridges in Venice?"  - 435. The most famous are Rialto, Scalzi, Academy Bridge and Constitution Bridge.  These structures are among the main attractions of Venice. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rialto Bridge </h2><p>  This and three other structures mentioned above pass through the Grand Canal.  Rialto is located in the same quarter.  This attraction has long become a symbol of Venice, it can be seen in all photographs depicting the most romantic city in Italy. </p><p>  A crossing on the site of a modern bridge appeared at the end of the 12th century.  Later it was replaced with a wooden structure, but it could not withstand the flow of pedestrians.  In the XIII century, a stronger bridge was built, in the form of an arch, but it suffered in a fire in 1310.  The stone structure was built in 1591.  The Rialto Bridge is mentioned in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.1366x768.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ialto bridge" class="if uuid-2543429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2543429.jpg"></div><h2>  Academy Bridge </h2><p>  This building is named after the Academy Gallery, which it connects with the San Marco area.  In 1854, a metal bridge was built, but the design caused very negative criticism.  The construction was dismantled at the behest of <span>Benito Mussolini.</span>  Otherwise, disputes about the too modern style of this bridge would continue to this day.  In 1934, a wooden structure appeared, which more harmoniously fit into the architecture of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="academy bridge" class="if uuid-2543422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2543422.jpg"></div><h2>  Skalzi </h2><p>  Translated from Italian, the name of this Venetian attraction means "barefoot bridge."  Nearby was once an abbey, whose monks were also called barefoot.  The building itself appeared in 1934.  The bridge connects the areas of Canaregio and Santa Croce. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="skaltsi bridge" class="if uuid-2543435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2543435.jpg"></div><h2>  Constitution Bridge </h2><p>  This is a relatively new construction.  Built by architect <span>Santiago Calatrava</span> in 2008.  A bridge connects Piazzale Roma with Santa Lucia Train Station.  It is also called the Fourth Bridge or Calatrava Bridge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="constitution bridge" class="if uuid-2543433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2543433.jpg"></div><h2>  Bridge of Sighs </h2><p>  One of the canals in Venice is called the Palace.  Its shores connect two bridges.  The younger one dates back to the beginning of the 17th century.  <span>The Bridge of Sighs</span> connects the prison building with the Doge's Palace. </p><p>  Tourists, not knowing the history of this building, believe that the name is associated with something romantic.  But no, these sighs have nothing to do with happy lovers.  The one who came up with the name meant the sighs of the convicts.  It was on this bridge that the guards once led prisoners to prison, where they were destined to spend the last days of their lives. </p><h2>  Straw bridge </h2><p>  The structure is built of very durable material.  And the name is explained by the fact that once there was a pier, to which straw was brought on barges for prison.  The bridge was built in 1360.  Restoration work was carried out in the XIX century. </p><h2>  Arsenale Bridge </h2><p>  The construction was established by the 16th century.  This is the oldest wooden bridge in the world.  Toothed towers are installed on its sides. </p><h2>  Ponte della liberta </h2><p>  The bridge was built in the middle of the XIX century.  The length of this brick structure is three kilometers.  On the bridge are railways and roads.  In the 30s of the XX century, a complete reconstruction was carried out. </p>
