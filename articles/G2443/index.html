For example, a subscriber can use a speed of 2 Mb, but at the same time use the network resources as much as he sees fit, while the owners of smartphones are given unlimited access at all.  However, many people noticed that the speed of the traffic was reduced, and therefore they were interested in circumventing the Yota restriction. </p><h2>  What are the limitations? </h2>

    <p>  It is natural that many technologically advanced people try to use SIM cards from their smartphones in various tablets or modems, as well as provide Internet distribution via Wi-Fi.  In this situation, users have to deal with initially invisible restrictions - SIM cards can only be used in devices specially designed for them, while distributing the Internet without any speed limits will only be possible after paying for the additional service. </p><p>  Also, bypassing the Yota restriction is of interest to those people who prefer to use torrent clients to download various files, because such programs will download various resources at a speed of no more than 64 kbit / s, which is a very, very modest result.  For this reason, any owner of a mobile device connected to this operator should be aware of how the procedure for eliminating any "inhibitory" effects is performed.  At the same time, you need to understand correctly that bypassing the Yota restriction will vary depending on which device you use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  TTL and IMEI </h2><p>  First of all, it will be necessary to understand in detail how the SIM card is rearranged from one device to another.  For example, many people prefer to use the card of their smartphone via a modem, but in order for this tariff to be used for your modem, you will need to change its IMEI to the same IMEI of your smartphone.  Exactly the same procedure should be carried out with tablet computers, if you want to bypass the Yota restriction on such gadgets.  At the same time, do not forget that the official substitution of IMEI is prohibited, therefore, in case of detection, various sanctions may apply to your number. </p><h2>  What is TTL? </h2>

    <p>  Next, you should understand the concept of TTL, as well as exactly how you need to interact with it, since this is also quite important if you bypass the Yota distribution restriction.  The TTL number is a specific value that determines the total lifetime of traffic packets.  Initially, it is 64 for the vast majority of modern operating systems.  In other words, after a connection is made to your operator‚Äôs network, the device starts to automatically transmit this default value to it, but if the connection is not direct, but with the help of a router, the TTL value will be reduced by one unit, which allows Yota see the use of additional devices by the user. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In other words, if you try to distribute the Internet through your smartphone, you will use it as a router, but for normal distribution you will need to bypass the Yota restrictions.  W3bsit3-dns.com and its users have described a lot of information about how the network detects this and begins to take measures in the form of speed reduction.  Also over time, they have developed a large number of methods and technologies for how to address these limitations. </p><h2>  We configure a router </h2><p>  In this case, the general essence of the operation is that you distribute the Internet through a router in conjunction with a modem, but at the same time circumventing the Yota speed limit is to transfer the standard value TTL = 64 to the network.  To do this, you need to specify a command in the router that will cause the device not to decrease this value, in this case, after connecting the computer to the router, the TTL value will still drop, but the router will return it to its normal state. </p><h2>  We work with USB modems </h2>

    <p>  It‚Äôs worth mentioning that such functionality is often absent in standard USB modems, as a result of which you will need to download specialized router configuration files from the control panel attached to it, then search for the main parameters of the modem there and add the line ‚Äúip adjust‚Äù to them -ttl inc 1. "  After that, you need to upload the file back, restart the power of the router and use the Internet at normal speed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, bypassing the restrictions of distribution of the Yota Internet may consist in the fact that you add the TTL value immediately to 2 units for the reason that a computer is added to the router, but you already do this on the device connected to the router.  It is worth mentioning that the procedure for <span>setting the</span> TTL <span>parameter</span> on different models of routers may slightly differ from the above description, therefore, if necessary, it is recommended to find instructions for your router model on the relevant profile resources. </p><h2>  We configure the modem </h2><p>  We have already figured out how to make the modem interact with the standard SIM card of the smartphone - just change the IMEI modem to the IMEI of the smartphone, and you can use the relatively cheap mobile Internet.  But after that, you will need to make sure that your modem can normally communicate with the computer, and start transmitting the TTL = 64 value to the network, thus circumventing Yota restrictions.  W3bsit3-dns.com contains individual information on the various models of modems, so it is recommended that you read the individual instructions specifically for your device. </p><h2>  Change the value through the computer </h2><p>  If you do not want to somehow get into the settings of your modem, in this case, you can try changing the TTL value using your computer.  In this case, its value must be 65 to circumvent the Yota restrictions.  The modem connects to the computer, and this value decreases to 64, since a node is added in the form of the computer itself and the TTL value decreases by one unit. </p><h2>  Customize Android </h2>

    <p>  Also, the distribution of the Internet directly from smartphones may be limited.  Since in the overwhelming majority of cases, it is not customary for smartphones to establish superuser rights.  You will need to find out exactly which TTL value will be transmitted to the network by your device.  To do this, a smartphone must be present on the smartphone that allows it to work in terminal mode, while the line cat / proc / sys / net / ipv4 / ip_default_ttl is entered and launched on the command line. </p><p>  After you find out the basic TTL value, on an external device in the form of a computer you will need to increase it by one so that in this bundle the mobile device will still give TTL in accordance with its basic value.  After this, reconnection is carried out, and you can use high-speed Internet without any restrictions in accordance with the established tariff.  Thus, bypassing restrictions on the distribution of mobile Internet Yota can be carried out on any devices running the Android operating system. </p><p>  Also, in some situations, it is possible to set the desired TTL value in the mobile phone itself, but for this you will first need to obtain superuser rights for your device model. </p><h2>  Customize iOS </h2>

The standard value of your mobile device will be transmitted through the network. </p><p>  Now, in order to bypass Yota restrictions on the computer, you need to open the registry editor using the regedit command, and then find the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SYSTEM \ CurrentControlSet \ Services \ Tcpip \ Parameters branch and create a new DWORD parameter (32 bits) in it.  The new parameter should be renamed to DefaultTTL, and the value 65 is already driven into it. After that, it will be enough to activate the connection and connect to the network. </p><h2>  Eliminate restrictions when using torrents </h2>

    <p>  There are two options for how to eliminate the Yota speed limit if you want to download various files via torrents: </p><ul><li>  Enable the encryption function in your torrent client. </li><li>  Use a network connection using a VPN. </li></ul><p>  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that encryption is not provided today in every torrent client, but you can search for such a program in which it is present.  In particular, you can use the qBittorrent program, in which it‚Äôs enough to go to ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù, enable DHT and then click on the item ‚ÄúRequire encryption‚Äù.  However, this approach does not always work out, as a result of which one may not see a decent data loading speed. </p><h2>  VPN Features </h2><p>  VPN services for the most part are paid, and also require additional computer settings.  However, despite all this, in the past few years, many people who actively use the Internet, prefer to use VPN services. </p><p>  In the vast majority of cases, users use the Internet from work, from home or from some public place, but not everyone is aware that regardless of where you use the network, your security, anonymity and freedom Web surfing is continuously at risk. </p><p>  This is exactly what VPN services are for.  Initially, such a resource will deploy a full-fledged virtual network that will be used on top of your existing connection.  Thus, any Internet traffic in a fully encrypted form is passed through a virtual server, so you will: </p><ul><li>  Remain completely anonymous for any sites you visit. </li><li>  Provided with effective protection for Wi-Fi connections. </li><li>  Completely spared restrictions on ports, protocols and location. </li><li>  Get much more effective internet surfing security. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, it is quite important to choose the right VPN, since they differ among themselves in a large number of factors.  In particular, you need to look at the location of the servers, and here you will need to already make a choice depending on your preferences.  For example, if you want to get easy access to certain resources that are restricted by Russia, then you can choose any service from the USA or European countries, but if you just want to make your connection more secure, it‚Äôs better to choose a closer server, to get normal internet speed output. </p><p>  After you enter the parameters specified on your chosen site, the data transfer will begin to be carried out through the encrypted channel, and the operator will not even know which transmission protocol is used in it. </p>
