    <h2>  Progress in Engineering Science </h2><p>  The twentieth century has become a genuine scientific and technological breakthrough for mankind.  Especially the period after the Second World War gave an impetus to the development of rocket science - that which was previously inaccessible, became fully capable of being implemented.  People have long looked closely and tried to study outer space, but this was done exclusively from the surface of our planet.  The second half of the last century became the real dawn of astronautics and the era of the study of near space.  The geopolitical opponents of that period ‚Äî the USSR and the USA ‚Äî advanced especially far in this.  The United States was developing in this direction, especially when the "father" of German rocket technology W. von Braun appeared in this country.  It was he who was the pioneer of the European region in this direction of engineering and design.  However, in the USSR there were long-standing developments.  The founders of Russian rocket science (Tsiolkovsky, and later Korolev) first theoretically, and then practically substantiated their conclusions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The first steps in space exploration </h2><p>  The end of the 50s had a truly impressive impact on the minds of contemporaries.  The Soviet Union first launched an Earth satellite, designed by engineers, into orbit.  Many peoples greeted this event as a tremendous progress in scientific and technological thought, but for America, this meant, although small, but a defeat in this contest.  An even greater sensation was caused by the event that occurred on April 1961 day.  It was then that Yuri Alekseevich Gagarin became the ancestor of all cosmonauts, regardless of their nationality, and the first person to be outside the Earth.  Flight preparation was conducted in an atmosphere of increased secrecy.  After all, then our country risked not only the life of a particular person, but also its authority in the international arena.  The stakes were very high, but the results were comparable.  After that, our country became a leader in <span>space exploration.</span>  <span>US President</span> John F. Kennedy at a meeting of his government announced an accelerated program of research and the allocation of large investments in space exploration. </p>

    <h2>  Mind competition </h2><p>  The person who was the first to go into outer space would provide his country with the title of space leader or take a retaliatory step on the enemy‚Äôs step.  Both countries have actively taken up the preparations for this event.  US NASA tried to speed up the process of building manned spacecraft, but the rush led to the opposite result.  The lack of experience led to a breakdown - during the tests, the malfunction was noticed, therefore, human casualties were avoided, but the timing was seriously violated.  In the USSR, almost at the same time, similar calculations and training of the man who was the first in outer space were carried out.  The slightest flaws could seriously affect the entire further program of development of a new world for man.  In addition, the rush and party control had a rather depressing effect on all project participants.  And yet, those who first visited outer space turned out to be our compatriot. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Historical moment </h2><p>  This person was <span>Alexei Leonov.</span>  It was he who was chosen from a galaxy of well-trained astronauts.  And already at the end of 1964, careful preparation and testing of all kinds of situations that might arise during this flight began.  And then came the long-awaited moment, in 1965 (March 18), the Voskhod-2 ship found itself in low Earth orbit.  After a short preparation, Alexei Leonov was the first to go into outer space.  Being outside the <span>spacecraft</span> was very short, about twelve and a little minutes.  It was a monumental step in the history of all mankind.  However, even for such a short period of time, an extraordinary situation occurred.  <span>The astronaut</span> 's <span>spacesuit</span> increased in size, and Alexei Arkhipovich could not get back into the ship's airlock.  But he did not panic - weakening the internal pressure of the spacesuit, he achieved its reduction in size and was able to enter back into the spacecraft. </p><h2>  Ups and downs of flight </h2><p>  The one who was the first to go into outer space, had great courage and endurance, these qualities of personality helped him in the future.  Another unpleasant situation happened with Leonov - during the landing, the descent vehicle was out of the calculated landing point.  But this circumstance did not embarrass the brave space explorer.  When landing, he was in a remote taiga, and at that time there were severe frosts.  In such conditions, the crew stayed for two days, only a third rescue team made it to them.  For his feat <span>A. A. Leonov</span> was awarded the title of ‚ÄúHero‚Äù of the country.  The Americans admitted defeat, but intensified preparations for the flight and landing of the man on the moon, but this happened four years later and did not detract from the merits of Soviet engineers and astronauts.  And Alexei Leonov is the man who was the first to go into outer space and forever write his name in the annals of history. </p>
