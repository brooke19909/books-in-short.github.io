    <p>  Although the hardware tends to mid-range devices, the exterior remains budget-friendly.  The lack of interesting design solutions in the <span>Lenovo A6000 is</span> noticeable at first sight. </p><p>  An inconspicuous appearance has long been a hallmark of public sector employees of the company and no longer causes discontent.  A more significant miscalculation was the coverage of the device, or rather, the lack of it.  The phone case turned out to be incredibly easily soiled and collects fingerprints and dirt on it.  The reason for this lies in the absence of an oleophobic coating.  Fingerprints not only spoil the view, but also create difficulties in the operation of the sensor. </p><p>  Improves the use of the phone light weight - only 129 grams.  Despite its large dimensions, working with the <span>Lenovo A6000 is</span> possible with one hand.  Unfortunately, the back without coating and roughness makes the device slippery. </p><p>  External details took their usual places for the company.  In front is a display, camera, sensors, touch controls, logo and speaker.  The right side has got a volume control and a power button.  At the back of the device is a camera, two speakers, a logo and a flash.  The top end is designed for USB-jack and headset jack. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Each element has taken its usual place.  There are even disadvantages of most cheap devices, namely the lack of button illumination.  The manufacturer very rarely pays due attention to this trifle. </p><p>  Investing a lot of effort in the design of flagships, the company absolutely does not pay attention to the budget category.  Almost all devices from series A are made under carbon copy and do not cause enthusiasm. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Some solutions remain unchanged for budget devices, and the Lenovo A6000 is no exception.  Technical characteristics of the camera completely migrated to the novelty from its predecessors.  The novelty received the usual 8 megapixels, but with high resolution. </p><p>  A lot of settings and a digital stabilizer improve the operation of the Lenovo A6000 camera.  Photos, unfortunately, are obtained exclusively of medium quality, although more was not expected. </p><p>  The device also has a front camera with two megapixels.  In this case, you also do not have to wait for special quality, however, front-end cameras are quite enough for video communication. </p><p>  The smartphone‚Äôs cameras are not particularly surprising.  Hackneyed characteristics pass from one device of a series to another. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

The screen has got a solid IPS-matrix, which significantly improves the viewing angles of the A6000.  The resolution characteristics also did not disappoint: 1280 by 720.

    <p>  It is the ‚Äúfilling‚Äù that brings the Lenovo A6000 phone, the characteristics of which are presented in the article, to more advanced brothers.  Replaced by the Chinese favorite MTK processor came a more powerful analogue of SnapDragon.  In addition, the budget A6000 received four cores, each of which operates at a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  Previously, only representatives of the S-series could boast of such a filling. </p><p>  He supported the success of the processor and gigabytes of RAM.  Perhaps memory is not enough to fully reveal the potential of the "filling", but for most everyday tasks it will be enough in full. </p><p>  The installed Adreno 306 video accelerator brings the device even closer to the average price category. </p><p>  The hardware is impressive.  The RAM is a little blurry, but hoping for two gigabytes would be unnecessary.  Performance is enough for applications and powerful games. </p><p>  The smartphone has 8 GB of native memory.  Naturally, the installed "Android" will take part, but the user will still have 6 GB.  Present on the phone and the ability to install a 32 GB memory card. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  The device operates under the guidance of Android 4.4.  An outdated version of the system somewhat worsens the impression, but this is still a minor drawback. </p><p>  On top of Android, the manufacturer installed the Vibe UI shell, which does not have the best optimization.  It is worth starting with braking an interface that was not in the predecessors.  Also, along with the shell there are many programs, most of which, with a high probability, will not be needed by the user. </p><p>  Correct system deficiencies is possible using the update.  The user will be able to install a more recent version through FOTA or using custom firmware. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Equipped the device with a battery capacity of 2300 maH.  This is significantly less than with some lower power devices.  The battery absolutely does not match the bright display and productive "stuffing". </p><p>  With minimal use, the smartphone will last two days.  More active work will reduce life expectancy to about 6 hours.  Maximum load will further reduce operating time. </p><p>  Turning off the life of the device will help to turn off unnecessary programs, control included functions and reduce screen brightness.  An easier way would be to <span>replace the battery</span> with a capacitive analogue. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  An interesting feature of the A6000 was the presence of two speakers.  Relative to its predecessors, the sound of the phone is much richer.  There is, of course, a minor flaw, namely a noticeable hoarseness at maximum volume. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the design also affects the sound.  The speakers are located in the lower part of the case, and, working with the phone, the user covers them with his hand. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Affordable cost adds appeal to the device.  The price of Lenovo A6000 fluctuates around 10 thousand rubles.  Given that the gadget, although it is in the budget series, but belongs to the middle class, the cost is more than acceptable. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  In addition to the device, the manufacturer provides an adapter, a USB cable, a battery, a headset, and instructions.  Naturally, the user will have to spend money on a flash card. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The manufacturer saved on many details of the Lenovo A6000.  Customer reviews pay attention to a nondescript appearance.  The lack of zest in the phone is supported by the available colors.  The user can select only a white or black device. </p><p>  The camera will not cause much excitement.  Trying to overcome the distinction between classes, the manufacturer gave preference to an already obsolete solution.  The installation of 8 megapixels is quite relevant for a state employee, but the A6000 is essentially not anymore. </p><p>  The small battery capacity makes the owner dependent on the outlet.  This is very unpleasant, and the company could well have avoided such a flaw by installing 3000 maH. </p><p>  Perplexed and terribly implemented system.  Android 4.4 itself is not bad, but failed optimization pushes the user to change the version of the system. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2>

    <p>  The Lenovo A6000 smartphone has significantly more advantages.  The reviews of the owners are full of enthusiasm for the "stuffing" of the device.  The hardware really succeeded the manufacturer. </p><p>  The phone display will not leave indifferent.  High resolution and vibrant colors are great for work and entertainment. </p><p>  The sound of a smartphone is much better than many Android devices.  Stereo speakers allow you to enjoy music or watching a movie even without headphones. </p><p>  The cost will also appeal to fans of Lenovo.  To get an advanced gadget for just 10 thousand is very tempting. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbreaking the barrier between categories failed.  What was the reason for this - the lack of attention to design or the installation of not the best camera, it's hard to say.  The device is good "stuffing", but still could not leave the limits of the budget category. </p>
