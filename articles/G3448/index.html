  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get a TIN?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each citizen of the Russian Federation must have a taxpayer identification number (or abbreviated as TIN).  Not a single event, no matter how important it may be, is possible: hiring, applying for a loan or tax deduction, etc. </p><p>  12 digits of the TIN represent a certain encrypted code, read from left to right.  Assignment of a specific number occurs according to a strictly specified pattern.  The first four digits of the taxpayer identification number are a code that is correlated with the specific department of the tax inspectorate that assigns this number.  The next 6 digits indicate the number in the order in which the record was made of an individual in the territorial department relating to the unified state register of taxpayers in the tax authority that carried out the registration.  The next 2 digits are assigned as a control number according to the algorithm established by the Federal Tax Service. </p><p>  Since it is possible to obtain an <span>INN for an individual</span> only once in a lifetime, and his number remains unchanged throughout his life, you will not need to change the number in case of a change in status, surname, place of residence and other important life changes, which often entail a change in many documents .  The identification number is unique, so a second similar number does not exist. </p><p>  For those who first encountered the need to obtain an identification number, one should know simple rules on how to get a TIN. </p><p>  The body responsible for issuing the taxpayer identification number is the tax office at the place of registration of the individual.  Those citizens who live by temporary registration are also entitled to apply to the tax authority at their place of residence, since it is permitted by the legislation of the Russian Federation to obtain a TIN for temporary registration. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Knowing how to get a TIN for an individual, the registration process will not cause any special difficulties. </p><p>  When applying to the tax service at your place of residence with a statement filled out in the form N 2-2, you should also have a passport.  An application in paper form is filled in with a ballpoint pen in blue or black; ink of the same color is also allowed.  If there are corrections in the completed application form, the tax authorities will reject it.  In addition, you can use the alternative online application method by filling out the form on the official website of the Federal Tax Service of Russia.  At the very least, this will save you from unnecessary problems with rewriting the form in case of errors, and also do not need to stand in line for submitting an application. </p><p>  Since every citizen of the Russian Federation can <span>obtain a TIN</span> , the procedure for obtaining a TIN for a minor child under the age of 14 is carried out by his legal representative, who must confirm the right to represent the interests of the child legally by presenting his passport, child‚Äôs birth certificate and a document confirming place of registration of the minor.  After assigning the TIN, a corresponding certificate of registration is issued. </p><p>  If you lose your certificate, you should know not only the procedure of how to obtain the TIN, but also how to restore the document confirming the assignment of the TIN.  The rules for restoring the certificate provide for the writing of an application with a request to issue a document confirming the TIN, and you will also need to present a passport and a receipt with a <span>paid state duty.</span> </p><p>  Obviously, the procedure for obtaining such an important document in life is as simple as possible.  It is only a pity that the process of applying for and issuing a certificate often requires considerable time.  The queues in the window for receiving applications are usually many hours. </p>
