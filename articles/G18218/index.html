After he was educated, the young man got a youngster on his first ship. </p><h2>  The beginning of service in the Navy </h2><p>  In his early youth, Cook decided that he would devote his life to the sea.  In his free time, he studied related sciences - geography, astronomy, and the history of research on new lands.  In 1755, the Royal Navy received a new sailor.  He was James Cook.  A brief biography of the man included career growth from a simple sailor to a boatswain in just a month of service. </p><p>  At this time, the <span>Seven Years' War began</span> against France and its allies.  Cook participated in battles on the ship "Eagle" and the blockade of the enemy coast.  In 1758, he was sent to North America, where the struggle for colonies and resources continued between the two great sea powers.  At that time, Cook was a master - assistant captain.  He, as a specialist in cartography, was instructed to investigate the channel and channel <span>of the St. Lawrence River.</span>  On its shores stood the important <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Quebec,</span> which the British wanted to capture. </p><p>  The master successfully completed his task, due to which the assault and the capture of an important fortress took place.  The Royal Navy was vitally important specialists such as James Cook, whose brief biography received a new round.  After returning to his homeland, he began to prepare for his first round-the-world trip. </p>

    <h2>  First expedition </h2><p>  The state allocated Cook a small ship, Endeavor.  On it, an experienced sailor had to explore the southern seas in order to find the unknown continent, which was supposedly located in those extreme latitudes.  The team also included experienced specialists - botanists and astronomers.  This team was to be led by James Cook, whose brief biography still attracts many readers today. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1768, he left the port of Plymouth to end up in Tahiti.  The captain was distinguished by the fact that he introduced strict discipline on the ship regarding his attitude to the natives.  The command was ordered in no case to enter into conflict with the savages, but, on the contrary, to try to build peaceful relations.  This went against the usual practice of the colonialists, when the local population massively slaughtered or fell into slavery.  This was opposed by traveler James Cook.  A brief biography of the captain does not contain the facts that he ever initiated a conflict with the natives. </p>

    <h2>  New Zealand and Australia </h2><p>  Tahiti was followed by New Zealand, which James Cook carefully examined.  A brief biography of the navigator in each textbook includes a detailed description of his activities as a cartographer.  He described in detail each coast past which he sailed.  His cards have been used for another hundred years.  At Endeavor, he discovered the bay, which he called Queen Charlotte's Bay.  The name of the captain received the strait separating the two islands of New Zealand. </p><p>  The east coast of Australia met a team of unprecedented plant species.  Because of this, the bay in this region is called the Botanical.  Europeans were amazed at the local fauna, including the feral kangaroo.  June 11, 1770 the ship received a serious hole in the reef, which greatly slowed the expedition. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When the leak was shut up, Endeavor went to Indonesia.  There, the sailors contracted malaria.  The sanitary conditions of the then voyages were conducive to the spread of epidemics.  However, Cook, thanks to compliance with hygiene rules and a change in diet, managed to overcome scurvy - the scourge of many sailors.  But against malaria and dysentery there were no effective remedies.  Therefore, when the Endeavor finally arrived in Cape Town, only 12 people remained on board, including Cook. </p><p>  The first expedition proved that New Zealand represents two islands.  The main target (southern mainland) was never discovered.  The east coast of Australia was mapped in detail. </p>

    <h2>  Second expedition </h2><p>  In 1772, a new expedition began, led by James Cook.  A short biography for children contains many fascinating travel details that attract small readers.  These are mainly descriptions of amazing plants and animals of the tropical fauna. </p><p>  Cook's first target was Bouvet Island, which had previously been seen from afar by a Norwegian expedition.  However, the coveted piece of land was never found, after which the team went further south.  In January 1773, "Resolution" and "Adventure" for the first time in the history of research crossed the Arctic Circle.  Due to severe weather conditions, the two ships even briefly lost sight of each other. </p><p>  After a long voyage, the expedition headed to Tahiti and Hua Hin.  There, the British faced aggressive behavior by the natives and even cannibalism.  Subsequently Cook headed strictly east, discovering New Caledonia and South Georgia.  However, he never managed to reach the shores of Antarctica.  That was where James Cook was aiming.  The biography, the summary of which carries away vivid adventures, has become the subject of research by numerous historians. </p>

    <h2>  Death </h2><p>  Already in January, Europeans first saw the Hawaiian Islands.  Here they rested, and then went to the shores of Alaska and the Chukchi Sea.  Along the way, ships crossed <span>the Arctic Circle.</span>  In the <span>Aleutian Islands,</span> Cook met with Russian researchers and industrialists. </p><p>  From the polar seas, the team returned to Hawaii.  She was met by a crowd of natives numbering about a thousand.  Conflicts constantly arose with the locals, because of which they attacked the British.  In an attack on February 14, 1779, James Cook was killed.  A very brief biography of this navigator should be known to any educated and erudite person.  The captain became the national hero of Great Britain. </p>
