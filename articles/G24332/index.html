    <p>  The Nativity of the Virgin Sanaksar <span>Monastery</span> was founded in 1659.  And by the beginning of the XIX century, the small temple turned into a huge and well-maintained monastery, where everyone was comfortable to be.  The decoration of the monastery is made in the Baroque style.  The church has survived to the present day, and still there are services that help to heal the souls of people. </p><h2>  The history of the formation of the monastery </h2><p>  The place for the construction of the monastery was allocated by one of the kind-hearted locals named Luka Yevsyukov.  He invited the builders and priors of the Old Kadomsky monastery, with the help of which a magnificent chapel was erected.  They also prepared wood for the further construction of the temple.  And only in 1669 was a blessing received for the construction of the church and the monastery itself.  It was given by Patriarch Joasaph II.  Already in 1676, the construction of the first church was completed, erected in honor of the icon of the Mother of God of Vladimir. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hegumen Theodosius was in the monastery for many years and lived here until 1681.  And then he was sent to stay in another monastery.  After the abbot left, and he was forced to do so, the monastery fell into decay, there was no one to restore order.  In this state, he remained until 1759.  During this period, the brethren were not enough, the construction completely stopped, the cells needed repair. </p><p>  One of the best stages of the monastery‚Äôs life is connected with the name of Theodore Ushakov.  His prayers were aimed at the monastery developing, and the brethren could calmly carry their calling. </p><p>  March 7, 1765 a special decree the temple received the right to be called a monastery. <br>  Rev. Theodore was rector until 1774.  Then this post was taken by his successor - Ilya Fomich Tishkov.  Construction continued.  By 1776 a bell tower and a refectory were erected.  Such a large-scale construction indicated that the monastery received a rebirth and now it had a good future. </p>

    <p>  In 1805-1806, thanks to the assistance of a professional and experienced architect, another church was erected in honor of the Resurrection of Christ.  The church turned out incredibly beautiful and bright.  There is a special atmosphere. <br>  Rector Filaret remained on the territory of the monastery until the end of his days.  He did everything possible, erected new temples, made the monastery comfortable for the brethren. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hard times </h2><p>  In the pre-revolutionary years, churches were considered the center of the spiritual life of Russia. <br>  In the XX century, after the advent of Soviet power, a tragic event took place in the monastery, which was imprinted on the lives of all its inhabitants.  It was closed, the monks were expelled, the adjacent churches were plundered. </p><p>  And only in 1991 the church was returned to the hands of the state, and the authorities were able to begin the restoration.  And on May 26, 1991, the first worship was held within the walls of the monastery, indicating that the monastery was functioning again. </p><h2>  The restoration of the monastery </h2>

    <p>  By 2000, 90 people lived in the monastery.  Then the temple was still being restored, the brethren worked tirelessly.
