And quite often the gaze of travelers stops at the cozy Alkyonides Hotel.  What does this place look like and is it worth spending a vacation here?  What can a hotel offer to an experienced tourist?

    <p>  It is quite natural that for many tourists the location of the hotel is important first of all, because not everyone wants to spend their holidays divorced from civilization or, conversely, in the center of a noisy active life.  Where to look for the Alkyonides Hotel?  Crete, namely the small but colorful fishing village of Stalida - here you can stay for a few days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The area is very calm, there are only other guest houses nearby, as well as cafes and shops.  By the way, the sea can be reached in a matter of moments (the distance is about 20 m).  Only 3 km away is the rather remarkable and popular tourist town of Hersonissos.  There is a bus stop near the hotel, so you can easily move around the island.  The airport is located in the city of Heraklion, the capital of the island, at a distance of 30 km.  Package tours, as you know, already include a transfer upon arrival, and the journey will take only a few minutes. </p><h2>  What does the hotel area look like? </h2>

    <p>  Alkyonides Hotel is primarily designed for a relaxing beach holiday.  Nevertheless, it is also possible to diversify leisure on its territory.  There is an adult and a children's pool in the courtyard, where you can refresh yourself at any time of the day.  Umbrellas and sunbeds on the terrace can be used for free, but here beach towels are not given out.  You can also have fun playing ping pong.  By the way, a special playground with swings is equipped for children. </p><p>  Entertainment can also be found outside the walls of the Alkyonides Hotel.  Greece is a country with an ancient history and a lot of attractions of different calibers.  Even on the island itself, you can spend weeks on excursions. </p><h2>  Hotel Alkyonides Hotel 3 * <span>(Crete): reviews</span> and experiences of tourists </h2><p>  When planning a vacation, each person first gets acquainted with the official information about the chosen hotel.  But without the feedback of travelers who have already managed to visit a particular place, the picture will be incomplete.  What do the former guests say about the hotel complex Alkyonides Hotel 3 *? </p><p>  Most reviews are either positive or neutral.  Your impression of the hotel will directly depend on what purpose you came to the island with.  For example, if you want a full-fledged diet and a full range of entertainment in the territory, then you probably should look for other places.  This hotel is perfect for tourists who flew to Crete, wanting to enjoy a vacation by the sea - they return to the hotel only for sleep. </p><p>  The rooms are simple, the atmosphere is straightforward, but there is the necessary equipment and furniture.  Water in the bathroom is also present constantly.  Maids in the rooms are cleaned daily, and towels are changed very often.  Breakfast is very simple, the menu is modest, but the dishes are usually tasty, and more is hardly needed for a morning snack.  A rich lunch or gourmet dinner is served in one of the nearest restaurants.  The staff here are polite, they welcome guests cordially, and it‚Äôs nice to talk to them (though in English). </p><p>  The hotel has two important advantages.  Firstly, it is located almost on the beach itself, and the city center is not far away.  Secondly, the cost of living here is record low, which creates demand among budget travelers. </p>
