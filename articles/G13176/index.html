As for evening entertainment, there are practically no night clubs, but you can always find a cozy bar. </p><h2>  Are there any conditions for relaxing with a child? </h2><p>  For parents who are going to spend a vacation with the whole family, along with the children, comfort issues become priority.  What can the Royal Jinene Hotel Sousse 4 offer?  Reviews suggest that this hotel complex is suitable for a relaxing family vacation.  Moreover, the main contingent of vacationers is precisely parents with children of different ages. </p><p>  For starters, of course, it's worth talking about amenities.  Children under the age of two years stay at the hotel for free, and children from 2 to 12 years old are entitled to discounts.  Naturally, upon request, a folding bed with a comfortable mattress is delivered to the room.  Unfortunately, the restaurant does not have a separate children's buffet or food, but the choice of dishes is very large, so it is always easy to find something healthy and tasty for a child of any age. </p><p>  In the courtyard of the Royal Jinene hotel complex there is a small but roomy pool where children can splash around in warm water and complete safety.  There is a small playground with swings.  There is also a mini club where children also have fun under the supervision of educators and animators.  The children play, draw, dance, take part in various productions and team sports games, in short, have fun and enjoy. </p><p>  The hotel has several experienced professional nannies who, for a relatively small fee, are happy to look after the child, giving their parents a little free time. </p><p>  Entertainment can also be found outside the Royal Jinene 4. Sousse is a beautiful tourist city offering plenty of ways to have fun.  Very close to the hotel there is a large water park, where you should definitely take the child.  Large and small slides, pools, various water attractions - all this is liked not only by children, but also by their parents.  And in the city there is a zoo with a large number of different species of animals, fish and reptiles (here children can also get a lot of positive emotions).  In any case, the kids have a great time in the city, while improving their health with fresh sea air. </p><h2>  What do tourists say?  Reviews and recommendations </h2><p>  Probably every experienced tourist knows that a huge amount of useful information can be obtained by asking a few questions to people who have already managed to visit a particular place.  So what do travelers say?  What impressions does the hotel complex Royal Jinene 4 (Sousse) leave? </p><p>  Tourists leave different reviews: some of them are completely satisfied with the vacation spent here, while other people note shortcomings in the work of the hotel complex.  The hotel territory is large, because another hotel belonging to the same owner is adjacent to it - guests can stroll everywhere.  In the rooms, travelers note a fresh repair, accuracy and cleanliness.  There is the necessary furniture, from the windows of some rooms overlook the garden and the sea, and they clean the rooms regularly.  However, sometimes towels are delivered not during cleaning, but later. </p><p>  The presence of the all-inclusive scheme also seems convenient, because the food in the hotel restaurant is really delicious.  By the way, the tables are assigned to the numbers, so you do not have to stand in line, waiting for the table to free.  The menu is varied, especially when it comes to lunch and dinner.  The dishes are always freshly prepared and tasty, although tourists arriving here for a long time, note a certain uniformity. </p><p>  Royal Jinene Hotel Sousse 4    .       ,           . ,       -,   -, , ,     . </p><p>      ,    ,        .           ‚Äî      .
