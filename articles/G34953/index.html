  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Spassky bridge": reviews of residents, location, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Reviews about the Spassky Bridge residential complex are of interest to everyone who is considering the possibility of moving to this residential complex.  The acquisition of an apartment is a responsible and significant mission.  Therefore, first you need to carefully study all the information that exists about the developer, find out what experiences the co-investors who managed to make their choice, and then invest in the acquisition of the treasured square meters.  We offer detailed information about the new modern complex "Spassky Bridge". </p><h2>  General information about the object </h2><p>  Reviews about the Spassky Bridge residential complex are very diverse, so it is important to carefully understand everything that is known about it.  The residential district is located in a picturesque place on the left bank of the Moscow River in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Pavshinsky floodplain.  This is a modern monolithic new building, which is located within walking distance from the capital. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novostroev.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The location of the LCD on the map" class="if uuid-2968135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2968135.jpg"></div><p>  LCD "Spassky Bridge" in Moscow is one of the most prestigious complexes in the floodplain, very successful in terms of landscaping, transport accessibility and planning decisions. </p><p>  Against the backdrop of mass development, it stands out by its original species characteristics and unique architecture.  About a quarter of apartment buyers in reviews of the Spassky Bridge residential complex admit that they made a purchase spontaneously, passing by, were amazed at what they saw, they liked it so much that they decided to buy housing here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The project includes seven residential buildings of different floors - from 17 to 30 floors.  Each house has its own underground parking.  In the courtyard of the residential complex has its own school, kindergarten, sports and landscaped playgrounds.  From the street there is a supermarket.  In buildings, the first floors are considered non-residential.  They are given under commercial real estate.  There are cafes, shops, a fitness center, bank branches. </p><p>  A key role in improving the Spassky Bridge residential complex in Krasnogorsk is assigned to the central pedestrian boulevard.  It expands to the center of the quarter, then forms an area with a square for recreation for all residents of the microdistrict. </p><p>  Here you can buy one-, two- and three-room apartments with a variety of layouts from 37 to 89 square meters.  Most of the windows have excellent views of the river.  Initially, apartments are rented without finishing.  If necessary, it can be ordered from the developer. </p><p>  Some of the buildings are currently commissioned and settled.  A wonderful picture opens from the windows.  The entire residential neighborhood is designed so that most of the apartments have an excellent view of the river, almost every bend of the river is visible, as well as its green banks. </p><h2>  Where can I buy an apartment in the Spassky Bridge complex </h2><p>  The company‚Äôs sales office is located at Moscow, Krosnogorsk, Spasskaya street, building 1, building 3. Apartments are sold by several dealers.  The sale of housing is carried out in full accordance with federal laws that reliably protect all the rights of property owners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="spasskiymost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Spassky Bridge&quot; customer reviews" class="if uuid-2967075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2967075.jpg"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  There are several ways to get to the residential complex.  By bus you can get to Volokolamsk highway, from there go to the LCD in just about three minutes. </p><p>  In the reviews of the secret buyer about the Spassky Most residential complex, it is noted that sellers are positioning new buildings as houses located in the immediate vicinity of the metro.  Managers can assure that it will be possible to reach the Myakinino station (it is located on the other side of the Moskva River) in ten minutes with a walking step.  In fact, the journey will take at least 20 minutes.  You should immediately warn that girls will need to give up heels. </p><p>  It will be very comfortable for the residents of the new building to get to the Pavshinskaya floodplain from the Moscow Ring Road.  True, traffic jams cannot be avoided, but residents of the capital should get used to them for a long time.  By car, it is most convenient to get from the Moscow Ring Road.  At the intersection with Pyatnitsky highway, you need to turn onto Volokolamskoe.  On the highway, the path will take about 15 minutes. </p><p>  In the future, there is hope that in the near future there will be a station "Knitted", which they intend to build in the immediate vicinity of the new building.  The project for its construction was approved back in 2014, but so far no active work has begun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="novostroev.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Spassky Bridge&quot; project declaration" class="if uuid-2967078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2967078.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  There is a developed infrastructure on the territory of the residential microdistrict.  It provides almost everything that is necessary for a comfortable and quality life.  This is a kindergarten for 150 people, a secondary school for 550 students, a large shopping and entertainment center, which includes a large-scale supermarket covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than four thousand square meters. </p><p>  All buildings have multi-level underground parking for residents, and for guests there are ground parking spaces. </p><p>  You can get to Moscow from the territory of the residential complex in just three minutes through a pedestrian bridge.  This is sure to be appreciated by everyone who is keen on shopping, as the bridge leads directly to the Crocus City shopping center, on the territory of which there are a large number of restaurants, shops, beauty salons, and even has its own oceanarium. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  At the moment, one, two and three bedroom apartments can be purchased on the territory of the residential complex. </p><p>  For example, a one-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã45.5 square meters can be purchased for six million 261 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Alternatively, you can make a choice in favor of a two-room apartment.  Its area is almost 67 square meters.  It will cost you about eight and a half million rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dompluse.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Spassky Bridge&quot; reviews of residents" class="if uuid-2967076" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2967076.jpg"></div><h2>  Terms of purchase </h2><p>  If necessary, apartments can be purchased in a mortgage without paying the full amount.  The developer cooperates with several large domestic banks.  Based on the certified <span>design declaration of the</span> Spassky Most residential complex, they are ready to provide loans for the required amounts. </p><p>  One of the most profitable offers is Delta Credit Bank, which offers a rate of 8.5% per annum for up to 25 years with an initial payment of 15%. </p><p>  Sberbank is ready to issue a loan at a rate of 9% for up to 30 years with a similar down payment.  VTB Bank is ready to lend to customers at a rate of 9.7% with an initial payment of 10%. </p><p>  Also, loans can be provided by Otkritie Bank and Absolut Bank.  The rate is from 10% per annum, the down payment is from 10 and 20 percent, respectively. </p><h2>  Who is building </h2><p>  The developer of the residential complex "Spassky Most" is KomStrin.  This is a federal level company.  In recent years, it has been one of the leaders in the volume of current housing construction among the largest developers in the entire Moscow region.  At the same time, OblTorgUniversal, a limited liability company, which is part of the ComStrin group of companies, is directly involved in performing the work.  Currently, the developer of the Spassky Bridge residential complex has decided to go beyond the metropolitan region, starting to build houses in Perm, Yekaterinburg and Sochi. </p><p>  The company itself claims that they have been working in the Moscow real estate market since 2000, and since 2006 they have been building throughout the country, starting with the first multi-format village in the Urals.  Currently, the company has already built more than 40 large-scale real estate objects with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than one and a half million square meters.  These are apartments, and apartment buildings, and office buildings, and residential complexes, and cottage villages.  About 47 thousand people already live and successfully work in the homes and offices of the developer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pronovostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Spassky Bridge&quot; Mystery shop reviews" class="if uuid-2967077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2967077.jpg"></div><h2>  Project Features </h2><p>  Buyers in reviews of the Spassky Bridge residential complex separately dwell on the features of the project.  The complex is designed from polysectional buildings, which are three parts of the microdistrict.  The first was commissioned back in 2016 and by now is almost completely populated. </p><p>  The construction of the third stage is planned to be completed by the end of 2018.  It is worth noting that the developer so far complies with all deadlines. </p><p>  Pleasantly surprised by the thickness of the walls of houses.  For external facades, it is almost one meter, and for interroom partitions about 35 cm. Heat and sound insulation are at a good level.  For comfort-class housing, the entrances are planned at a standard level - a concierge room, porcelain stoneware, modern elevators. </p><p>  On the territory of the residential complex there is a municipal kindergarten.  According to local residents, the queue will have to wait about six months. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pronovostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Spassky Bridge&quot; Krasnogorsk" class="if uuid-2967082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2967082.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  In reviews of honest buyers about Spassky Most LCD in Moscow, a number of obvious advantages of this new building can be noted.  The houses are located in relative proximity to the large Vegas shopping center, where you can make all the most necessary purchases. </p><p>  The complex is really located very close to Moscow, each house has its own underground parking.  It is possible to purchase an apartment by installments or a mortgage.  In the future, it is planned to develop our own infrastructure. </p><p>  The developer is a large construction company that has been operating in this market for a long time, so it managed to win the trust of consumers.  They build houses fast enough. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Among the obvious drawbacks, it is worth noting significant parking problems.  Initially, it was stated that it was intended only for guests, but not all locals plan to purchase a place in the underground parking, so they leave cars right in the yard. </p><p>  The Myakinino metro station is relatively close, but the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line itself is very long.  It takes at least half an hour to get to the ring. </p><p>  Some buildings were built very close to Volokolamsk highway, where traffic is saturated.  As a result, residents may be disturbed by the noise outside the window and the smell of exhaust gases. </p><p>  The apartments are rented without finishing, so you will have to do the repairs yourself.  True, it is possible to order this service from the developer for a fee.  Since the pedestrian bridge across the Moscow River was built farther than originally planned, it takes much longer to reach it than promised to potential buyers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krasnogorsk.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Spassky Bridge&quot; Moscow an honest buyer" class="if uuid-2967080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2967080.jpg"></div><h2>  Impressions of interest holders </h2><p>  You can find quite a lot of positive customer reviews about the Spassky Bridge residential complex.  Many are satisfied that representatives of small and medium-sized businesses are actively populating commercial real estate on the first floors of new buildings.  There are already medical centers, a wide variety of shops, even a new private kindergarten with a swimming pool for kids. </p><p>  I like the view from the windows, which really opens up wonderful.  Customers note the high quality of the materials that were used in the construction.  High ceilings that create an additional feeling of spaciousness and comfort, high-quality double-glazed windows that neutralize all the noise from the street.  All this serves as a confirmation that the developer did not save, hired really professional builders who know a lot about this. </p><h2>  Negative opinions </h2><p>  It is worth recognizing that there are many negative reviews of residents about the Spassky Bridge residential complex. </p><p>  The obvious disadvantages include the high density of buildings in this part of the city, the existing queues for kindergartens.  In the reviews of the Spassky Bridge residential complex, many complain that the metro is much further than they originally expected.  These statements are countered by individual residents of the capital, who admit that in the areas of Moscow where they live now, it is more difficult and longer to get to the metro than from this residential complex. </p><p>  Another equity of the project, some real estate investors call the fact that the LCD was built on a small plot of land, which is surrounded on all sides by roads. </p><p>  It is worth noting that most buyers found more advantages in this offer than minuses, because at the moment almost all apartments are bought out.  In those buildings that were commissioned, there were literally isolated options. </p>
