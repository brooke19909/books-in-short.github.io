    <h2>  Castles of Naples </h2><p>  A very interesting attraction of the city is the Egg Castle, or Castel del Ovo.  According to legend, the poet Virgil spoke an egg, placed it in an amphora, and the vessel in an iron cage, which he buried on the island of Magaride, where he built an impregnable castle.  The city will not be destroyed as long as the egg remains intact.  It is because of this legend that the castle got its name.  Today Castel del Ovo is a complex of towers of different eras.  The castle was built in 1139, in the XVII century it turned into a prison, and now it is open for tourists. </p><p>  Castel Nuovo, or Anjou Donjon, is considered another architectural masterpiece that Italy boasts.  Naples was once the capital of the Sicilian kingdom, so Karl of Anjou built a residence here.  The castle was built over five years, from 1279 to 1284.  It is a trapezoidal fortress with powerful round-shaped towers in the corners.  There is a portal of marble, it is decorated with bas-reliefs and statues. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="naples airport" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/467935.jpg" width="600"></div>
