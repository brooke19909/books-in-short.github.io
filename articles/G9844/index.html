  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Zenit-ET camera: instruction for use</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Of course, film cameras are not popular today.  But connoisseurs of the quality of professional work done, for example, with granular film, always keep a film SLR in their possession. </p><p>  The Zenit-ET camera has become one of the most popular of the DSLR line, released in those ancient Soviet times.  Consider the Zenit-ET apparatus, whose instruction will help in its productive use. </p><p>  In fact, Zenit-ET is the same Zenit-10 and -11, but this only applies to the technical side.  Outwardly, they are noticeably different. </p><p>  A huge plus of this mirror device is the automatic rewinding of the film at its end, as well as the ability to change the lens, suitable in size, with M42x1 thread.  The equipment was produced with two lenses: Helios-44-2 and Industar-50-2, which were the most popular at that time. </p><p>  So, we proceed directly to the instructions. </p><p>  <strong>Zenith ET.</strong>  <strong>SLR Camera Instruction</strong> </p><p>  First of all, of course, the film is charged into the camera.  There is nothing complicated in this action.  The device has a latch, pulling up which you can open the back, in which the culprit of this procedure should be.  On the left side you will see a place for the film.  However, before inserting it into the slot, pull the tape measure to rewind.  After putting the film in, release the tape measure and pull the protruding edge to the reel on the right so that it "looks" inside the camera.  Close the camera cover, then cock the shutter, lowering the lever to the end.  Press the button to take pictures, and then (in order for the device to supply an unlit film), cock and release the shutter twice. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Set the exposure.  Using the shutter speed scale, we connect the arrows of the exposure device and the calculator.  Stop on the 250 scale, then the diaphragm should show the number 4. </p><p>  This means that if the aperture is set to 8, then the scale will show 60, which means we set the shutter speed to 1 / 60s. </p><p>  It is also advisable to study GOST-ASA DIN for photosensitivity exposure. </p><p>  It can be installed using the disk, rotating it until it is fully fixed.  Set the aperture according to the depth of field.  Turn the ring until it clicks into place and set the proper aperture value.  The distance scale will help you choose a specific <span>depth of field</span> in accordance with the selected aperture. </p><p>  Having studied Zenit-ET once thoroughly, the instruction for its modifications will then seem to you an example for second-graders.  Now you can begin full-fledged shooting. </p><p>  You can take pictures with the whole family without leaving anyone behind the scenes.  This can be done even by a Zenit-ET <span>film camera</span> .  The instructions attached to it fully describe this method.  We will only say that it takes 7 seconds for the self-timer. </p><p>  Also, the camera provides shooting with a flash that works automatically synchronously with the shutter.  A big plus is that the flash is portable and will not interfere with your shooting, because the Zenith-ET itself weighs about one kilogram.  There are two ways to set the flash.  The first is the pin contact in the clip 10, and, of course, the plug socket.  Therefore, you can use a wired flash, being, for example, in a photo studio, or portable, which is convenient to use anywhere.  The main thing is not to disturb this convenience with "dead" batteries. </p><p>  If you have such a camera, then be sure to treat it carefully, exclude the possibility of direct sunlight in the camera lens.  Make sure that dust does not penetrate into it, because cleaning will be very painstaking when daily rubbing will be the best solution. </p><p>  The Zenit-ET camera, the instructions of which are clear to a true amateur photography, will help beginners to master the basics of the art of photography. </p>
