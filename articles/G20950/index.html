    <h2>  Shooting Process: Taking Pictures </h2><p>  We study the features of photographing using such a device as a digital camera Sony Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãShot DSC W830.  First of all, it is worth noting that the user can use one of the 4 main modes of photographing, which are available in the main menu of the device control software interface. </p><p>  In particular, the Intelligent Auto option activates the automatic selection of camera settings depending on the shooting conditions.  The corresponding module can, for example, determine whether a longer exposure is required - despite the fact that the stabilizer does not turn off, or if it is necessary to increase ISO sensitivity due to insufficient clarity of the display of the object in the camera lens. </p><p>  As we noted above, the device‚Äôs software interface allows you to manually enter various options.  Among them: <span>ISO sensitivity,</span> white balance, focus modes, dynamic optimization.  Working with these options will make the picture more vivid and clear. </p><h2>  Shooting Process: Timer </h2><p>  Among the most notable options that the Sony Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãShot DSC W830 has is a Black or Silver timer, which can also be used via the menu.  It can work: </p><p>  - after the time specified by the user; </p><p>  - when faces are detected - when the lens is pointed at them; </p><p>  - if the person filmed on the camera smiles. </p><p>  Thus, the owner of the camera has 3 different timer settings at his disposal.  Using the software interfaces of the device in question, you can configure the desired shooting scenes - for example, portrait, landscape, night. </p>

    <h2>  Features of panoramic shooting </h2><p>  It will be useful to consider the features of using the camera in panoramic mode.  The easiest way to activate it is to press the shutter button and hold it.  The camera in automatic mode will record the user's desire to start shooting in this mode. </p><p>  If necessary, the owner of the camera can use additional options when using panoramic modules.  For example, if its standard mode is selected, the camera will take panoramas in the resolution of 4912 by 1080 pixels and combine the frames when viewing about 90 degrees (if necessary, the resolution can be increased to 3424 by 1920 pixels).  In turn, you can choose a mode in which frames will be formed in a resolution of 7152 by 1080 pixels and 180 degrees of view (or, if necessary, you can set another parameter - 4912 by 1920 pixels).  You can also use the function in which panoramic shooting will be carried out with a resolution of 11520 by 1080 pixels at 360 degrees. </p>

    <h2>  Shooting process: video recording </h2><p>  We will now study the features of shooting video using the camera in question.  As we noted above, the device can record videos in HD format.  In this case, the recording speed of frames will depend on the specific video mode - PAL or NTSC.  You can select one or the other in the program menu of the camera. </p><p>  In addition, you can select standard or advanced recording quality with movie settings.  In both cases, an MP4 file will be generated using the H.264 codec.  This video format can be opened on most modern devices, which makes the Sony Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãShot DSC W830 camera - expert reviews can confirm this with a fairly universal solution. </p><p>  Video files are stored in a directory that is separate from the one in which the photos are recorded.  If the user has chosen an improved video format, they will be recorded at a speed of about 12 Mbit / s.  One minute of such recording will occupy about 90 MB of disk space.  Thus, a user who decides to shoot a long video in appropriate quality will need to stock up on memory cards.  The use of the standard shooting mode involves the formation of files that require about one and a half times less resource. </p><h2>  Shooting process: expert reviews </h2><p>  It will be useful to consider how experts evaluate the practical nuances of using the camera.  Thus, experts note the extremely high efficiency of the Beauty Effects function, which allows you to edit images directly in the camera at a quality level that may not require additional processing of images using special computer programs. </p><p>  The smart flash function is also highly appreciated: the corresponding module is designed to optimize ISO sensitivity so that all objects captured on the camera are clear and bright. </p><p>  Among the most useful features of the device in question, according to experts SteadyShot.
