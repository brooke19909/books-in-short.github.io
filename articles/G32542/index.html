    <p>  To the liking of work: </p><ul><li>  balance of the main production - in accordance with the statutory activities of the institution; </li><li>  the balance of auxiliary work reflects other types of work of the institution (trucking, public housing, etc.). </li></ul><p>  According to the configurations of the property, balances are presented in connection with the set coordination-legal figure: </p><ul><li>  national; </li><li>  urban </li><li>  cooperative; </li><li>  general companies, etc. </li></ul><h2>  Balance display </h2><p>  On the display subject, balances are divided into: </p><ul><li>  independent - such a code is drawn up by companies that are represented by attorneys; </li><li>  special - this type of balance is drawn up by structural divisions belonging to one institution (attorney's representative). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of balance analysis" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41004/1252518.jpg" width="599"></div></li></ul><p>  According to the method of purification: </p><ul><li>  ‚Äúdirty‚Äù contains stabilizing notes; it is used for the purpose of academic studies, as well as for the purpose of improving informative functions; </li><li>  ‚Äúclean‚Äù eliminates stabilizing notes; it is used in the current period of balance balance.

Papers, in turn, display data on the work of the institution for a specific time period. </p><p>  Balance, types of balance were considered above, proves and defines accounting data. </p><h2>  Veil Techniques </h2><p>  The following methods of veiling data are distinguished: </p><ol><li>  The display of values ‚Äã‚Äãin the balance sheet is not indicated in the place where they must be taken into account. </li><li>  The conclusion of accounts payable and receivable.  The funds are required to appear, indeed according to the asset (debtors) and according to the liability (creditors).  And in the code is only the difference among them (balance, balance). </li><li>  Types of balance - deduction of shortages of values ‚Äã‚Äãdue to the calculation of the discovered excesses. </li><li>  Incorrect (enhanced or decreased value of the amounts than was due) the formation of funds and reserves of the institution. </li><li>  The non-write-off of amounts to the costs of expenses related to the reporting phase. </li><li>  Introduction to the balance sheet of extraneous property. </li><li>  Formation of the code at the basis of information not substantiated by the documentation. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of balance sheet" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41004/1252517.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  The reality of balance and honesty are controversial definitions.  The code has the ability to be honest, but impossible. </p><p>  There are concepts of balance sheet valuations: fair valuations, individual and book valuations. </p><p>  The theory of fair values ‚Äã‚Äãis based on the conviction of the realized values ‚Äã‚Äãthat were introduced during the sale of the property of the institution during the period of equilibrium formation. </p><p>  The theory of individual assessments is based on the fact that the monetary value of an institution is directly dependent on the personal circumstances in which this system is located.  This only object has the ability to have different prices at various institutions. </p><p>  The theory of book ratings is based on a scale, in accordance with which the resources of the institution are listed (in books). </p><p>  None of the concepts mentioned has the ability to provide a single solution to the scale problem.  Thus, one should rely on the ratio of balance sheet assessments to established normative acts functioning in the current period. </p>
