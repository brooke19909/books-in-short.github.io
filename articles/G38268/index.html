    <p>  Drawn thread is a thin and very soft wire.  Nowadays it is made of any metal.  Spun - thin wire wound in a spiral on a thread.  Most often made of <span>gilded silver.</span>  To beat is a simple flattened wire.  It bends well and easily.  The gimp is characterized in that a flat or round wire spirals like a spring.  Not only gowns are weaved from it, but also the patterned stripes that adorn the edge of the clothes, make various pendants and applications. </p><h2>  Where is the thread for braiding </h2><p>  In Russia, they are manufactured at the Denisovsky plant, which is engaged in their production for defense needs.  Abroad gimp is also produced.  In Europe, they make military uniforms out of it.  In India, national clothes are embroidered.  Such threads can not be bought in a simple store, they simply are not available for sale.  Embroiderers and needlewomen, weaving bracelets and other jewelry, also purchase them at the factory.  In church shops you can buy a regular gimp made in Turkey.  It is quite thin, but does not contain precious metals. </p><h2>  Historical findings </h2><p>  Historians find a huge variety of different antiques decorated with embroidery and gowns.  Even in the time of the Vikings in Scandinavia, weaving from a dragged thread was widespread.  Often the embroidery was done in gold, and on the edge was framed by a gimbal from a simple thin wire. </p><p>  In Hedeby, Birka, Gotland there are gimp products similar to animal images.  So, for example, a deer was found, woven from a very thin wire, inlaid with small stones, and the base on which it seems to be standing was made from a gutter.  Various pendants are also found, with inserts of mica or leather ribbons.  Some positions and knots are woven incredibly beautiful, they are almost impossible to repeat. </p><p>  People have always sought to decorate their formal clothes.  A monument is a real work of art, because it is not so easy to weave an intricate pattern from a thin wire or thread. </p>
