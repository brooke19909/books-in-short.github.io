There the air smells of grass, the birds sing, the small river purrs.  There you can really relax with your body and soul, and go to work in Moscow, crowded with people and transport.  This is what guarantees the LCD "Opaliha Park".  Responses of buyers of real estate in it affect many important aspects of such life - infrastructure in the complex and around, transport accessibility, the obligation of the builder and even the reliability of piles for the foundation, because the rivulet is really very close here.  Let's see what actually happens on the construction site of the complex and what future residents can expect from the purchase of housing here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In one of the central regions of the <span>near Moscow region</span> , the Opalikha Park residential complex is being built.  He has the following address: the city of Krasnogorsk, the Opalikh microdistrict.  Streets, let alone house numbers, are not yet available.  But, possibly, in the future the address will be supplemented by Anikeevskaya Street, the closest located today.  Krasnogorsk itself from the center of the capital lies only 22 km, and from the Moscow Ring Road 2 km.  Its Opalikha microdistrict is located 5 km from the center of Krasnogorsk and 9 km from the Moscow Ring Road.  In recent years, the construction of new modern residential complexes is being conducted with enviable activity.  At the moment, they have been built or are at the stage of completion of as many as 3. LCD Opalikha Park has become a new project.  A place was found for him at the very river Lipka, a few steps from the forests of Istra forestry.  The private sector is located on the opposite side of the complex.  That is, from the windows of their apartments, future residents will be able to contemplate mainly the beauty of nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Opaliha park customer reviews" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1589000.jpg" width="515"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Traffic interchanges </h2><p>  There is no definite answer on how convenient the Opalikha Park residential complex is being built with respect to transport hubs.  Customer reviews differ here.  For some, the priority is the nature around, for some, familiar modern conveniences with transport, but these two points are difficult to combine.  After all, if you create a network of roads near the complex with bus stops, garages, gas stations and car repair shops, then you will have to give up natural arrays.  At the moment, in the immediate vicinity of the complex there is a road leading to <span>the Volokolamskoye highway,</span> passing directly through Krasnogorsk, or to the village of Nakhabino, and from there to the Riga highway.  It is almost 15 km to the Moscow Ring Road from the ZhK construction site, that is, the complex is being built at some distance from the center of the Opaliha microdistrict, which is about 5 km, and to the outskirts of Krasnogorsk - about 9 km. </p><p>  It is convenient that no further than 700 meters from the complex there is a railway line, as well as a railway platform.  It takes 20 minutes to get to Moscow by train, and in the future it is planned to launch high-speed electric trains. </p><p>  Another option on how to get to the Opalikha Park residential complex from the capital is to get to the Tushinskaya metro station, take buses 478 or 372 and go to the stop with the name Novo-Nikolskaya.  Next - on foot. </p><p>  Another route is to get to the Mitino metro station, and then take the bus to Nakhabino and get off at the Dachi stop.  Further, also about 3 km on foot. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The purity and beauty of natural resources is perhaps the main trump card of the Opaliha Park project.  Customer reviews are united on the issue of a favorable environmental situation in which they will have to live.  Some are confused by the nearby railway branch, but it is separated by the existing green space, so there is no inconvenience.  The fact that there is no heavy traffic route near the LCD is also good and allows people to hope for clean air.  But if you turn your eyes to Krasnogorsk, which is located not so far, then the picture is a bit upsetting.  This, in fact, a small town fell into the black list of the most ecologically unfavorable settlements of the Moscow Region.  Environmentalists are especially worried about air pollution (and this is surrounded by forests!) And the presence of hazardous chemicals in groundwater above the norm, and, in addition, the high loss of forests around Krasnogorsk due to diseases and pests.  Residential complex "Opaliha Park" from the city center at a decent distance, but still not far from the LCD had to cut down a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe forest due to its infection with pests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Opaliha Park" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1588932.jpg" width="501"></div>

According to experts, these facilities do not affect the environment of Opaliha Park.  The issue of soils is much more serious.  They are in the vicinity of Krasnogorsk are highly boggy.  The developer, in order to eliminate this problem, poured drainage cushions, made embankments, so that if everything is correctly calculated, the houses of the complex should be without problems. </p><h2>  Information about the developer </h2><p>  As you know, Avest LLC became the developer of Opalikha Park residential complex.  Reviews about this company are very restrained.  It has been on the construction market since 2005, but so far it has only one object in its asset - the residential complex actually under construction.  On the Avest website there is evidence that the company has implemented more than 20 similar projects, but perhaps it did not mean their construction from scratch, but some kind of equity participation or only the sale of redeemed real estate.  What annoys equity holders, according to reviews of many of them: </p><p>  1. Visually, there is some lag in terms of the construction of the first stage and the simultaneous presence in the DDU of a clause on the rejection of claims.  This does not give the right to compensation for damages. </p><p>  2. The absence of an officially published work schedule, so it is impossible to understand whether there is a time lag or not. </p><p>  3. Jumps in apartment prices. </p><p>  4. Unintelligible answers of some managers to questions about parking and the amount of housing already sold. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex Opaliha park" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1588854.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Planned infrastructure </h2><p>  A complex of the comfort class should be Opaliha Park.  Customer reviews note that in the future a kindergarten and a school will appear on its territory, which is what excites future residents most of all.  In the general plan of construction there is also a center of creativity for large and small, a yoga studio, sports grounds, recreation areas and playgrounds for kids.  They plan to build an excellent beach on the Lipke river, and to plant flowers and trees on the territory of the complex.  So far, the kindergarten closest to the Opalikha Park residential complex is 5.3 km, the school is 5 km, and the clinic is 6 km, which, of course, is not very convenient, especially considering that there is not a single public route to them. transport.  Access by car only.  Also, not far from the LCD there are also retail outlets.  The nearest ones are located in the central part of the Opaliha microdistrict.  The industrial park of the new residential complex occupies almost 19 hectares.  Many future residents are interested in what kind of parking will be in this area.  At first, the developer promised to make it underground so that the territory of the complex was free from cars.  Now underground parking will not be built.  According to investors, there are two reasons for this - the price of a parking place and the unfavorable condition of soils that prevent the construction of such structures.  Parking is now planned to be done ground covered, but the principle of free parking is also possible. </p>

The layout of the apartments is very different.  According to potential buyers, the most successful are the studios and one-room apartments, whose <span>living area</span> is from 18 squares, and the kitchen area is from 11 squares.  The most mixed estimates were given to the layouts of three-room apartments, in many of which, according to the architectural design, there will be beveled corners, arched walls or not very convenient placement of the bathroom and bathrooms. </p><p>  Initially, it was planned to rent out all the apartments without finishing, but with utilities and wiring.  Subsequently, the plans appeared item to rent a certain amount of housing with decoration.  Design and materials are at the discretion of the developer. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  According to many investors, the Opaliha Park residential complex is being built very slowly.  In total, two lines are outlined here.  In the first, 5 residential buildings should be commissioned (according to other sources - 3 buildings).  The keys must be issued to residents by the end of 2017, that is, in December.  The second part included the remaining buildings, a kindergarten and a school.  They are going to pass in the II quarter of next 2018. </p><p>  In mid-January 2017, the first building of 8 floors was built at the construction site, but there is no glazing, the installation of external walls has not been completed, internal work is at the stage of material delivery.
