This building monument symbolizes the place of a merciless internecine battle, a sad page in our history.  The fight ended in victory for the Moscow regiments.

    <p>  In 1557, Ivan the Terrible and his wife were present in Pereslavl at an important event - the consecration of the local church.  Queen Anastasia was in the final week of pregnancy.  After offering their prayers to the Almighty, they headed back to the capital.  Having driven off several kilometers from Pereslavl, near the village of Sobilovo, the wife of John gave birth to a son, whom they named Fedor.  <span>Theodore Stratilates was</span> considered the guardian angel of the baby <span>.</span>  At the birthplace of Fyodor Ioannovich, a cross chapel was created.  In gratitude for the appearance of the offspring, Ivan the Terrible decided to become an intercessor of the monastery.  On the territory of an old wooden cathedral in the name of St. Theodore Stratilates, the ruler creates a stone monastery, which has survived to this day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Theodore monastery </h2>

    <p>  The oldest building is considered to be <span>Theodorovsky Church</span> , created in 1557 with the money donated by John the Terrible.  The church was created in the central part of the monastery territory.  It is a powerful five-headed brick structure.  Initially, the chetverik had a beskomarnoe coating.  This was reported by the zakomar images remaining on the facades.  The roof eventually changed to a gable roof.  On the east side of the temple, three apses are adjacent to the quadrangle.  Other outdoor decoration is hidden from prying eyes.  At the end of the XIX century, the temple was decorated with a stylized gallery from three edges.  Perestroika in the monastery was carried out before.  In 1704, the obsolete porches were replaced, a small bell tower in the northwestern part of the cathedral was removed.  In the interior of <span>the temple</span> , unique murals created by the hand of the Italian specialist N. Tonchi have been preserved. </p><h2>  Vvedensky cloister </h2>

    <p>  Near the Feodorovsky Church there is a refectory church.  It was built in 1710 with money provided by the royal special Natalia Alekseevna.  Previously, a stone monastery was located on this territory, which eventually deteriorated.  The refectory church is a low but rather wide temple.  Volume increases due to large aisles.  The church has three apses, decorated with elegant half-columns.  The walls of the aisles are decorated in the same way.  One chapter rises in tier, the other - above the refectory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kazan Hospital Church </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pereslavl Zalessky Feodorovsky Monastery address" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/1955189.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Theodorovsky Monastery (Pereslavl-Zalessky) has on its territory another beautiful temple structure.  Kazan Hospital Church was built in 1714 with the money of Princess Natalia.  Immediately, two-story hospital wards were erected.  This simple and unpresentable building was badly damaged in the 18th century.  Then almost all hospital rooms were burned down, the temple was launched, so for a long period the church was closed.  To date, the monastery has been restored. </p><h2>  Other facilities </h2>

    <p>  There was a belfry in the monastery - the tallest building in Pereslavl.  It was erected in 1681-1705.  Her sound came over several kilometers.  In 1681, construction of walls and a stone tower began.  Only a part of these buildings has survived to this day.  The fence did not perform a protective function.  It was built without passages and loopholes.  The gateway church was considered a compulsory building, but money for its construction was constantly lacking.  Nowadays, the tiered bell tower was increased above the gate. </p><p>  On the north side of the main entrance to the Feodorovsky Monastery in Pereslavl-Zalessky is the hotel building, built in 1896. On the territory you can see several residential buildings of the XVII-XIX centuries.  Today, architects conducting restoration work in the Feodorov Monastery, find here a large number of ancient objects. </p><h2>  The formation of a convent </h2><p>  Until 1667, the monastery was male, but after a fatal epidemic of a deadly disease, a large number of women remained in the city, orphaned and widowed, who had nowhere to go. </p><p>  According to the decree of Patriarch Joseph and the decree of Alexei Mikhailovich, the temple, where 10 hermits lived, was reorganized into a female, and the men's brotherhood was disbanded in other churches.  In 1688, Peter the Great visited the monastery. The ruler brought in foreign weaving equipment, high-quality wool and linen and craftswomen who gave orders to learn how to spin and weave. </p><p>  Since that time, Theodorovsky Monastery in Pereslavl-Zalessky (address: Moskovskaya St., 85) has been famous for its own craft workshops.  Here weaved fabrics for the royal elite, as well as sewed spiritual clothes and made utensils.  In the XVII century, Theodore Church reached its peak, through Pereslavl began to pass the trade route from the capital to the Volga.  In 1913, the temple was visited by Nicholas II with his family.  In the monastery, the royal family was presented with various gifts.  When leaving, Nicholas II thanked him with all his heart for the friendly welcome.  In memory of the arrival of highly respected guests, a linden alley was planted, on which you can walk today. </p><p>  The history of the monastery in the Soviet period is the same as that of other temple buildings of that time.  At the beginning of the XX century it was closed.  On its small territory at different periods there was a colony for minors and a nursing home.  Then the temple was transferred to the army department.  In 1998, the monastery held the first spiritual service.  Currently, the Feodorovsky Monastery in Pereslavl-Zalessky is functioning and rapidly being restored. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In the reviews, visitors describe that the territory of the monastery is not very large.  You can get around it in just 30 minutes.  The place is very quiet, cozy and welcoming.  At the entrance, guests are greeted with fresh homemade cakes and other goodies.  The photo of the Feodorovsky monastery in Pereslavl-Zalessky, unfortunately, cannot convey all the beauty and atmosphere of this place.  It‚Äôs better to see it with your own eyes. </p>
