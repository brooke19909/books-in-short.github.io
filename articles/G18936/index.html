  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to go if you urgently need money - a pawnshop as a solution</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Situations are different, and each person may encounter such a problem when money is needed urgently.  It happens that the disease was taken aback and medicines are urgently needed, or maybe they simply didn‚Äôt calculate it at sea after rest and were left without money. </p><p>  In such critical cases comes to the rescue <noindex>  <span>jewelry pawnshop</span> </noindex>  .  Its advantage is that money can be received immediately, within 10-15 minutes.  Most pawnshops require an identification document to verify that the item is not stolen.  The pawnshop does not want problems with the police, which the stolen thing can simply be taken away as evidence. </p><p>  The minus of the pawnshop can be called that the amount issued will be less than about half the real value of the thing.  But the pawnshop earns on this without risking anything.  This is due to such a quick service and cash withdrawal. </p><p>  The pawnshop provides loans for a short time, usually from a month to two.  If the client after this time does not pay the debt, the pawnshop will simply pick up the collateral thing.  Best at pawnshops accept jewelry of the highest standard.  If gold is not of the highest standard, then the pawnshop will pay a penny for it, since its remelting and resale to the pawnshop is not profitable.  Pawnshops can take anything as collateral - telephones, electronics, even a car.  But to assess the real value of such things will take more time, and gold is estimated instantly by the number of grams and sample.  You need to understand about the weight of gold and its sample, so as not to be deceived by the employees of the pawnshop.  Sometimes the sample is visible with the naked eye, but a magnifier may be needed.  The number of grams can be found by weighing the jewelry in another pawnshop.  If the product is with a precious stone, then it is evaluated separately. </p><p>  In pawnshops often hand over such jewelry that have high historical and archaeological value, without even realizing it.  Therefore, it is important to carefully consider all the inscriptions and stamps on the jewelry, if its origin is not known for sure.  By such an error, you can hand over for a hundred dollars a thing that costs several thousand. </p><p>  The whole transaction is documented in which the amount of the loan and interest on it, as well as the contract are recorded.  It is better to take a business card with you to call if you suddenly have problems.  It will not be very convenient to go to another city if the collateral thing has remained there.  But if the network of pawnshops is well known and developed, then you can agree on its receipt at any of the pawnshop offices in other cities. </p><p>  When money is urgently needed, a person in a panic may not understand much.  Turning to a pawnshop, you need to weigh everything well, because this is also a form of lending, and it should be acceptable in terms of the price of the loan. </p></div></article>
