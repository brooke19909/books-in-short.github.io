    <h2>  Large microdistricts </h2><p>  There are such micro-districts in this city that they can be safely mistaken for full-fledged large areas.  These include Donskaya Street, Makarenko, Mamaika and New Sochi.  It is worth talking about them in more detail. </p><p>  Donskaya, for example, is one of the noisiest and busiest in the whole city.  This is where a lot of shops are located, Sochi meat factory is also located there.  Donskaya street is also considered one of the oldest neighborhoods in all of Sochi.  However, not the most comfortable, because there is a very busy traffic. </p><p>  A few words should be said about such an area as Mamaica.  There is a boarding school in which children who are lagging behind in development study and are brought up.  But Makarenko is the most peaceful neighborhood.  It is ideal for a peaceful holiday, as all the sights and noisy tourist places are far from it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Adler - the legend of Sochi </h2><p>  Speaking about the areas of Sochi, you can not say anything about Adler.  It is in fairness the most interesting, expensive and most visited.  By the way, there are still disputes over whether it can be called a separate city.  But no, in fact it is part of Sochi.  The Adler district is notable for the fact that the Olympics, Formula 1 and other large-scale competitions, festivals, events, etc. were held here.  In addition, it is in the Adler region (slightly above it) that the famous ski resort with the beautiful name "Krasnaya Polyana" is located. </p><p>  Also in Adler is the Resort Town - a place where a huge number of hotel complexes, guest houses and hotels are concentrated.  <span>Nizhneimeretinskaya Bay is</span> also located here - the <span>Olympic Village</span> was erected next to it <span>.</span>  The Adler district of Sochi is the most popular, it has everything that is needed for a good rest.  Entertainment, various nightlife <span>, Sochi Park,</span> beaches - this and much more attracts the attention of many tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Peace and quiet </h2><p>  Many <span>areas of Sochi are</span> noisy and lively, but there are also those that are considered the ideal place for privacy and tranquility.  These include Lazarevsky.  Not many people live here as in Adler or in the center, and a large number of small villages are dispersed here.  Here is Dagomys - a microdistrict named after the river that flows into the Black Sea.  Today this village is considered a resort, but few people know that it was originally created for peasants who served the cottages of wealthy landowners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another village of the Lazarevsky district is called Loo.  One of the most comfortable and secluded corners of Sochi.  Based on this specificity, a comic transcript of the name of the village appeared: Loo - I Like Relaxing Alone.  Indeed, solo travelers, tired of city noise and routine, are often found here.  The rest go to Adler. </p><h2>  For those wishing to improve their health </h2><p>  So, the districts of Sochi are noisy, quiet and ... therapeutic.  These include Matsesta.  From the Adyghe language this name translates as "fiery water".  What kind of place is it?  Hydrogen sulfide waters flow here, which brought fame to the resort.  To improve their health, people from all over the world come here.  The truly unique healing properties of Matsesta waters and mud work wonders.  Since 1902, Matsesta became famous and still continues to receive tourists from different cities and countries. </p><p>  By the way, Matsesta is closer to the Adler district - this is another reason why it is so popular. </p>

    <h2>  Khostinsky District </h2><p>  Hosta is also included in the regions of Sochi.  It is also called Khostinsky.  He was baptized in honor of the river flowing nearby.  From Adyghe, again, Khosta is translated as "clear water".  What is the difference between this area and the rest?  Stunning landscapes, <span>high mountains,</span> approaching the sea, and comfortable air temperature.  For this reason, several centuries ago, people actively settled here.  Only some were stopped by malaria.  However, today this is not a problem - it simply is not here, it has disappeared. </p><p>  By the way, Hosta was originally supposed to be an industrial point.  Factories for the production of artificial ice and brick began to appear, and a sea station and a railway station were erected.  But then, in the middle of the last century, the tourism industry began to develop actively - several hotels, pensions and sanatoriums were built, which are still standing. </p>

    <h2>  Center - for business and activities </h2><p>  Well, the city of Sochi, the regions of which were examined above, is very diverse and multifaceted.  A well-developed metropolis with many hotels, pensions, large companies - there is everything that is necessary for a full life, work, leisure and self-development.  In the end, I would like to say about the most important thing with regard to Sochi.  Central district - we will talk about it. </p><p>  What can I say about him?  Numerous shopping centers, companies, firms, banks, entertainment venues, restaurants, bars, business centers, hotel complexes ... There is everything in order to work productively.  So the majority of city residents, even if they live in Adler or in Lazarevsky, are employed here.  But all areas of Sochi have a well-developed <span>transport infrastructure,</span> so there are no problems with moving. </p>
