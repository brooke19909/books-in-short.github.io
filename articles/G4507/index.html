    <h2>  The story of the first Summer Palace </h2><p>  After the construction of the Admiralty began on the left Neva coast, residential buildings began to appear house after house.  Peter I also chose a site for his residence - the territory on the Neva coast between the river Mie (Mayka) and Bezymyanny Erik (Fontanka).  The First Summer Palace of <span>Peter the Great</span> was a small wooden structure.  The plastered and painted structure did not stand out among other buildings located in the neighborhood, and not much resembled the royal residence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Symbol of the new policy of Russia </h2><p>  The victory near Poltava in 1709 meant a turning point in the Northern War in favor of the Russian army.  In St. Petersburg, the hasty construction of numerous stone buildings began.  During this period, the Swan Channel was laid, which connected the Sink with the Neva.  As a result of this, a small island was formed between the rivers.  It was on this piece of land that Peter I decided to build a stone palace.  By order of the tsar, a project was created that symbolized the new political direction of Russia.  The architect of the Trezzini Summer Palace proposed to arrange the building of the future royal residence in such a way that the same number of windows faces both west and east.  Peter I approved this idea, and on August 18, 1710 the construction of the palace began, which was completed in April 1712. </p><h2>  Summer house </h2><p>  An amazing feature of this building was that when it was erected, the first sewage system of the city was built.  Water was pumped into the house using pumps, and the drain went to Fontanka.  Since the Summer Palace was surrounded on three sides by water, the river itself was the driving force.  However, after the flood in 1777, the small bay of Havanets, located in front of the house, had to be filled up.  This led to the fact that the first sewage system ceased to function. </p>

    <h2>  First floor of the palace </h2><p>  The king moved to the Summer Palace, the photo of which is presented below, with his whole family immediately after the construction was completed and lived in it from spring to late autumn.  It occupied six rooms located on the ground floor, including a bedroom with a fireplace.  Nearby was the reception room, where various meetings were held and important matters were decided.  The king‚Äôs favorite place was a lathe with a machine, where the emperor mastered the craft of a carpenter in his spare time.  He spared no effort to work and was proud that he had corns on his hands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The second floor of the palace </h2><p>  The summer palace of Peter I also had a second floor, which was led by a massive oak staircase.  There were six rooms in which the queen was housed with her maids of honor and children.  The interior of the second floor was significantly different from the first, since there were a huge number of mirrors and paintings.  Near the bedroom of Catherine I was a beautifully designed throne room in which the queen decided her affairs.  The green office surprised visitors with its magnificent gilded decoration, numerous figures of ivory and wood, as well as amazingly beautiful Chinese frescoes.  For parties and dances, a special room was allocated. </p>

    <h2>  Summer garden </h2><p>  In 1720, a magnificent garden was built near the palace, which resembled a huge park.  Beautiful paths stretch across the entire garden.  They share the array with beautifully trimmed trees and shrubs.  Sculptures symbolizing Russia were installed throughout the territory.  In addition, there were many busts of marble in the garden, the creation of which involved the best Italian masters.  Particular attention was paid to the construction of fountains, which served as a decoration of the palace grounds.  Due to the fact that the Summer Palace was surrounded by water on three sides, special boats were offered for walks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Historical memo </h2><p>  The king was very fond of the Summer Palace.  It was here that he spent the last days of his life.  In 1725, in the lobby of the palace, Peter I was attacked by one of the schismatics, which ended in death.  After the death of the king, Catherine I never lived in a residence.  For some time there were meetings of the <span>Supreme Privy Council,</span> but in the end the palace became the resting place of the imperial court. </p>

    <h2>  All beautiful is forever </h2><p>  After three centuries, the Summer Palace in St. Petersburg virtually unchanged.  Time has not made adjustments to the exterior of the palace.  To this day, not only the strict appearance of the building, built in the Baroque style, but also the summer frieze under the roof, consisting of twenty-nine bas-reliefs that divide the floors, has been preserved.  Drains built in the form of winged dragons are preserved under a high four-sloped roof, and a weather vane in the form of George the Victorious is installed on it, showing the <span>direction of the wind.</span>  In addition to the appearance, the main part of the interior decoration has been preserved: artistic carvings on the walls, painted ceilings and tiled stoves.  The Green Cabinet, the dining room and those rooms in which the royal maids of honor lived in almost the same form. </p><h2>  Tour of the Summer Palace </h2><p>  Today this palace is rightfully included in the "Best Attractions of St. Petersburg" section.  Thousands of tourists are eager to visit it.  What can be seen in the palace? </p><p>  The main decoration of the lobby is a large panel - a bas-relief of Minerva, carved in wood.  One cannot but pay attention to the door, the platbands on which are made of black marble.  She leads to the room, which was once the king‚Äôs reception room.  The following room is intended for orderlies, it is not of particular interest.  Next is the Assembly (Second reception), the main decoration of which is the ceiling ‚ÄúTriumph of Russia‚Äù.  And between the windows is the Admiralty Chair, previously owned by Peter I. Behind the second reception room is a narrow room that once served as the wardrobe of the king. </p>

    <p>  Continuing to inspect the Summer Palace, we move on to the next room - the emperor‚Äôs office, where some of the king‚Äôs personal belongings are preserved.  So, of interest is the gift of the English king George I - a ship <span>watch with a compass.</span>  In the corner there is an oak cabinet with beautiful carvings.  In the center is a huge table and a work chair.  From the office leads the door to the royal bedroom.  It attracts the attention of the ceiling, which depicts the sleep god Morpheus, holding poppy heads in his hands.  Looking at it, determining the purpose of the room is not difficult.  In the bedroom there is a beautiful fireplace, in which, according to legend, the royal royal jester Balakirev was hiding. </p>
