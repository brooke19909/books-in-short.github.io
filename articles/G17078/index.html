    <h2>  The most useful services in the "Mobile Bank" </h2><p>  Solving financial issues is very convenient within the framework of the Mobile Bank service (Sberbank).  The "economical" package, the description of which will be presented below, allows you to perform the most common operations right at home.  To carry out expenditure operations, you must visit the ‚ÄúYour Cards‚Äù menu and select the necessary card with which you plan to pay.  Next, click the "Activate" button.  After entering the session key, you will be able to log in.  The item ‚ÄúYour accounts‚Äù is useful in that it allows you to find out the residual cash balance without the help of an ATM or cashier.  The expense transaction itself can also be carried out in the section ‚ÄúPayment for services‚Äù.  The application can be downloaded from the official website of the bank, both on the phone and on the computer.  Software is provided for operating systems such as Android, iOS (iPhone, iPad) and Windows Phone. </p><h2>  Integrated Security </h2><p>  A separate feature can be called a high level of security, which has a "Mobile Bank" (Sberbank).  An ‚Äúeconomical‚Äù package (they can also tell how to connect it in any department) is a guarantee of confidentiality of information.  Due to the fact that the service provides full access to accounts and the ability to redirect personal funds flows in the right direction, the financial institution paid great attention to the system of protection against fraudsters.  To access the office you need to know a huge amount of identification data, which significantly limits the ability of attackers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Do not share your personal data with third parties. </h2><p>  Here we make a reservation that neither passwords nor session keys should under any circumstances be handed over to third parties.  It is necessary to pay attention to the form in which the bank employee issues the key.  It must be sealed.  If the keys are lost, you must urgently contact the bank and ask for new ones.  This will save you trouble if attackers decide to use other people's data. </p>

    <h2>  Package "Economical": list of services </h2><p>  The financial institution offers two formats of partnership to maximize the satisfaction of the needs of its customers.  Flexibility and focus on the interests of everyone is one of the main advantages of a service such as Mobile Bank (Sberbank).  The "economical" package (what is included in it, we understand this article) does not require additional payment.  Basic services are provided free of charge, but for some manipulations you still have to pay extra.  For example, if you need to get a report on the last five card transactions, one request will cost about 15 rubles.  For SMS notifications about settlement transactions, no money will be charged.  A subscription fee, as in the case of the Full package, is not required. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúFull‚Äù package provides a subscription fee of 60 rubles.  The partnership program provides full access to all possible operations within the bank.  The funds are debited automatically from the card account.  If the bank client does not have money at the time of writing off the funds, mobile banking is blocked until the card is replenished. </p><h2>  The specifics of the offer of Sberbank </h2><p>  Almost everyone faced a situation where they had to wait hours in line at a bank branch in order to make a monthly payment or pay for a certain service.  This required not only incredible strength, but also a huge investment of time and nerves.  "Mobile Bank" (Sberbank, "Economical" package), which, as mentioned above, is aimed at reducing the activity of customers in the branch and is focused on creating the most convenient format for cooperation. </p><h2>  Mobile banking to combat fraud </h2>

    <p>  Recently, there have been very frequent cases of cash withdrawals by fraudsters at ATMs.  The sad statistics prompted the leadership of the financial institution to radically change the partnership policy.  To say more, "Mobile Bank" is adapted even to the needs of Sberbank international cardholders.  A client of an institution located outside of Russia can use the application to carry out almost any banking operation with minimal effort. </p><h2>  Full list of services available to customers of Mobile Bank </h2><p>  One of the most convenient services of the largest bank in Russia is the ability to connect to the Mobile Bank (Sberbank) service.  The ‚Äúeconomical‚Äù package how to switch to the ‚ÄúFull‚Äù package will be discussed below, but for now, let's get acquainted with the full list of available services within the framework of the functionality.  So, each participant in the system can: </p><ul><li>  Top up your mobile phone account or the phone of another subscriber with your credit card.  You can configure banking in such a way that the recharge of a mobile account is carried out automatically at a specified time and for a certain amount. </li><li>  Get full reporting on accounts (expense transactions, income transactions, statistics on all operations for a certain period). </li><li>  If fraud is discovered on one of the accounts, submit a request and block it immediately. </li><li>  Make payments to organizations that have partnership agreements with Sberbank. </li><li>  Transfer funds to cards of other clients, to accounts of charity funds. </li><li>  Make deposit replenishment and loan repayment. </li><li>  Monitor and track the illegal operations of fraudsters through informing via SMS, which offers "Mobile Bank" (Sberbank, "Economy" package).  How to check the balance on the card in case of notification of an imperfect operation, technical support staff will tell you. </li><li>  Take advantage of comprehensive information on the latest news from Sberbank. </li></ul><p>  Systematically lends itself to the expansion and modernization of the "Mobile Bank" (Sberbank, "Economy" package).  What kind of product this will turn out in the end, one can only guess. </p><h2>  Current mobile bank rates </h2>

    <p>  Every client of a financial institution that uses the capabilities of the Mobile Bank (Sberbank) service can change the "Economy" package to "Full" at any time.  It is worth mentioning the wider possibilities of the ‚ÄúFull‚Äù package, which, unlike its ‚ÄúEconomical‚Äù counterpart, offers open access to information regarding the flow of funds for each of the accounts.  The advantage of the ‚ÄúEconomical‚Äù offer is that in the absence of money in the account, online banking will not be disabled.  After the client connects to the service, he is given a trial period of several months, during which payment for the application is not charged.  Let us dwell on the cost of the proposal in detail: </p><ul><li>  Holders of Platinum, VisaGold and Mastercard cards get access to their personal account for free. </li><li>  The owners of Momentum, Maestro and VisaElectron cards must pay about 30 rubles per month. </li><li>  Customers with Mastercard Standart and VisaClassic cards will pay 60 rubles per month. </li></ul><h2>  Possible difficulties </h2>

    <p>  Despite the fact that Mobile Bank has opened up enormous advantages for Sberbank customers, its technical component is not perfect.  Functional users quite often complain about the system freezing and the inoperability of individual buttons and functions.  There are cases when the service is not activated after three days from the date of registration.  This is most often due to errors when connecting a new client.  Having informed the employee of the department about the situation, you will solve all difficulties very quickly.  The facts of theft and transfer of funds from customer accounts were recorded, with which representatives of the bank could not do anything.  People had to contact the prosecutor.  Fortunately, such cases are rare, and inattentive people become their participants.  If you deal with the issue in detail and study the rules, no problems will arise as you use the Mobile Bank application (Sberbank, "Economy" package).  What is included in it, what precautions should be observed, what is possible and what cannot be done are issues that should definitely be studied on the eve of connecting the service. </p>
