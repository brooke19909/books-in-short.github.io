    <h2>  Hotel Services </h2><p>  The hotel has paid and free services. </p><p>  They provide free room service, cots, sun loungers and umbrellas on the beach and near the pool, a bottle of drinking water daily and the ability to use a safe and a left-luggage office at the reception.  Throughout the hotel guests are offered free Wi-Fi (including on the beach).  During lunch in the Cleopatra restaurant you can enjoy ice cream, and from 3 to 5 pm smoke a hookah in the beach bar.  Also, at no extra charge, you can visit the hotel's water park, bask in the sauna or go to a disco (for drinks - a fee). </p><p>  Do not count on visiting the jacuzzi in King Tut Aqua Park 4 *, a photo of which is posted in almost every hotel brochure.  More precisely, there is a jacuzzi here, but far from being so attractive: located on the roof of the hotel, with dirty water and weak streams. </p><p>  For a fee, you can use the laundry, hairdresser and beauty salon, call a doctor, order a transfer to the airport, rent a car to travel around the resort, and even order a limousine.  You can also purchase the necessary things for yourself and souvenirs for friends in small shops and shops that the King Tut Aqua Park 4 * hotel has located on its territory.  Guest reviews warn of poor quality hotel laundry.  When ironing, things are often spoiled here, without compensating for the cost of damaged clothes. </p>

    <h2>  Beach, pool </h2><p>  King Tut Aqua Park Beach Resort 4 * hotel is located on the first coastline, less than 200 meters from the sea.  The hotel has its own small sand and pebble beach with a comfortable gentle entry into the water.  The sea forms here a small lagoon, in which children and vacationers who are poorly kept on water can calmly frolic.  However, you should take care of special shoes for entering the water, since there are many sharp pebbles and sea urchins.  A live coral reef is located not far from the beach, and another hundred meters from the shore, with many bright fish, sometimes found barracudas and turtles.  For those who like to dive from the beach to the sea, a pier separates the territories of two hotels. </p><p>  The beach of a neighboring hotel (use is free for guests of King Tut Aqua Park 4 *) tourist reviews recommend for people who know how to swim well: the sea is immediately deep (three meters from the coast, the depth is more than five meters).  Sunset at sea - on paved steps from a stone slab.  The bottom here is ugly, a lot of construction debris, the reef is dead. </p>

    <p>  The beaches are equipped with sun loungers with mattresses and umbrellas, beach towels are provided (once a day).  The waiters from the bar serve guests of the hotel, offering drinks and fruits. </p><p>  Located in the city of Hurghada, King Tut Aqua Park 4 * offers its guests two large outdoor pools, in one of them from December 1, water is heated.  The water in the pools is fresh, around there are sun loungers with mattresses and umbrellas. </p><p>  Also, guests of the King Tut Aqua Park 4 * hotel can use the pools, beach and bars of the neighboring Sphinx Aqua Park Beach Resort 4 *. </p><h2>  Aquapark </h2><p>  In addition to swimming pools and beaches, tourists can have fun in the water park of a nearby hotel.  It is small, with heated water in the winter.  For children there are three slides and a children's pool.  For adults, 4 slides are installed here: one is low, gentle, double, the second is straight, rather steep, the third is spiral, open, the fourth is closed, spiral.  When visiting the water park, you should be careful: the joints on the slides can be poorly fitted, and there is a high risk of getting hematomas.  Also, reviews note the inconvenience of climbing up for a descent from the hills - for these purposes only one staircase is provided, which is rarely cleaned. </p><h2>  Leisure for adults </h2><p>  Regarding the animation at the King Tut Aqua Park 4 * hotel, the reviews were divided.  Some guests complain about the boring monotonous animation, the lack of a good evening program, while others, on the contrary, are completely satisfied with their excellent leisure and colorful shows. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has a Russian-speaking animation team.  During the day you can go to belly dance classes or try your hand at windsurfing, play water polo or do gymnastics, conduct water aerobics classes twice a day in the pool of the water park.  Daytime animation is unobtrusive, not too noisy, for the most part these are activities in various sports.  Twice a week, the hotel organizes holidays. </p><p>  There are two tables on the territory of the Isis bar: a billiard table and a table tennis table.  There are no declared basketball and volleyball courts, as well as a tennis court at King Tut Aqua Park 4 * hotel.  There is a ball court at the nearby Sphinx Hotel, but the net and balls are not always there. </p><p>  Evening animation at the hotel is represented by a disco, which hosts a variety of comic games and contests.  Sometimes you can watch fire shows, fakir numbers or oriental dances. </p><h2>  Children's animation </h2><p>  For children, the King Tut Aqua Park 4 * hotel has a good playground with a large selection of swings and horizontal bars, there is a shallow pool and children's slides in the water park.  During the day, animators deal with children, hold competitions, arrange active and calm (attentiveness, erudition, dexterity) games.  Those who want to make crafts or draw pictures can go to the kids club.  In the evening, a mini-disco with fun children's songs and contests is held for young guests of the hotel, once a week they choose a mini-miss and Mr. Hotel. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Those who want to diversify their beach holidays can go on various excursions, which can be purchased at the reception or on the beach, with local guides (the second offer will be cheaper and more interesting).  The most popular city tours, fishing and a trip to Cairo. </p><p>  A sightseeing tour of Hurghada will help guests of the resort to get to know this city, which 18 years ago was a small fishing village.  The guide will tell about the history of this region, show two sides of this city - the bright and beautiful tourist and poor real life of local residents (the second part of the tour is carried out at the request of the group).  In addition to the <span>Coptic Church</span> and the mosque of St. Abdulhasan Elshazi (the main Muslim temple of the city), there are no attractions here, the trip is more likely to be interesting for those who want to walk around the colorful oriental bazaar with a lot of merchants and wander around the shops veiled under the name of the museum of aromatic oils, the museum papyrus, hibiscus factories and gold factories, where you can learn something new about manufacturing processes and product properties and purchase small souvenirs. </p>

    <p>  If you love the sea and want to participate in the fishing process, then, of course, you will be interested in sea fishing.  Usually the tour starts at 9 am: group members are taken from hotels and taken to the pier with many boats.  Further, as elsewhere - access to the sea, the issuance of equipment and fishing itself.  Fishing rods here are a small stick on which you need to reel the fishing line, using chopped squid carcasses or pieces of the same fish as profit.  The nibble is excellent, the fish is caught differently: from a small inedible colorful picasso to impressive sea bass.  Those who wish can swim in the sea on the other side of the boat.  At the end of fishing, a delicious lunch prepared from freshly caught fish awaits everyone. </p><p>  Those who want to see one of the wonders of the world - the Egyptian pyramids - can go on an excursion to the capital of the country - Cairo.  This is a long tour, which will take a whole day (some companies offer two-day options with a stop in Alexandria).  After midnight, a comfortable bus will pick you up from the hotel to deliver you to the modern metropolis of Cairo in the morning.  A large number of museums, architectural monuments and other attractions have been collected on the territory of the city, which are impossible to see in one day.  Therefore, as part of the tour, you will visit the most ambitious and famous beauties of this country: the national museum, which contains a huge number of treasures of the pharaohs, jewelry, statues, various artifacts, unique sarcophagi and mummies, the pyramids of Giza, whose monumentalism amazes and delights, and the Great Sphinx, whose lion's body is crowned by the head of the pharaoh.  In addition to the main attractions, you will visit the Museum of Papyrus and the factory of essential oils, where they will tell and show all the technology of their manufacture and offer to buy a small souvenir in memory of visiting museums. </p>

    <p>  On the road, it is advisable to take a small pillow with you to sleep comfortably on the bus, drinking water, money for additional expenses (visiting the pyramids and museums, buying small souvenirs).  Tourists who have already visited this tour caution to give photographic equipment into the hands of the local population, ride camels near the pyramids (a well-known local joke: you will climb a camel for free, but you will have to fork out to go down to the ground) and advise you to avoid too annoying sellers, which offer free postcards and souvenirs. </p><p>  Rest at the King Tut Aqua Park 4 * hotel, located in Hurghada, on the Red Sea coast, is suitable for those who love travel and excursions and are looking for affordable accommodation in Egypt.  A beautiful sea reef and its own water park are the undoubted advantages of the hotel, which help to turn a blind eye to some of its shortcomings. </p>
