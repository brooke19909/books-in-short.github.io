In terms of service, they are in no way inferior to European ones.  The picturesque village of Kabardinka, which is located on the shore of the Tsemess Bay near the city of Gelendzhik, is one of the most comfortable resorts in the Krasnodar Territory in terms of climate.  The percentage of air humidity in this area is low, the number of sunny days in the summer season is maximum, and rainfall here is a rare occurrence.  This is probably why the hotel complexes of the <span>Kabardinka resort</span> (5 * Nadezhda Hotel, Solnechny Sanatorium, etc.) are so popular among Russians and tourists from neighboring countries. </p><p>  The range of prices for holidays in this village is very large.  If you wish, you can find inexpensive accommodation in a comfortable guesthouse or budget hotel.  However, if sufficient funds are available, you can relax more than comfortably and take a full relaxation course by visiting the Nadezhda SPA Hotel.  Kabardinka today falls into the rating of the best resorts of the Black Sea coast of Russia precisely thanks to the location of this truly chic hotel on its territory.  In this article you will find complete information regarding the conditions of accommodation, services and advantages of the mentioned hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kabardinka hotel hope" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/458461.jpg" width="500"></div>
