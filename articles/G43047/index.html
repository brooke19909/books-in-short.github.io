Their main distinguishing characteristic is that they have only one fixed end on the bone structures, and the second is woven into soft tissues, forming a mobile attachment point.  The <span>contraction of the muscles of the face</span> causes not only the work of the muscle itself, but also, more importantly, it provides for the displacement of the skin, the formation of folds and, located around the natural openings, ensures their specific functions.  What is the function of the circular muscle of the eye and the circular muscle of the mouth, we will consider in more detail in this article. </p>

    <h2>  What is the muscle around the eye </h2><p>  Before proceeding to the consideration of the functions of a given muscle, it is worth briefly dwelling on its structure, since each of its parts ensures the performance of individual actions. </p><p>  Anatomically, the circular muscle of the eye is represented by three sections: </p><ol><li>  Orbital. </li><li>  Tearful. </li><li>  Century old. </li></ol><h2>  Orbital part </h2><p>  The function of the circular muscle of the eye (its orbital part) is to narrow the entrance to the orbit by simultaneously and unidirectionally reducing the fibers by dropping the eyebrow and raising the cheek.  With the defeat of the innervation of this area, there is a lack of muscle contractions and a typical appearance appears (an ajar eye and a lowered cheek). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lacrimal part </h2><p>  The lacrimal part is represented by a small amount of muscle fibers located between the orbit and the upper eyelid, which bend around the lacrimal sac along its route.  With the contraction of this muscle, there is a fairly strong pressure on the aforementioned bag, and a tear is extracted into the nasolacrimal duct.  The function of the circular muscle of the eye (its lacrimal part) is better, the stronger the eye is closed. </p><h2>  Century </h2><p>  Judging by the name, this part provides a reduction in eyelids.  The subtlety lies in the fact that there is a simultaneous closure of the lower and upper eyelids, respectively, on average by 3 and 10 millimeters.  The function of the circular muscle of the eye of this part also provides a softening of the cornea with a tear. </p><p>  As you can see, a relatively small and non-massive muscle performs a number of important functions that ensure the normal functioning of the eyes and give certain features to our appearance. </p>

    <h2>  Circular muscle of the eye - innervation </h2><p>  The general innervation of the face, including the muscles around the eyes, is provided by the facial nerve.  The neuromuscular conduction of this zone is mainly represented by its two large branches: the zygomatic and temporal.  Due to their large size and surface location, they are often injured and inflamed.  As a result, the circular muscle of the eye cannot perform its functions and at all becomes paralyzed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Eye area tension </h2><p>  <span>The organ of vision is</span> subject to heavy loads during the day.  During a person‚Äôs wakefulness, the circular muscle of the eye experiences quite a lot of tension.  Working at the computer, watching videos and TV shows, reading and continuous visual load, bright light and a rapidly changing picture - strain the organ of vision and the muscle around the eyes. </p><p>  Scientists have proven a direct relationship between the work of this muscle and the one that provides a change in the curvature of the lens.  Thus, if the function of the circular muscle of the eye is impaired, lymphatic outflow and venous stasis may occur, up to an increase in intracranial pressure. </p><p>  Therefore, you do not need to test your body for strength.  With increased visual load, it is imperative to unload and rest.  The most effective method of relaxing the circular muscle is a simple contemplation of nature, when the gaze is not fixed on one object, but perceives the general picture. </p><p>  Reflex movements to relax the muscles of the eyes is rubbing them.  Although there are more effective exercises aimed not only at relieving spasm, but also at preventing and eliminating existing problems, which we will consider further. </p><h2>  Circular muscle exercises </h2><p>  Light exercises and a little gymnastics of the muscles that ensure the functioning of the organ of vision will help not only to relieve and relax them, but also improve blood circulation in this area, which will certainly appear in appearance, give it freshness, smooth wrinkles and give skin elasticity and youth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What is necessary: </p><ul><li>  10-15 minutes of free time; </li><li>  good mood; </li><li>  Wash the hands; </li><li>  stand in front of the mirror; </li><li>  Follow these guidelines. </li></ul>

    <p>  <em>Exercise number 1</em> </p><p>  Stand in front of the mirror and visually imagine exactly where you have the circular muscle of the eye.  The exercise to strengthen this zone does not require special skills.  All that is needed is to position the fingers correctly.  On the outer edges should be the index and middle fingers.  No need to apply great pressure.  All movements should be soft, clear and unidirectional.  Now, as it were, fix the skin with your fingers so that during the exercise it remains immobilized.  In this starting position, raise the lower eyelid as high as possible.  If at this moment the muscle tension around the eye is intensely felt, then the technique for performing the exercise is correct.  Alternate tension with relaxation.  Fixing the gaze for 5-6 seconds, relaxation - 2-3 seconds.  It is necessary to produce 5-6 such repetitions. </p><p>  Be sure to ensure that other facial muscles are not involved.  If you feel their work, then just open your mouth (this will help not only to be distracted, but also to concentrate on the work of the desired zone). </p><p>  <em>Exercise number 2</em> </p><p>  The following actions are aimed at maintaining muscle tone and preventing the appearance of facial wrinkles around the eyes.  So, let's start: close your eyes and tightly close the upper eyelid to the lower.  When performing this exercise, in no case should you put pressure on the eyeball.  Firstly, it is harmful; secondly, you will use other muscles.  And we need only the circular muscle of the eye to work.  The functions of this muscle are multidirectional, therefore, the effect of the exercise will also be significant. </p><p>  After you learn to control yourself and close your eyelids correctly, place two fingers of the corresponding hand in the corners of the eyes.  The force of pressing should be palpable, but in no case painful.  Simultaneously increase finger pressure with increasing lowering force of the upper eyelid.  All actions should be smooth and enjoyable.  In no case do not shift the skin that is located under your fingers. </p><p>  When doing the exercise, mentally imagine what happens as the muscles around the eyes contract and relax.  Fix yourself, stop, count in your mind up to ten and also smoothly perform the reverse actions.  Repeat the exercise five times, keeping small pauses (only a few seconds) between them.  Watch your breath.  This will help to concentrate on the manipulations and make the exercise more effective. </p><p>  For complete relaxation, you can turn on beautiful, calm music and combine business with pleasure.  In order for the result to be noticeable not only for you, but also for others, the exercise should be regular.  It is advisable to do them daily, alternating between each other. </p><h2>  Circular muscle of the mouth </h2><p>  Missing the complex structure of the circular muscle of the mouth, I would like to dwell in more detail on the functions it performs.  It‚Äôs not a secret for anyone that thanks to our oral cavity we can not only eat, but also talk, sing, laugh, etc. Performing these familiar things, we don‚Äôt even think about how it all happens, which muscles are involved - all occurs reflexively. </p>

    <p>  The main function of this muscle is the work of the lips.  Thanks to its reduction, we can stretch them into a tube, wrap, close or open.  Also, the circular muscle of the mouth is a kind of external sphincter that provides closure of the <span>oral cavity.</span>  Well, undoubtedly, thanks to the work of this muscle as well, each of us has a unique smile that can change depending on our mood or desire. </p><p>  As you can see, the function of the circular muscle of the eye and the circular muscle of the mouth are equally important, so do not neglect their significance, but make the most of their possibilities so that they work as expected. </p><h2>  <span>Clamps the muscle</span> located around the mouth </h2><p>  If we are talking about the functional clamps of this area, then they are quite common, but still amenable to correction with diligence and the right approach.  In contrast to organic lesions, when in 99% of cases it is already impossible to do at least something. </p><p>  Functional clamps in this area are directly related to the psycho-emotional state of a person, his hostility to anything in question.  As a result, a person with the help of his lips expresses a certain emotion: resentment, disappointment, disgust, and so on. </p>

    <h2>  Circular Muscle Exercises </h2><p>  In order to train this muscle, it is only necessary, fixing the skin and not using any other muscle, to make alternately all possible movements of the lips.  After performing one action, for example, stretching out the lips with a tube, fix for several seconds in this position.  Before moving on to the next exercise, do a minimum of 3-5 repetitions.  To enhance the effect of this exercise, while you pull your lips into a tube, draw air into your cheeks and alternately move the air from one side to the other. </p>

    <p>  It is recommended to perform exercises in front of the mirror, as well as working with the circular muscle of the eyes.  This will help you concentrate on charging and perform it as efficiently as possible. </p><p>  To prevent <span>wrinkles around your mouth</span> or to eliminate existing ones, do the following exercise.  Compress the upper and lower lips as much as possible without interlocking your teeth.  Use your index finger to make measured strokes in the midline of the lips.  Then, with massaging movements (without relaxing the lips), move the lips up and down.  Do 10 such repetitions, alternating them with complete relaxation of the lips and the circular muscles of the mouth. </p><p>  Another available exercise option may be a clear (with vivid articulation) vowel pronunciation.  In this case, it is not necessary to do this exercise out loud, you can only simulate the movement of the lips.  This option is suitable for office workers, when you can do it without distracting from work.  There is no limit to perform such an exercise. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you have received the most frequently asked question: ‚ÄúWhat is the function of the circular muscle of the eye?‚Äù  - the answer.  Everything is quite simple: knowing where this or that muscle is located, you can also determine the area of ‚Äã‚Äãits action. </p><p>  With <span>facial muscles, of</span> course, it is not so simple as with the muscle corset of our body, and not so much because of the size of the muscles themselves, but because of the features of attachment and the actions described above. </p>
