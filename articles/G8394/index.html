The famous expression was used by A. S. Pushkin in his poem The Bronze Horseman.  But few people know that it belongs to the Italian traveler Francesco Algarotti, this is referenced in the notes to the poem. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cyrillitsa.ru" data-author=": "><img alt="why Peter 1 cut a window to Europe" class="if uuid-2510320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2510320.jpg?1536681972"></div><h2>  Access to the sea </h2><p>  Not a single ruler enjoyed such popularity among descendants as Peter I. Not a single monarch could change Russia and its history in such a way as Peter I. Opinions differ about him even among historians who have studied everything about this era.  But, nevertheless, it is difficult to overestimate all of Peter's affairs.  With the shaving of beards and the introduction of a European dress, Peter I “opened the window to Europe” only.  He opened it, gaining access to the Baltic Sea, which allowed him to feel on an equal footing in Europe. </p><p>  Even as a teenager, Peter I learned for himself that Russia cannot exist normally without access to the seas, having only the northern sea borders.  At 23, he personally participated in the Azov campaigns, as a result of which the Azov fortress was taken.  Russia came to the shores of the Sea of ​​Azov, thereby opening the passage for Russian merchants to the South.  But this is a small inland sea, and the future emperor loved the scope in everything.  Peter I always dreamed of an exit to the Baltic, which opens an outlet to all the seas and oceans. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.5-tv.ru" data-author=": "><img alt="Peter 1 cut a window to Europe" class="if uuid-2510316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2510316.jpg?1536681972"></div><h2>  Why did Peter 1 cut through the “window to Europe” </h2><p>  What does going to sea without a fleet mean?  Russia did not have it.  At the age of 11, Peter the Great learned to build ships under the guidance of the Dutchman Timmerman F. and the Russian master Kartsev R., and at the age of 12 he sailed around his Yauz boat.  A little later he sailed on Pereyaslavsky lake.  He laid the first shipyard here.  This childhood love of ships remained with him for life. </p><p>  Communication with the Germans and the Dutch from the German settlement convinced him that Russia must have access to the sea in order to develop further, since all the significant countries of Europe were maritime powers.  All his life he built ships and fought for twenty years in the Northern War for access to the Baltic Sea.  Despite the skepticism of many, Peter 1 cut a “window to Europe”, built the beautiful European city of St. Petersburg on the shores of the Gulf of Finland. </p><h2>  A trip to Europe with a great embassy </h2><p>  In 1697, the future emperor went to Europe as part of the Great Embassy.  He spent more than a year there, not tired of studying.  In Koenigsberg and Brandenburg he studied the full course of artillery, and in Amsterdam at the shipyards, working as a carpenter, he comprehended the technology of building ships.  In England, he studied the science of shipbuilding, learned to draw and read drawings, got acquainted with ship architecture.  He acquired many instruments and tools.  But the disturbing news from Russia made him urgently return. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the instructions of Peter the Great, the great embassy was preparing a “window to Europe” - an alliance against Sweden.  This meant the denouement of the Northern War, which began in 1700 and lasted 20 years.  The allies of Russia were the elector of Saxony and the king of Poland August II, the <span>king of Denmark</span> and Norway Christian V. Russia fought for the return of its territories lost according to the Stolbovsky Peace, which was subsequently achieved. </p><p>  In addition, contracts were concluded with foreign officers and soldiers, who were able to help re-create the Russian army.  She as such at that time was not there: only regiments of archers, who performed mostly police functions, and the people's militia.  Such an army could not lead a long war. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tyden.cz" data-author=": "><img alt="why Peter 1 cut a window to Europe 2" class="if uuid-2510322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2510322.jpg?1536681972"></div><h2>  Education reform </h2><p>  Russia urgently needed various kinds of specialists.  Therefore, Peter I began to actively carry out educational reform.  Mathematical and navigation, medical and surgical, engineering and artillery schools, the Naval Academy, and collegiate translator schools were opened.  The clergy’s monopoly on education was completely eliminated.  A civilian font has been introduced. </p><p>  His undertakings were not only supporters, but also a large number of ill-wishers.  The fight against the conservative opposition, whose representatives were sincerely convinced of the dangers of reform, continued until the end of the days of Peter I. The “Window to Europe” was opened.  There was no turning back. </p><h2>  Reformation of the army and state power </h2><p>  Reforms were underway in the army and government institutions.  Streltsy units were liquidated.  Instead of them, following the example of Western ones, regiments are introduced.  Soldiers called up for recruitment kits are taught military affairs.  Ships were built and bought.  Russia became a sea power.  Reforms in the army allowed Sweden to do irreparable damage in the battle of Poltava.  This showed the correctness of the chosen path. </p><p>  State reforms caused the greatest resistance.  Peter I eliminated the Boyars Duma as an outdated authority.  He leveled the estates of the boyars and nobles, introducing for the latter the inheritance of estates given for excellent service.  He introduced the “Table of Ranks”, dividing the civilian and military into 14 ranks, making service people officials.  The last tsar in the history of Russia becomes the first emperor of a great power. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cruel-clown.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img alt="window to europe peter 1 what does it mean" class="if uuid-2510317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2510317.jpg?1536681972"></div><h2>  The importance of reform </h2><p>  What does “window to Europe” mean?  Peter 1 oriented Russia to the West.  His reforms were mostly spontaneous, caused by domestic factors, his vision of the country.  But their results predetermined the development of the state for many years, made Russia a great power.  During his reign, industry and trade developed rapidly, natural resources were explored, and new cities were built.  Centralized power strengthened, its economic potential increased.  The territory of the country has increased many times. </p><p>  The defenders of the people were ambivalent about Peter's reforms.  Undoubtedly, their main burden fell on him.  It was during the reign of Peter I that the peasantry was enslaved completely.  During the construction of St. Petersburg, peasants were driven from all over Russia.  The fugitives were actively sought after, their families were put under arrest until the fugitives were caught.  All this was expressed by peasant uprisings, for example, the Peasant War led by Bulavin.  They were brutally suppressed. </p>
