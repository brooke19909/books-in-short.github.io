    <h2>  Biography: early years </h2><p>  Justin Chatwin was born in Nanaimo, <span>British Columbia,</span> Canada.  His mother, Susanna, was an artist, and his father, Brian, was an engineer. </p><p>  He studied well at school and easily entered the University of British Columbia to become a future sales representative. </p><p>  Once classmates called him to classes in an acting studio, and then the young man decided to radically change his plans.  Justin began to dream about cinema and with the permission of his parents dropped out of school to become an actor. </p><h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  The actor’s debut work was the small role of Jeremy Creek in the science fiction series Smallville.  Justin Chatwin at that time had not yet celebrated his 19th birthday, and the invitation to the set of a fairly successful project about the youth of America's cult hero - Superman - was a big event in his life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Almost simultaneously with this, the actor played his first episodic role in the full-length musical film "Josie and the Cats", in which the famous actresses <span>Tara Reid</span> and <span>Rosario Dawson</span> were involved <span>.</span>  The film was not a box office success, but the young man was remembered by the directors. </p><h2>  Relocation to the USA </h2><p>  In 2005, Justin Chatwin went to conquer Hollywood.  There, luck smiled at him, and he was taken on the full role of the son of the protagonist in the fantastic film by Stephen Spielberg based on the Herbert Wells novel “War of the Worlds”.  Although the actor was already over 20, he did an excellent job with the role of a teenager who seeks to protect the planet from aliens contrary to his father's requests. </p><p>  In the same 2005, Justin Chatwin was invited to the comedy “Chamskrabber”, in which he played a classmate of the protagonist <span>(Jamie Bell).</span>  Glenn Close and <span>Ralph Fiennes</span> were also in the picture <span>.</span> </p>
