But there are other resorts on this island.  So, at the northeastern tip of Phuket is <span>Nai</span> Yang Beach.  It is ideal for lovers of a calm, contemplative holiday.  You should not think that the inhabitants of local hotels are cut off from the entire outside world.  There is all the necessary infrastructure in the form of cafes, restaurants, shops.  The only thing that is not here is the deafeningly vibrant nightlife, as in Patong.  But few tourists can boast that they rest right on the territory of the national natural park.  Hotels lined up on the front page of a snow-white beach.  One of them is Nai Yang Beach Resort 4 *.  It will be discussed in this article.  We built the description of this hotel solely on the reviews of tourists who have already visited there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nai Yang Beach Resort 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1103995.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is it located and how to get there? </h2><p>  Hotel Nai Yang <span>Beach Resort 4 *</span> is located in Nai Yang Bay, on the northwestern tip of Phuket (Thailand).  The resort is located on the first line of a wide sandy beach with a length of three kilometers.  To the sea go a maximum of two hundred meters.  From <span>Phuket</span> International <span>Airport, it</span> takes about ten minutes to <span>get</span> to the hotel.  Travelers, whose package included a transfer, say that they were the first to be delivered to the place of rest.  Despite the proximity of the airport, noise from the aircraft was not heard.  This area is popular with locals who like to come here on the weekend and have picnics.  Therefore, the excellent road No. 402 leads to Nai Young Beach. In this place, reviews say, there is an amazing balance between a calm and contemplative vacation and an eventful pastime.  Here you can simply merge with nature.  Everywhere mangroves, casuarines and other exotic plants.  However, if you want civilization, you can always get to neighboring noisy resorts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nai Yang Beach Resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1104007.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, he does not produce the impression of crampedness.  This is due to the fact that there is no big noisy building with dull hotel corridors and doors on both sides.  No, tourists at the hotel live in pretty one- and two-story bungalows that are securely hidden in the greenery of a lush tropical garden.  The buildings are designed so that the inhabitants as little as possible saw and heard their neighbors, but only admired the view of the sea (or pool) and enjoyed the sound of the surf.  The hotel has a spirit of hospitality and hospitality, it seems that we came to rest with our beloved relatives - such is the family atmosphere here.  There are few Russians, mostly tourists from Western and Central Europe and China rest.  There are only three hotels in Nai Yang Bay.  There are Rouen My Beach Resort and Kokun Spa Indigo Pearl next door. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nai Yang Beach Resort 4 pics" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1104001.jpg" width="600"></div>

And according to the amenities (and prices), guest rooms are divided into standard twin, deluxe (direct access to the lawn), Thai mini-suite, tana grand.

They are served in the Sand restaurant, which also has an outdoor terrace.  Breakfast is fully consistent with its name - ‚Äúcontinental‚Äù, as they are very satisfying.

The most budgetary option is the macaque.  They arrive with their ‚Äúfield kitchen‚Äù at lunchtime and fry amazing shrimps, kebabs and other meals with you.  Those who are not shy in their means can be advised by the Rodcharin restaurant.  Of course, there is a Seven / Ileven grocery store nearby, and a market is organized three times a week.

    <h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  Hotel Nai Yang Beach Resort 4 * is separated from the sea by just a promenade.  Nai Yang, like all beaches in Thailand, is municipal, with free entry for everyone.  It is laden with a number of sunbeds and umbrellas, but this service is paid - one hundred and fifty butts per day.  However, many tourists did without this beach ammunition.  The fact is that right in the middle of the white sand, on the coast of Nai Yang Bay, amazing trees grow - casuarins.  They cast an openwork shadow in which there is no heat at all.  So it‚Äôs easy to relax on a towel, on a soft sand.  The entrance to the sea is gentle, which is good for families with children.  The ebbs are significant.  During them, the entire coral ridge is exposed.  Reefs shelter the bay from storms.  There are some water activities on the beach, but given the fact that this coast is part of the reserve, there are few motorized boats.  You can fly a kite, ski, practice kayaking.  Reviews report that a good dive site is located a kilometer from the coast.  The hotel itself has three swimming pools.  It goes without saying that the sunbeds and umbrellas around them are free for hotel guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Nai Yang Beach Resort 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1104008.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services at Nai Yang Beach Resort 4 * </h2><p>  Free parking is a significant advantage of the hotel, because many tourists rent motorbikes for free movement around the island.  And you can rent a bike in the hotel itself.  At the reception, which operates around the clock, you can book excursions.  Laundry, by the way, also works at the hotel, and you can use its services if you wish.  For divers in the hotel there is a diving center that provides instructor services and escort to coral reefs for a fee.  More recently, the hotel began to be called Nai Yang Beach Resort Spa 4 *.  A slight change in the sign indicates that the hotel has opened its own spa.  There you can take a massage course (Thai or oil), facial and body treatments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nai Yang Beach Resort Spa 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1104005.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The proximity of the national nature park "Sirinat" determines the choice of travel.  Reviews recommend taking a one-day excursion to the reserve.  It includes elephant riding, rafting on the river and a visit to the monkeys, which you can feed.  But you can even go along the paths among the mangroves.  Markings will not let you get lost.  There are other attractions in the bay.  Karma can be corrected at Wat Nai Yang Temple.  There are also schools here - diving, kiting, Thai massage, yoga and cooking classes.  More recently, giant sea turtles came to lay eggs in the bay.  And they say, so far they can be seen in the corresponding period.  And on the beach near Nai Yang Beach Resort 4 * after the storm, you can find pearls.  There are also large pieces of nacre. </p><h2>  Nai Yang Beach Resort 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists praise the hotel for its vast green area, clean pools, beautiful, well-kept and comfortable rooms.  The hotel staff is very cordial.  True, they do not speak Russian, you need to know a little English.  Everyone praises breakfast.  Some tried dinner at the Sand - tables are served by torchlight right on the sand of the beach.  Expensive, but very tasty.  The public at the hotel is mostly calm and respectable.  Hotel Nai Yang Beach Resort 4 * reviews recommend for a measured beach holiday. </p>
