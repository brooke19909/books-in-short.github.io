  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Banking services for individuals: information base</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The banking system of Russia has been actively developing in recent years.  As of August 1, 2015, 727 banks are entitled to carry out various operations.  High competition among lending institutions stimulates the expansion of the range of services offered and the creation of new products.  Consumers have become more demanding on the level of service and the proposed conditions of service, as the financial literacy of the population is growing steadily. </p><p>  Systematic approach to choosing a bank </p><p>  Most citizens of the Russian Federation prefer to use the services of several banks.  This approach is fully justified, since it allows you to combine the most optimal conditions depending on the goals.  However, in order to select financial institutions that correspond to preferences, it is necessary to conduct a comparative analysis of the proposed conditions and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages.  This process can take a considerable amount of time if it does not have a system basis.  As an objective source of information, specialized resources, such as ‚Äú <noindex>  <span>bankchart.ru</span> </noindex>  ".  They allow you to analyze the activities of banks in various analytical sections.  The positions of banks in various ratings may be subject to research and indicators that testify to the financial stability of institutions may be evaluated: </p><ul><li>  total assets; </li><li>  net profit received; </li><li>  volume of attracted deposits; </li><li>  amount of loans issued. </li></ul><p>  Information opportunities for choosing a banking product </p><p>  The list of services for individuals is almost identical in different institutions.  However, the terms of settlement and cash services, deposit and loan programs may vary significantly.  Some banks may prefer to expand the range of loan products, others focus on creating attractive conditions for deposits, and others - take care of the interests of certain categories of the population, for example, retirees or military personnel.  On specialized websites focused on covering all aspects of banks, potential credit holders and depositors can not only get acquainted with the latest financial market news, but also get system information about: </p><ul><li>  proposed conditions and rates; </li><li>  ongoing promotions; </li><li>  advantages of certain types of products; </li><li>  changes in legislation. </li></ul><p>  In addition, visitors can take the advice of experts and find out the opinions of consumers of financial services on the activities of banks. </p><p>  The main advantage of using such resources is the ability to select products according to specified criteria.  For this, special services are being developed that instantly optimize the process of searching for the most favorable banking services for private individuals that meet consumer preferences. </p></div></article>
