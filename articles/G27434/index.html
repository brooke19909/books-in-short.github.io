  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The leader of production is the pride of the USSR!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Finally, unemployment in the USSR disappeared in 1930.  People striving for a better life and the dream of communism begin to work tirelessly.  The greatest honors are the foremost in production.  Who are they?  This is the working class.  Workers who surpass their colleagues in some ways. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.avito.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="advanced workers of the USSR" class="if uuid-2494913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2494913.jpg"></div><h2>  Case study </h2><p>  Joseph Stalin on May 4, 1935 gave another installment of the party.  It was about that people should master the technology, become real professionals in first-class factories and factories of the USSR.  It is then that the country will receive the effect of three or four times more than it is at that time. </p><p>  The basis of the working class in the factories at that time were uneducated peasants who fled from devastated villages to the city in search of a better life.  In order to show them how to work for the good of the motherland, a heroic example was needed.  In the years 1935-36, workers began to be equated with the Stakhanovites as an example of advanced workers.  Who are these people, and how did they become so famous? </p><div class="photo" data-original="artposter.kiev.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cotton pickers" class="if uuid-2494897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2494897.jpg"></div><h2>  Stakhanovtsy </h2><p>  The Stakhanov movement became a form of <span>socialist competition</span> in the USSR.  Stakhanov Alexey Grigoryevich became the ancestor of this phenomenon, due to the fact that he did the impossible.  For a shift from August 30 to August 31, 1935, the norm for cutting coal was exceeded by 14 times.  Alex showed an example of incredible hard work.  The incident occurred in Ukraine in the mine Central-Irmino.  Since that time, all the advanced workers of the USSR began to equal him, the workers began unofficially called Stakhanovites.  For his feat, the leader received the award - the title of Hero of Socialist Labor.  The miners immediately picked up the initiative of the worker.  Later, all employees joined the unspoken competition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among the leaders of the Soviet production then the blacksmith Busygin was also noted.  He worked at the Gorky Automobile Plant and forged 966 crankshafts in a single shift at a rate of 675 pieces. </p><div class="photo" data-original="klim-ua.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leading Workers - Rich People" class="if uuid-2494910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2494910.jpg"></div><p>  The news about the Stakhanovites was constantly published by the Izvestia newspaper.  For example, congresses of advanced workers with Stalin were covered, as well as progress reports.  The state was desperate for professionals.  The first five-year plans required skilled workers, and it is better to educate people on the examples of toilers. </p><h2>  Racing work </h2><p>  Stakhanovites brigades were organized everywhere.  Races milked cows, sewed a robe and clothes, salted cucumbers, boiled steel.  Newspapers were full of headlines about the next victories.  There was even an example of a patient who voluntarily left the hospital with an attack of appendicitis in order to set a new record in production. </p><p>  Gudov also noted in the history - a milling machine operator from the Ordzhonikidze plant.  He was awarded four times overfulfillment of the daily norm.  The namesakes Vinogradov managed to simultaneously serve 100 machines in the textile industry. </p><p>  Unfortunately, Alexey Stakhanov ended his life sadly.  After retirement, he drank too much, and they tried not to spread about him.  The first Stakhanovite died in 1977. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sto16km.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Best in their profession" class="if uuid-2494922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2494922.jpg"></div><h2>  Title of Labor Hero </h2><p>  The award appeared in the 20s.  She was received for special achievements in overfulfilling the plan. </p><p>  The leading workers who worked diligently were constantly endowed with household signs necessary for the household.  For example, a collective farmer-Stakhanovka boasted in an interview that she received as a reward: </p><ul><li>  gramophone; </li><li>  bed; </li><li>  dress; </li><li>  shoes </li><li>  sewing machine. </li></ul><p>  Such gifts were made not so much to enrich the advanced workers as to raise their cultural level.  As a reward, hunting rifles, bicycles, and classics were often also given.  Most of them came from poor villages, and such gifts were a luxury for them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sto16km.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stakhanovites on the board of honor" class="if uuid-2494916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2494916.jpg"></div><h2>  Soviet-made leaders </h2><p>  Until 1991, 22 thousand people were awarded the title of Hero of Labor and Hero of Socialist Labor.  Below is a photo of production leaders during the workflow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stalinsociety.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Labor of the Stakhanovites" class="if uuid-2494888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/2494888.jpg"></div><p>  This title was also awarded to the first persons of the state.  Three times the award received: </p><ul><li>  Nikita Khrushchev; </li><li>  Dimmuhamed Kunaev. </li></ul><p>  The monetary remuneration excited the beginning workers.  So, the salary of a low-paid employee was about 120 rubles.  The salary of an ordinary miner-miner is 500 rubles, while the one who exceeded the norm received 1,500 rubles.  This strongly motivated people to work harder and yielded tremendous results.  So in the second five-year period, labor productivity growth increased from 41% to 82%.  The union also believed that Stakhanov‚Äôs wages could only be received in the homeland, since among the capitalists the growth of labor productivity only leads to the fact that the owner is enriched. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the music did not play for long, soon the Stakhanov salaries were reduced, and thanks to their records, production standards were increased.  In addition, during the period of the Stakhanovites, punishment for being late and absenteeism was greatly tightened.  In punishment for the latter, one could even get a prison term.  Criminal punishment was also imposed for unauthorized departure from work and for being late for more than 20 minutes.  Later, the sentences were softened. </p>
