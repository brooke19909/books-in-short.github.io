  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Denationalization and privatization: systemic conditionality</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The development of a market economy during the <span>transition period</span> requires a whole range of measures to restructure the entire economy in order to give it the greatest efficiency and dynamism.  One of the most important areas of such work is the privatization and privatization of property.  Such events contribute to the emergence of new forms of organization of production activity in all sectors of the economy, without exception. </p><p>  As a rule, such activity is very painful for various social groups of the population, and it is not even that denationalization and privatization involve the redistribution of property and the rights to use it, during their implementation habitual value guidelines are often destroyed, value systems change, and a change in the philosophy of economic thinking itself, among those population groups that are involved in this process.  That is why denationalization and privatization require the development of well-balanced programs that will ensure the most optimal procedure for this socio-economic process.  An important place in comprehending the content of necessary measures is occupied by the issue of a clear understanding of the very content of the concepts of denationalization and privatization. </p><p>  By denationalization in the broadest sense of this concept, it is necessary to understand the system of measures to demonopolize the economy and abandon the administrative-command strategy for its development in order to enter the path to the formation of a multistructure economic mechanism that develops according to the natural laws of a civilized market economy.  The main thing in solving this issue, as a rule, is the implementation of measures aimed at freeing the state from the possibility of totally and directly intervening in the economic process and completely managing it.  As the world experience in the implementation of the policy of denationalization shows, this activity is the solution of two interrelated and mutually conditioning tasks: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - the transition from administrative-command management strategies to economic technologies based on the operation of economic laws; </p><p>  - a change in the content and forms of industrial and economic relations based on its multistructured and free development. </p><p>  The process of privatization involves the implementation of the following activities: </p><p>  - the creation of an effective non-state <span>sector of the economy</span> developing on the basis of a variety of types of business entities; </p><p>  - the transformation and transfer of <span>state-owned</span> enterprises on the path to effective development in a market economy, first of all, their liberation from the direct controlling influence of the state with the help of administrative-command methods; </p><p>  - privatization of part of the property directly into the hands of citizens - the creation of a private sector of the economy. </p><p>  Thus, it can already be seen from this content that denationalization and privatization are interconnected processes, where privatization acts as a structurally necessary element of the denationalization policy. </p><p>  In practice, privatization can be carried out outside the process of privatization, in which case it comes down only to the decentralization of enterprise management or the change <span>of ownership</span> without changing the owner.  As a rule, this option of privatization is used to improve the economy or its individual sectors. </p><p>  One type of privatization - the privatization of municipal property, is just such a case.  It is carried out mainly with the aim of attracting investment in the regions.  Substantially this process is the transfer of ownership, long-term <span>lease of land,</span> enterprises, infrastructure on the basis of their active participation in the development and modernization of the transferred economy. </p><p>  Privatization of <span>property of municipal</span> entities is beneficial for local authorities and entrepreneurs, which is why in some countries, including regions of Russia, free privatization programs are being implemented.  Such a mechanism allows municipalities to get rid of objects that cannot be used effectively by them and still make a profit in the event of paid or mandatory privatization. </p>
