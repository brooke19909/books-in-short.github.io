Despite the Internet, which provides a sea of ​​information about any corner of the planet, new surprises are constantly emerging.  There is something that no one ever knew about.  And how many people do not have knowledge of the "untwisted" natural wonders!  This is understandable.  The information flow is so dense that a person begins to “sink” in it, which means that it is dismissed from a secondary, at the moment not important. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ritsa lake where is located" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15236/472009.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, you need to know the main attractions in order not to look ignoramus, and for yourself, to plan a vacation.  For example, Lake Ritsa.  Where is?  What is known and interesting?  Let's figure it out.

    <h2>  Lake Ritsa on the map </h2><p>  We proceed from the fact that a person only vaguely remembers this phrase, and with what to associate it, does not represent.  He understands that this is not a mountain, but a reservoir - Lake Ritsa.  Where is it, has no idea.  To find this object, you will need a map of Eurasia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to the lake" class="if" height="468" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15236/472592.jpg" width="600"></div>  That is, they decided on the continent, do not look at Africa and America, it is not there.  We narrow down the search sector.  Take a look at the Caucasus.  It is among its mountains that Lake Ritsa is located.  Where is it, if more?  Sukhumi, Gagra found?  Near a pond.  This is the desired lake.  From the city of Gagra is approximately sixty kilometers.  I must say that its location is unique!  The mountains, beautiful and untouched, are simply mesmerizing.  But this is for lovers of extraordinary, natural experiences.

If you are looking for a body of water on a political map (where countries are marked with different colors), then you have to work hard.  The fact is that the lake is located in Abkhazia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to ritsa lake" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15236/472010.jpg" width="419"></div>  And this is an <span>unrecognized republic.</span>  So, it can not be found on any map.  It is better to use Russian production, because the Russian Federation recognized a small heroic republic.  Near its border in the Caucasus you will find a small country, and there will be Lake Ritsa.  Where is the Black Sea, near Georgia.  Did you see?  So, a small piece of land, between the sea on one side and the Russian Federation on the other, is Abkhazia.  Its southern borders overlook Georgia.  Now that we have decided on the location of the lake, let's talk about the journey itself.

    <h2>  How to get to Lake Ritsa </h2><p>  Regardless of where you start your journey from, you will be comfortable flying to Sochi airport.  Although closer to go from Gagra or Sukhumi (Abkhazia).  In principle, this does not really matter.  All Black Sea cities are connected by good roads.  The path to the lake begins with the M-27 highway.  You need to get to <span>the Bzyb River.</span>  From this point turn into the mountains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ritsa lake legend" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15236/472039.jpg" width="600"></div>  If you are traveling from the Russian side, then pay attention to the traffic police post that will be after the city of Gagra.  From it to the reservoir is only twenty kilometers.  Tourists wondering how to get to Lake Ritsa are advised to look for a tour desk.  This way is the easiest.  And trips there are organized from any resort town nearby.  So you don’t have to mess with cards.  Take the bus and they will show you everything.  More interesting is the ride on an SUV.  Not all magnificent corners can be visited by bus.

Only by visiting it do you understand why.  From the turn from the seaside highway to the reservoir, thirty-eight kilometers.  Believe me, this is a way of enjoyment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ritsa Lake on the map" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15236/472011.jpg" width="600"></div>  In this case, the gaze will absorb the splendor of the mountains, the mind will freeze with delight and admiration for the courage and perseverance of the locals, the body will sing, saturated with wonderful air.  The road to Lake Ritsa runs past ancient and modern villages.  The first Bzyb (by the name of the river) stands in an ancient place.  Nearby through a series of trees you can see the remains of ancient fortresses.  Next, there are two more.  The guide will definitely tell you about the exploits of the warriors of both antiquity and modernity.  Further, the path goes through narrow canyons and gorges.  The builders had to work hard to ensure the comfort of today's travelers.  You will meet and overcome thirteen bridges, tunnels and avalanche fortifications.  It is recommended to stop and enjoy the <span>Blue Lake.</span>  It is small but magnificent.  The water is clear and fresh.  And also pay attention to the struggle of plants for life on rocky slopes.  She is just bewitching.

    <h2>  Some Travel Tips </h2><p>  Tourists are advised to take warm clothes with them even in the summer.  The fact is that the road runs among steep cliffs, dense forests.  The sun will not always pamper you with its warmth along the way.  And the mountains are not desert.  The higher the lower the temperature.  Therefore, a sweatshirt or a thin sweater will not be superfluous, especially if you hit the road with your children.  Somewhere halfway you will drop into the park.  Have to pay for the pleasure.  The amount is small - fifty rubles.  But you need to keep this in mind when you are planning. </p>

    <h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  If you were hypnotized by a mountain miracle, then parting with it right away is not necessary.  Holidays on Lake Ritsa organized.  Here I liked to spend a rare weekend even Joseph Vissarionovich.  And he knew a lot about rest.  Ask the locals, they will show you Stalin's dacha.  There is now a museum.  You can visit him to have an idea of ​​how the leader of the peoples lived, for which he was loved in the Caucasus.  But the greater interest is the surrounding nature.  Many people believe that this crystal air is better than any medicine.  Moreover, unlike doctors and medicines, it heals comprehensively, affecting not only the body, but also the soul. </p><h2>  If you rest, then completely </h2><p>  Leave life and a whirl of problems outside the park.  And here is a place of contact with eternity and depth of nature.  Contemplation of the contrast of magnificent mountains and deep waters alone will cure depression and other “vices” of the modern world.  But do not stop at the views.  Try local food.  It is simple but very useful here.  In cafes you will be offered goat cheese, meat and greens.  The combination is more beneficial to the body than fast food, coupled with pills.  Once arrived, then "sit down" on local products.  You will feel that your body has become alive, light.  Indeed, after several days it is believed that a person can live more than two hundred years.  Be sure to go fishing!  Here is a magnificent underwater world.  Get a lot of fun! </p><h2>  About the legends </h2><p>  Such an amazing place could not fail to attract the attention of folk singers.  From the mouth of the guide you can find out how, according to local beliefs, the lake Ritsa arose.  The legend describes a beautiful girl whose name is now a reservoir.  She was beautiful, like a fairy tale, kind and cheerful.  She lived with three brothers who hunted and sang in the evenings by the fire.  Once young people were late for dinner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on lake ritsa" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15236/472038.jpg" width="600"></div>  And the robbers attacked the girl.  The mountain falcon warned the lads about the danger threatening their sister.  Just before they had time to recapture her from the rapist.  The bandit brothers brutally avenged.  A sword sent towards the thief blocked the river.  Yes, only their work was in vain.  Ritsa could not stand the shame and drowned in the cold waters of the new lake.  And they desperate turned into gloomy mountains.  And now they all stand together.  Ritsa splashes with crystal waves, and the brothers guard her peace.

    <p>  Many more wonderful stories can tell you the hospitable owners of the region.  Their difference is the depth and purity of the moral foundation laid down in every legend.  Locals are open, like the expanse of a lake, severe as mountains.  They are friendly and kind with friends, like stormy subtropical vegetation.  They are merciless to enemies like bare sheer cliffs.  Anyone who knows the charm of this land always returns here for a healing sip of calm eternity, helping to live in a difficult modern world. </p>
