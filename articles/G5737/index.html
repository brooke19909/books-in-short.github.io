Our grandmothers did not even dream that with the help of one object several types of cleaning can be done in the apartment.  This opportunity was presented thanks to the Samsung washing vacuum cleaner.  This is the best model for those who value cleanliness and order. </p><h2>  Short review </h2><p>  A technical novelty was published in 2014.  The attractive design of the vacuum cleaner is combined with the advantages of the device.  It has a pyramidal shape, and it is no coincidence.  It contains some of the amenities laid down by the South Korean manufacturer, which will be discussed in this article.  The device is a first-class example of household appliances, with the help of which three cleaning methods are carried out: dry, wet and dry with an aquafilter. </p>

    <p>  Using a multifunction device is not limited to cleaning the floor.  Samsung is a washing vacuum cleaner with which you can wash furniture, windows and other suitable surfaces. </p><h2>  The main characteristic </h2><p>  This design has a compact body and large wheels, as well as a water supply hose and a removable container.  A convenient handle with a hole for the hand, which is equipped with a remote control, allows you to control the necessary actions during cleaning, for example, adjust the power of dust retraction.  A universal brush is included in the Samsung vacuum cleaner kit.  Attached are nozzles for hard planes, carpet and fabric. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The design of the vacuum cleaner allows you to make maneuvers on fleecy carpets.  It can be moved smoothly around the apartment, overcoming obstacles such as thresholds and corners.  And all this thanks to an engineering idea, which implied the location of the wheels at an angle for the stability of the body of the washing vacuum cleaner.  Samsung can be freely rotated, and it does not tip over.  An additional rubber coating on the wheels protects the surface from damage. </p>

    <p>  To maintain perfect cleanliness, such a feature of a technical device as a constant suction power is one of the most important factors.  By the way, about the Samsung VW9000 washing vacuum cleaner in reviews, many housewives focus on this particular advantage.  Moreover, the maximum amount of energy consumed is about 1700 watts.  The noise level is 87 dBA.  A dust collector made of transparent plastic (volume 2 l) allows you to see the amount of accumulated dust. </p><h2>  Models </h2><p>  There are 4 models of the discussed news.  The color of the case is the main visual difference between each option.  A separate model has a certain set of items, which is slightly different from another.  The kit may include the following nozzles: <span>half-carpet, crevice,</span> fabric, main brush for wet cleaning, <span>brush for dust,</span> laminate parquet and nozzle for upholstered furniture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Each buyer can choose for himself a more convenient option, taking into account the additional nozzles included in the kit. </p><ul><li>  Model SW 17H9050H (sea wave) has a device that protects furniture from scratches and damage, but there is no parquet brush in the kit. </li><li>  SW 17H9070H (azure color) - the set has a parquet brush. </li><li>  SW 17H9090H (silver case) - a mini-turbo brush designed for wool and hair, and a nozzle for upholstered furniture. </li><li>  SW 17H9071H (red) - has the same accessories as the previous model. </li></ul><h2>  Aquafiltration process </h2><p>  Almost all vacuum cleaners have a single operating principle, which is the accumulation of dust in special bags.  As a rule, this affects the intensity of absorption and the quality of cleaning.  The water filter operates on a different principle.  Water is considered a natural filter that can trap absorbed chemical compounds.  When the vacuum cleaner absorbs dust and debris, they fall into the water together with air, where they are deposited.  Purified air passing through a thin filtration system exits.  At the same time, the filters are not clogged, and the process taking place in the aquafiltration mode does not affect the dust suction power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Using HEPA filters, a multilayer cleaning system is created, which is almost one hundred percent.  Additional porous filters absorb even spores of fungi. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The washing Samsung vacuum cleaner can rightfully be called an anti-allergenic device.  The manufacturing company incorporated an effective filtration system into the product design.  The collected dust remains in the water, its particles do not spread around the room, and thus the air in the room is cleaned.  The HEPA-13 filter absorbs pollen and all kinds of allergens.  The presence of a multicyclone purification system improves the quality of filtration.  The filter consists of 8 cameras, each of which works with its own speed and a certain radius.  Thanks to such a device, a vortex is created, which can collect not only garbage, but also lumps of wool. </p>
