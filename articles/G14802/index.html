Under Catherine the Great, a palace ensemble was born here, born of the genius of architect Cameron.  The architect, being a fan of ancient Greek and Roman art, led the construction in the classical style.  Paul I hired the Italian architect Brenn, who gave the buildings more gloss and splendor.  The palace, destroyed by fire, was rebuilt by <span>architects Voronikhin</span> and Stackenschneider.  In this form, it has survived to the present day.  The ceremonial halls are decorated on the basis of collections of furniture, bronze, silk and paintings belonging to Paul I and Empress Maria Fedorovna.  Pavlovsky Palace is surrounded by one of the most romantic and picturesque parks in Europe.  Tall trees, winding streams, paths harmonize with classic statues and comfortable benches.
