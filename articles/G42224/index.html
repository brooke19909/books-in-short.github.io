Greater Poland Voivodeship (Poznan - its administrative center) is, one might say, the place where it all began.  From ancient times, they settled on the banks of the Warta River: archaeologists found the remains of a settlement created in the X century, and in the XI city is already mentioned in the chronicles. </p><h2>  First capital </h2><p>  According to legend, Lech, Czech and Rus (the founding fathers of the three Slavic peoples) met here after a long separation.  They immediately recognized each other and shouted: “Know!”  (“I know,” in the sense).  From here, according to legend, the name of the city went.  Scientists are more prosaic: they prefer to think that the reason for this was the old Polish name Poznan. </p>

Tourists are attracted by the rich historical past, as well as a convenient location: many road and rail routes run through Poznan, so travelers often find themselves here.  After a quick tour of the city, many of them, judging by the reviews, are very sorry that they did not plan to devote <span>more</span> time to this <span>city</span> .  There is something to see.

Now it is the most visited part of Poznan.  The area is square and quite extensive: the size of a large football field (approximately 140x140 m).  Here much of what is worth looking at is concentrated, coming to Poznan <span>(Poland).</span>  <span>Sights</span> literally "crowd" around.  Judging by the reviews, the compact location of many interesting monuments and structures is very pleasing to tourists. </p><p>  The old market is more than 750 years old - the beginning of development dates back to 1253.  This is not the largest city square in Poland (there are more similar ones in Wroclaw and Krakow), but it is considered one of the most beautiful in Eastern Europe. </p>

    <h2>  City Hall </h2><p>  In the center of the architectural ensemble is the town hall - “fiery greetings” from the Renaissance.  The building was designed by Italian architect Jan Quadro in 1560, and his style is undeniably Renaissance.  Of course, the first town hall, wooden, appeared at about the same time as the square itself, but was destroyed by fire.  But the new one has survived to this day almost in its original form.  In essence, only the spire suffered: before 1725, it rose to the sky at a height of 90 meters, but the elements made adjustments, and a rainstorm caused the building to be damaged.  Now the height of the spire is "only" 61 meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The town hall is crowned with a two-meter sovereign eagle, which managed to survive all the historical and weather disturbances - it is considered one of the symbols of the city.  Another emblem (and it seems to be much nicer to the inhabitants of the city) are the goats, which, according to legend, saved the city of Poznan.  Poland in this sense is no worse than the Roman Empire (if you recall what the Eternal City owes to geese). </p><h2>  The "awake" emblem of Poznan </h2><p>  In different reviews of travelers who had the opportunity to get acquainted with the legends on the spot, you can find two versions of the "goat feat."  According to one of them, the animals ran away from the owner, who intended to put them into consumption.  The search for the fugitives led him to the roof of the town hall (the legend is silent about how the kids got in there), from where he saw hordes of enemies approaching the city.  Citizens raised by alarm were able to repel the enemy attack. </p>

As it actually was, it’s not known, but in honor of the horned saviors, every midday the door above the clock at the town hall opens (this fun, by the way, appeared back in 1661), and from there appear heroes who “buckle” exactly twelve times for the fun of a motley audience who is happy to gawk.

Numerous souvenirs beat their images, and near the Old Market there is a metal installation depicting two butting goats.  Children are happy to saddle stubborn stubborn, and in the meantime, parents are in a hurry to capture them in the photo.  The city of Poznan (Poland) is a great place for families. </p><p>  Numerous travelers note that the city is not fussy even during a large influx of people.

    <h2>  Around the Old Market </h2><p>  Each of the houses located along the perimeter of the Old Market has its own special history.  The “House under the Cap” (No. 50) became famous for the fact that in 1716 a certain noble nobleman fell out of his retinue of King Augustus II from his window on the second floor.  Evil tongues say that the rowdy was a monarch in his own right. </p><p>  The house number 45 is a museum of musical instruments (there are only three in Europe).  Chopin himself once played in this building, here is the <span>death mask of the</span> great composer. </p><p>  Once upon a time in the Dzyalynsky Palace (No. 78), one of the most beautiful buildings of the Old Market, an exquisite society gathered, balls, evenings, and theater performances took place.  Now there is a rich library. </p><h2>  Entourage Square </h2><p>  Fountains are located at the corners of the square.  One of them is authentic, preserved from the moment of construction and is dedicated to Proserpine, the mistress of the underground kingdom.  Three others - Apollo, Mars and Neptune, appeared only at the beginning of the XXI century, when the city authorities decided to return the square to its historical appearance. </p>

    <p>  Once the fountains had a purely practical purpose: there were wells in which the inhabitants of the city took drinking water.  Later they were decorated with wooden figures, which, of course, were not preserved.  Only in the XIII century there were sculptures made of stone, but numerous wars that swept through the city took away many monuments of the past. </p><p>  On the old square there is another medieval wonder - a shameful pillar.  This is an octagonal column, on the top of which there is a statue of the executioner.  In ancient times, the building was used for its intended purpose: the fellow citizens — thieves, prostitutes, and fraudsters — were tied to a pole in the small “dirty tricks” of the building.  Those interested could throw them with mud, spit or have fun in a similar "civilized" way.  It is noteworthy that throwing stones was forbidden. </p><h2>  Student leprosy </h2><p>  Now the original pillar, built in 1535, is located in the Poznan Historical Museum (located in the town hall building).  A copy flaunts on the square, on which the dates when the post was repaired are carved.  The last time the building had to suffer four years ago: a pretty tipsy student managed to climb a column and drop the executioner's figure.  The crashed statue had to be restored - one of the witnesses of the “climber’s feat” had stolen his head. </p>

Poland, whose universities enjoy a good reputation in Europe, is very popular in this sense.

    <h2>  Poznan is working and having fun </h2><p>  In addition, Poznan is also an industrial city.  It is one of the five largest <span>Polish cities.</span>  After Poland decided on its development vector and headed for European integration, many investors find it attractive.  Several powerful enterprises have been opened in the last two decades in different cities, including the one in question.  The place where the Samsung factory is located in Poland is Poznan.  The city is not only remarkable for this.  In 1994, a large production of the automotive giant Volkswagen opened here, and in 2014, the German concern began construction of another plant near the city. </p><p>  In addition to multinational companies, domestic companies are also based in Poznan.  The local brewery is quite famous for inviting nighttime excursions.  Tourists who visited the factory are satisfied: great impressions, tasty beer, very interesting technology. </p><p>  Poznan (Poland) - a place where traditions are kept sacred.  What regular events have not found shelter here.  In autumn, athletes come to the city (traditional marathon).  In mid-June, the famous Sventojan Fair opens here, the roots of which go back to the Middle Ages. </p>

    <h2>  Moving away from the square </h2><p>  In addition to the Old Market, the surrounding beauty is also of considerable interest.  The island of Tumski enjoys well-deserved popularity.  Here is a wonderful example of Gothic architecture - the oldest cathedral that Poland can boast of (Poznan, one might say, was born at the same time as this temple).  Since the time of Pope John Paul II, the architectural ensemble has been solemnly called the Archcathedral Basilica in Poznan of Saints Peter and Paul.  The first cathedrals of Poland, the Church of the Virgin Mary, surrounded by an ensemble of other buildings, some of which are representatives of the ancient Romanesque style, were built in the chapel on the territory. </p><p>  The city has more than a dozen museums, two zoos (New and Old), many restaurants, shops and shops.  Football is no stranger to this city: Poznan (Poland) hosted championship matches during Euro 2012.  The local stadium is modern, comfortable and meets all safety requirements.  Two teams are based in the city, one of which (Lech) is a regular in European competitions (although the Poles have not yet achieved much success on this field). </p><h2>  Diversity is the key to success </h2><p>  In the reviews you have to read that Poznan has a soul, and many travelers admit that they were subdued and disarmed by the charm of local architecture, traditions, and hospitality of local residents. </p><p>  The city has a tourist office on Freedom Square, where you can get the most detailed information about events that are planned in the near future.  Experienced travelers are strongly advised to visit him in order not to miss something interesting, and they also recommend staying at least two or three days: they say, it's worth it. </p><p>  It is gratifying that more and more tourists express a desire to visit Poznan (Poland).  Photos of numerous attractions and rave reviews gradually do their job, popularizing the city, which many tour operators undeservedly underestimate. </p>
