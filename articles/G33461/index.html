The foundation date of this unique complex is 1051.  This is the first center for the spread of Christianity in Kievan Rus.  Today the object is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><p>  The third object among the most significant sights of Ukraine is the Khotyn Fortress.  The city of Khotyn was founded in the tenth century AD by Prince Vladimir.  Since the settlement was considered strategic in the Principality of Galiko-Volyn, a stone rather than a wooden fortress was built to protect it.  The construction has survived to the present day, and it was here that many famous historical films were filmed.  These are such paintings as ‚ÄúThree Musketeers‚Äù, ‚ÄúArrows of Robin Hood‚Äù, ‚ÄúZakhar Berkut‚Äù and many others. </p><h2>  List of Ukrainian miracles: continued </h2>

This shrine is considered the main one in all of Eastern Europe.  The date of construction, according to the "Tale of Bygone Years", is 1037.  The object is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, today it is the center of the Kiev Metropolis. </p><p>  Tauric Chersonesos - an ancient Greek city-state, built more than 2500 years ago, located today in the territory of modern Sevastopol.  Antique ruins picturesquely rise against the backdrop of the sea, it is definitely worth a visit to this attraction. </p><p>  The last of the 7 wonders of Ukraine, but no less interesting than all the previous ones, is the <span>island-reserve Khortytsya.</span>  We are talking about the largest land area on the Dnieper, isolated on all sides by water, which is interesting, here in a relatively small area you can see all kinds of natural landscapes of the country.  Khortytsia is also notable for the fact that one of the first Zaporizhzhya Sichs was founded on it. </p><h2>  Amazing Natural Attractions </h2>

After the publication of the results of the 7 Wonders contest, the public expressed the opinion that many protected areas and miraculous monuments were undeservedly forgotten against the background of ancient palaces and castles.  Many bloggers of the country began to write personally about unique sites and natural attractions worthy in their opinion to become "the very best."  Why argue, because all this is invaluable information for Ukrainians who do not know what to do on the weekend, and tourists from other countries planning excursions on vacation.

    <h2>  Canyons and Lakes </h2><p>  In Ukraine, you can see a variety of natural landscapes and attractions.

This is a unique apple colony.  At first glance, it might seem that you have a garden consisting of trees of an irregular shape.  However, in reality this is one apple tree whose branches, touching the ground, take root and turn into new trunks.  There is a legend according to which the tree was planted by the gardener of <span>Prince Meshchersky.</span>  There is in Ukraine and its own active volcano, it is called "Starunya".  You should not be afraid of it, because instead of lava dirt erupts, but you should definitely watch this miracle with your own eyes.  In the vicinity of the unique object, the remains of a mammoth were found, according to legends, the treasures of Oleksa Dovbush are stored in the volcano itself.

This is a birch bark lake, which is popularly called Black and Enchanted.  The water in it is always cold, and even the most advanced equipment is not able to establish the exact depth of the reservoir.  The people believe that the lake has no bottom, the version of scientists is more prosaic - the bottom is double, the first false, from moss and spruce needles.  In the Rivne region, between the villages of Bazaltovoye and Novy Berestovets, you can see miraculous pillars of basalt, the outlines of which resemble traditional American landscapes.  The final in the unofficial list of ‚Äú7 Wonders of Ukraine‚Äù are Dzhurinsky Falls and the ruins of the ancient city of Chervonograd.  These attractions are located very close in the Ternopil region, and you can see them in one trip.
