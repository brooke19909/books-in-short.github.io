    <p>  In the zoo of the city of Chelyabinsk, you can see many species of primates, predators, amphibians and birds.  Many animals came here from other <span>zoos in the world.</span>  In addition to entertainment, the organization is conducting scientific work. </p><p>  A visit to the zoo is not only a walk in the fresh air.  This is an acquaintance with wild and domestic animals, a study of their lifestyle.  You can not only take a walk around the park, but also attend developmental classes on topics of interest to your child.  It is interesting that such lessons are completely free, students pay only the entrance ticket to the zoo.  And this cannot but rejoice: nowadays, less and less you can find quality free services for children. </p><h2>  Activities for children.  Bagira Club </h2><p>  Those children who are interested in biology are waiting for the Bagira club of young biologists at the zoo.  Young animals choose an animal, observe it, and record all information in diaries.  This activity is of great importance so that the child can prove himself in biology classes, reading reports, telling classmates about his notes. </p><p>  The zoo (Chelyabinsk) has long been famous for high-quality, interesting work with children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Contact zoo </h2><p>  As you know, communication with animals has a good effect on health.  The dog, sitting at the bedside of the sick owner, did a lot for his recovery, almost as much as the doctors who treated him.  For children who love animals, there is a petting zoo in the park. </p>

    <p>  Everyone loves to touch kitties and puppies.  But where else can you see little decorative hedgehogs, little ducks, chickens and piglets?  Sure, only here!  This department is located in the zoo, but a ticket there is purchased separately.  The proceeds are mainly spent on animal feed and on their maintenance.  How much is the entrance to the contact zoo (Chelyabinsk)?  The ticket price is only 30 rubles, kids under one and a half years pass for free.  Please note that the contact zoo is open during the warmer months, from May to September, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Friday, Saturday and Sunday - an hour later), the rest of the time - on Friday, weekends and holidays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. if the air temperature is not lower than plus 10 (this happens in the Urals in October and April). </p><p>  By the way, on the territory of this zoo ride a pony.  Of course, such walks are not carried out every day.  You can ride a pony from Friday through Sunday.  Opening hours - from 11:00 to 18:30.  There is also lunch, the duration of which is exactly 60 minutes (from 13:00 to 14:00). </p><h2>  Zoo website </h2><p>  A place like a zoo (Chelyabinsk) must have its own site, and it is.  This is chelzoo.ru.  The site has bright pages, where you can see photos of animals and birds that live in this park.  We won‚Äôt enumerate all, but suffice it to say that these are primates, artiodactyls, and marsupials, and carnivores (cats, dogs, and others), and edentulous, and artiodactyls, and rodents, and many, many others.  Each species is described in detail: where does the animal live, what does it feed on, how long does the pregnancy last for a female, and so on.  It is always pleasant not only to visit the zoo, but also to learn a lot of new and interesting things. </p><h2>  Zoo news.  Exemplary feeding of animals </h2><p>  This magical place, as always, surprises its visitors, especially in the summer.  For example, in July of this year, an entertaining experiment for children was held.  Children love to chew!  It is especially good that professionals observed this process.  They directed children's energy in the right direction. </p><p>  Recently, zoo was born in the zoo.  A contest for the best names for these funny tiny kittens has been announced. </p>

    <p>  It happens that people plan to come to the park while feeding animals, but the daily regimen for different animals is different.  This problem was solved by the zoo.  Chelyabinsk in this case was the first among other cities to organize an indicative feeding of animals.  This means that you can come at a certain time and see how the animals eat.  The event takes place on Fridays at exactly 13.00. </p>
