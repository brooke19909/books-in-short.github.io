Smartphone Overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Surely, each of us, while studying information about a particular mobile phone, met the phrase ‚Äúsmartphone-flagship‚Äù.  Lenovo K900, <span>Samsung Galaxy S6,</span> Apple iPhone 6S and many other models are often referred to by this term.  At the same time, ordinary users do not always understand how such a mobile phone differs from others, what they should expect by acquiring a <span>model of this</span> category. </p><p>  In this article, we will tell <span>you what a flagship smartphone is</span> and analyze how it differs from simple devices.  We also give examples of phones that can definitely be called ‚Äúflagships,‚Äù and explain why. </p><h2>  The concept of "flagship" </h2><p>  The term itself, to which the article is devoted, came from the phrase ‚Äúflagship‚Äù.  This is how one of the ships that carries out command is characterized. </p><p>  By analogy, this term, transferred to the mobile market, can refer to one - the most prestigious, productive, expensive device.  Thus, the development company claims: ‚ÄúThis phone is the flagship.  It‚Äôs more powerful, faster and more convenient than everyone else. ‚Äù  Buyers, in turn, can focus on such a model and make their choice either in favor of it, or another, cheaper device. </p><p>  A review of smartphones shows that the flagship, as a rule, is released in the form of some unique technological solution and appears in the image of a novelty.  Due to this, an artificial demand for this device is created.  The promotion tools for such a phone should include a massive advertising campaign.  Read on for how to find out what a flagship smartphone is in each particular device line. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Criteria for evaluation </h2><p>  In fact, with the search criteria of the flagship model, everything is quite simple.  Most often, the price set by the manufacturer can serve as a hint.  After all, it is logical that the most advanced and powerful phone will also be the most expensive. </p><p>  In addition to the price, attention must be paid to the technical parameters.  This concept includes indicators such as device performance <span>(</span> processor <span>clock speed</span> , RAM size, number of cores and their type), its life (battery capacity affects this), operating system and a number of other options.  All this is indicated in the description for each phone - and by these indicators you can confidently identify the best flagships of smartphones. </p><p>  You can guess which model is the flagship, and the date of its release and presentation of the device.  Of course, the most advanced, powerful and expensive phones are always new.  The flagships of smartphones are constantly updating in order to diversify the range and, in addition, stimulate additional sales.  You don‚Äôt need to go far for an example - take a look at Apple, which releases a new model every six months, creating a real sensation. </p><h2>  Who is cooler? </h2><p>  In fact, it is difficult to compare the flagships of smartphones and say which one is cooler.  And the thing is that almost any most advanced phone is equipped with the most high-tech stuffing - a new processor, a colorful display, a strong battery and an advanced wear-resistant case.  Due to this, each such device is ‚Äúthe best‚Äù.  Therefore, the difference between those of them that are released in the same time period (say, in the interval of 1-2 months) lies solely in the company that developed it and in its vision of the ‚Äúideal smartphone‚Äù.  In all other respects, almost all flagships are the same. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Marketing </h2><p>  True, there is another point of view regarding this issue.  Some analysts of the mobile device market argue that the very concept that we are talking about in the article does not exist.  They explain what a flagship smartphone is, because it is a marketing decision to ‚Äúpromote‚Äù one particular model in every way.  In fact, a phone with strong characteristics and a high-quality (according to the developers) design is taken and begins to be actively advertised.  For this, of course, it is called the ‚Äúflagship‚Äù to show: this is the best that the user can get. </p>

    <p>  If you look at this category of phones from this point of view, then you should really review the flagships - smartphones positioned as ‚Äúthe coolest‚Äù from their manufacturer. </p><h2>  Characteristic </h2><p>  In order for the user to understand more about flagships, as part of the article, we will conduct a brief review of some of the most famous models.  All of them are widely advertised in the media and various reviews, and some have been hearing for years.  Thus, a review of smartphones in this category will give us the opportunity to compare them and, perhaps, even choose the best one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Apple iPhone 6S </h2><p>  Of course, we will start with the world famous iPhone.  It is believed that this phone is the best in the world in all categories, and it is the embodiment of simply the most advanced technologies available to mankind. </p><p>  But this is not so.  The device is certainly good, but it is ‚Äújust a phone.‚Äù  The device runs on an A9 processor, which consists of two cores.  Despite their small number (as it may seem to users of Android gadgets), the phone shows simply wonders of speed.  In addition to speed, it also gives you the opportunity to enjoy a flawless design (smooth forms, brushed metal, graphic design of iOS 9) and useful options like unlocking the screen using Touch ID. </p>

    <p>  What can I say - the iPhone is the most popular device, despite its high cost in relation to other phones.  Obviously, for a reason. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia Z3 + DS </h2><p>  Not only Apple has its own cool phones.  Here, for example, Sony.  The flagship smartphone in its lineup is the Xperia Z3 + DS.  Although the device is built on Android and does not have a logo ‚Äúapple‚Äù on the back cover, its cost is a little less than that of the iPhone.  Ask why so? </p><p>  Well, we will not talk about design for a long time - and so it is clear that the device is presented in a beautiful, framed metal case, which is nice to hold in your hand.  In addition, there is a powerful eight-core processor (every 4 cores have a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz and 2 GHz).  This device will definitely not hang, slow down or malfunction, so be sure! </p><p>  Further, we can mention the complete moisture resistance of the case - when you drop your Sony in a puddle, you should not panic.  Also here is a powerful 20-megapixel camera and colorful Triluminos Display for viewing photos in the best quality. </p><p>  Again, since this is a flagship, its price reaches $ 800. </p><h2>  LG G4 </h2><p>  Another interesting Android model was developed by LG.  It is sold at the same price as the previous phone, and costs about $ 800.  At the same time, the phone has its own advantages, the most obvious of which is the design.  It can be seen that the developers have worked hard to create the concept of ‚Äúphone for the successful.‚Äù  In particular, the leather insert on the rear panel looks interesting, and even pleasant to the touch. </p><p>  In addition to it, you can point to a high-quality screen with a display having a density of 543 pixels per inch.  This is a lot - the image quality on the device corresponds to the quality of the image on the leaflets that are distributed to you near the metro. </p>

    <p>  The performance of the model is also at the level - 6 cores with a clock frequency of 1.6 GHz allow you not to worry about system requirements before starting another colorful game. </p><p>  Also, according to customer reviews, the phone has an excellent body assembly, a high-performance camera with a resolution of 16 megapixels and a laser autofocus function.  Do not doubt that the gadget takes the best pictures that can only be imagined on a device of this class.  Look at the LG G4 - and you will understand <span>what a flagship smartphone is.</span> </p><h2>  Samsung </h2><p>  Of course, the Korean corporation Samsung has a flagship device.  We are talking about the <span>Galaxy A7</span> model <span>, the</span> presentation of which took place shortly before the writing of the article.  What is noteworthy in Samsung phones is the positioning of each of the presented versions of devices as the ‚Äúbest‚Äù in a particular class.  For example, the A7 is currently the best in the category of ‚Äúbudget flagship smartphones‚Äù (since its cost is only about $ 400). </p><p>  There is also the Galaxy S6 (it was already mentioned by us at the very beginning of the article).  This device will cost almost $ 1,100, because it is equipped even better than the same iPhone 6S.  Say here we have a Super AMOLED display with a size of 5.1 inches with a high-quality picture, the pixel density of which is 577 ppi. </p><p>  Here is a heavy-duty eight-core processor (4 cores with a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz and 2.1 GHz).  In addition, the developers paid special attention to the design of the device, the materials from which the phone is made. </p>

    <p>  Finally, another flagship device from the Koreans is Samsung Note Edge.  It also has strong characteristics, but is presented in a different class of gadgets - with a display of 5.6 inches (like the A7, but more expensive). </p><p>  In fact, the Korean giant is trying to occupy all the niches at once, introducing phones in different classes.  We can judge this at least by the number of devices manufactured by the company on a regular basis.  Samsung has dozens of models that are constantly updated and replaced with other, newer ones.  There is a constant rotation, in which you can see the flagships. </p><h2>  Lenovo P90 </h2><p>  Not all ‚Äútop-end‚Äù devices are offered at the highest possible price.  There is, for example, the Chinese flagship smartphone, which was released by Lenovo.  This is the P90, priced at $ 400.  The device is equipped with powerful cameras (13 and 5 megapixels), a quad-core processor from Intel, a colorful display that runs on Full HD technology. </p>

    <p>  Together with a battery with a capacity of 4000 mAh, the phone offers the user exactly the set that is necessary to perform basic tasks.  Both the functionality and speed of the model make it an indispensable assistant in any situation. </p><h2>  HTC One M9 </h2><p>  HTC also recently unveiled its flagship model, the One M9.  It will cost the buyer more than the previously presented phone - $ 900.  But the device has an even more powerful ‚Äúheart‚Äù (4 cores with a clock frequency of 2 GHz, and 4 with 1.5 GHz), a high-quality 20-megapixel camera, a slot for a memory card, a battery capacity of 2840 mAh.  These technical parameters make the device very convenient and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù in everyday use. </p><p>  As for the additional options, they include an attractive metal case (built on a ‚Äútiered‚Äù principle), <span>sapphire crystal</span> on the camera lens, a magnetic sensor and more. </p>

    <p>  However, with regard to this flagship - reviews about it are not the most flattering.  There are a lot of comments that the device is warming up, or that the lens glass is crookedly glued on it.  Of course, such defects should not be on the best device of the lineup. </p><h2>  Huawei Ascend Mate7 </h2><p>  Another Chinese manufacturer, Huawei, also has a flagship.  The company is launching the Ascend Mate7 model - a business smartphone for $ 550-600.  The device, like the ones described above, is offered with an 8-core processor that can switch between the cores in the process of performing tasks.  This ensures maximum performance. </p><p>  As for the additional options, here is available, for example, the ability to unlock the screen by touching the back cover of the device.  The thing is that a special sensor is installed on it, capable of accurately reading user fingerprint data.  A decent response to the sensor on the Home button (like the iPhone and Samsung). </p>

    <p>  Also, if you read reviews about the model, you can notice data on the attractive design of the case, on its high-quality assembly, perfectly selected materials and much more.  All this together makes the device truly a ‚Äúflagship‚Äù phone. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In the article, we described some of the most common top-end models of devices on the market.  As you can see, they all have advanced technical stuffing, presented in the form of a powerful processor, high-quality camera and display, a capacious battery.  Also, which is characteristic, in the ‚Äúflagships‚Äù they also rely on additional options.  For example, this is the design of the device, its ergonomics, interface, some functions that make the daily operations that we carry out with a smartphone, easier and more affordable. </p><p>  In fact, the flagship differs from the usual device only in a set of these ‚Äúadd-ons‚Äù and, of course, in the level of performance.  If you need a phone for some more mundane purposes - communication and banal surfing on the network, then you do not need to acquire a ‚Äútop-end‚Äù model.  And, on the contrary, if you want to get the best copy of those that are in the manufacturer‚Äôs lineup to work with the most productive and stylish device, take the ‚Äúflagship‚Äù - you won‚Äôt regret it. </p>
