Over time, a huge amount of this material accumulates in each apartment.  Many countries are already abandoning the use of plastic bags in stores, wanting to protect nature from this scourge.  Let us join the ecologists by reusing old packages and renewing their useful existence. </p><p>  In the article, we consider various options for crafts from cellophane packages.  These are decorative elements for decorating apartments and household plots, children's toys, knitted baskets, bags or foot mats.  You can make magnificent pompons for a dance or arrange a room for a holiday, a bouquet of flowers in a vase and a Christmas tree on a stand look beautiful. </p><p>  Making crafts from plastic bags is easy.  For most of them, you need to cut the product into thin strips and combine them into a long continuous thread, from which a new thing will subsequently be made.  If you know how to knit or crochet using yarn, then you can show your skills in weaving from cellophane threads. </p><h2>  Chrysanthemums </h2><p>  One of the interesting ideas for crafts from cellophane bags is the manufacture of a variety of colors.  The photo below shows a sample of lush chrysanthemums from burgundy-colored packets attached to a wire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cellophane flowers" class="if uuid-3089759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3089759.jpg"></div><p>  In order to start work on the craft, prepare a long thread from interconnected strips of polyethylene.  You will also need a cardboard template for the size of the future flower.  A synthetic thread is wound with many turns on the base and is connected by a thread in the center.  Then the template is carefully removed, and the cellophane loops are straightened in all directions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From below they screw the wire, creating a stalk.  You can then wrap it with a strip of green polyethylene or use corrugated paper.  The center of the flower, where all the petals come together, is lined with yellow or orange floss.  Such a bouquet can be put in a vase or "planted" on a personal plot, decorating a flower bed. </p><p>  This craft from cellophane packages is simple, you can do it together with children of primary school age.  Some masters after tying the winding in the center with scissors cut polyethylene loops, then the flowers are made up of thin threads, the petals come out twice as much, and the flower turns out to be more magnificent. </p><h2>  Lush pompom </h2><p>  From thin strips cut from packets of the same or different colors, you can make a magnificent pompom.  Such crafts from plastic bags are used to create toys by connecting different sizes of products with a glue gun.  So, the figure of a bunny consists of one large pompom for the body, a middle one for the head, two small ones for the front paws.  The remaining small parts are added from other materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cellophane pompom" class="if uuid-3089795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3089795.jpg"></div><p>  Let's take a closer look at how to make such a craft out of plastic bags with your own hands.  You will need a cardboard template.  It can be made from corrugated packaging cardboard of a rectangular shape or in the form of two rings.  Then the polyethylene thread is wound with many turns around the warp.  If winding was carried out on a rectangular template, then you need to tie all layers of thread in the center, carefully removing the paper.  Loops are cut with scissors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If rings were used, as in the manufacture of a pompom from yarn, then the principle of operation is the same.  A thread is wound around the rings.  Then the scissors are inserted with a point between the cardboard templates and cut them along the edge of the circle.  Then a strong kapron thread is inserted there and a knot is tied.  It remains to take out the cardboard and trim the pompom with scissors from all sides so that it looks neat. </p><h2>  Christmas wreath on the door </h2><p>  The spectacular craft of cellophane bags, the photo of which you see below, consists of a huge number of small parts that were strung on the wire alternately.  The constituent elements may be in the form of a square or a star.  The main thing is the presence of sharp corners, giving the wreath fluffy.  Parts are immediately cut out in bundles of one pattern, a hole is made in the center point of each pile and a wire is passed through. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas wreath" class="if uuid-3089784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3089784.jpg"></div><p>  When the entire surface of the ring is filled, the ends of the wire are twisted together and catch the loop for hanging.  Further work is done on decorating the wreath.  The simplest design option is to attach small Christmas-tree balls of contrasting colors with hot glue.  You can wrap it with silver or gold "rain". </p><h2>  Toys </h2><p>  Such a wonderful chicken is created on a wire frame.  It is made up of several pompons of different diameters, interconnected by a wire.  A strip of polyethylene is taken wide so that the frills are large. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful cellophane craft" class="if uuid-3089796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3089796.jpg"></div><p>  The paws on the bottom form yellow tape.  Hot glue stick small parts, separately cut with scissors from other packages. </p><h2>  Jump rope to the child </h2><p>  From packages of three different colors, you can quickly twist the rope to the child.  You will also need colored tape for decorating pens.  The thread of each color should be long, because braiding with a pigtail makes it shorter than the size necessary for the rope. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cardingtonlibrary.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rope from old packages" class="if uuid-3089779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3089779.jpg"></div><p>  To make the pigtail tight, it is recommended to tie the beginning of weaving, for example, to the back of a chair or a heating radiator.  You can ask to hold the ends of the stripes of a family member or future owner of the rope.  When the required length of the craft is reached, the ends are pulled together with a strip of adhesive tape in several turns on one and the other. </p><h2>  Basket </h2><p>  How to weave a pigtail from strips of cellophane, you already know.  A large laundry basket is sewn in a circle from a long blank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cellophane basket" class="if uuid-3089763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3089763.jpg"></div><p>  The bottom of the crafts can be woven with a large hook, and only its sides can be wrapped with a pigtail. </p><p>  We examined several original handicrafts from plastic bags.  The advice of experienced craftsmen will help you cope with your own work faster. </p>
