This and much more can be found in this article. </p><h2>  Meaning of the word ‚Äúvictim‚Äù </h2><p>  ‚ÄúSacrifice‚Äù - according to the Explanatory Dictionary of the Russian language of Ozhegov, means anything brought to the deity as a gift (living creature, any object) or an offering to the gods.  In another way, it appears as a sacrifice. </p><p>  Another explanation is the rejection of someone or something in favor of another.  It is presented as self-sacrifice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victim what is" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/918739.jpg" width="409"></div>

    <p>  The 3rd version of the meaning of the word ‚Äúvictim‚Äù is a person or any living creature that suffers suffering from failures, misfortunes and violence (victim of violence, accident, elements, etc.). </p><p>  What does the victim mean? Let us try to find out, having understood the essence of the psychology of the victim itself, the role of the people present next to her. </p><h2>  The essence of the psychology of the victim </h2><p>  The most important feeling of a potential victim is fear.  In nature, any organism reacts differently to this situation.  The chameleon changes color, merging in color with the shades of the environment, the deer freezes, the hermit crab slams in its sink, the skunk throws a terribly smelly liquid, and the cat just hisses, arching its back. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But what is the psychology of a human victim? </p>

    <p>  Victim - what is it?  In this situation, the <span>victim‚Äôs position is</span> unpredictable and specific.  There is a special section in psychology - victimology (‚Äúvictim‚Äù translated from English as ‚Äúvictim‚Äù). </p><p>  Psychologists have long wondered what can be common in the <span>personality of criminals</span> and what is the psychology of the victims.  According to numerous stories of the investigating authorities, judges and convicts, it turns out that the victims also have certain common features - both in behavior and in the style of thinking. </p><h2>  Who is present next to the victim? </h2><p>  In any of the conflicts, there are always three role positions that are interconnected with each other.  The victim is unable to exist without another representative. </p><p>  What happens as soon as they begin to interact?  Of course, a third one appears right there - the hero-savior, who is trying to protect the unfortunate from attacks.  Such a plot is often found in fairy tales. </p><p>  But in fairy tales, evil is always justly punished, the victim is rehabilitated, and the humble savior goes into the distance.  And everyone who has read or viewed the tale remains confident that the last hero will return at any moment and help all the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones, punishing the ‚Äúbad ones‚Äù.  Everything is simple. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What happens in life situations? </h2><p>  Such is the sacrifice in a fairy tale.  What is she in life?  It is rarely so easy and straightforward here.  The very plot of the struggle between good and evil often arises in the society around us and in everyday situations.  However, here, each of the parties to the dispute, as a rule, is convinced that it is he who represents the very good, that is, the unfortunate victim of unjust attacks. </p><p>  And the other side of the dispute acts as evil, and at best - out of ignorance, and at worst - out of intentional cruelty. </p>

    <p>  And the savior is not in the image of a good fairy fairy, but simply someone‚Äôs authoritative article, a lawyer, a doctor, a psychologist, a policeman, a psychologist, a ‚Äúcourt‚Äù of friends and relatives, or even just impressive fists. </p><h2>  Why is it sometimes beneficial to be a victim? </h2><p>  Sometimes the victim also benefits.  What is the benefit?  Paradoxical as it may seem, being in the victim‚Äôs position (or just putting yourself in that role) is sometimes beneficial. </p><p>  It happens that there are problems that prevent a person from doing what he wants.  And it happens that problems help not to do what he does not want.  This is the very <span>benefit (secondary).</span> </p><h2>  Examples of apparent helplessness </h2><p>  For example, if someone has some kind of damage in their hands (eczema, for example), then this is an excellent reason not to wash the dishes ever. </p><p>  Or, for example, if a woman is the mother of three babies, then in the near future (several years) she can not worry about career problems. </p><p>  There are many such situations. </p>

    <p>  Problems at work justify low earnings or conflicts with their loved ones. </p><p>  Concern for elderly parents does not allow a person to leave their home and face the difficulties of an independent life. </p><p>  Circumstances themselves contribute to the emergence of causes (however, not everyone uses it) for the birth of a person with the position of ‚Äúvictim‚Äù.  What is behind this expression - the answer is received. </p><p>  That is why many people cling to apparent helplessness and wish to be saved by anyone.  So living for them is more convenient. </p>
