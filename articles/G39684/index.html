    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The sea is just 300 meters from Aiyapura Resort &amp; Spa.  In general, the beach here, according to tourists, is not bad.  However, at the bottom when entering the sea, algae are encountered that create unpleasant sensations.  Many vacationers preferred to go to other beaches of the island.  The most popular is White Sand Beach.  By the way, there is a well-developed infrastructure: there are pharmacies, shops, supermarkets, cafes, macau-shops, souvenir shops, etc.  Our compatriots advise, if possible, to take sunscreen products from home, since on Koh Chang they are quite expensive. </p><p>  You can get here for free on the hotel shuttle, which runs in this direction several times a day.  You can also sail to nearby beaches by kayak.  They (like bicycles) can be taken at the hotel. </p>
