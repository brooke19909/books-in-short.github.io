For Russians, this is the famous <span>Red Square.</span>  Muscovites have much to be proud of, because in order to see this famous place, they do not have to go a long way.  There is a statement that this square is the most famous in the whole world.  Well, we will not persuade anyone to the contrary.  And we ourselves turn a little to historical facts and learn more about what they are, the sights of Red Square. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="red square sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/629210.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How it all began </h2><p>  When in 1493 Tsar Ivan removed wooden structures from the territories around the Kremlin in order to avoid the occurrence of fires, which were often raging in Moscow at that time, he laid the foundation for the most famous <span>square in Russia.</span>  True, in those days, increasingly more or less even platforms in cities were occupied by trade, and their names, respectively, were different.  At first it was called Torg, later Torgovaya, and later the epithet ‚Äúred‚Äù appeared.  The square in Moscow in those days was really very beautiful.  As always, everything that starts with trading activity later takes on a political connotation.  It was at this time that some of the attractions of Red Square began to be built, although not all of them have survived to their days in their original form.  Those that we have the pleasure of observing now are worth getting to know more closely. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Red Square in Moscow" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/629209.jpg" width="550"></div>

There is a rather cruel legend among the people that after the construction was completed in 1560, all the architects were blinded by order of the king, so that they could no longer build a building similar in beauty and grandeur.  The temple is made in a rather bright color scheme, but red still prevails.  The area in Moscow has long been associated with tourists with this cathedral, and most of us know its unofficial name - St. <span>Basil's Cathedral.</span>  It so happened that the Russian saint chose this temple as a favorite place of residence during his lifetime, and after death was buried at it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="red square photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/629213.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Frontal place </h2><p>  The sights of Red Square are of great historical significance, and the famous <span>frontal place</span> is no exception.  This site, made of white stone around the 16th century, was not the place of execution, although many think so.  And the name itself came from the name of Golgotha, which for the residents of Moscow, who are mostly Orthodox, has a sacred meaning.  A site fenced with a cast-iron fence was built so that royal decrees were proclaimed from it.  The future anointed tsars were taken here to get acquainted with the people, exhibited to worship the relics of the revered saints in Russia, well, sometimes sentences were also read.  The frontal place is a historical symbol for many Russians, a place for important events that broke the course of our country's history. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="museums in red square" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/629212.jpg" width="600"></div>

No matter how he was called: the Soul of the people, and the Cradle of history.  Many joyful and tragic events were committed within the walls of this magnificent building, which will delight even the most sophisticated tourist.  Since the Kremlin was laid back in the 14th century, its appearance was constantly changing, many wooden buildings disappeared as a result of fires, which were a frequent occurrence in Moscow.  All the attractions of Red Square are certainly important, but the Kremlin takes an honorable first place.  The modern complex consists of 20 towers, the oldest of which was built in 1485.  Only five of them, the tallest, are decorated with stars.  These are Vodovzvodnaya, Nikolskaya, Spasskaya, Troitskaya and Borovitskaya. </p><h2>  Historical Museum </h2><p>  As we already know, all the museums on Red Square are of unprecedented value to the people.  But there is one place that you can visit in a short time to learn all the greatness of the past and present of our country.  We are talking about the Historical Museum, a huge complex that stores real treasures.  In the bowels of this seemingly heavy building is a huge number of artifacts.  Some architects criticize the museum building, consider it too ‚Äúheavy‚Äù and such that it stands out from the general ensemble.  But given that over its long history, the appearance of Red Square has repeatedly been radically redrawn, any criticism is superfluous.  It is fortunate for our generation that the area in general has survived to our days, and it is no longer so important in what form. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Red Square in Moscow" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/629211.jpg" width="583"></div>

    <h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  It will not be difficult for modern architects and restorers to bring at least the facades of buildings into proper form and adjust everything to a single ensemble.  Moreover, now during the restoration of the building it is customary to ‚Äúput on‚Äù a so-called cocoon so that for the residents the final result of the restoration work is a surprise.  Recently, we can observe such a cocoon over the building of the mausoleum, we hope that this is not another cosmetic repair. </p><p>  In fact, no matter what the appearance of Red Square, only its sacred meaning matters to the Russian people of all generations.  No matter how many reconstructions she goes through, people will still come here, come from all over our vast country.  For several decades, a portrait made at this place has occupied a place of honor in the album of millions of citizens.  Arriving here, you will love this color - red.  The area, the photo of which is in our article, is liked by absolutely everyone. </p>
