All the <span>first people</span> lived in common dwellings, because it was easier to survive.  Having united in a community, they could transfer experience from older generations to younger ones, who, in turn, learned to hunt, to make various tools from wood and stone.  Skills and knowledge have been passed down from generation to generation for many centuries. </p><p>  Every student must know the history of their ancestors.  They can gain knowledge from textbooks that describe the life of ancient people.  Grade 5 provides an opportunity to get acquainted with the first people and find out the features of their life. </p><h2>  First fire </h2>

The conquest of fire was the first step towards the survival of mankind.  Ancient people first became acquainted with fire when they saw volcanic eruptions and forest fires.  People were not afraid of the scale of the disasters that fell upon them, but, on the contrary, wanted to use fire for their own benefit.  Therefore, they learned to mine it artificially.  Getting fire was a rather time-consuming process, so it was carefully cared for and kept.  Ancient people made fire in the following way.  They took a dry tablet, made a hole in it and twisted a wand in it until smoke appeared, followed by a fire in dry leaves near the hole.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Weapons and tools </h2><p>  The life story of ancient people has interesting facts.  Scientists have found interesting finds: <span>weapons, tools</span> and many household items.  They surprise with their ingenuity.  All items are made by ancient craftsmen from improvised materials: wood, bone and stone.  The main tools were considered objects made of stone.  With their help, wood and bone were subsequently processed.  Many tribes, in order to protect, made batons, arrows, spears and knives from stone.  Axes were made from deer and whale bone for the manufacture of boats from a solid tree trunk.  The process of manufacturing one boat with such an instrument of labor could take up to three years.  Needles made of dog bones sewed shoes and clothes. </p><h2>  Cooking Features </h2><p>  The life of an ancient person could not do without cooking.  The first people made household items primarily from bushes and branches, leather, bamboo, wood, coconut shells, birch bark, and more.  Food was cooked in wooden troughs, into which hot stones were thrown.  In a later period, people learned how to make dishes from clay.  This marked the beginning of the real cooking of food.  The analogs of spoons were river and sea shells, and forks were ordinary wooden sticks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="human life in the art of ancient egypt" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22753/548749.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fishing, hunting and gathering </h2><p>  In the communities, fishing, hunting and gathering were an integral part of the life of ancient people.  This type of food production refers to the appropriating form of farming.  In ancient times, people were engaged in gathering fruits, bird eggs, larvae, snails, root crops and more.  Mostly it was the work of women of the tribe.  Men got the role of hunters and fishermen.  While hunting, they undertook various tricks: traps, traps, corrals and raids.  The aim of the hunt was to obtain food and other livelihoods, namely: horns, tendons, feathers, fat, bone and skins.  In fishing, sticks with sharp stone tips were used, and later they began to weave nets. </p><h2>  Livestock raising </h2><p>  The appropriating form of the economy was replaced by the producer.  One main can be distinguished - cattle breeding.  <span>The way of life of</span> ancient people changed over time, from nomads they became sedentary, they stopped trying to leave their settlements, settled in them forever.  Therefore, the taming and breeding of animals became possible.  Cattle breeding arose from hunting.  The first <span>domesticated animals</span> were sheep, goats and pigs, later cattle and horses.  Accordingly, an indispensable pet was a dog that guarded the house and was an ally in the hunt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the spiritual life of an ancient person" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22753/548743.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Agriculture </h2><p>  Women played a leading role in the development of agriculture, since they were engaged in gathering.  The life of an ancient person changed radically when he mastered this type of food production.  Trees were cut down from stones with axes, then burned.  Thus, space was freed up in flattering areas.  A pointed tip digger was an impromptu chopper.  Her first people dug the earth.  Later, they invented a shovel - a stick with a flat end, and a hoe - an ordinary female with a shoot, to which a sharp stone, bone tip or horn of an animal was tied.  Around the world, ancient people grew in the fields those plants that were inherent in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir habitat.  Corn, potato and pumpkin were grown in America, rice in Indochina, wheat in Asia, cabbage in Europe and so on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="life story of ancient people" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22753/548750.jpg" width="576"></div>

    <h2>  Handicrafts </h2><p>  Over time, the life of an ancient person forced to master various crafts.  They developed according to the conditions of the locality of the first people and the availability of nearby raw materials.  The earliest of them are considered: woodwork, pottery, leather dressing, weaving, skinning and bark processing.  There is a hunch that pottery arose during the process of weaving vessels by women.  They began to smear them with clay or in the pieces of clay themselves to squeeze indentations for liquids. </p><h2>  Spiritual life </h2><p>  The spiritual life of an ancient person is visible in the cultural heritage of Ancient Egypt.  This great civilization has left a significant mark in the history of all mankind.  Religious motifs permeated all the work of the Egyptians.  The first people believed that human earthly existence was only a transition to the <span>afterlife.</span>  This stage was not considered so important.  From birth, people were preparing to leave for a more perfect other world.  The reflection of the spiritual life of Ancient Egypt is reflected in painting and other forms of art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="life of ancient people grade 5" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22753/548748.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Human life in the art of Ancient Egypt </h2><p>  In the <span>Ancient Egyptian</span> state, an extraordinary and vibrant painting flourished.  The Egyptians were deeply religious religious people, so their whole life consisted of rituals, which can be traced to the theme of their paintings and drawings.  Most of the paintings are dedicated to higher mystical creatures, the glorification of the dead, religious rites and priests.  To this day, the finds of these works are true examples of art. </p><p>  Egyptian artists performed paintings in accordance with strict frameworks.  It was customary to depict the figures of gods, people and animals strictly in full view, and their faces in profile.  It looks like a kind of mystical scheme.  The Egyptian painting served as decoration of the regilious buildings, tombs and buildings where noble citizens lived.  Also, the painting of Ancient Egypt is characterized by monumentality.  In the temples of their gods, Egyptian artists created images that at times reached enormous proportions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lifestyle of ancient people" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22753/548752.jpg" width="324"></div>
