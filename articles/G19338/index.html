    <h2>  General Information at a Glance </h2><p>  Pavel Alekseevich Belov lived for a long sixty-five years, during which he managed to go through two wars.  It was they who determined his future fate, showing the true purpose of this brilliant military leader. </p><p>  Even in peacetime, General Belov did not abandon the work of his life.  During this period, he graduated from the Higher Military Academy and was even a representative of the people in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.  At the end of his life, Pavel Alekseevich actively wrote memoirs, but managed to cover only the initial period of the Great Patriotic War.  The full biography of Belov was written much later, according to the recollections of people who knew him well.  The memoirs were printed in a hundred thousand copies a year after the general passed away. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that for his services he received not only awards from the fatherland, but also from foreign countries.  Most of them were assigned to the commander of the Polish People's Republic. </p><h2>  Biography Belova P.A. </h2><p>  The future hero was born on February 6, 1897 in Shuya.  His parents were simple workers in the factory, so great prospects that could radically affect his life simply did not exist. </p><p>  However, at the age of nineteen, Belov Pavel Alekseevich joined the imperial army: his fate at that moment was already completely predetermined.  During two years of service, he managed to learn and get a new rank. </p><p>  In 1918, the 20th century, he became part of the Red Army, and after three years he was able to rise to the command post.  For several years he has come a long way, completing various courses and taking part in numerous campaigns of the Soviet army. </p><p>  By the beginning of World War II, he approached the post of commander of a <span>cavalry regiment.</span>  Twelve months later, the Soviet military leader Pavel Belov assumed command of the sixty-first army.  During the war, he was wounded more than once, fought in the rear of enemy troops, left the encirclement and was directly involved in the offensive on the Dnieper.  It was for the last actions that he was awarded the title of Hero of the USSR. </p><p>  In peacetime, Belov was actively involved in the prosperity of his country.  Colonel General Pavel Belov died at the age of sixty-five on December 3, 1962.  He was buried in the Novodevichy cemetery, where to this day his grave and a modest monument are located. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Youth of Pavel Belov </h2><p>  The future General Belov, born in the family of a factory worker, always showed a penchant for military affairs.  But he did not even imagine that the war would become his fate.  At the age of sixteen, young Paul graduated from elementary school and began working to help his family. </p><p>  For three years, Belov has changed many positions and professions.  He worked as a messenger in his father‚Äôs factory, as a clerk and telegraph student.  In 1916 he joined the army, which eventually became the work of his life. </p><h2>  Service in the tsarist army </h2><p>  Little is known about this period of the life of the future General Belov.  He rarely recalled him, mentioning only dry facts.  Historians know for certain that for more than a year he served as an ordinary in a reserve regiment, based in the Voronezh region. </p><p>  Then for four months Pavel Alekseevich was sent to study in Rostov-on-Don, from where he was supposed to return with the rank of ensign.  But the revolution fundamentally changed the established life of a young man who did not want to take part in the clashes between the people and the imperial regiments. </p>

    <h2>  Red Army: service to the young Soviet state </h2><p>  In order not to get into the White Guard army, Belov hid for several months in a remote village far in the mountains.  But by spring I decided to return to Ivanovo, which at that time was called Ivanovo-Voznesensk.  Here Pavel again went to work at the telegraph of the railway, where he was registered as a clerk before leaving for service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In late summer, Belov joined the Red Army and immediately received the position of instructor.  His duties included training new fighters, which proved to be very useful in the difficult conditions of the Civil War. </p><p>  Since the summer of 1919, Pavel Alekseevich took command of the cavalry platoon and took an active part in the hostilities. </p><h2>  The formation of a military career </h2><p>  Belov fought mainly on the Southern Front.  He happened to face Denikin‚Äôs troops and participate in the suppression of the Tambov uprising.  In the fall of 1919, he was first wounded and underwent long treatment in a hospital.  Then he was sent on vacation to his parents to go through a recovery period in a calm environment. </p><p>  The following two years became very successful for Pavel Alekseevich, he very quickly climbed the career ladder, receiving ranks and new appointments one after another: </p><ul><li>  from spring to autumn of the twentieth year of the last century, he went from a platoon commander to a squadron commander; </li><li>  the next twelve months he spent in the position of squadron commander of the second reserve cavalry regiment; </li><li>  in the twenty-first year, Belov was appointed to the post of commander of a cavalry regiment. </li></ul><p>  During the specified period of time, the future general personally eliminated armed gangs in different parts of the country.  He managed to visit the Donbass, the North Caucasus and the Kuban. </p>
