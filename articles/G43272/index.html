  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The procedure and methods of protecting civil rights</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A person as a subject of law has the ability to defend his rights in this way - both political and, of course, civil, so that they can be realized.  Both international documents, including the UN Declaration of Human Rights, as well as national ones - namely, constitutions and legislative systems of various countries - provide such an opportunity and consolidate it legally.  In Russia, the very concept and methods of protecting <span>civil rights by subjects of law are</span> prescribed in the Civil Code.  According to this document, protection of rights is the opportunity to take legal measures provided to an authorized person to restore his or her violated rights or rights that are disputed.  The subject of protection is, in this case, violated civil rights and interests protected by law. </p><p>  Thus, they distinguish between <span>forms and methods of protecting civil rights.</span>  <span>Forms of protection</span> (jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional) are a set of measures agreed upon and established by law to protect subjective rights and interests.  In a jurisdictional form, authorized bodies of the state act when a person whose rights are violated seeks protection (for example, the authorities, file an administrative complaint, or apply to the court).  In a non-jurisdictional form, citizens and organizations independently act in defense of violated civil rights, and do not turn to authorities or local governments for help, but unite for self-defense or even act alone.  But a non-jurisdictional form of protection must be legally authorized. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ways to protect civil rights are legislatively approved or sanctioned by law measures of <span>substantive law that</span> are mandatory in relation to the offender, through which violated rights are restored.  Depending on the type or form of how to restore the violated rights, they distinguish: elimination of the violation of the <span>right, restoration</span> (i.e. recognition) of the right and compensation for losses that were caused by such violation. </p><p>  The Civil Code of the Russian Federation has a special article 12 devoted to this issue, and it lists eleven different ways of how such protection can be implemented.  But this does not mean that you can protect your rights only as described in this article.  So, there are such ways of protecting civil rights, such as recognizing the invalidity of the rights of a particular subject, or of any act issued by a state or other body (for example, local government).  These two methods of protection are implemented only in court, and in the second case, the right to appeal in court has only a person or organization (legal entity) whose rights have been violated as a result of the publication of such an act.  Another method of protecting the law echoes this, namely, the non-application by the court of an act or document that is contrary to the law and which was issued by a state authority or a self-government body.  This method applies to both regulatory and individual legal acts of these institutions of power. </p><p>  There are also ways to protect rights that do not require a mandatory appeal to the court and can be restored voluntarily by the violator or by self-defense.  For example, when a transaction is recognized as invalid, and the consequences of this recognition are applied in practice in the future.  Or when the situation is restored that existed before this right was violated;  when actions that threaten the <span>realization of a right</span> or even violate it are suppressed.  Civil law provides in some cases, and such ways of protecting civil rights as self-defense or the decision of the violator to voluntarily restore the violated rights.  This may be a voluntary compensation in the form of monetary compensation;  or compensation for a penalty stipulated by the contract or law (which may be provided voluntarily or as a result of a court decision).  But the award to fulfill obligations, compensation for <span>moral damages,</span> termination or change of legal relations are those forms of restoration of violated civil rights that are realized only through appeal to the court, that is, in a jurisdictional order. </p>
