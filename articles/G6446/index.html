It is necessary to clarify how to correctly pronounce this word.  The Japanese art of folding from fabric or flower ribbons is called kanzashi.  Women of the land of the rising sun have long loved to pin their hairstyles with scallops or pins decorated with flowers of various shapes.  We fell in love with small triangles that either gather on a thin thread or stick together.  This subtype of creativity is called Khan.  The technique of manufacturing such kanzashi for beginners, we will consider in this article. </p><h2>  Fabric quail </h2><p>  You can collect a beautiful flower for an elastic band or a hair clip using a small piece of thin fabric.  For work, you will also need pins with a bead at the end, a thin thread to connect parts of the craft, a decorative element to design the middle of the flower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="artescomcapricho.blogspot.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric kanzashi" class="if uuid-2540240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2540240.jpg"></div><p>  Five squares are cut depending on the size of the petals.  Kanzashi for beginners has its own characteristics: you need to learn how to fold fabric properly.  First of all, the square is bent in half diagonally.  The next action is performed after turning the workpiece base down.  The extreme corners of the triangle rise up to the connection with the top of the figure.  All ends are fastened together with a pin.  The resulting figure is flipped to the opposite side, but the pin remains below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When making <span>kanzashi flowers, it is</span> recommended for beginners to stitch them right away to fix the product details.  After connecting the corners in the center, immediately make a couple of stitches.  Then the product is turned on the front side and the fabric is gently straightened by hand.  One petal is ready, it is laid aside.  Work continues in the same way with all other details.  At the end, they are connected in the center by one thread and a knot is tied.  Hide the joints of joints will help decorating the middle.  Alternatively, you can use a bead, a pebble, a small button with a buttonhole at the back, or any other accessories for this contrasting color. </p><h2>  Kanzashi Ribbon for Beginners </h2><p>  Beautiful and vibrant flowers are obtained from pieces of satin ribbon.  The wider the strip of fabric, the larger the size of the product. </p><p>  Consider the option of making a simple flower from a satin ribbon 3 cm wide. The same lengths of 8 cm are cut. Flush the edges immediately with a candle or lighter so that the threads do not crumble in the product when worn.  When all the details are prepared, we proceed to the alternate production of the petals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="artescomcapricho.blogspot.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satin ribbon kanzashi" class="if uuid-2540249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2540249.jpg"></div><p>  For beginners, a simple flower kanzashi master class is described below.  To get started, prepare a few pins and a thin needle with a thread in the tone of the ribbon, sharp scissors.  The first segment is folded in half and a straight line is pierced with a pin connecting the upper bend angle and the base point.  You should get a right-angled isosceles triangle.  Excess tissue is trimmed in a straight line with straight scissors.  Further, the base is stitched with stitches along the edge and at the end the thread is tightened.  The first petal is ready, but the knot is not tied and the thread is not cut. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The workpiece is laid aside while the wizard is working on the next element.  When everything is folded again into a triangle, you need to take the same needle and stitch the second petal with stitches.  So the flower is going to one thread completely, all 6 or 7 parts.  The final touch and useful advice in making kanzashi from a ribbon for beginner needlewomen will be to tighten the thread and tie a knot.  The excess is cut with scissors.  Numerous folds of fabric will remain in the center, so the middle of the crafts must be covered with a decorative element.  It will be interesting to look at the flower if you attach to the center of its stamens. </p><h2>  Hairpin with flower with pointed petals </h2><p>  The next option for making kanzashi crafts for beginners is simple, but it looks pretty impressive.  Such a flower should be folded carefully, pressing the tape with your fingers so that the folds are even. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="petals with corners" class="if uuid-2540264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2540264.jpg"></div><p>  Even a novice will be able to complete such a craft, just look carefully at the step-by-step photograph of the work.  Prepare all materials for work in advance: </p><ul><li>  Satin ribbon 2 cm wide. </li><li>  A needle and thread in tone of the main fabric. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Glue gun. </li><li>  A circle of black felt with a diameter of 2 cm. </li><li>  Bright shiny button with a loop on the back for decorating the hole in the middle. </li></ul><h2>  Workshop for beginners </h2><p>  Kanzashi from tapes is done after cutting small pieces of tape.  The size of the petals will be equal to half the length of the prepared strip of fabric.  Therefore, each master decides how many centimeters of fabric to measure.  All items must be the same size so that the flower looks neat.  Then the edges of each segment are fused with a candle, so the threads will not crumble. </p><p>  Work begins on folding the petal with the fact that the strip is bent in half, the upper part is at right angles to the bottom.  Then the edge sticking out to the side drops back and down.  On the front side, a smooth part is obtained with a pointed angle from above, and on the back side there is a small pocket.  So that the petal does not fall apart, it is fixed from below with a pin, flashing it with stitches at the base of the strip. </p><p>  When all the petals are assembled, the lower part of all the parts is sewn with a needle and the thread is tightened, the fabric is gathered in the center.  A knot is tied and an extra thread is cut with scissors.  A circle of felt is glued with hot glue on the back side of the craft in the center, and a central button is fixed on the front side.  Then a satin ribbon craft is attached to a hair clip or elastic band for hair.  You can sew a flower on a dress instead of a brooch. </p><h2>  Lush flower </h2><p>  This earlier step-by-step explanation of making kanzashi flowers from ribbons for beginners will help in creating such a large and lush flower.  This is an elegant option that can be used even instead of a bow.  It is easy to do, since the principle of work is already clear to the reader.  The only difference between this craft and the previous one is the combination of several flat parts of different sizes together.  The lower part is made of long segments, the middle - of shorter ones, and the upper flower should be the smallest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="lush flower" class="if uuid-2540270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2540270.jpg"></div><p>  This kanzashi for beginners is not difficult to perform, but it is recommended to use a glue gun to connect the elements in the center.  If all the parts are easy to stitch together, a coarse knot may form from a large number of threads.  If they are glued together with glue, then a flat depression forms in the center, which can be decorated with a large pebble.  I would like to draw attention to the fact that all three flowers made separately are attached to each other in a staggered arrangement of petals.  So get a voluminous kanzashi flower.  For novice beginners, it is first recommended to make a double flower, which also looks quite impressive. </p><h2>  How to make leaflets </h2><p>  When making flowers, handmade craftsmen often place leaves of a plant next to flowers.  They are made from all shades of green satin ribbon.  You can use simple loops of thin stripes, or you can try and create beautiful leaves with wavy edges.  We have already described the method of fusing the edges of the atlas with a candle or a lighter.  In order not to get burned, for beginners kanzashi leaves can be done with tweezers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="kanzashi leaves" class="if uuid-2540275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2540275.jpg"></div><p>  Some masters, heating the edge of the satin ribbon, bend the fabric with folds and simply press with their fingers to fasten the workpiece like glue.  Leaflets in which the fabric is bent in half and the lower edge are pulled together look beautiful. </p><h2>  Three layer flower </h2><p>  This method of folding three-color petals is clearly visible in a step-by-step photograph.  Each segment stacks in decreasing order of size.  After assembling all the parts together, you need to fix all the edges with tweezers and melt them with a candle.  Then press down with your fingers at the place of heating. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tricolor petal" class="if uuid-2540289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2540289.jpg"></div><p>  Fire will firmly hold all layers together.  It remains only to spread the petal with your fingers. </p><h2>  Petal with curl </h2><p>  Such a kanzashi detail is composed of two segments.  The lower one is folded into a triangle, and a curl twisted from the same workpiece is inserted into the inner part.  The photograph shows that a spiral is formed only from one corner to the middle.  The petal assembled from two parts is sewn or glued from below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="curled petal" class="if uuid-2540298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2540298.jpg"></div><p>  The article describes in detail the manufacture of kanzashi for beginners.  Photos with a step-by-step explanation will help you quickly understand all the intricacies of such work. </p>
