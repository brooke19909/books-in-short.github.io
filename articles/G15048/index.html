    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Not only positive aspects, but also disadvantages is the resort hotel "Majestic" (Crimea).  Reviews about this place contain the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  balcony partitions are very low, and therefore, through negligence, you can simply fall out (especially for children); </li><li>  drinking water in the minibar is not replenished; </li><li>  due to the fact that there are no partitions between balconies, it is very uncomfortable to be with an open door; </li><li>  maids do not have an additional key with which to open a cleaning number; </li><li>  the cost of services is somewhat overstated; </li><li>  The Internet is intermittent; </li><li>  clogged drain in the bathroom; </li><li>  Despite the fact that the hotel has a generator, it is not included at a time when there is no electricity; </li><li>  there are no window panes on the windows, and therefore, to air the room, you have to open the balcony. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Partenit is one of the most popular tourist destinations, because here you can not only enjoy swimming in the waves of the Black Sea, but also admire the incredibly beautiful nature.  At the very foot of Ayu-Dag Mountain is the luxurious Majestic Hotel, which offers guests many services related to both relaxation and wellness.  Here you will find comfortable rooms, quality service and good food.  It is important that the hotel has its own beach area, which is open exclusively to guests. </p><p>  As for the shortcomings, it can be noted excessively high prices for accommodation, as well as a number of services.  In addition, there are some questions regarding the layout of the rooms.  So, the guests are embarrassed by the non-observance of safety measures on the balconies (the handrails are too small), and there are no partitions between them.  In general, if you love nature, quality service, as well as silence, this hotel is exactly what you need. </p>
