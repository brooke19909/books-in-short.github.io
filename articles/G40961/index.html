Sunny Spain is especially attractive in this direction, the golden beaches of which do not leave indifferent any traveler.  So, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands. </p><h2>  Beach de las Canteras </h2><p>  Gran Canaria is one of the most popular and largest islands.  Hundreds of tourists flock here to enjoy the hot rays of the sun, soak up the beach.  Fans of active water recreation will find amazing places for surfing here. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="27.9202202" data-lng="-15.547437299999956" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/4/8/6/17486.png"></div><p>  Las Canteras Beach belongs to the city of Las Palmas and occupies a significant territory, stretching for almost three kilometers along the seashore.  It is noteworthy that only this place is washed by waters from three sides.  At the same time, La Barra reef painstakingly protects the beach from wind and strong waves and makes it possible to frolic in clean calm water.  On the other hand, at the southern end of the beach, surfers can hone their skills in the coastal waves that rise by noon. </p><p>  Las Cantras beach, as well as all the beaches of Gran Canaria, offers tourists the rental of beach equipment, changing cabins, safes for storing personal belongings, and restrooms.  Car traffic is prohibited in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach, so you can skate and ride bicycles without fear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="lpavisit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="las canteras beach" class="if uuid-3218995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3218995.jpg"></div><h2>  Playa de Maspalomas </h2><p>  Maspalomas Beach in Gran Canaria enjoys a reputation as the most fashionable destination among all Spanish resorts.  Here come mature people, held financially and free to choose their preferences.  To match its guests the beach and beach infrastructure offers to spend relaxing hours relaxing in the spa, playing golf or relaxing in the casino.  If you have forgotten your favorite sunglasses at home, the boutiques of famous luxury brands will present you a large assortment of all kinds of accessories. </p><p>  The beaches of Gran Canaria are not distinguished by an abundance of entertainment, but Maspalomas has several attractions: the Maspalomas lighthouse and sand dunes, very similar to the desert.  There is no special seasonality for relaxing here, due to the weather you can swim in the sea and sunbathe on the beach all year round. </p><div class="photo" data-original="reserving.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Las Maspalomas Beach" class="if uuid-3219005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3219005.jpg"></div><h2>  Playa de amadores </h2><p>  If you are looking for the perfect place for a honeymoon, then the beach of Amadores in Gran Canaria, in the town of Puerto Rico - this is what you need: in Spanish, the name means "Beach of lovers."  No more, no less, eight hundred meters of the cleanest beach located in the southwestern part of the Spanish island of Gran Canaria, away from the noisy surf and impudent waves. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Do not confuse Spanish Puerto Rico with American Puerto Rico! </p><p>  At any point on the beach you can find a quiet atmospheric cafe serving the most delicious coffee and the most ripe fruit.  When you notice that the day is drawing to a close, do not rush to leave.  Take a comfortable position and get ready to see one of the most magnificent sunsets in the world. </p><p>  Of the city amenities there is a parking and parking spaces by the road. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.grancanariaexcursions.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beach de amadores" class="if uuid-3219010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3219010.jpg"></div><h2>  Playa del ingles </h2><p>  This is one of the largest beaches in Gran Canaria.  Everything here is equipped for a carefree vacation for travelers.  During the day you can rent equipment for active water recreation.  Vacationers on the beach can rent sunbeds and umbrellas to hide from the gentle, but very persistent sun. </p><p>  The beach in Spanish means "Englishman's Beach", it was created in 1960 on a place that could hardly be called a resort.  The territory was more like a desert.  Now it is a comfortable multi-meter beach for families, which at night turns into a kingdom of pubs and cafes with a noisy entertainment program and delicious cuisine from around the world. </p><h2>  Beach de San Augustine </h2><p>  De San Augustine should appeal to travelers who do not pursue entertainment, but are content with a quiet family vacation.  This beach is just that.  Silence, tranquility, unhurried walks along the coastline and lazy splashing in the warm water of the Atlantic Ocean - this is what will provide an opportunity to relax from work and the bustling city.  Despite the calmness of the resort, it is not separated from city and public life.  Nearby there are local attractions in the form of an old plane, which is something like a symbol of a local flying club, where everyone can book a helicopter ride around the area. </p><p>  The beach line stretched almost two kilometers.  On the one hand - the sea, on the other - magnificent gardens, in the shade of which you can find cozy cafes and restaurants with excellent cuisine and soft drinks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holaislascanarias.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beach de san agustin" class="if uuid-3219023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3219023.jpg"></div><h2>  Gui-Gui Beach </h2><p>  Holidays on the beaches of Gran Canaria will not be complete unless you visit one of the pearls of this Spanish island - Gui-Gui Beach.  One of the most unusual excursions in the world will give you the opportunity to swim in the purest calm water on the entire coast of Gran Canaria, soak up on the fine-grained sand, the origin of which is directly related to volcanic eruptions, and admire the Teide volcano. </p><p>  Remember that the tour is on foot, designed for an average of two hours.  Not the easiest sections are found along the way, so you should not take young children on a hike, as they can quickly become exhausted.  In return, you will see unique pictures of virgin nature, inhale the cleanest air and swim in the crystal clear water. </p><p>  Returning from a short trip, you can regain your strength in a local cafe or restaurant on the beach, where cooks prepare dishes for every taste from the freshest products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hellocanaryislands.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gui Gui Beach" class="if uuid-3219025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3219025.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach de la Meloneras </h2><p>  In the southern part of the island of Gran Canari there is a quiet and comfortable beach with calm water.  This place is great for swimming not only for adults.  For children who are just learning to swim, this beach is just a godsend.  De La Meloneras is the smallest beach on the island, its length is only five hundred meters, but there are not many people on this patch of coastal strip.  A great place for a relaxing holiday with your family or soulmate, equipped with all the necessary items: sun loungers, umbrellas, changing cabins, swimming equipment.  Golf lovers will find here a large field with eighteen holes.  De La Meloneras begins immediately behind the famous Maspalomas lighthouse and the adjacent popular beach with a whole string of small shops, souvenir trifles and summer cafes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="toponimograncanaria.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meloneras beach" class="if uuid-3219030" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3219030.jpg"></div><h2>  Playa de melenara </h2><p>  The beaches of Gran Canaria are located around the perimeter of the island.  In the north, travelers who prefer lazy idleness on a warm sand will find a great place.  If you are planning a vacation with children and are afraid that they will have nothing to do, do not worry.  It is on the beach of de Melenara that children can be comfortably accommodated in various playgrounds and calmly go for a swim in clear, warm water. </p><p>  The beach is usually sparsely populated.  It is located at some distance from popular tourist locations, so those who get to de Melenard will feel the charm of an almost individual stay on the beach.  Since the place is considered a little tourist, here you can often meet local residents not as sellers of refreshing drinks and service staff, but also as vacationers.  On the beach there are several restaurants interesting for their cuisine and original serving of dishes.  So after an active swim, you can eat freshly prepared seafood and cold cocktails. </p>
