This settlement has the status of an administrative regional center and is one of the largest cities in the republic.  In recent years, there has been an active population growth on its territory, as well as the development of production, infrastructure and the economy.  We learn a lot of interesting facts about this city later in the article. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  The modern city of Taldy-Kurgan is based on the site of the Gavrilovka farm located here, founded once by Ukrainian immigrants.

    <h2>  Cultural life and infrastructure </h2><p>  Taldy-Kurgan is also very developed in the spiritual sphere.  For the pastime and leisure of citizens here are: fifteen national cultural centers, two museums, an art gallery and a drama theater. </p><p>  In addition, several years ago many beautiful new buildings appeared on the streets of the regional center, since in 2009 this settlement celebrated its 140th anniversary.
