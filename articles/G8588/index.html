    <h2>  Biography of Ilya Muromets (summary).  The legend of restoration </h2><p>  Ilya was born near the city of Murom in the village of Karacharov, where he lived his life until the age of 33.  On the birthday of Muromets, prophetic elders came to his house who asked to give them water.  The impossible happened that day.  Muromets explained to the guests that he could not get up, but they seemed to not hear anything that the future warrior wanted to explain to them.  They insisted on their own and asked him until Ilya felt an unprecedented power and for the first time in his life stood on his feet. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the scientists who investigated the relics of Muromets confirmed that the bone tissue was completely restored, and this cannot be called a miracle. </p>

    <h2>  Way to Kiev </h2><p>  Finally, the elders told Ilya that he should go to the service of Prince Vladimir.  But they warned that on the way to the capital he would see a large stone with an inscription.  Muromets went and saw him on his way.  A call was written on the stone for the warrior to try to move him from his place.  Here he found a horse, armor and weapons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fight of Ilya Muromets with the Nightingale the Robber </h2><p>  As you know, after his recovery, Ilya Muromets accomplished many feats.

    <h2>  With whom did Ilya Muromets participate in feats?  Biography (briefly) </h2><p>  It is worth noting that in epics and legends it was often mentioned that Ilya Muromets, Alyosha Popovich and Dobrynya Nikitich often performed feats.  However, in reality, these characters have never met, much less participated in battles.  They lived in different centuries.  It often happens that when legends are passed down from generation to generation, they are increasingly being overgrown with new untruthful details. </p><p>  One of the most famous and popular characters of legends and epics is Ilya Muromets.  A biography for children usually excludes the facts that the numerous information that is currently known about the legendary warrior is untrue. </p><p>  Ilya Muromets is a great and glorious warrior who possessed inhuman strength, performed a huge number of feats and participated in battles for his beautiful homeland.  There are several facts that confirm that it actually existed.  Ilya Muromets managed to survive his death and leave a huge mark in the memory of people, and they still consider him the greatest and most powerful glorious warrior.  Who is Ilya Muromets really?  Myth or real character? </p>
