    <p>  In addition to jeans with holes that open bare legs, there are also those that hide stripes from other fabrics under the holes.  Especially popular are such things with guipure fabrics or material with variegated patterns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But do not forget that no matter what type of hole is chosen to improve your favorite outfit, you need to know the measure in this matter.

It is best to use a clerical knife. </li><li>  Making cuts is only necessary when using the underlay.  Without it, you can cut through jeans through a clerical knife. </li></ol><p>  Knowing how to rip jeans on your knees beautifully, and applying these valuable tips, you can transform your outfit without any help. </p><h2>  Which jeans are better? </h2>

    <p>  Going to decorate their <span>old jeans</span> or recently purchased, with the help of tears, many fashionistas forget to take into account some nuances: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Ripped jeans in the knee area are not suitable for all body types.  If a girl has a slim figure and high stature, then she can, in principle, wear jeans with gaps in different places.  But chubby ladies with magnificent forms and short stature are better to give preference to this thing with small vertical tears above the knee. </li><li>  Before making torn knees on jeans, you need to know the features of the material from which they are sewn.  Although many people think that any jeans with torn knees look cool, in fact it is not.  Pants created using classic jeans with an average level of density are best suited for this. </li><li>  And finally, I would like to mention the style that is most suitable for such decisions.  Too wide cut of trousers will not allow to reveal all the beauty of ripped jeans, since the holes on them will look awkward.  Also, it is not necessary to carry out such manipulations with very narrow models, because the fabric on them will deform, which will spoil the original appearance of the outfit.  Skinny jeans are considered the most suitable for forming holes in the knees. </li></ol><h2>  Nude knees </h2><p>  Having studied the information on the correct selection of suitable jeans for their further transformation, we proceed to the most important point - the formation of holes. </p>

    <p>  Consider the most popular view, which allows you to fully open your knees.  So let's get started: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Put on jeans and use a piece of chalk or a piece of soap to draw one oval on each knee leg in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe knees.  The oval should be depicted so that when it is cut, the knees are fully opened. </li><li>  Look in the mirror and, if the drawings are satisfactory, proceed to the next steps; if not, redraw them. </li><li>  Remove the trousers and lay them on a flat surface. </li><li>  Inside the jeans, under the oval drawn, put a plate. </li><li>  Cut the pattern using a clerical knife. </li><li>  Do the same with the second leg. </li><li>  The edges of the hole need to be ruffled a little with a fine grater. </li><li>  And with the help of a needle, disconnect several extreme threads, after which you will get a beautiful fringe that will border holes on your knees. </li></ol><p>  No need to try to make holes on the knees identical.  Best if they are a little different.  The slight negligence of the image obtained using this method allows you to give the wearer these jeans lightness, freedom and sexuality.  Knowing how to rip jeans on their knees by drawing ovals, you can improve this method a little by changing the contours of the picture.  Thus, it is possible to depict various patterns on the surface of the trousers. </p><h2>  Narrow strip </h2><p>  This method consists in the formation of narrow holes on the knees.  Many people like these ripped jeans because they look more restrained than the previous version.  They are preferred to wear natures who want to liberate themselves, but are not yet ready for very large reincarnations. </p><p>  Making narrow cuts on jeans in the knee area, which would be noticeable only when walking, is very simple.  Consider how to rip jeans on their knees with this method, in more detail. </p>

    <ol><li>  Put on jeans and draw in chalk one thin strip in the center of the patella, on both legs. </li><li>  Make sure that the work performed is correct. </li><li>  Remove the trousers and lay them on the table. </li><li>  Place inside the jeans, under the drawn line, a board. </li><li>  Cut the line with a sharp clerical knife. </li><li>  Do the same with the second leg. </li><li>  Make a small fringe along the edges of the cut using a needle or a fine grater. </li></ol><p>  As can be seen from the above actions, working with the creation of different types of holes in trousers has similarities.  Therefore, you can easily make some jeans with different types of holes for yourself. </p><h2>  Thin web </h2><p>  To make holes on your knees so that they are covered with thin threads is a simple matter, although, at first glance, it seems different.  Guided by certain rules for the manufacture of such parts, you can create a thin web on your trousers quite quickly.  Consider how to rip jeans on your knees beautifully at home, with a step-by-step guide: </p><ol><li>  On both legs, in the knees, draw several transverse lines of different lengths. </li><li>  Place a plate inside each leg under the drawn lines. </li><li>  Use a sharp clerical knife to make cuts along the drawn lines. </li><li>  On each resulting strip, use a needle or tweezers to pull out the blue threads, leaving the white ones intact. </li></ol>

    <p>  If desired, you can make not a full cobweb on jeans, but only a few alternating stripes. </p><h2>  Which color is better? </h2><p>  The current fashion has provided the opportunity to have not only blue or blue jeans, but also any other shade.  In this regard, many have the question of whether the color of the trousers is crucial in the manufacture of holes on them. </p><p>  Some points can be noted.  In fact, the <span>color of jeans</span> does not really affect the appearance of the holes made on them.  Another thing is that colored trousers are sometimes not jeans at all, but out of habit they are called their owners.  For the formation of a beautiful flaw on trousers, the density and structure of the fabric are important, and therefore a material with thin fibers will not work. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about colored jeans with medium density, then they will look great small cuts in the knee area with minimal fringe and slight scuffs. </p><p>  Also, some are concerned about how to tear black jeans on their knees.  In fact, making beautiful holes in black trousers is no different from similar work with blue or blue. </p><h2>  Macho Jeans </h2><p>  Although men who prefer to wear ripped jeans are much fewer than women, nevertheless, many men consider this outfit to be the most stylish.  Men's jeans with holes on their knees and other places can make their wearer visually more masculine and brutal.  To achieve this result, you need to use the same techniques as in the manufacture of holes on women's trousers. </p><p>  Before <span>tearing men's jeans</span> on their knees, it would be nice to think through the whole image of the trousers as a whole.  For representatives of the stronger sex, you can make the edges of the holes rougher.  It is also worth adding more scuffs on jeans.  To do this is quite simple using sandpaper. </p>
