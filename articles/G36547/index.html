Yes, semi-automatic machines have a right to exist, but most often it is a washing machine that becomes an indispensable assistant.  It is impossible to describe the number of existing brands that produce washing machines, which themselves will soak, wash, rinse, wring, or even dry the laundry.  A huge selection of possible configurations, dimensions and colors will not leave indifferent even the most picky buyer.  But everything is not limited only to the appearance, because we must not forget about the quality and technology used. </p><p>  One of the flagship manufacturers of automatic washing machines in the middle and premium price segment is Samsung.  A great innovation in the market has long been the Samsung Eco Bubble washing machine, which uses a relatively new exclusive technology.  It is about such machines that this article will be discussed. </p><h2>  Cons washing machines </h2><p>  Until recently, washing machines had several negative aspects that repelled them from buying.  Woolen clothes ‚Äúsat down‚Äù, thin fabrics were torn, and holes soon appeared on the bed linen even from the most durable material.  Another negative factor was the power consumption, so I had to start the device only at the most necessary moments.  But time passed, technology did not stand still, and it soon became clear that it was not the washing machine itself that caused the problems with the laundry.  It is all about hot water, in which it was believed that the powder dissolved efficiently and completely and removed all stains on the fabric.  Scientists have worked for many years to improve obsolete systems.  Progress does not stand still, a solution was eventually found. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Eco bubble like a panacea </h2><p>  <span>Samsung has</span> developed a technology that circumvents problems with hot water.  Samsung Eco Bubble washing machines, the price of which is not much different from other machines, quickly became popular and turned into irreplaceable assistants in washing the house.  The fact is that a washing machine using this technology allows washing in cold water as efficiently as any other in hot water. </p>

    <p>  Washed things remain the same color and size, and the amount of energy consumed is reduced by several times, because you do not have to spend it on heating water and washing a small amount of things.  Indeed, in addition to all of the above innovations, Samsung washing machines are equipped with a special weighing mechanism.  But more on that later in the article. </p><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  And the thing is that the approach to the washing process has fundamentally changed.  The Samsung Eco Bubble washing machine sends the powder to a special foam generator before feeding it directly into the laundry tub.  In the foam generator, the powder undergoes the processes of dissolution, activation and mixing with water and air, thereby turning into foam, which, in turn, consists of bubbles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  This very mixture is formed within a few seconds after the start of the selected mode and remains unchanged throughout the cycle.  In addition, the automation of the machine in an intelligent way allows you to distribute all the powder in equal amounts over the entire cycle.  As a result, things retain a beautiful appearance and do not change size. </p><h2>  Engine </h2><p>  But in addition to the washing quality, there are several points to be noted regarding the reliability and durability of the Samsung Eco Bubble washing machine.  Reviews on these models can be heard the most diverse, but from a technical point of view, one thing can be said that the reliability here is at the highest level. </p>

    <p>  And all because the engines of these machines no longer use brushes that increase the risk of breakage due to strong friction of parts.  The new <span>inverter motors</span> are equipped with magnets, which not only make them virtually silent, but also make it possible to verify reliability in view of the ten-year warranty declared by the manufacturer.  A separate plus will be a reduction in the amount of vibration, which will allow you to use the washing machine even in moments of sleep and rest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Drum </h2><p>  The special Diamond Drum drum system is one of the most important advantages of Samsung Eco Bubble machines.  6 kg of linen in perfect condition after washing?

    <p>  The secret of this drum is the correct location of the holes through which the foam with bubbles enters.  In addition, it was the use of the Eco Bubble system that made these holes of a minimum diameter, which positively affects the washing.  Linen located in the drum has practically no chance to get into these holes and even more so to tear. </p><h2>  Other innovations </h2><p>  In addition to a new type of engine, the <span>Samsung Eco Bubble washing machine</span> has an updated heating element.  The thing is that it uses a unique patented ceramic coating.  This coating is used in order to reduce the level of scale that is formed during operation directly on the heater.  This fact gives confidence that the machine will last longer than washing machines with a conventional heating element. </p>

    <p>  Another advantage is the Volt Control system, which is equipped with any Samsung Eco Bubble washing machine.  Thanks to Volt Control, these machines do not need to be afraid of power surges and power surges, because the system stops the washing cycle during such changes and continues it from the moment it was stopped, immediately after stabilization. </p><p>  It is worth noting that all new models are equipped with an automatic weighing system for laundry in the drum.  This function will reduce the time and cost of electricity, since the difference in the weight of the laundry is not taken into account by old washing machines, and you have to wait the same amount of time for washing both 1 kg and 6 kg. </p><h2>  Samsung Eco Bubble user manual </h2><p>  Like any washing machine, Samsung requires careful operation.  Therefore, do not make mistakes that can lead to breakdowns.  Firstly, when loading the laundry, you should be sure that the weight of the wet laundry will not be too large.  Indeed, large loads on the drum can cause the engine and drive system to work for wear.  Therefore, if the maximum allowable load is 6 kg, then it is better to load dry linen weighing up to 4.5-5 kg.  Repair of Samsung washing machines is not an expensive thing, it is worth remembering this. </p>

    <p>  Secondly, between separate washing cycles it is worth giving the machine a "rest".  Like any mechanism with a large number of moving parts, it heats up and "gets tired" in technical terms.  Accordingly, a short break before the next wash will definitely not hurt. </p><h2>  If the washing machine breaks down </h2><p>  As mentioned above, repairing Samsung washing machines is not the easiest and cheapest thing, therefore, in case of any malfunction it is better not to try to repair the unit yourself.  If the machine has stopped working for one reason or another, the initial steps should be to conduct a diagnosis.  By the way, Samsung's new generation of washing machines are equipped with a Smart Check scanning system.  All that needs to be done for the diagnosis is to install the appropriate program on the smartphone.  With it, you can get good advice on troubleshooting at the entry level.  If the problem is much more serious, you should contact an authorized service center.  It should be recalled once again that the Samsung Eco Bubble washing machine is not such a simple device.  Mistakes made by self-repair attempts can be expensive. </p>

    <p>  In general, I want to say that Samsung washing machines have always been one of the best solutions for buying and home use, and with the use of new technologies they become almost an indispensable assistant at home.  A person always tries to choose a more practical option that will last quite a long time and with high quality.  And you should be sure that a really good choice is the Samsung Eco Bubble.  The price even for premium cars is quite acceptable (from 20 thousand rubles), and in the near future a worthy competitor is unlikely to be able to oppose something more efficient. </p>
