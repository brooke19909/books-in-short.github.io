    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Since most tourists come to Egypt to relax on the beach, the proximity and quality of the beach play one of the most important roles in choosing a hotel.  So, as for the Movie Gate <span>Hotel 4 * (Hurghada),</span> it is located on the very shore of the Red Sea.  According to travelers, the hotel's beach is quite large, there is a sufficient number of sunbeds and umbrellas for everyone.  You can enter the water either directly from the shore or from the pier.  In the first case, you will have to walk about 200 meters to a depth.  Many guests did not like this, and they preferred to swim from the pier.  Tourists who have been here also note that it is recommended to enter the water only in special shoes.  Otherwise, you risk injuring your legs.  You can buy such shoes in the shop at the hotel.  Here you can buy a mask for snorkeling, flippers and other equipment. </p><p>  Many hotel guests also enjoyed spending time by the pools, of which there are several on the territory of the Movie Gate Hotel 4 * (Hurghada, Egypt).

So, some of the guests claim that they were quite satisfied with the unobtrusive entertainment program offered here.  According to them, during the daytime animators invite all those who wish to do aerobics, stretching, water aerobics, play water polo or volleyball.  At the same time, they act unobtrusively and do not try to convince vacationers, causing irritation, as is the case in some other hotels.  As for the second group of tourists, they were not very pleased with the weak evening entertainment program.  According to them, the hotel could take care of more diverse shows and performances, so that people had something to occupy themselves after dinner. </p><p>  Experienced travelers also recommend that those who come to rest in Egypt be sure to go for a vacation at least for a couple of excursions in order to diversify their pastime.  At the same time, they advise not to buy tours from hotel guides, but to order them at local travel agencies, focusing on reviews of other vacationers.  So, according to them, the quality will be offered to you the same, but if such a trip costs one and a half, or even two times cheaper than a hotel guide. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  As for the staff at the Movie Gate Hotel (Egypt, Hurghada), the reviews of which we are reviewing, our compatriots were generally satisfied.  So, according to them, the hotel staff are mostly friendly and attentive.  They do their job well.  A big plus for our compatriots was the fact that many hotel workers speak Russian well.
