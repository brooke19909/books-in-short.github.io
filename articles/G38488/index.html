  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best flash drives: an overview of models and companies, specifications, prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today‚Äôs technologies are developing so rapidly that the devices bought yesterday are already outdated and require updates with upgrades.  Processors are becoming more powerful, the picture on the monitor screen is clearer, and films and games take up much more space than two or three years ago. </p><p>  Such a race forced manufacturers of hard drives and other drives to create storage media containing more information than before.  Of course, some movie in bluray quality on a terabyte hard drive is not so noticeable, and 30-40 GB is uncritical for such a volume.  But transferring it to another device is a real headache. </p><p>  Good old flash drives come to the rescue.  But not every drive will pull such large files.  Therefore, many users are asked by quite natural questions: ‚ÄúWhich flash drive is better and why?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat should I look for at the time of purchase?‚Äù  etc. </p><p>  The choice is complicated by the fact that the abundance of drives on the computer equipment market is simply amazing: small, large, chip-wise, 3.0, 2.0, expensive, cheap, etc. And to determine in all this variety which flash drive is better, oh, how difficult it is.  In addition, consultants in stores, alas, are not always competent in these matters. </p><p>  So, let's try to figure out how to choose a drive, what critical moments to pay attention to first of all, and how not to miscalculate with a purchase.  As specific examples, consider the best flash drives, based on the opinions of consumers and experts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Difficulty choosing </h2><p>  You should immediately warn that such drives are not intended for long-term data storage.  That is, even the most advanced flash drive of the best company, due to its technical features, will not be able to store information for more than three, and in rare cases - five years.  So it will obviously be superfluous to copy data to another medium once a year and check the integrity of the current one. </p><p>  Standard flash drives of good quality are not suitable for working with small files.  The fewer bytes in the data, the slower the copying process.  This is especially true for small-sized SD-drives.  Even the best micro-flash drives, when faced with tiny files, work, as a rule, from ‚Äúbad‚Äù to ‚Äúcomplete brake‚Äù.  In this case, it is best to look closely at technically advanced models based on SSD technology. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the larger the volume of the drive, the faster information is written to it.  Moreover, the increase in speed is in most cases steps.  That is, if copying began with an indicator of 1 Mbit / s, then it can continue somewhere at 40 Mbit in a minute or two. </p><p>  We should also pay attention to models with MLC chips.  Manufacturers of the best USB flash drives are trying to flash them with such chips.  Such technology will significantly increase the operational operational resource of the gadget.  MLC-chipovka will come in handy for those who intensively use a USB flash drive. </p><h2>  Flash drive manufacturers: which company is better? </h2><p>  Many manufacturers are engaged in the production of flash drives, but the backbone of trusted brands has been formed for a long time, and newcomers are not welcome there.  The cost of branded gadgets is much higher than that of products from little-known companies, but there are clearly more quality guarantees.  Because the competition here is very fierce, and every venerable manufacturer understands that customer dissatisfaction promises serious financial losses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sandisk </h2><p>  This is a large company from North America, which was able to conquer almost a third of this market.  The best USB flash drives of the brand are known around the world, including in Russia.  Hence, very good sales, as well as excellent quality products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.harveynorman.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which flash drive is better" class="if uuid-2673193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2673193.jpg"></div><p>  On the domestic market you can find a lot of fakes "Sandisk", so do not flatter yourself when you see a model from a popular brand at a bargain price.  If the company holds shares, it is only at official distribution points.  And the latter, of course, are not associated with fakes.  It is also worth noting that products from Sandisk often receive awards at specialized exhibitions where they select the best flash drives of the year, carefully assessing all the advantages and disadvantages of the participants. </p><h2>  Transcend </h2><p>  The second most popular brand after Sandisk.  The Taiwanese company has a reputation as a manufacturer of stable and best flash drives, as well as memory cards.  The brand's products are enviably popular among domestic consumers. </p><p>  This demand is largely due not only to the high quality of products, but also to the more than democratic pricing policy of the company. </p><h2>  Corsair </h2><p>  In third place is another American company, which boasts not only the production of the best flash drives, but also the release of high-quality memory modules for desktop and mobile PCs.  Both the first and second are very popular among domestic consumers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As in the previous case, the company does not oppress prices and pursues a more than adequate pricing policy.  It is also worth noting that the brand pays a lot of attention to the appearance of drives, where in the assortment you can find a flash drive with an original exterior. </p><h2>  Kingston </h2><p>  The company does not produce drives as such, but is the largest supplier of memory modules, flash drives and hard drives for personal computers.  The brand also owns a well-known division of HyperX, under whose leadership the expensive, but extremely high-quality RAM gaming modules enter the market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thumbsup.in.th" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best usb flash drives" class="if uuid-2673192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2673192.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that the company itself does not produce chips, it conducts rigorous selection and subsequent product adaptation.  As a result, the really best flash drives with an extremely high-quality component and an impressive warranty period are on the shelves. </p><p>  Products of other brands can also be considered, especially if you liked the cost of the drive.  But here it is necessary to take into account that for little-known or generally no-name manufacturers, not every series turns out to be successful.  So before buying, it will be clearly out of place to read reviews, and not in the store itself, but not in specialized forums, or at least on Yandex.Market. </p><p>  Next, we consider the best flash drives that have distinguished themselves by trouble-free operation, balanced cost, as well as a large number of positive feedback from users. </p><h2>  Transcend JetFlash 780 16 Gb </h2><p>  This is a relatively inexpensive, but time-tested drive type 3.0.  One of the main advantages of the flash drive is MLC chipovka, while almost all products of this price category are built on the shaky TLC architecture.  So for users who plan to actively use the drive, this inexpensive option will come in handy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.conrad-electronic.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best flash drive of the year" class="if uuid-2673196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2673196.jpg"></div><p>  The flash drive received a classic appearance with a textured pattern.  The latter does not allow the drive to slip out of hands, although it collects dirt from them.  The manufacturer indicates a write speed of up to 40 Mbit / s, and read speeds of up to 140. The actual characteristics, of course, will be more modest, but this is quite enough to solve ordinary problems. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  good speed for a small volume; </li><li>  business and practical exterior; </li><li>  stable operation even at maximum load; </li><li>  lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Heats up when recording small files; </li><li>  the dimensions are too big for fans to attach a USB flash drive to a keychain, chain, etc. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost of the model is about 1100 rubles. </p><h2>  Corsair Flash Voyager GT USB 3.0 32GB </h2><p>  Unlike the past respondent, this one looks much more attractive and fashionable.  Fans of stylish and catchy drives probably will not pass by a good flash drive 3.0 from Corsair.  It is also worth noting that the model received a rubberized case, which adds practicality along with protective qualities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.everythingusb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which flash drive is better" class="if uuid-2673194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2673194.jpg"></div><p>  By the way, this drive is not afraid of either a washing machine or a fall on asphalt from a decent height (without fanaticism).  Behind all the advantages of design lies one, for some, a critical drawback is the proximity to other USB interfaces.  The design turned out, so to speak, puffy, so sticking to the other ports in neighboring ports is quite problematic.  Of course, you can remove the rubber cover or even spend money on the hub, but this, again, is unnecessary difficulties and a headache. </p><p>  As for speed indicators, here they are at an acceptable level: 35 Mbit / s for recording and 135 for reading.  Naturally, these characteristics will be revealed only with a USB port 3.0. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  attractive appearance; </li><li>  good protective characteristics; </li><li>  good read and write speed; </li><li>  seamless synergy with all popular platforms. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  impressive dimensions; </li><li>  short warranty period. </li></ul><p>  Estimated price of the model is about 2000 rubles. </p><h2>  Transcend JetFlash 750 64Gb </h2><p>  This model was especially liked by those who often use the FAT32 file system in their work.  The latter will not pull more than 64 GB, so the acquisition of a more capacious flash drive here is simply irrational. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcstore.bg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best usb flash drive 3 0" class="if uuid-2673197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2673197.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the presence of MLC chipovka, which is a rarity for budget models.  We were also pleased with the speed characteristics, where the flash drive copes very well with files of both small and large sizes.  The gadget received a plastic case and a classic design.  There are no questions to the assembly: nothing creaks, there are no cracks and backlashes, and the protective cap sits firmly in place. </p><p>  The flash drive has found its application in the hands of system administrators and service wizards.  But ordinary consumers, knowing the quality of the brand, often buy this model. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  MLC chipovka; </li><li>  excellent read speed; </li><li>  ‚ÄúThin‚Äù body; </li><li>  adequate cost. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  low speed performance during data recording; </li><li>  the body, like a vacuum cleaner, collects fingerprints with dust. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost of the model is about 2700 rubles. </p><h2>  HyperX Savage 128GB </h2><p>  Most ordinary users believe that this is the best USB 3.0 flash drive from the Kingston brand division.  It is primarily focused on the transfer of large files.  The manufacturer promises a stable speed of 250 Mbit / s for writing and 350 for reading, but in reality the numbers differ from those indicated and depend mainly on the characteristics of the data being copied and the features of the local USB protocol. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.7dayshop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flash drive is the best company" class="if uuid-2673195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2673195.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the claimed numbers and high average speed indicators, the flash drive can not be called fast.  While copying tiny files, the entire fuse of the gadget melts before our eyes.  So the device is not very suitable for working with such data, but things are much better with photos, music and films. </p><p>  It is also worth noting a very high-quality case and assembly as a whole.  The original design is complemented by a matte soft-touch coating without a hint of backlash, crevices and other problems.  Protection was also pleasing: the gadget can be dropped from a decent height and even rinsed with water if necessary, but without bathing. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  excellent speed characteristics (with the exception of the smallest files); </li><li>  high-quality assembly; </li><li>  protection against physical impact and moisture; </li><li>  attractive design; </li><li>  full MLC chipovka. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  the case is thick and there may be problems with the "neighbors" on the USB ports. </li></ul><p>  The estimated price of the model is about 5700 rubles. </p><h2>  Kingston DataTraveler Ultimate GT 1TB </h2><p>  This is the most capacious flash drive that can be found on the shelves of domestic stores.  There is also a 2 TB model, but it is not for sale in Russia yet.  It‚Äôs worth noting that the gadget can‚Äôt be called compact at all - it calmly blocks access to a pair of neighboring USB interfaces.  In addition, a decent weight can give a roll to the average ultrabook. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best flash drives" class="if uuid-2673199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2673199.jpg"></div><p>  An extension cord acts as a panacea for such dimensions.  Fortunately, the manufacturer took care of this and put a small hub to the kit.  The latter has a very modest size and will not cause any trouble to the neighbors at the ports. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the model received a very solid structure based on zinc alloy.  She is not afraid of falling even from a decent height, as well as a small wash.  The gadget also pleased with its speed characteristics.  The proprietary and highly productive Phison PS2308 controller works just wonders that SSDs will envy. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the model </h2><p>  The only thing the flash drive copes with is very small files.  But here we have a noticeably higher speed in comparison with the above models.  Moreover, no one bothers to archive and copy all this ‚Äútrifle‚Äù in an instant.  Naturally, the device has an MLC chip, so there is no need to worry about file security. </p><p>  Despite the massive dimensions, the device looks very stylish, fresh and technological.  It seems that in your hands you have some kind of gadget from the future, and not just a flash drive.  Users leave positive feedback about the model.  For those who work with large amounts of data that you need to keep constantly with you, this is just a godsend. </p><p>  The only negative that users complain about is the cost of the flash drive.  For this price, it‚Äôs quite possible to build an average computer, so for ordinary users, such a purchase is simply impractical.  The gadget found its application in the hands of professionals like system administrators and service wizards.  In a word, this is the best this segment can offer, but such a pleasure is not cheap. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  An enviable capacity of 1 TB; </li><li>  excellent speed of reading and writing medium and large files; </li><li>  reliable design with good protection against physical impact; </li><li>  stylish and pleasing to the eye; </li><li>  non-marking case; </li><li>  the presence of sensors; </li><li>  the presence of an extension cord (hub); </li><li>  maximum guarantee for such gadgets from the manufacturer. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  decent dimensions; </li><li>  the price tag is clearly not designed for the average consumer. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost of the model is about 55,000 rubles. </p>
