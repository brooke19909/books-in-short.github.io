Decryption</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  By the end of the second decade of the last century, the question arose of the country's development, which suggested that electrification would raise the level of the state's economy to a whole new height. </p><p>  This was the first plan, designed for the next 15 years, and envisaging not only the construction of large enterprises, but also the development of the <span>national economy.</span>  Lenin understood that the world does not stand still, and electricity is a new round in the modernization of life. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  In history books, the transcript of GOELRO sounds like - The State Commission for Electrification of Russia.  Over the course of 15 years, it was planned to build about thirty large power plants across the country, which were supposed to generate electricity up to eight billion kilowatt / h.  If we compare the pre-revolutionary period, the output of kilowatts was only about two billion. </p><p>  The leader of the proletariat V. Lenin himself became the ideological inspirer and actual creator of this program.  When the GOELRO decoding was taken for the official name of the electrification plan, sometimes Lenin heard phrases that capitalism is a steam era, and socialism is not just a new level of development of society, but also the era of the spread of electricity.  Vladimir Ilyich suggested that if Russia is covered by a powerful network of power plants and the latest technological equipment, then the level of the country will rise to the forefront of European lines. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decoding goello" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2161798.jpg"></div>

Even during the First World War, projects were created that the imperial government ranks rejected, as their implementation was too expensive and time-consuming. </p><p>  Knowing this fact, the USSR government abandoned all its financial and engineering forces in order to make the plan a reality.  In 1918, at the All-Russian conference devoted to workers in the electric industry, it was decided to create an authority for the implementation of the guidelines for the construction of power plants - Elektrostroy.  Also, all professional Russian power engineers were gathered under the "roof" of the Central Electrotechnical Council. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decoding goelro when accepted" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2161809.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At the same time, they created a special bureau, whose employees developed a global plan for the electrification of all the territories of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  But in 1921 it was decided to abandon the GOELRO (decryption - State Commission for Electrification) and create the State General Planning Commission (or Gosplan).  Starting from this time, it was Gosplan who controlled all economic activity. </p><h2>  The essence of decoding GOELRO.  USSR at a new stage of development </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the focus of two hundred scientists was the direct introduction of electricity, the plan affected all areas of the economy.  The details of the project were calculated very well, optimization of all the processes of building power plants and an energy distribution system was in progress.  The territory of the RSFSR was divided into thirty districts.  In each of these areas it was supposed to build a power station.  The territories were divided in the image of the availability of a particular source of raw materials or railways.  Much attention was paid to the development of the country's transport interchange. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In total, twenty <span>thermal power plants</span> (TPPs) and ten hydroelectric power stations (HPPs) were laid in these areas. </p><h2>  Reflections on the initial idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãGOELRO </h2><p>  The version that electrification in the country until 1917 was absolutely unnecessary went around during the reign of Stalin.  But skeptics are very wary of the option of the lack of an energy base in the Russian Empire, and the fact that the first steps to create the GOELRO (stands for State Electrification Commission) were made by the Bolsheviks led by Lenin.  In the 90s of the twentieth century, this skepticism has acquired even greater proportions.  Researchers were of the opinion that GOELRO planning was licked from the projects of foreign scientists and that is why foreign experts were invited to the country, since the scientific and technical personnel of the Soviet Union was simply absent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="goello decryption" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2161796.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The next version on the creation of an energy project was put forward with more patriotic ideas.  Its meaning was that the Bolshevik government insolently stole and appropriated the foundation of industrial development and <span>intellectual resources</span> from the tsarist empire.  And it is precisely the latter option that has more supporters these days. </p><h2>  Steps to Implementing a Plan </h2><p>  Based on the explanation of the existing projects under Tsarist Russia, in the early 20th century, careful development of the concept for large-scale electrification of the country began.  However, the process slowed down during the First World War and the October Revolution.  But enthusiasts of their craft still continued research and development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="goelro abbreviation" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2163808.jpg"></div>

    <p>  After Krzhizhanovsky‚Äôs report at the meeting of the Energy Commission, he met with Lenin in 1917.  He spoke about his plans and already completed projects for electrification, his competent emphasis on the importance of starting the electric power process for the speedy development of industrial ideas and stocks, impressed the leader.  Therefore, after the civil war ended, the leadership of the new country began to work closely on the implementation of the GOELRO.  The Eighth Congress of Soviets approved a detailed plan. </p><h2>  Post-war time </h2><p>  The country began to restore the energy economy, and in just six years, indicators began to rise, and in 1931 the plan was exceeded.  By 1935, the USSR became the third country after the United States and Germany in terms of energy development.  At that time, prisoners began to use prisoners to continue the construction of power plants.  It was slave labor, but it was thanks to him that the <span>Soviet Union</span> was able to rise from its knees after lengthy wars and internal turmoil. </p><h2>  Electrification and other industrial sectors </h2><p>  Intentions to reconstruct all sectoral bases of the <span>national economy were</span> reflected in the development of the growth of heavy industry and its rational distribution among the regions of the state.  This plan was created for eight main economic regions: Northern, Caucasian, Central Industrial, Volga, Turkestan, Southern, Ural, West Siberian.  All natural, raw and energy resources, as well as national conditions, were taken into account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="goelro decryption ussr" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2161799.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Transport Electrification </h2><p>  Since the country was undergoing a comprehensive reconstruction of transport, the plan also provided for the electrification of the most important railways, and the beginning of the construction of new railways across the country.  Agricultural mechanization, the agrochemical industry, farming systems and so on, all this was put on the stream of improvement in pair work with GOELRO.  Electrification and mechanization of production were the main ideas for productivity growth. </p><h2>  Global construction </h2><p>  In addition to the construction of power plants, a global construction site was launched to create enterprises that will supply the construction of power plants with everything necessary.  For example, a tractor factory was founded in Stalingrad, the country began to develop the Kuznetsk coal basin with the creation of a new industrial area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decoding goelro story" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2161807.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The Soviet government also supported initiative groups of individuals in the implementation of the GOELRO plan.  He obtained government loans and tax benefits.  At the moment, one can note such grandiose structures within the GOELRO as Krasnoyarskaya, Bratskaya, Volzhskaya hydroelectric power stations, as well as Konakovskaya, Zmievskaya TPP. </p>
