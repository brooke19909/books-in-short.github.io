    <p>  Such functionality is available in modern models of TVs with the prefix Smart, but whatever manufacturer you take, whether it is Sony, LG, Samsung or another brand, usability, and the technology itself is still damp.  Very often, many owners complain about some kind of hangs, disconnects, format conflicts and other unpleasant moments.  Of course, you can use it, but the sediment remains unpleasant anyway. </p><p>  Another thing is when all these miracles work on the Android platform.  In this case, the <span>‚ÄúSmart TV‚Äù set-top box</span> greatly expands the possibilities and eliminates many of the problems that are inherent in the original branded firmware.  Here you are working with Google Play, where the number of programs is simply amazing, compared to the same LG World and Game World, and solving problems with format conflicts, and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  That is, it turns out that the smart set-top box on Android for the TV is not just some kind of addition to the main functionality, but a full-fledged entertainment platform with many features.  Sometimes there is simply no need to buy an expensive smart device, but confine yourself to an ordinary TV that will work perfectly in tandem with a similar prefix.  This nuance, perhaps, will not affect premium models, where everything is taken into account and included, but for middle-class TV gadgets it is quite relevant. </p><h2>  What is an Android set-top box for a TV? </h2><p>  The review should begin with the fact that this kind of equipment is not much different from similar counterparts on other platforms in terms of ease of use.  That is, you do not need to be afraid of migration from one device to another.  There are neither any sophisticated requirements, nor anything that the average consumer cannot cope with. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù set-top box for the TV is a small ‚Äúbox‚Äù that connects to your device, usually through an HDMI interface.  Power is supplied either through the usual 220 W network, or from the TV itself, it all depends on the specific model.  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù for a TV (set-top box), by analogy with tablets and smartphones, has a processor, a certain amount of RAM, modules of wireless protocols ‚Äúbluetooth‚Äù or ‚Äúwifi‚Äù, etc.  That is, in essence - this is the same tablet, but only without a screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of use </h2><p>  You can control the console using the mouse and / or keyboard.  If the TV set-top box on Android for the TV is equipped with the above-mentioned modules, then the wireless peripherals are at your service.  In addition, special manipulators, such as Air-Mouse or similar, are provided for such devices.  So there is plenty to choose from for a suitable headset. </p>

    <p>  It is also worth noting separately that on the shelves of stores you can find more expensive models of such devices, that is, it will be a significantly expanded ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù set-top box in terms of functionality.  Reviews on such models are mixed, but the advantages are obvious.  Here you have a camera with a microphone for talking on Skype, and the possibility of synergy with other household appliances in your home, etc.  Some people like this multifunctionality, but someone prefers to buy their own gadget for each business, believing that one device can not take on everything, and this qualitatively affects the result. </p><p>  Let us designate a list of models, which included sensible devices, distinguished by high-quality assembly, good functionality and having a concept of universality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  MXQ Pro TV Box </h2><p>  This ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù for the TV (set-top box) works on the 5.1 platform and has a good set of characteristics, as well as an attractive price tag.  The model runs on a well-established set of Amlogic S905 chipsets (64 bits) with a Cortex A53 processor on 4 cores with a clock frequency of 2 GHz. </p>

    <p>  There is not much RAM - only 1 GB, but this is enough for comfortable viewing of videos in ultra-high resolution ("Ultra" -HD) and for not very "heavy" games.  There will obviously not be enough internal memory for users - 8 GB.  Fortunately, there are interfaces for connecting external hard drives and third-party SD cards.  So there should not be any problems with data storage. </p><h2>  Device Features </h2><p>  In addition, there is a LAN port so that the set-top box for the TV (Internet up to 1000 Mbps) has full access to the World Wide Web.  The Wi-Fi and bluetooth modules are responsible for the operation of wireless protocols.  The gadget supports working with files via HTPS channel and digital broadcasting of IPTV class.  Connection to the TV is via the <span>HDMI interface version</span> 2.0. </p><h2>  iconBIT XDS1003DW </h2><p>  This model is not just some ordinary ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù for the TV (set-top box), but a real media center.  The device costs accordingly, but the money spent on it pays off with interest.  One of the main ‚Äúchips‚Äù of the device is the ability to work with 3D content.  Moreover, the model supports such standards as Dolby Digital and DTS, that is, the system quietly copes with class 5.1 channel sound. </p>

    <p>  The ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù for the TV (set-top box) of the iconBIT brand has its own distinctive feature - these are two operating systems.  That is, on the one hand, we see the shell from the "Realtek" RTD 4.5 series familiar to such gadgets, and on the other, the "Android" platform.  Therefore, the device can be called utterly universal.  Although some believe that such a set of operating systems is not entirely successful, they point to some conflict between the main protocols.  But an ordinary user is unlikely to notice any critical flaws, because this tandem works quite tolerably and does not "swear" over trifles. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the device </h2><p>  In addition, the model supports working with external 3.5-inch drives, which is also pleasing.  It is enough for the user to lift the lid, snap the hard drive into the SATA interface and work quietly.  If there is such a need, then you can connect non-standard media, such as 2.5-inch drives, which are usually placed on laptops.  Also, the console has Internet access via LAN port, with a speed of no more than 1000 Mbps. </p><h2>  Enybox EKB368 </h2><p>  This model is characterized by a very fast and high-performance set of chipsets.  The prefix can be called a kind of mini-computer, which will make of your TV a very good semblance of a multimedia station.  The gadget works on the latest version of "Android" 5.1.  This version has very good user ratings and is characterized by multifunctionality, an intuitive interface and convenience. </p>

    <p>  The high-performance Rockchip RK3368 processor, which runs on eight Cortex-A53 series cores of 1.5 GHz each, is responsible for speed.  The characteristics of the chip allow you to safely watch videos in ultra-high resolution, which owners of large screens will certainly appreciate, as well as play "heavy" games.  RAM for this kind of technology is quite enough - 2 GB, so there are no problems with friezes, brakes and other lags. </p><p>  The internal 16 GB drive is not particularly impressive, but most owners do not use it, because the device is able to accept a couple of hard drives and any SD card.  There are wireless Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules, as well as a LAN-type Internet port with a stream limit of 1000 Mbps.  The device is connected using the HDMI interface, so there will be no problems with adaptation here either. </p><h2>  ZIDOO X5 </h2><p>  This is an interesting representative of its segment originally from the Middle Kingdom.  The device has a catchy and very attractive appearance, as well as a good filling.  The system runs on the Android platform 5.1. </p>

    <p>  One of the most attractive features of the console is the ability to work with ultra-high resolution 4K format.  Not every gadget in this price category can boast such a distinguishing feature. </p><p>  Responsible for the performance is the relatively fast processor of the Amlogic S905 brand, running on four cores of the Cortex A53 architecture with a frequency of 2 GHz for each core.  The amount of RAM is not enough to run powerful applications (1 GB), so you have to be content with average toys and undemanding software. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The internal drive also has modest performance - only 8 GB, but you can significantly expand the volume if you connect an external device via a USB port.  On board there are modules of wireless protocols ‚ÄúWi-Fi‚Äù and ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù, there is also the possibility of accessing the network via a LAN port with a speed limit of 1000 Mbps.  In general, this is a very solid prefix that will appeal to undemanding users, especially since the price tag for the model is very affordable. </p>
