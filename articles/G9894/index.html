Perhaps, even an average school student could easily cope with this task.  This seems to be nothing complicated.  However, let's recall.  So, the seas of the Arctic shelf are the Barents, Kara, White, Laptev, East Siberian and Chukchi.  Total six.  What are their features?  What do they have in common?  And what are the main differences? </p><p>  This article will not only give an answer to all these questions, but also try to prove to the reader that the Arctic seas deserve no less attention than the more usual for us, especially in the summer, Black or Azov.  They are unusual for us in terms of temperature balance, but this actually does not make them less interesting. </p><h2>  Section 1. Arctic seas washing Russia.  general information </h2><p>  In an attempt to reveal this topic, we will try to list the main features of these parts of the globe. </p><p>  First of all, it should be noted that the Arctic seas of Russia are covered most of the year with a dense layer of ice.  From west to east, they are becoming colder.  For example, if in the Barents Sea the influence of the Atlantic is still felt a little, then further east the thickness of the ice increases significantly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arctic seas" class="if" height="462" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/818610.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Arctic seas are becoming warmer thanks to the currents of the Pacific Ocean.  This is especially noticeable in that part of Chukotsky, which is directly adjacent to the Bering Strait. </p><p>  We also note that the so-called Arctic seas, in turn, exert maximum influence on the climate of Siberian regions.  And, oddly enough, but most of all such an effect is felt in the summer.  This is because in winter they are covered with ice, like land, and there are no differences in temperature and humidity.  But in the summer, cold masses of water contrast strongly with warm earth. </p><p>  The fishing of various marine animals has long been associated with all the Arctic seas of Russia, which at one time led to the extermination of many species and was ultimately banned.  However, these places, despite the severity of the climate, constantly attract a huge number of tourists from different parts of the globe.  One of the most popular routes is a visit to the North Pole.  Many people, <span>not paying attention</span> to all difficulties, tend to climb onto this ‚Äúcrown‚Äù of the Earth on an icebreaker.  Other favorite objects of the Arctic seas are rookeries of fur seals and walruses, ‚Äúbird markets‚Äù, places favored by polar bears. </p><h2>  Section 2. The Mysterious White Sea </h2><p>  The main difference between this section of the world ocean and all other seas of the Arctic is that it is located south of the Arctic Circle, and only a small northern part of the water area extends beyond it.  Thus, it turns out that the White Sea has natural borders from almost all sides.  It is separated from the Barents only by a thin and rather conventional line. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arctic seas of Russia" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/818609.jpg" width="600"></div>

It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 90 thousand square meters.  km  The average depth of the local waters is 67 m, and the maximum is 350 m. Especially deep-water sections of the White Sea are the Basin, Kandalaksha Bay.  In the northern part, the shallowest zones are located - not deeper than 50 m. It should be noted that the bottom here is uneven. </p><p>  Surprisingly, within the White Sea, a mixed climate reigns, so to speak, having the features of a marine and at the same time continental climate. </p><h2>  Section 3. The Amazing Barents Sea </h2><p>  Those who want to trace how the nature of the Arctic seas is changing are recommended to go to Barentsovo, which occupies the most western position. </p><p>  Geographically, it communicates with the Norwegian warm sea, as well as the cold waters of the Arctic basin.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Barents Sea is about 1,405,000 square meters.  km, the average depth here is approximately 200 m. </p><p>  <span>The climate is polar</span> marine, the warmest among the rest of the shelf seas of the Arctic Ocean.  3/4 of the surface of the Barents Sea is annually covered with ice, but it never completely <span>freezes</span> , even in winter.  All this is due to the influx of warm Atlantic waters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arctic seas washing Russia" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/818608.jpg" width="600"></div>

All this greatly affects the hydrological characteristics of the water body.  For example, this sea is characterized by good mixing of waters and excellent aeration. </p><h2>  Section 4. Why not go to the coast of the <span>Kara Sea?</span> </h2><p>  The Kara Sea is located off the coast of the Taimyr Peninsula, northeastern Europe, as well as the shores of Western Siberia.  Its western border is in contact with the Barents Sea, the eastern - with the Laptev Sea. </p><p>  This section of the oceans is completely located beyond the Arctic Circle.  The Kara Sea reaches about 883 thousand km¬≤, the average depth is 111 m, and the maximum reaches 600 m in some places. </p><p>  The shores in the eastern part of Novaya Zemlya are indented by fjords, and on the mainland there are large lips and bays, into which the great Siberian rivers flow, namely the Yenisei, Taz, Ob and Pyasina. </p><p>  There are many islands in the Kara Sea, especially a lot of them off the coast of Taimyr. </p><p>  The maximum salinity (33-34%) is observed at its surface in the northern part.  In spring, melting ice may somewhat desalinate the bays near river mouths (up to 5%). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arctic shelf sea" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/818607.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It should be noted that almost all the Arctic seas of Siberia are significantly affected by river flow.  For example, at Karsky this percentage ratio reaches 40%.  In general, it is known that rivers carry 1,290 km¬≥ of fresh water here annually, with 80% of this amount coming from June to October. </p><p>  By the way, another important feature is that from October to May the Kara Sea completely freezes.  That is why local people even called him the "ice bag." </p><h2>  Section 5. The Laptev Sea </h2><p>  Do you know which of the Arctic seas is the deepest?  Laptev, of course!  Geographically, it is located directly off the coast of Eastern Siberia.  Previously, it was even called Siberian. </p><p>  Immediately, we note that this sea is completely beyond the Arctic Circle.  In the north, the Arctic Ocean opens before him, the Arctic Ocean is cold and almost completely covered with eternal ice, in the west several straits connect the Laptev Sea with the Kara Sea, in the east the East Siberian Sea begins behind the straits, in the south there is a very indented coast of the Eurasian continent. </p><p>  Its total area is 664 thousand km¬≤, on average, the depth is 540 m, the southern part (up to 50 sq. M) is considered the shallowest, and at the edge of the shelf, a region of great depths is found, for example, in the Sadko trench, the maximum in-depth distance reaches an almost unthinkable figure in 3385 m. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how the nature of the arctic seas is changing" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/818606.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The eastern part of the sea is quite seismic; earthquakes up to 6 points sometimes occur just west of the <span>Novosibirsk Islands</span> . </p><p>  As a rule, most of the year the Laptev Sea is covered with ice.  From the glaciers giants icebergs are abundantly formed here. </p><p>  The average salinity of the water is 34%, but near the mouth of the river.  Lena, it drops up to 1%, because a full-flowing river brings fresh water here.  In addition to Lena, other large arteries flowing into the Laptev Sea are Yana, Olenek, Anabar and Khatanga. </p><h2>  Section 6. East Siberian - the shallowest Arctic sea </h2><p>  This surface area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe globe belongs to the category of the so-called marginal continental.  It is geographically located off the coast of Eastern Siberia.  The boundaries of these waters are generally conventional lines, and only in some parts is it really limited by land.  The western territory of the East Siberian Sea runs along Fr.  Boiler room and then runs along the Laptev Sea.  The northern cordon completely coincides with the edge of the mainland shallows.  In the east, it is outlined about.  Wrangel and two capes - Blossom and Jacan. </p><p>  The waters of the East Siberian Sea communicate well with the Arctic Ocean.  The sea area is 913 thousand square meters.  km, but the maximum depth reaches 915 m. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arctic seas of siberia" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/818605.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In East Siberian there are few islands.  The coastline has strong bends, in places the land protrudes directly into the sea.  Continents in the Arctic seas, as a rule, are represented by plains.  True, in some areas there is still a slight bias. </p><p>  Note that this sea is under the influence of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and that is why its climate is considered to be the polar sea, with great continental influence. </p><p>  A relatively small amount of mainland water comes here.  The largest rivers flowing into this sea are the Kolyma and Indigirka. </p><h2>  Section 7. And what do you know about the Chukchi Sea? </h2><p>  Between Fr.  Wrangel and the American cape Barrow is the Chukchi Sea area of ‚Äã‚Äã582 thousand square meters.  km  Probably everyone who is interested in culture and traditions understands that it got its name thanks to the name of the people who inhabit its shores. </p><p>  In general, the Chukchi Sea is characterized by a cold climate, intense ice conditions created due to the influence of the Canadian ice cycle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="continents in the arctic seas" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/818604.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Chukchi Sea connects to the Pacific Ocean through the <span>Bering Strait,</span> 86 km wide and 36 m deep, but about 30 thousand cubic meters penetrate into the Arctic.  km of relatively warm water.  In August, its upper layers near the strait can warm up to +14 ¬∞ .  In summer, unlike cold pores, Pacific waters move the ice edge farther from the coast. </p><h2>  Section 8. Nature and man: the seas become noticeably cleaner </h2><p>  In the modern world, we are used to circumventing the topic of ecology whenever possible.  Why?  The thing is that somehow it has already become a habit to scold industrial enterprises, dishonest vacationers and dishonest officials from the local administration.  In general, we somehow at the subconscious level already know that everything is bad, and in the future it will be even worse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which of the Arctic seas is the deepest" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/818603.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But recently, scientists from the Murmansk Marine Biological Institute, after returning from the Murmansk-Dudinka flight, brought 200 liters of sea water with them for analysis on Cesium-137 and Strontium-90 - radionuclides, which are indicators of anthropogenic effects.  The results of painstaking work were encouraging: the northern seas are becoming cleaner, nature nevertheless copes with the previously received and accumulated damage. </p><p>  Unfortunately, radioactive elements are still detected, but in smaller quantities than in the 90s. </p>
