  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to crochet a unicorn: diagram and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, demand for crocheted toys has begun to skyrocket.  Moreover, finished crafts are to the liking not only of kids, but also of many adults.  In the material presented below, we will talk about how to make a unicorn crocheted.  The scheme and a detailed description of the necessary actions will also be offered to the attention of readers. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><div class="photo" data-original="thewhoot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet a unicorn" class="if uuid-2954247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2954247.jpg"></div><p>  Before embarking on an idea, you need to carefully consider which toy you want to get in the end.  After all, a unicorn is a mythical character, which means that its appearance can vary depending on the imagination of the knitter.  The main thing is not to forget to add the most important attribute - the horn.  And then surely everyone will recognize in the fulfilled character a true unicorn.  Having thought over the appearance of the conceived creature, we proceed to the choice of material and tool.  Professional knitters recommend choosing yarn designed specifically for children.  It is best suited for crocheting a unicorn (either with or without a pattern).  The hook must be chosen based on your preferences.  If a beginner takes the case, it is better to purchase a metal tool of medium length in size equal to the thickness of the thread. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How does knitting toys begin? </h2><p>  Knitting a unicorn, like other small animals, involves the implementation of parts of various shapes.  The main thing is to know which one to start with so that it is more convenient to assemble the product together.  Knitted toys are notable for not being sewn together with a needle and thread.  After all, the craftswoman has a hook that is great for this purpose.  However, it‚Äôs important that you start the execution of every detail correctly.  Therefore, we further propose to study the initial stage of the execution of a unicorn crocheted according to the scheme. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet unicorn" class="if uuid-2954255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2954255.jpg"></div><p>  The technology is really simple: </p><ol><li>  The first step is to take a hook and yarn. </li><li>  The index finger of the right hand to wrap the knitting thread, making two turns. </li><li>  Then we remove the resulting loop and begin to tie it with a hook. </li><li>  Knitted toys are crocheted.  Otherwise, the product will turn out smoky and sloppy. </li><li>  After adding six columns, we connect the first and last loop of the row together. </li><li>  Then we go to the second row. </li></ol><h2>  We knit the hind legs </h2><p>  Professional knitters note that amigurumi art is exclusively suitable for creative people.  After all, sweaters, skirts, swimwear and other wardrobe items are knitted according to strict canons, and knitted toys are performed almost arbitrarily.  The size of the conceived animal, as well as its individual parts, is determined independently.  Therefore, in the current master class, we will not present a specific crochet pattern for a unicorn, where each step will be described in detail.  We will only explain how not to get confused in actions and create a truly unique creature. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, unicorn knitting begins with the hind legs.  Therefore, we carry out the manipulations described in the previous paragraph.  And it‚Äôs better to start with additional yarn to highlight the hooves.  Then we tie a circle, reaching the desired size.  You can navigate according to the scheme proposed below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a unicorn" class="if uuid-2954252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2954252.jpg"></div><p>  Then we knit without adding, making a hoof.  After that, we begin to gradually reduce the number of loops so that the foot narrows upward.  It is recommended to fix all your actions on paper, developing your own crochet pattern and description of the unicorn.  Indeed, by analogy, we will knit the second part.  When the length of the first seems sufficient, set it aside and proceed with the second. </p><h2>  We knit a little body </h2><p>  When the two hind legs are ready, we stuff them and connect them together.  To do this, we knit a chain of an arbitrary number of loops from one foot to another.  We focus on our idea.  Then we tie the circumference of the second paw and return through the chain to the first.  From time to time we add loops, expanding to the desired size the lower circumference of the body.  We repeat the described actions until this part reaches the intended parameters.  For readers who better perceive visual instructions, we offer the following part of the scheme for a unicorn crochet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet unicorn how to make" class="if uuid-2954262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2954262.jpg"></div><h2>  Add the upper legs to the body. </h2><p>  The body of the unicorn fits in the same way as the hind legs.  But it is important to consider that this part should be larger.  We carry it out, forming a pear.  But remember that closer to the upper edge you need to add the upper legs.  Therefore, we tied the body to the desired length and interrupted to tie the legs.  They can be made the same size as the rear, or smaller.  It all depends on the wishes of the needlewoman. </p><p>  We carry out the two necessary parts and carefully attach to the body.  To do this, attach the foot to the body and tie the contacting parts of both parts.  Thus, we pass the first circle.  Next, fill the trunk and legs.  Then we again take the hook and move along the body, moving to the outer parts of the legs. </p><h2>  Knit head </h2><p>  Professional knitters are convinced that it is impossible to explain the technology for making this part of the unicorn amigurumi crochet according to the pattern.  The description in this case will help you better understand the actions.  I would like to note right away that experts recommend tying the head separately.  Especially if a beginner knits a toy.  Because how to properly reduce loops and rows, performing solid products, only masters can.  For beginners, it is better to prepare this part separately, and then attach it with a hook. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hricrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet unicorn" class="if uuid-2954233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2954233.jpg"></div><p>  The technology of head knitting is simple: </p><ol><li>  To begin with, you should bind the amigurumi ring.  We studied its technology in the second paragraph of the current article. </li><li>  Then moving in a circle and evenly adding loops, we form a circle of the desired size. </li><li>  Then we knit the nose.  Which we should get like a ball. </li><li>  Next, we form the head.  Remember that hands should be placed on it.  Therefore, I cut about half, together, where the eyes will be located, we make a chain of air loops.  As a result, we get a small hole. </li><li>  Finish the head, reducing the loop.  But before that, we stuff it well. </li><li>  We tie a hole for the horn in a circle, after which we form a part of the desired size.  Unforgettable stuff it!  Then we connect the head with the torso, embroider the eyes, nose and smile. </li></ol><p>  That's the whole description and diagram for a crocheted unicorn.  We wish you creative success! </p>
