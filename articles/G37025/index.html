It became especially acute in 2017, when the interesting flagship X was introduced. Many have to think over their purchase, since the cost of a smartphone is far from small. </p><p>  The article will describe those phones that you should pay attention to.  Among the information will be submitted specifications, advantages, disadvantages, cost.  The lineup of iPhones is not very large, so choosing a suitable option will not be so difficult. </p><h2>  iPhone 4S and older </h2><p>  If we are talking about what is the best iPhone in the world, then obviously you should not pay attention to models older than the iPhone 4S.  Such a device can only be purchased as a rarity.  However, smartphones can no longer be found on sale; they were discontinued three years ago. </p><p>  Even with its merits, the device is already obsolete.  Display - 3.5 inches.  Resolution - 640 x 960. RAM - 512 MB.  Processor - A5. </p><p>  If you want to buy such a device, then you need to look for either refurbished or used.  It will cost no more than 5 thousand rubles.  The phone, although it performs its basic tasks, but does them slowly.  When buying, you need to understand that there may be problems with the battery or other elements. </p><p>  Call the best phone categorically impossible.  Although it is inexpensive, playing or working with it is quite difficult.  There are no modern features.  The only advantage is that the phone‚Äôs camera is much better than that of Chinese competitors for the same amount. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which iPhone is better" class="if uuid-2855819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2855819.jpg"></div><h2>  4S Features </h2><p>  The device has compact dimensions: 5.86 x 11.52 x 0.93 cm. The smartphone weighs 140 grams.  Powered by A9 processor, coprocessor - MP2.  Cores - 2. RAM 512 MB.  It was released in three versions: 8, 16 and 32 GB.  The battery is 1432 mAh.  Screen resolution 640 x 960. Built-in sensors of light, proximity, accelerometer, compass, gyroscope. </p><p>  The device can be upgraded to version 8 of the operating system.  The rear camera allows you to take pictures with a resolution of 3264 x 2448. The front module is slightly weaker.  Thanks to him, you can take a photo of 640 x 480 pixels. </p><h2>  iPhone 5S / 5C </h2><p>  When answering the question of which iPhone is the best and most reliable, it is worth mentioning 5S and 5C.  Although the phones were released relatively long ago, they are still in demand.  You can buy them if you want an iPhone, but money is enough only for the Chinese state employee.  At the moment, the cost of phones does not exceed 8 thousand rubles.  However, the smartphone is not officially produced, so there are only two options: you can buy a used / refurbished one. </p><p>  On iPhone 5S, users say, you can install one of the latest versions of the operating system.  Accessories for it are inexpensive.  The phone itself is small in size, has an interesting and recognizable design.  Works good.  It has a Touch ID.  Optimization of the phone is at an excellent level, so the smartphone will perfectly pull modern games. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  5C will be cheaper, since it is made of plastic, does not have a fingerprint scanner, is equipped with a bad processor.  Everyone likes this phone due to its bright shade and compact body.  However, the phone is not updated to the latest versions of iOS. </p><p>  So, is it worth taking these phones in 2018?  You can‚Äôt name them the best iPhones, but they are perfect for teenagers or the older generation who are just getting acquainted with smartphones.  But if a person likes to play modern games, watch movies on the phone and so on, then buy iPhone 5 is not worth it. </p><h2>  Characteristics 5S / 5C </h2><p>  The 5S phone runs on the A7 processor, 5C - A6.  The clock frequency is slightly more than 1 GHz.  RAM - 1 GB.  The camera has an 8 megapixel module.  If you compare the power of these two devices, it is better to choose 5S.  It works more stably and is able to now draw most of the games. </p><h2>  iPhone 6/6 + </h2><p>  Which is better: iPhone or iPhone Plus?  Definitely need to answer, the ‚Äúplus‚Äù works more stable, has improved hardware.  However, it should be noted: the ‚Äúsixth‚Äù smartphone was not very successful.  Why?  The cases are bent - one of the most popular claims of buyers.  Upgrading to a new version of the operating system is not worth it, as the phone will greatly slow down.  RAM is not enough, the processor is outdated. </p><p>  Why is it recommended to take older models, but the ‚Äúsix‚Äù is not worth it?  This is due to the fact that 5S / 5C has a low cost.  And at 6/6 + the price is now biting strongly.  For it they ask from 10 thousand to 20 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You cannot call this iPhone the best, so you should not buy it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.euronics.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the best iphone in the world" class="if uuid-2855821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2855821.jpg"></div><h2>  Characteristics 6/6 + </h2><p>  The Six screen has a resolution of 750 x 1334 pixels.

The processor is A9, and the RAM is 2 GB.  Due to such characteristics, the phone is able to compete with many Chinese counterparts that are in the same price segment.  In addition, this phone has 3D Touch.  They are updated and distributed everywhere.  There is one small minus - the cost of phones starts at 25 thousand rubles. </p><p>  If you do not want to spend such an amount of money, you can pay attention to the restored models with a minimum configuration.

However, it has compact dimensions and can be updated to the latest version of the system.  Suitable for a child or older generation.  However, brand lovers should not buy this iPhone.  There are rumors that the company will release an updated version, so it's better to wait. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which is better iphone or iphone plus" class="if uuid-2855822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2855822.jpg"></div><h2>  SE specifications </h2><p>  The phone works with 2 GB of RAM, on the A9 processor.

Now the cost of them has fallen a bit.  Considering that newer models have a slightly different filling and fall into a different category, the ‚Äúseven‚Äù is ideal for lovers of ‚Äúapple‚Äù devices.  The smartphone has a stylish and solid design.  Both versions have an excellent camera that can compete with more modern devices in photo quality.  In AnTuTu, the phone receives 170 thousand points.

Both cameras are 12 megapixels, front - 7 megapixels.  Operating system version 10. </p><h2>  iPhone 8/8 + </h2><p>  This phone can be considered an improved version of the "six".  The smartphone received a new processor, the body is made of glass.  The camera is improved, wireless and fast charging are added.  However, acquiring a device that charges the phone is quite expensive.  Therefore, many buyers prefer to use a wire. </p><p>  The device should be cheaper by the end of the year.  However, you should think carefully before buying.  Glass breaks easily, and repairs cost a lot. </p><p>  The cost of the device is more than 50 thousand rubles.  So which iPhone is better?  It should be noted that the G8 cannot be called such.  There are no distinguishing features that would justify such an overpayment compared to previous models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestbuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the best iPhone to date" class="if uuid-2855824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2855824.jpg"></div><h2>  Features 8/8 + </h2><p>  The G8 has a screen of 4.7 inches, 8+ - 5.5 inches.  A11 processor.  RAM 2 GB and 3 GB, respectively.  Two versions of memory 64 and 256 GB are on sale.  There is a fingerprint scanner.  The G8 has a 12 megapixel camera, while the Plus modification has a pair of 12 megapixel cameras.  Frontal - 7 megapixels. </p><h2>  iPhone X </h2><p>  This phone has everything a modern smartphone needs.  Someone may not like the design, but it is recognizable.  The processor is excellent, the cameras are good, there is a face recognition scanner. </p><p>  The cost of this device starts from 80 thousand rubles.  If we talk about which iPhone has the best camera, then this device fully meets all the requirements.  However, according to the characteristics and price / quality ratio, it is better to pay attention to the news - XS / XR. </p><div class="photo" data-original="store.stormfront.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which iPhone is the best and most reliable" class="if uuid-2855826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2855826.jpg"></div><h2>  Characteristics X </h2><p>  The phone has a 5.8 inch display.  RAM 3 GB, built-in - 64/256 GB.  It works on version 11 of the operating system.  A11 processor, the number of cores - 6. The cameras take pictures 4032 x 3024 and 3840 x 2160. Videos are recorded at a speed of 60 frames per second. </p><h2>  Which iPhone to buy in 2018? </h2><p>  The most optimal (both in terms of price and quality) phones in 2018 should be called the 6S / 6S + and 7/7 + models.  These devices have excellent equipment, updated to the latest version of the operating system.  The price tags for these phones are already optimal, phones will no longer be cheaper.  If we are talking about which device will be the best for a child or an elderly person, then you should pay attention to 5S and SE smartphones.  The G8 is not impressive, and the X is too expensive, although many call it the best iPhone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which iPhone model is the best" class="if uuid-2855825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2855825.jpg"></div><h2>  Which memory to choose? </h2><p>  It must be remembered that iPhones do not support memory cards.  That is why, before buying, you need to calculate whether there is enough memory for your needs.  Models with 16 GB will be enough for undemanding users, but if a person likes to play powerful games that require a lot of memory, download movies, music, then you should look at the modification of 32 GB or more.  But you need to remember that the larger the amount of memory, the more expensive the phone will cost. </p><h2>  Which shade to choose? </h2><p>  The answer to this question is as subjective as possible, but for some reason many buyers cannot make a choice.  In the line of smartphones there are a sufficient number of options.  The classic shade should be called the silver version.  ‚ÄúSpace gray‚Äù is a little like him.  In the first version, the front panel is white and the back is silver.  In the second, the front panel is black.  This option is suitable for both women and men.  If someone likes the golden color, then such models are in the line of smartphones.  The front panel is white.  The most interesting in this shade is a glass iPhone.  The device is also practical as fingerprints are not visible.  The shade of "pink gold" is also now popular.  Mostly women like him.  The color is pleasant and noticeable from afar. </p><p>  IPhone 7 was the first in the line with a black body.  There is a matte option, there is a glossy one.  The first option is almost impossible to scratch, and the second is more convenient in the hand. </p><p>  When buying, you need to pay attention to the front.  The user does not look at the rear panel so often.  Buyers advise paying attention to black frames that look more solid and practical.  Thanks to them, sensors and frames around the screen are not visible, which does not distract during use.  To understand which option is suitable for a particular person, it is better to consider several color shades. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone is the best phone what" class="if uuid-2855828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2855828.jpg"></div><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  You should not purchase a new version of the iPhone at the beginning of the year.  It‚Äôs better to wait until the summer when gadgets start to get cheaper.  Closer to September, new models will be announced, which may be more interesting.  If you want to take devices 4 years ago, you can buy a smartphone at any time of the year. </p>
