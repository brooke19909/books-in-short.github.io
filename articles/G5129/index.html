Is the tourist complex so good as it is described?  It is worth noting that the guest reviews are very controversial, since the institution has significant shortcomings. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the pension is located in an incredibly picturesque place.  This is the main advantage of the complex.  If you live on the upper floors, you can appreciate the view of St. Petersburg, the forest and Kronstadt.  Amazing clean air and birdsong is what you need after the hustle and bustle of the city.  The boarding house is located near the city.  A trip by public transport from St. Petersburg takes only forty minutes. </p><p>  The main drawback of the restaurant, according to guests, is the number of rooms, which needs updating.  Some of the apartments have been renovated, but this did not affect the overall picture.  On the territory of the boarding house there are three buildings, two of them were built long ago, and the third is a new one.  In which of them to book apartments - you decide.  Despite the shortcomings, the boarding house has its regular customers who come here not the first year.  They note that recently the situation has somewhat worsened and traces of neglect are noticeable.  The number of rooms needs updating and repair.  Probably, this is not about all the rooms, but only those that are more in demand due to the lower cost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotelspb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension Baltiets Repino address" class="if uuid-2866743" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2866743.jpg"></div><p>  Old furniture and TVs are not the only problem of the apartments.  Absolutely all guests note the terrible quality of cleaning.  Dirty balconies, windows and corridors of buildings are commonplace.  Unfortunately, the administration does not pay due attention to cleanliness.  No less depressing are the facades of buildings that need updating. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Food is one of the most important points by which the quality of rest is evaluated.  According to tourists, the buffet in the boarding house leaves much to be desired.  A modest assortment of dishes, poor service and a large crowd in the main restaurant do not have a meal.  Tourists note that when booking you can choose a guesthouse, half board and breakfast.  Many are limited only to a morning meal.  But it is worthwhile to understand that in Repino's establishments food is not cheap. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Many tourists come to the boarding house for the sake of beautiful nature and fun.  The complex has wonderful animators who devote a lot of time to children.  Young guests are incredibly pleased with the rest.  For kids there is a lot of entertainment in the boarding house.  In addition, daily activities carry out all kinds of entertainment events.  Children here are a lot of fun. </p><p>  The pension is no less attractive in terms of entertainment and for adults.  Want to take a break from the fast pace of the city?  Come to Repino.  Pension "Baltiets" (the details of the institution are given at the beginning of the article) is the best place to relax.  Despite the shortcomings, people come back here year after year, hoping that soon everything will change for the better. </p><p>  A huge advantage of the complex is the presence of a swimming pool, which operates throughout the year.  His visit allows you to get in shape, relax and get a lot of pleasure.  Positive feedback is also left by guests about the spa center of the pension. </p><p>  In general, the boarding house makes a dual impression.  On the one hand, it is very attractive in many ways, including pricing.  And on the other hand, there are flaws that are worth eliminating.  Nevertheless, the pension is recommended if you want to relax in Repino. </p>
