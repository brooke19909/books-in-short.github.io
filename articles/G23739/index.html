    <p>  The future teacher of Nero from his youth was interested in philosophy.  He was a follower of Papyrius, Fabian, Sotion.  Subsequently, Seneca became interested in politics and became a lawyer.  However, it did not last long.  Seneca interrupted his career and left the country due to a serious illness.  He went to Egypt for treatment.  There he did not waste time in vain.  He regularly visited the <span>Alexandria Library</span> and talked with scientists.  There he wrote his first works.  Seneca returned to Rome already as a famous speaker and writer.  Having received a public post, the philosopher brought his works to the Senate and Emperor.  However, no one shared his views, and as a result, Seneca was sent in exile to Corsica. </p><p>  Here he also had something to do.  Seneca watched the heavenly bodies.  His views on the world are changing somewhat.  He writes his famous works - ‚ÄúFedra‚Äù, ‚ÄúOedipus‚Äù, ‚ÄúMedea‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

It was through her efforts that the philosopher was returned from exile and became a mentor to the boy.  The teacher of Nero had a great influence on his student.  This can be judged by the first years of his reign, when the <span>Roman Empire was</span> strengthened and richer <span>.</span>  Nero has done a lot for his people.  Passed some financial reforms, strengthened the power of the Senate.

    <p>  Seneca dreamed of creating an ideal society.  For this, a highly moral ruler was needed.  In this regard, he was very responsible for his role as a mentor.  A year after the accession of Nero, his teacher read him his treatise "On Mercy."  It spoke of the difference between an ideal ruler and a tyrant. </p><p>  The teacher of Nero soon lost power over the emperor.  His dreams were not destined to come true.  Seneca tried to take up his life and did not interfere with his former student.  However, this did not save him.  A few years later he was accused of conspiracy.  The Emperor could only do so, and he ordered Seneca to die.  The philosopher committed suicide. </p>

    <p>  The teacher of Nero was a unique and amazing person.  Unfortunately, many of his works were not preserved or partially reached us. </p><p>  Among his works, the most famous were the treatises On Mercy and On Good Deed.  One of the best are letters to Lucilius.  They are sermons about some events from the life of Seneca. </p><p>  The philosopher dedicated to his brother the dialogues "On Blissful Life" and "On Anger."  He wrote 12 books, which fit 10 treatises.  Consolation to Marcia is a collection of tips for mothers who have lost sons.  "Consolation to Helvia" was written during the exile.  "Consolation on the death of his brother," Seneca wrote for Polybius - in the hope that the latter would help him return to Rome. </p>
