    <p>  Practical teaching methods are used to cognize reality, form skills and abilities, and deepen knowledge.  During their application, the following techniques are used: task performance planning, task setting, operational incentives, control and regulation, analysis of results, determination of the causes of deficiencies.  Practical <span>teaching methods</span> cannot be used without other, in particular visual and verbal, teaching methods. </p><p>  Practical training methods are as follows: exercise method, laboratory work method, practical work <span>method, game method.</span>  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><p>  <strong>Description of practical teaching methods</strong> </p><p>  <strong>Exercises</strong> </p><p>  <span>This method of</span> practical training is most effective.  Under the exercise is understood organized systematic and repetitive action, the purpose of which is to master these actions or improve their quality.  In order for students to master these skills well, exercises need to be properly organized. </p><p>  There are three types of exercises: </p><p>  ¬∑ Special - this is repeatedly repeated exercises, the action of which is aimed at the formation of labor and educational skills. </p><p>  ¬∑ Derivatives - this is an input to special previous exercises.  They contribute to the repetition, and thus the consolidation of previously organized skills.  If derivative repetition is not used, then the skill is usually lost. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  ¬∑ Commented - these are exercises that serve to enhance the educational process, as well as the conscious execution of tasks.  In other words, students and the teacher comment on the actions performed, as a result, the latter are better understood and remembered. </p><p>  Exercises are also divided into oral and written.  Oral exercises are most often used in the learning process, and most importantly, their purpose is to master the culture and <span>technique of reading,</span> storytelling, logical presentation of tasks, etc.  Writing exercises are also an important component of learning.  These are grammatical, stylistic and spelling dictations, summaries, essays, descriptions of experiments, etc.  They help to form and develop the necessary skills.  The effectiveness of the exercise is determined by such requirements as the correct execution of all actions, the conscious desire of the student to improve the quality of activity, monitoring and consciously taking into account the conditions under which the action is to be performed, taking into account the results achieved, and distributing the repetitions of the exercises over time. </p><p>  <strong>Laboratory method</strong> </p><p>  It is based on the independent conduct of research and experiments by students.  Most often it is used in the study of subjects such as chemistry, biology, physics.  The laboratory method can be carried out both individually and in groups.  The most effective is the problematic laboratory method, since during its implementation a hypothesis is put forward, its path is outlined, and the necessary devices and materials are selected directly by the students themselves. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>Practical method</strong> </p><p>  Practical training methods such as laboratory and practical are very similar, but practical differs from laboratory in that students apply in practice the knowledge that they already possess.  The ability to use theoretical knowledge in practice is highlighted.  The practical method helps to deepen knowledge and skills, improves the quality of solving problems of correction and control, stimulates cognitive activity. </p><p>  In the practical method, the following stages are distinguished: first, the teacher introduces the students to the theory, then there is instruction, a test (an example of how to do it), performance of work, and then control. </p><p>  <strong>Cognitive games</strong> </p><p>  This refers to created situations that completely simulate reality.  The main task of students is to find a way out of this situation.  Cognitive games stimulate the cognitive process.  Recently, simulation games have been especially popular when students need to reproduce certain qualities.  The most commonly used types of game method, such as the generation and dramatization of ideas.  Generation is understood as something like a ‚Äúbrain attack‚Äù, during which students share (generate) their ideas for solving the problem in question.  The dramatization method can take various forms.  For example, he can act as a dialogue, a pre-arranged theatrical performance, etc.  It should be noted that cognitive games are to some extent non-traditional teaching methods, which are increasingly being introduced into the educational process. </p>
