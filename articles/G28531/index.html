    <p>  What is remarkable about Dederka, why it is worth choosing it among other resort villages of the Black Sea coast for spending holidays or vacations?  This question usually concerns only those who are unfamiliar with the name of the resort, since those tourists who have visited here at least once know for sure the answer to it. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Due to the small population of the village, the surrounding forests covering the mountainous terrain remained almost untouched.  Crossing the mountains, the river Dederkoy carries its waters to the sea.  On its banks and settled the village.  The air here is always crystal clear, fresh, saturated with volatile pine trees and dizzying aromas of the sea and southern flowers.  The water is clear and clean, most of the year is sunny days.  There is no frost here even in winter: the air temperature in January is +10 ¬∞ C, and sometimes even higher. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, in the summer there is no sweltering heat - this is due to the proximity of the sea.  Light breezes are refreshing, and the July heat is tolerated quite easily. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  As in many other neighboring resorts, the beach here is pebble, with a length of about 1.5 kilometers.  The bottom is flat, the entrance to the water is smooth, completely safe for both adults and children.  The most visited is the central beach of the village, but if you walk along the coast for about a hundred meters, you can find completely deserted areas where you can retire and relax all alone. </p><p>  In addition to the main beach, the village has a plot of about a hundred meters long and a little more than five meters wide, which belongs to the Green Guy boarding house.  This is a guarded paid beach where you can rent equipment for water sports, use the services of a medical center.  There are well-equipped beaches at two children's camps. </p>
