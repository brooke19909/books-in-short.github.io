  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is adaptation always ‚Äúadaptation‚Äù?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Translated from Latin, ‚Äúadaptation‚Äù or adaptation is ‚Äúadaptation‚Äù.  In biology, it is generally accepted that organisms adapt to the environment, and not vice versa.  <span>Socio-psychological adaptation of a</span> person is understood in two ways: as a short-term situation of a person getting used to the conditions of a new group and as a constant process of adapting each person to a new social environment.  In a changing world, addiction must take place actively, otherwise it begins to manifest itself as maladaptation and becomes a nuisance in personality development. </p><p>  In the theory of ethnography of L.N. Gumilyov, the adaptation of a passionate personality to the environment is considered as adaptation not so much of a personality to the new conditions of existence, but rather a change in the environment of this personality for itself.  Passionary leaders have an increased desire for activity, for a change in ethnic group.  They are maximally activated when the ethnic group is in danger.  For a passionarian, adaptation is the creation of such conditions of existence for an individual where he could maximize show his abilities and skills for the benefit of the whole society.  The goals of the activity of a passionate person are aimed at improving the living conditions of the ethnos, therefore, the manifestation of aggression in the form of conquering and developing new territories for people to live is not excluded.  For modern passionaries, the manifestation of activity in business and politics is more characteristic.  Their professional adaptation is characterized by making changes in the team where they begin their activities.  Changes are taking place in the structure and in the nature of the organization, where a passionate person feels as successful as possible. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If a passionate person, in the opinion of L.N. Gumilyov and M.I. Kovalenko, is a superadaptant, then the subpassionary is not efficiently adapted to new living conditions.  Its adaptation is a long process of overcoming the requirements of society, adapting to conditions that are unsuitable for an active and fulfilling life.  Only under the influence of a passionate leader can crowds of sub-passionaries change their lives, fulfilling their goals.  Adaptation processes are often spurred by material gain, i.e.  pay for activities.  Subpassionaries may be mercenaries who participate in hostilities or political events for a fee.  Sub passionarity can occur in early childhood, as  low energy is an inborn manifestation.  Such <span>children often get sick</span> when changing their lifestyle or place of residence, and the process of their getting used to kindergarten or school is difficult, therefore for them adaptation is a series of long and serious illnesses. </p><p>  An intermediate category of people with a moderate ability to absorb energy from the environment, the author of the <span>theory of passionarity</span> called harmonious individuals.  Their activity is enough to organize a family, participate in the production of consumer goods, i.e.  to provide society with everything necessary.  This is the largest group of people in the ethnic group.  For them, adaptation is a <span>process of socialization, the</span> assimilation of norms, requirements and values ‚Äã‚Äãof the <span>social environment.</span>  The level of reproduction of the population depends on them, therefore, their health, level of security and adaptation to living conditions within the existing ethnic group are paramount values.  Sustainability and stability become the purpose of the existence of such people.  <span>Harmonious personalities</span> at all times did not like passionaries who violated <span>this stability</span> , forcing them to adapt to new living conditions. </p><p>  Adaptation is a multifaceted concept.  This is an adaptation of an individual to new conditions, it is also a function of personality development, and overcoming the difficulties of development, and the degree of satisfaction with one‚Äôs life. </p>
