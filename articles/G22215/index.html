    <p>  Hydrogen peroxide is an odorless and colorless liquid.  This substance is an unstable compound.  It dissolves well in water and decomposes in the light even at room temperature.  In a network of pharmacies, peroxide is sold in the form of a three percent hydrogen peroxide.  As a medicine, it finds application due to the antiseptic and hemostatic effect. </p><p>  Hydrogen peroxide, the formula of which contains two <span>hydrogen atoms</span> and two <span>oxygen atoms,</span> has reducing and oxidizing properties.  It is able to cause an oxidative reaction with nitrites, turning them into nitrates.  In addition, peroxide from metal iodides releases iodine.  It also cleaves unsaturated compounds. </p><p>  The production of <span>hydrogen peroxide under</span> industrial conditions occurs as a result of a reaction in which organic substances participate.  For example, the catalytic oxidation <span>of isopropyl alcohol.</span>  The most valuable by-product that stands out is acetone.  The chemical industry also produces hydrogen peroxide as a result of the electrolysis of sulfuric acid.  Purification of the peroxide is carried out by careful distillation. </p><p>  <span>Hydrogen peroxide</span> is widely used in industry and in everyday life.  For example, in the textile industry it bleaches fabrics, and in the woodworking industry they use it in paper production.  As an oxidizing element, peroxide serves as fuel for rockets.  Hydrogen peroxide is also widely used in analytical chemistry.  In the construction industry, this substance serves as a foaming agent used in the manufacture of porous materials.  In various industries, peroxide can be one of the components in the manufacture of bleaching and disinfectants, and also play the role of catalysts for a hydrogenating agent. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Three percent hydrogen peroxide, which is sold in a network of pharmacies, is recommended for treating shallow wound surfaces.  The tool provides an antiseptic effect.  Peroxide is also preferred for cleansing deep purulent complex-profile wounds in case of difficulties in their rehabilitation.  The effectiveness of peroxide is explained by its ability to produce a lot of foaming substance, which softens blood clots and pus, separating them from tissues.  Subsequent administration of <span>an antiseptic solution</span> removes pathological neoplasms.  Carrying out these procedures significantly reduces the healing time of wounds and improves the patient's condition. </p><p>  As an external preparation, peroxide is recommended for rubbing into any foci of pain, in the form of various compresses, for rinsing the mouth, with multiple sclerosis, etc. </p><p>  Hydrogen peroxide is used to whiten tooth enamel and bleach hair.  However, it should be remembered that peroxide in these cases oxidizes, therefore, destroys tissues.  As a result, the use of peroxide (especially for whitening tooth enamel) is not recommended by specialists. </p><p>  The food industry uses hydrogen peroxide solutions as a means of disinfecting the surfaces of technological equipment.  He processes those parts of machines that have direct contact with products.  Enterprises manufacturing dairy products and packaging them using Tetra Pak technology process packaging with peroxide.  Thus, its disinfection is achieved. </p><p>  Hydrogen peroxide is also used for technical purposes.  It is used in the manufacture of electronic devices. </p><p>  At home, it removes spots that appear on objects after their interaction with potassium permanganate.  The effect occurs as a result of an oxidative reaction. </p>
