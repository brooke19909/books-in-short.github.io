What does it mean?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A person very quickly and for a long time gets used to the good.  Previously, it was somehow quite normal for most people to live without telephones at all, although if necessary, they had to go to the call center to call relatives in the nearest city.  Now, if the first time you can‚Äôt get on your mobile phone, some immediately panic, you just hear: "The subscriber is temporarily unavailable."  What does it mean?  What happened?  Where did you disappear to?  A panic may even begin.  Let's try to figure this out. </p><h2>  The simplest answers to the question </h2><p>  First of all, you need to understand that a mobile phone is a regular device stuffed with electronics, which has a battery and an on / off button.  Therefore, the reason for the lack of communication may be that the phone is simply dead or in the off state.  In this case, in the near future you will not get through to the subscriber at all. </p>

    <p>  But the most annoying thing is that with the second or third dialing, the connection occurs and no one speaks.  Many have anger towards their operator and a desire to change him.  Meanwhile, the reasons can be very different.  And you don‚Äôt need to worry very much when you hear in the receiver: ‚ÄúThe subscriber is temporarily unavailable.‚Äù  <span>What does it mean?</span>  <span>It</span> can mean anything. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Some information on the principle of mobile communications </h2><p>  It turns out that the mobility of a modern phone is its weak point.  If there is no connection between two conventional devices, then there can be only two reasons: the absence of contact between them or the breakdown of one of them.  In our case, everything is more complicated.  After we dial the number and press the call button, the radio signal goes to the <span>base station,</span> then to the switch, where it is subjected to secondary processing and, along with other calls, sent to your operator, to the switch.  Here, data about all subscribers is stored and the ability to make a call, location, tariff plan and so on is determined. </p>

    <p>  At the next stage, the call goes to the subscriber of the same network or redirected to another.  There he makes almost the same path.  When the person you call answers, the connection is established, and then the signal follows back.  It may seem that the route is too long and problematic, but it is not so at all.  Before us is a very reliable system that processes thousands of calls per second. </p><h2>  Still, what does it mean: "The subscriber is temporarily unavailable"? </h2><p>  Errors may creep into the indicated route.  The radio channel between your unit and the base station is the most vulnerable spot.  An indirect indicator of the quality of communication is the reception level on your phone.  When it is small, the likelihood of error increases.  Why and where does it fall? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the subscriber is temporarily unavailable call back later" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/452812.jpg" width="600"></div>

In some places, the signal may disappear altogether: in elevators, basements, on the ground floors, in the back of large buildings that have metal fittings and thick walls.  Steps between metro stations and road tunnels are also not the best places for mobile communications.  Failure can also occur from the re-reflection of electromagnetic waves from various radio equipment, a base station and a telephone during dense development.  Operators in this case increase the number of transmitters and use the increased <span>frequency range.</span>  Nevertheless, communication problems are possible.  Therefore, after hearing "The subscriber is temporarily unavailable, call back later", follow the advice - call back later. </p><h2>  Other Causes of Mobile Issues </h2><p>  Sometimes, fortunately, not too often, switches and base stations are overloaded.  This happens on big holidays, weekends, in places of public events or in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa large traffic jam.  And if the last two examples are local, then the first two are global.  There are many other reasons, so clearly invisible and less common.  Communication between the switch and the base station is transmitted in the form of signals via digital transport channels: these are wired, optical and radio relay communication lines.  They can be affected by various factors, for example, lightning discharges, rains, power surges, equipment malfunction, builders work, and so on.  During the work, the workers tear the <span>optical cables,</span> chop the antenna feeder.  All these lines have backup protection, but until switching is completed, there will be no communication for some time. </p>

    <p>  If the subscriber is temporarily unavailable, what does this mean yet?  The switch software or your phone may hang.  Fortunately, operator equipment rarely fails for this reason. </p><p>  There are two more important factors for communication problems.  The first is that some subscribers actively use the telephone as a means of accessing the Internet.  In this case, it is sometimes difficult to reach them.  The second case when the subscriber is temporarily unavailable - what does it mean?  Sometimes - nothing good: the phone was stolen, and the SIM card was thrown away. </p><h2>  What to do when it is impossible to reach the subscriber? </h2>

    <p>  Very often, having assessed the situation, looking carefully around or at the phone‚Äôs display, one can make guesses about the cause of communication problems.  It happens that a person wanted to make a call while away from civilization, but did not look at the signal reception level.  Get closer to the village and try again.  Do not make calls to the subway or other similar places.  Caught in heavy rain and thunderstorm, wait until nature calms down.  When you see that the mobile phone is frozen, reboot it and a connection will appear.  And the most important rule: if the subscriber is temporarily unavailable - call back later.  And let's hope that with the development of technology, many of these problems will disappear. </p>
