  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Best and Worst Sharjah Hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A huge number of tourists visiting Sharjah, caused the growth and development of the hotel business in the resort town.  The total number of hotels in the emirate is 47. Naturally, all Sharjah hotels differ in the level of service, the services provided, their cost, as well as their remoteness from the sea.  But often the number of stars in a <span>hotel‚Äôs rating</span> has nothing to do with the quality of living in it.  Sometimes a three-star hotel is much more comfortable than the most fashionable in the city.  Alas, it's hard to predict.  It is best to consult with someone who has already been to Sharjah and can advise the most suitable option for choosing Sharjah hotels or see reviews on the Internet. <br><br>  Foreign tourists who decide to choose a vacation in Sharjah need to know that alcohol is completely prohibited there and you will not find it in any hotel.  You can swim in the bay only on the territory of hotel beaches, and topless cannot be even there. <br><br>  Perhaps it is worth starting with a description of the best hotels in Sharjah.  All of them are united by high <span>quality service, an</span> assortment of additional services, proximity to the airport, Internet access, the presence of free parking and the convenience of rooms.  Unfortunately, for lovers of traveling with animals, none of the hotels in Sharjah provides accommodation with pets. <br><br>  Although the Sharjah Palas Hotel does not have a private beach, you can swim and sunbathe here all year round - it has an indoor pool and a special terrace for those who want to get a tan.  For four stars, this hotel is simply luxurious.  Great rooms with scenic views of the Mazmar lagoon, with a private bathroom and air conditioning.  Sauna, billiards, gym, massage.  Great food.  Accommodation in a room of a child under seven years old is free.  If the baby has not yet turned two, a crib will be installed for him. <br><br>  Hotel Golden Tulip Sharjah overlooks Khalid Lagoon.  Some <span>suites</span> here even have their own fully equipped kitchen.  The staff is very polite and friendly.  It is possible to rent a car and get all the information about the attractions that are worth visiting.  Laundry and dry cleaning services are included.  Children under three years old get free cot. <br><br>  Sharjah Rotana, in addition to the usual services, also provides a shuttle service to a nearby beach club, although the hotel has its own outdoor pool.  The rooms are furnished both for relaxation and for work.  The hotel's restaurant, offering three meals a day, is famous for its international cuisine.  The lobby cafe is open all the time.  Free accommodation is provided for children under 6 years old; a cot is provided for children under three years of age. </p><p>  Holiday Inn Sharjah, Ramada Sharjah and Corniche Al Buhaira Hotel can continue this list of the best Sharjah hotels.  But which hotels in <span>Sharjah have the</span> most negative <span>reviews from</span> Russian tourists? </p><p>  Three stars Al Seef Beach Hotel deserved.  The situation there is completely reminiscent of the boarding houses of Soviet times.  And even elderly tourists who are nostalgic for the past do not like this. </p><p>  The <span>Coral Beach Resort is</span> disgustingly fed, and there is no refrigerator in the rooms.  So there is no place to store our own stocks.  The service at this hotel is very poorly organized.  Very dirty area. </p><p>  At Sharjah Premiere Hotel, drinks are only available for a fee.  And not a single Russian-speaking employee. </p><p>  Sharjah Grand Hotel - the staff is very rude and the food is in no way suitable for a four-star hotel. </p><p>  Hotel Al Maha Regency Suited has no facilities for children.  The staff does not know languages, so it is very difficult to communicate even in English.  Poor plumbing.  Poor selection of dishes in the restaurant.  Dirty beach and unfriendly staff.  And such are Sharjah hotels. </p><p>  We hope that our short review will help you make the right hotel choice and your stay in Sharjah will not be overshadowed by troubles.  Remember, in Sharjah there are hotels, both good and not so good. </p>
