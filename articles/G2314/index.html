    <h2>  The formation of the beliefs of the king </h2><p>  <span>The political views of</span> Alexander III were formed under the strong influence of his guardian and mentor KP Pobedonostsev. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Counter-reforms of Alexander III" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/825008.jpg" width="306"></div>  This odious politician opposed the introduction of Western European social values ‚Äã‚Äãinto the Russian mentality.  <span>Local authorities,</span> he considered unnecessary, their orders - "talking", which should be disposed of.  The people, in the understanding of Pobedonostsev, should be led by a sovereign father.  The mentor of the sovereign considered the need to preserve autocracy on the territory of the Russian Empire the only right policy, and any deviation from the course, in his opinion, could ruin the state and plunge the country into chaos.

Alexander III decided that liberalization of the Russian people is impossible, and social reforms are dangerous and lead to anarchy. </p><h2>  Political course of Alexander III </h2><p>  The main theses of the political course of Alexander III were as follows: </p><ul><li>  Strengthening the autocracy, strengthening control over the observance of estate orders, expanding the privileges of the noble classes. </li><li>  The removal from power of liberal statesmen. </li><li>  <span>The political system of</span> Russia began to acquire the features of a police power.  Counterreforms of Alexander III led to the emergence of the Security Department.  <span>The Tsarist secret police</span> monitored the political mood of their subjects, controlled, and, if necessary, suppressed objectionable activities without trial. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Active Russification of national suburbs and recently annexed territories.  This measure was supposed to destroy any attempts of countries to restore their independence and national identity.  The ideas of creating national literature, culture, and art were suppressed - national figures learned on themselves what counter-reform was and what its consequences were. </li></ul><p>  Reforms and counter-reforms of Alexander III did not prevent him from pursuing a rather balanced foreign political line.  In history, he called himself Peacemaker, because he preferred a peaceful solution to problems over direct military intervention.  Under this <span>tsar, Russia</span> did not conduct military operations and did not enter into military alliances. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The period of counter-reforms </h2><p>  Resistance to the introduction of European values ‚Äã‚Äãin the Russian Empire led to the creation of a number of political decisions that coordinate the course of the tsar.  <span>The years 1880-1900 were</span> called by historians as the period of counter-reforms in the state.  At this time, many liberal undertakings and transformations are canceled.  Russia learned what counter-reform is, and the principles of Nicholas I began to revive. </p><h2>  What are counterreforms and how were they carried out </h2><p>  Judicial counter-reform gave officials greater authority in the selection of <span>jurors.</span>  The governor was given the right to challenge any jury without giving reasons.  A significant restriction on property and educational qualifications for assessors was also introduced. </p><p>  The counterreforms of Alexander III also affected local self-government.  Peasants significantly reduced the number of their representatives in local governments, and for hereditary nobles, on the contrary, the quota increased.  Additional circulars prepared the transformation of the election system, which resulted in a decrease in the number of persons eligible to vote. </p><p>  Restrictions in the field of education and the press hit those liberals who still have not realized what counter-reform is.  Having set a goal to prevent the strengthening of liberal sentiments in society, decisive measures were taken to tighten control over young people and students.  Women's courses are being closed, universities are being deprived of their rights and freedoms, tuition fees have been increased, and senior management of universities has been appointed from above.  In addition, according to the circular ‚ÄúOn Cooking Children,‚Äù people of the lower classes were denied the right to receive higher education. </p><p>  The main counter-reforms, the table of which is given below, clearly describe all the main points of the tsar‚Äôs activity on the way to the autocratic police department. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="counter-reform table" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/825064.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Counter-reforms of Alexander III.  Summary </h2><p>  The consequence of the domestic policy of Alexander Peacemaker was the relative stabilization of the country's internal political life.  But the desire for freedom and democracy did not fade away - it literally exploded in the vastness of Russia when the son of Alexander III, Nikolai II, came to power. </p>
