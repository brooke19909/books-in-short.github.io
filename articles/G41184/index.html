    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Sonesta Beach Resort and Casino is located in the famous Egyptian resort of Sharm El Sheikh, in its most beautiful bay and the same city district of <span>Naama Bay,</span> not only in the central part, but closer to the edge, but still there are no interesting places of entertainment and good shops more than 10-15 minutes of calm walking.  Next to the hotel, right along the coast, there is a promenade where you can walk, admiring the local beauties, or you can reach popular supermarkets among Russian tourists with fixed prices, for example, Karfur and Pyramids.  Opposite the hotel are McDonalds, a bank branch, cafes and bars.  The Old Town, attracting with its architecture and a large colorful market, is slightly less than 10 km.  You can get there by taxi, paying from $ 3, or on local buses.  For tourists, the ticket price is from $ 1, which must be negotiated with the driver when boarding.  The airport from the hotel is also quite close, about 7 km, which the transfer overcomes in 10 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  Pleasantly surprises and impresses with its chic territory Sonesta Beach Resort and Casino 5 *.  The photo below shows one of its green corners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sonesta Beach Resort and Casino reviews 2015" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1062297.jpg" width="530"></div>  The hotel covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 140,000 square meters.  Despite such an impressive size, the whole area is well-groomed, there are many green lawns, rockeries and flower beds with exotic cacti, blooming bougainvilleas, various palm trees, oleanders and other evergreen vegetation all year round.  Two entrances lead to the territory - the main and the additional.  Near the first is a building with a reception, next to a chain of stores where you can buy beach accessories, souvenirs and other Egyptian goods.  Immediately after the central building there are three restaurants: Citadel, Italian La Gondola and Indian Tandoori.  Further, turning along the central alley to the right, tourists get to two pools - a large adult and a small children's.  Following the same alley, you can get into another restaurant, ‚ÄúCasablanca‚Äù, which is very popular among vacationers.  A couple of tens of meters from it is a diving center, beach restaurant with a bar and everyone's favorite sea.  If you deviate from the central alley a little to the left and walk a little along the path paved with tiles, you can get into a small clinic.  If you move to the left from the central building of Sonesta Beach Resort and Casino, the alley will lead to numerous buildings, several swimming pools with spacious sun terraces, a kids club, sports grounds.  Entering the hotel through the second entrance, you can also get to three of the seven pools, the Byblos bar, the administrative building.  To the left of this entrance is a casino.  A little further - the restaurant "Le Dom".

Since then, the numbers have been updated several times.  The last innovation (partial) was carried out here in 2009, which somewhat affects the state of furniture and appliances.  The hotel was built in the design of the Egyptian village and consists of a central building, where there is only a reception service, and 32 two-story cottages, harmoniously arranged throughout the vast territory.  Their location depends on the view from the windows, proximity to the sea, swimming pools, restaurants, access to the central street of Naama Bay, the ability to sleep at night and, in some way, the security of your stay.  Of course, it is more comfortable to live in buildings closer to the center of the hotel.  To get a room in them, according to tourists, it is advisable for reception staff to present a present in the form of a sum of money (from $ 10).  The interior, functionality and quality of service do not depend on the location of the buildings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sonesta Beach Resort and Casino 5" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1062261.jpg" width="576"></div>
