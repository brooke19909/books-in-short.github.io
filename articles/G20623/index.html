  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crimean War</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Crimean War of 1853-1856 first developed as a Russian-Turkish war.  The subject of the struggle was dominance in the Middle East. </p><p>  The Crimean War, the reasons for which are associated with the growth of the national liberation movement in the Ottoman Empire and the apparent decline in the power of the Sultan, instead of asserting the autocracy, significantly undermined the internal and external authority of tsarism. </p><p>  <span>Nicholas 1</span> sought to intervene in the affairs of Turkey in order to prevent a bloody revolutionary outbreak.  In 1850, the government of Napoleon from Abdulmejid (Turkish Sultan) demanded to transmit to the Catholic clergy in Palestine "the keys to the Holy Sepulcher."  In this regard, Orthodox priests in Jerusalem turned to Nicholas 1 for help.  The Russian tsar sent Menshikov (his extraordinary ambassador) to Constantinople in 1853. </p><p>  Prince Menshikov in a rather ultimative form presented demands to the Turkish side.  He demanded that the Turkish Sultan recognize the patronage of Nicholas 1 over Orthodox subjects in Turkey.  Menshikov‚Äôs demands were rejected by the Sultan, who was supported by France and Great Britain. </p><p>  The Russian tsar, having recalled the ambassador from Turkey, gives the order to invade his troops in the Danube principalities.  In June 1853, on June 21, the Russian regiments, without encountering obstacles in their path, invaded the principalities that belonged nominally to the Sultan. </p><p>  The conflict was also facilitated by the fact that not a single European power was satisfied with the Russian reinforcement at the expense of the Turkish territories.  An incorrect assessment by the Russian tsar of the situation in the world led to the diplomatic isolation of Russia.  This determined the result of the upcoming military operations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Military operations began in 1853, on October 23, at the mouth of the Danube.  Late in the evening of November 28, a five-thousandth Turkish detachment attacked between Batum and Poti on the post of <span>St. Nicholas.</span>  This marked the beginning of hostilities in the Caucasus.  Here the position of the Russian troops was complicated.  The war was hindered by the resistance of the highlanders. </p><p>  On November 18, the <span>Sinope battle took place.</span>  The victory of the Russian fleet, commanded by Nakhimov, was brilliant.  Russian sailors, without losing a single vessel, sent the Turkish squadron to the bottom.  The commander of Osman Pasha was captured. </p><p>  The Crimean War continued with the entry into hostilities of France and Britain.  In 1853, December 23, the French and English squadrons, passing the Bosphorus, entered the Black Sea.  The Russian government, in turn, reacted by declaring war on France and Great Britain in 1854, on February 9. </p><p>  Throughout the year 1854, the French and English fleets launched several attacks in various directions to various ports of Russia. </p><p>  The Crimean War was quite fierce.  Menshikov commanded the Russian troops, who considered the landing of the enemy impossible in the Crimea.  At the turn <span>of the Alma River,</span> he was defeated, trying to stop the French and British.  He goes to Sevastopol, and then to Bakhchisarai. </p><p>  The Crimean War continued with the siege of Sevastopol.  The first bombardment was carried out in 1854, on October 5.  However, the city responded with gunfire.  The siege of Sevastopol began to drag out.  Reinforcements arrived from Russia.  Menshikov decided to hit the enemy in the rear, but was defeated on October 24 in the <span>battle of Inkerman.</span> </p><p>  In 1854, on December 28, a conference of the ambassadors of Russia, Austria, France, and Great Britain was held in Vienna.  The issues of peace were discussed.  However, no agreements were signed in connection with the death of Nicholas 1. <span>Alexander 2</span> did not dare to accept the terms and conditions. </p><p>  At the beginning of 1855, the Crimean War continues with Sardinia entering it.  Gorchakov, trying to weaken the onslaught on Sevastopol, attacked the enemy near the Chernaya River.  However, he was defeated, which ultimately predetermined the fall of the city. </p><p>  On August 7, Malakhov Kurgan was occupied. </p><p>  In 1855, in December, hostilities ceased on all fronts.  At the same time, peace talks resumed.  In late February 1856, the Paris Congress opened.  He completed his work on March 18 with the conclusion of the <span>Paris world.</span> </p>
