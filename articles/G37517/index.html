This is greatly helped by vegetables from felt.  Such a visual aid can be bought at the store, or you can make it yourself.  Today we will tell you how to sew various vegetables from felt, and give a few patterns for your creativity. </p><h2>  Flat shapes </h2><p>  A unique feature of felt is that it has two sides of the front.  Therefore, it is simply impossible to make a mistake here.  How to sew flat felt vegetables?  First you need to make a pattern.  It will be the easiest - you need to draw a contour of the vegetable.  The picture should be the most primitive, but recognizable.  For example, a carrot is a rectangle with a narrowed bottom edge, a potato may look like a big bean.  We draw a pattern on paper or cardboard and translate it to felt.  To draw on fabric is better with soap or chalk.  Every detail needs to be mirrored.  Circled, now cut out.  There are two ways to make flat figures.  The first is just to stitch the two mirror parts together.  Moreover, the seam should be the simplest, over the edge.  You can choose the threads in tone for this purpose, but you can use contrasting.  The second option is to stuff the products with a synthetic winterizer.  They will not be completely flat, but not voluminous.  The result is an averaged version that is nice to hold in your hands. </p><h2>  Give vegetables a personality </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="felt vegetables" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2110075.jpg"></div>  To add zest to the product, you need to add some details.  For example, vegetables and fruits made from felt can be worked with stitches.  When making carrots, do not forget to lay the longitudinal stripes on the product.  This will add similarities to a real vegetable.  And so that the toy does not look boring, it can be glued eyes, cheeks, nose and mouth.  Felt vegetables will look more interesting when they get a face.  And children are happy to participate in the manufacturing process.  Eyes for vegetables can be bought at the store, or can be cut from the same felt.  Cheeks can be drawn, or made from pieces of fabric.  The mouth should be embroidered with dark threads.  You are free to bring creativity into your work, because playing with unique toys is much more interesting for children than with typical solutions.

Voluminous vegetables from felt look more interesting, and they can be used not only as a visual aid for training, but also for playing, for example, in a store.  The manufacture of such products will require more time and effort, and material, respectively.  You need to sew vegetables from felt in bright colors, since the children like the pastel version less.  Keep in mind that children will play with your products more than once or twice.  So, it‚Äôs not worth gluing anything, all the details need to be sewn.

Vegetables from felt are sewed according to one analogy, only the complexity of the work is different.  Let's take an example of eggplant.  The "body" of our purple handsome man consists of 4 parts and the "crown" of two more.  We print the pattern attached above, or draw a similar one in its image and likeness.  Now we transfer all the details to the fabric and cut them out.  To start, we will sew all the purple parts.  We chop off two parts with safety pins.  Then we sew them along the edge.  We repeat this action 4 more times, and we get an elongated bag.  We turn the product and stuff it with a synthetic winterizer.  Attach a leaf on top. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY vegetables from felt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2110087.jpg"></div>  The final action is the sewing on of a round stub on the top of the eggplant.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vegetables from felt patterns" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2110090.jpg"></div>  We have already seen that sewing vegetables from felt with our own hands is not difficult at all.  You need to know the sequence of actions and work in stages.  Now let's look at how you can quickly and easily sew peas.  For this we need a green felt.  We draw two ovals on it.  You can do this without a pattern.  First, draw one oval, cut it out and circle it.  So you get two identical geometric shapes.  Repeat the operation several times.  As a result, we should get 4 ovals.  Now draw some circles.  They can be painted differently, the main thing is that the width coincides with the shape of the oval.  We cut everything out.  Sew the first pod seam forward with a needle and stuff it.  Now we begin to manufacture a more complex form.  We sew 2 circles together and stuff them.  Sew one side of the oval.  Sew our peas into a pod.  On both sides we sew an oval so that the peas look out a little.

    <h2>  Show fantasy </h2><p>  To make patterns of vegetables and fruits from felt is very simple.  In a primitive way we depict, for example, beets.  You need to draw a circle with an elongated nose.  It will be the body of our beauty.  We draw a leaf arbitrarily, but so that it at least looks a bit like the original.  Pattern is ready.  In this way, a whole field of felt products can be fantasized.  Patterns of the most common vegetables are attached to a niche. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="felt vegetables" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2110086.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In the manufacture of felt toys need to show imagination.  If all products are sewn simultaneously, then you should adhere to one style.  That is, you should not sew a tomato realistic, and attach eyes to a carrot.  The child must understand what is in front of him: a prototype of food or a toy.  After all, no parent wants his child to play with breakfast, instead of eating him.  And this can be the result if mom does not establish clear boundaries between reality and the game. </p><p>  If you want to develop fine motor skills in a child, then it can also be included in the manufacturing process of felt vegetables.  Even a five-year-old child will be able to sew the seam forward.  But how accurately he succeeds in it depends on the efforts of his parents.  Sewing is useful not only because this activity develops finger dexterity well, but also because it increases the child‚Äôs attention area, as well as his perseverance.  And children are indispensable in the creative process, because they come up with the most incredible ideas.  After all, not every parent will guess to sew two halves of carrots.  "What for?"  - you ask.  But half a carrot is much more convenient to plant on an imaginary bed, and it is easier to throw chopped vegetable into a toy pan.  Fasten two separate halves with Velcro.  Thus, it will be possible to play by breaking carrots and collecting them back. </p>
