    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Swissotel Sochi Kamelia Hotel is built on the front page of the sea and has its own beach.  This is very important because many hotels in the resort are located in the "stone jungle", and their customers have a lot of time to get to the coast.  And there are fewer free beaches in Sochi than we would like.  The hotel address is very simple: 89 Kurortny Prospekt. This is the main transport artery of Greater Sochi.  The airport can be reached in ten minutes by car.  The main building of the Swissotel was built in the thirties of the last century.  The cascade and sculptures of the pioneers still adorn a beautiful vast park, in which evergreen trees and a large number of camellias grow.  This flower gave the name to a five-star hotel.  A pompous grand staircase leads from Kurortny Prospekt to the main building.  And the other facade of the building faces the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Swissotel Camellia Sochi" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1309945.jpg" width="600"></div>
