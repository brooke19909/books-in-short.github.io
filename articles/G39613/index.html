Turn off the radio</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Radio point - this word refers to the usual wired radio, the socket for which you are likely to be able to find in your kitchen. </p><p>  Few people know that its main function is not to broadcast radio programs, but to alert residents of the city about emergency situations.  After all, a wired radio is autonomous from the main <span>electric networks</span> and can function with a total outage.  This important point allows you to use it to convey important information about potential threats.  Due to this fact, radio dots are required in residential premises.  Both old houses and new buildings - all of them are necessarily connected to a wired radio.  Without the presence of a radio point in each apartment, the state commission does not issue permission to <span>operate the house.</span>  But despite this, residents have the right to refuse to use it in their apartment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the radio in an apartment in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43719/1386254.jpg" width="395"></div>

    <p>  The choice of radio stations for broadcasting near a wired radio is small: Mayak, Radio Rossii, Says Moscow.  Radio stations on air from 6 am to midnight.  But for three holidays - New Year, Christmas and Easter, you can listen to the radio until 3.00. </p><h2>  Using Radio Points </h2><p>  As mentioned above, three radio stations are available for listening.  The well-known "Radio of Russia" broadcasts on sound frequencies and is available for the least functional radio receiver.  To be able to listen to the other two stations, you need an apparatus with an amplifier that works in the high-frequency range. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turn off the radio in the apartment in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/1386314.jpg" width="581"></div>

    <h2>  Worth thinking </h2><p>  In conclusion, one can focus on the fact that a radio point can sometimes be the only means of <span>warning the population</span> about an impending disaster, martial law, or a natural disaster.  In its absence, you can lose a very chance of salvation, however absurd it may sound in our peaceful everyday lives.  You should think about it well before writing a document to refuse the broadcasting service in your apartment.  Ultimately, a hundred rubles a month is not so noticeable loss to deprive yourself and your loved ones of the opportunity to avoid unforeseen danger because of it. </p>
