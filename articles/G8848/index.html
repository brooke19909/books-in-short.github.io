As indicated in ancient sources ("Descriptions of ancient Moscow", XVII century.), The river was full of water, with a fast flow, navigable.  The name Skhodnya (formerly Shooter) is of Slavic origin.  They went upstream (ascended) along it, it was the shortest way of crossing from the capital to the Vladimir-Suzdal principality.  They also went south towards Klyazma, and through it to the Oka and the Volga. </p><h2>  Relief, nutrition and glaciation </h2><p>  The Skhodnya river is typical flat in character.  Type of food - mixed, mainly replenishes water reserves due to snow.  In winter, the stream freezes (late November to early December).  It opens in March. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Tributaries </h2><p>  There are few tributaries by the river.  The largest left - p.  Rust, large right ones - Rozhdestvenka, Zhuravka, Goretovka.  In addition to rivers, streams are also considered tributaries of the Skhodny: Golenevsky, Boldov, Chernogryazhsky, etc. </p><h2>  River Rafting </h2><p>  Throughout its movement, Skhodnya is a river that cuts deep into a dense forest.  This natural feature has made water flow very popular for alloys.  It is known that the movement on rafts, boats and kayaks here took place even before the Great Patriotic War.  In our years, summer houses and cottages were built on both banks of the river, and the once untouched nature has become fully developed.  This factor repels modern lovers of wild tourism, and river trips do not occur as often as before. </p><h2>  Nature parks </h2><p>  Skhodnya is a river in the territory of which parks were equipped.  In order to preserve the diverse landscape of the region, the government of the Russian Federation decided to create natural monuments and reserves in this territory.  The largest environmental complex of the North-Western administrative district is the Tushkinskiy Natural Park.  The total area is 700 ha.  It was created in 1999. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
