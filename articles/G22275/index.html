Of course, the romantic image of the knights does not quite correspond to reality, but they, without a doubt, made a significant contribution to the development of history. </p>

In some countries there is still knighting.

    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  Chivalry originated in the ninth century AD.  The appearance of new soldiers was due to changes in the social and economic life of Europe.  Before that, kings used the militia for war.  The role of the professional army was performed by the retinue of feudal lords.  However, with the development of new methods of warfare, the need arose to create horse detachments.  Riders had a huge advantage over the infantry.  One rider was counted as ten on foot.  The first names of the knights of the Middle Ages are associated with the kingdom of the Franks.  <span>Karl Martell</span> was king of the Franks during the Arab invasion.  It was he who first decided to create new detachments of equestrian warriors from the nobility.  To do this, they are given land for rent or without it.  For this, the feudal lords undertake to serve in the army as elite soldiers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Warriors of christ </h2><p>  The names of the knights of the Middle Ages abound in French nationals.  The reason lies in the history of the first crusades.  By the twelfth century, chivalry was widespread in Europe.  Large feudal lords had many children.  However, all the property passed only to the eldest son.  The rest received weapons and became knights.  A huge number of trained warriors aroused concern among the rulers. </p>

    <p>  These fears were one of the reasons that led to the start of the crusade.  Gottfried de Bouillon - one of the most famous knights of that time.  He led a huge army and led him to Jerusalem. </p><p>  After the landing in Byzantium, negotiations began with the king of Constantinople.  Gottfried managed to persuade him to give the army access to the east.  Knights, monks, peasants, the poor, counts and barons all went to the Holy Land to find themselves.  But on the way to the cherished goal stood an impenetrable barrier - the fortress of Antioch.  The crusaders besieged the city and waited.  However, it was not possible to feed the huge army.  The soldiers robbed local lands, but this was still not enough. </p><h2>  Storming the fortress </h2><p>  A terrible famine soon began.  As follows from the annals of the time, there were even cases of cannibalism.  The year of the siege yielded nothing.  The city had a relatively normal environment with food and water.  Another famous knight, Raimund Toulouse, proposed to take Antioch by storm.  But Gottfried refused and decided to go for the trick.  With the help of Boemund Tarentsky, he managed to negotiate with the city gunsmith.  He, for unknown reasons, agreed to open the gate to the enemy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The assault on Antioch and subsequent events became one of the most epic acts of the crusaders. </p>

    <p>  The most famous knights of Europe fought side by side.  The German feudal lord Robert of Flanders burst into the city one of the first.  After bloody battles, the knights won.  However, at this time, the hundred thousandth army of the Saracens was already moving to the fortress.  Robert Norman, an English knight, proposed leaving the city.  But the Franks and Livonians decided to fight to the end.  Four days later, the first assault began. </p><p>  Emir Kerbogi outnumbered Europeans more than three times.  On the morning of June 28, 1098, the army of Christ left the city.  The first was Count Knight Robert of Flanders.  He dismounted and began to pray on the lap of the Lord.  Then the troops lined up, Raimund Azhilsky came forward.  The day before, he allegedly found a spear in the ramparts that pierced Jesus.  Having carried the relic in front of the soldiers, he made a fiery speech.  Then the most famous knights of the Middle Ages rushed into battle.  The names of the fallen in that battle entered the holy bull of Pope Urban II.  Inspired by the crusaders defeated three times the number of the enemy and won the battle.  Knight Boemund of Tarents became the new count of the defeated city. </p><h2>  Famous Knights of the Middle Ages: Names and Feats </h2><p>  Many knights after gaining wealth and influence became good politicians.  However, history remembered only those who showed themselves on the battlefield.  Of particular fame were the martyrs who fell in the battle, took the obviously losing campaign, and so on.  Sacrifice was quite in the spirit of medieval Christianity. </p><p>  One of these heroes was Balian the second Ibelin.  The French crusader lived in Jerusalem and was engaged in the expansion of possessions in the west.  However, peaceful life in the Promised Land was interrupted when the knight Rene de Chatillon decided to attack the Egyptian lands.  After that, Muslims began to gather a huge army to recapture the city. </p><h2>  The death of the troops </h2><p>  On July 4th they marched to the city, and the crusaders met them at Hattin.  Guy de Lusignan intended to defeat the Arabs with one powerful blow, but the cunning Salah ad-Din constantly retreated, exhausting the soldiers.  The names of the knights of the Middle Ages that have survived to this day are covered not only with glory, but also with shame.  Raymond Bac and Laodicius de Tiberias scared and fled to the Muslims. </p>

    <h2>  Defender of the Kingdom of Heaven </h2><p>  Ballyan Ibelin managed to escape captivity and return to Jerusalem.  After that, the troops of Salah ad-Din approached the city.  The siege began, and Balian led the garrison.  At that time in Jerusalem there were only fourteen knights. </p>

The names of the knights of the Middle Ages, the list of which increased to sixty, went down in history forever.  The next six days, the Saracens stormed the city, but to no avail.  Despite the overwhelming majority, they were not able to take the city; Christians were able to turn it in under favorable conditions.  Everyone was given the right to leave the city.  The tomb of the Lord remained under the personal protection of Salah ad-Din.
