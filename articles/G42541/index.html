    <p>  Handicap 0, like others, helps to describe in more detail possible events during a sports competition, so you can bet not only on the probability of victory, but also on the number of goals, sets, points and other things.  Thanks to these conditions, bookmakers manage to lure a larger number of fans and give everyone the opportunity to try their luck, even if the likelihood of winning a favorite team tends to zero against the backdrop of a fight with a more serious opponent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What are they </h2><p>  Well, now we‚Äôll try to figure out what the Handicap 0, Handicap 1, and other most common hedges mean, or what handicaps are used to call them in the gambling world. </p><p>  Suppose you bet on a positive Forum +1 and hope that Team A will win. In the final score, your favorite has a draw, but you have a positive handicap of +1 in reserve, so one more goal is added to the final points of participant A, and as a result you win.  Similar manipulations are accepted with a big run of points - +2, +3 and further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="handicap 0" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/745600.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If in the bookmaker you decided to bet with a negative Handicap, then the score will be slightly different.  You place a handicap in increments of -2 on your favorite team.  And this means that two units are taken away from the number of goals scored by her.  And if under such conditions the favorite's advantage is still observed, then you get money from the bet. </p><p>  Do not be scared, Handicap 0 is much simpler in its understanding.  Although, as we see, positive and negative handicaps for bookmakers will not be difficult to confuse the fans. </p><h2>  Handicap 0 - what is it, finally, what is it? </h2><p>  Beginning fans often make a lot of mistakes, so they do not fully understand the order of betting and do not find the proper answer in the search for the necessary information.  In modern sources, you can find a lot of techniques for the definition of the concept of Handicap 0, which is both a positive and a negative handicap, and even a lot of other things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what does handicap mean 0" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/745599.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Let us return to the historical meaning of the term.  Handicap is called either the predominant or the missing number of points of one team in relation to another.  Therefore, what does the handicap 0 mean?  That's right, this is such a handicap that allows the favorite of the fan to draw and at the same time bring his follower profit for such an outcome of the match.  Although it‚Äôs hard to call it earnings, with an equal result between the rivals the bookmaker of the zero-odds supporter only returns the nominal volume of the bet. </p><h2>  Victory with Forea 0 by example </h2><p>  Surprisingly, the zero handicap is the most popular among sports betting lovers.  It is especially often used if two opponents of relatively equal strength meet in a duel, and you either earn money when your favorite wins, or you get a refund of the bet as a result of a draw.  In this case, of course, if the advantage of the points is on the side of the enemy, you will be left without money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="victory with handicap 0" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/745598.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, a zero handicap can be both positive and negative, as we discussed at the beginning of this article.  On the rating table, this rate will look something like this -  0 (+1). </p><p>  So, we clarify for ourselves: Handicap 0 - what is it?  This is an ordinary positive or negative handicap, which allows you to draw your own money back in a draw.  As you can see, nothing complicated. </p><p>  Using the promised example, it will look as follows.  You bet on team A with a handicap F 0 (+1), while she loses with a score of 1: 2.  Do not forget about the unit point to the zero handicap, so we add another point in favor of team A and get a score of 2: 2, which indicates the promised equality and the return of the nominal amount of the bet. </p>
