  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is 3g: understanding the network on a human scale</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For a long time, everyone forgot about 2G, now the 3g network has become the access standard.  What is it?  A small device?  Partly yes, but the essence of the access system to mobile communications and the Internet is much more complicated. </p><p>  <strong>Device</strong> </p><p>  Just five years ago, the 3G device was much larger than the current ‚Äúprototypes‚Äù and looked like a cell phone.  It provides high-speed access not only to the Internet, but also to radio waves, to mobile communications.  It allows you to use the communication mobile, but not stationary, as it was before.  Wires are a thing of the past. </p><p>  <strong>Signal</strong> </p><p>  The answer to the question of what 3g is not limited to the consideration and description of this device.  To maintain such a high-speed connection, such a powerful <span>data transmission</span> over the network is also necessary - data transmission over broadband networks allowed achieving such an effect. </p><p>  <strong>Features</strong> </p><p>  Multimedia services, including those in the <span>global network,</span> have become the prerogative of using the 3G <span>network.</span>  This is where the people mentioned 3G as a third-generation connection.  It allows you to not just communicate, but to communicate in a new form - video.  We now hear our interlocutor and see him.  And if we all already know how this works on the Internet, then how is this manifested in mobile communications?  Using a videophone! .. This is truly a breakthrough in mobile technology!  And now, with the new models of cell phones, everyone can go online, watch movies, and TV shows. </p><p>  Another feature that reveals the answer to the question of what 3g is, is the ability to stay in constant online mode.  At the same time, the form of payment and units of measurement have changed.  If you previously paid for the time spent in the network, then in 3g format the amount of information received (and transmitted too) is paid. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among other features of the new communication format: international roaming, support for several operators, communication with the satellite, speed up to 2 Mbit per second. </p><p>  All this is made possible by the continuous transmission of data in the decimeter range.  So far, nothing more powerful and global has been invented. </p><p>  <strong>Quality standard</strong> </p><p>  What is 3g as a term?  This concept speaks not only about high speeds, but is also used to describe the high quality of the connection provided: sound, video, multimedia.  To achieve this result, manufacturers were forced to follow international standards and technical requirements (UTI).  The recommendations come down to the features of using the 3g generation frequency spectrum: achieving increased efficiency, capacity and speed from 144 kbps (when driving, for example, in a car, the speed of which can reach 120 km per hour) up to 2 Mbit per second (when still). </p><p>  What does 3g mean for the user, in addition to high-speed Internet access?  The third generation will be appreciated by <span>corporate clients,</span> using conference calls and remote access to their database (wirelessly and from anywhere).  Many people have already appreciated the equally unique service - this is the ability to pay for services via telephone (the so-called mobile bank), thanks to which there is no need to look for a terminal or bank branch. </p><p>  <strong>3G Spread</strong> </p><p>  The Russians learned about what 3g is not so long ago.  The introduction of the latest technologies in mobile communications (in all senses of this term) took a lot of time - 10 years.  At first, the 3G network was widely used in Japan, then in the countries of Asia, in the USA and, finally, it came to the operators of Europe. </p><p>  3G network is a complex data transmission system, including a ‚Äúreceiver‚Äù of signals: radio waves, transmissions of mobile operators, <span>global Internet.</span>  They have high hopes for 3G: developing it, it will be possible to create a global mobile network, to unite all operators.  But if the network will exist under different protocols (there are 2 today), then the final, ‚Äúrainbow‚Äù goal will not be achieved ... </p>
