    <p>  The future head of the Russian government came from a very noble noble family, which was known since the end of the XVI century.  For example, the grandmother of the famous poet Mikhail Lermontov as a girl was Stolypin.  The state senator of the first half of the 19th century A. A. Stolypin was the great-grandfather of our hero.  Peter's father was a friend of the writer Leo Tolstoy, and his mother was the native niece of Chancellor A. Gorchakov, a classmate of Alexander Pushkin in his lyceum years.  As you can see, Pyotr Arkadievich was born in a very respected family, whose members made acquaintance with the most famous people of the empire. </p><p>  <strong>Peter Stolypin.</strong>  <strong>Short biography: childhood and adolescence</strong> </p>

The boy spent the first years of his life in the family estate of Srednikovo.  Later the family moved to Lithuania, and then to Oryol.  It was in Orel that the young man began his studies at a local gymnasium.  After graduation, Petersburg University was chosen to continue education.  In 1885, the young man graduated from the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics and entered his first public service at the Ministry of Agriculture.

Later, Pyotr Arkadievich became the governor of this region.  In 1903, a transfer to Saratov took place, where Peter Stolypin received the same position.  A short biography, unfortunately, with its own limited framework does not make it possible to consider in detail his activities as governor of two regions.  However, it is important to mention that this activity forced the attention of Moscow officials of the highest rank to draw attention to him.  And already in 1906, the personality of Peter Arkadyevich was considered by the emperor himself as the main contender for the post of Minister of Internal Affairs of the country.

    <p>  <strong>P.A. Stolypin.</strong>  <strong>Short biography: reform activity</strong> </p><p>  Reforms of the initiative first minister, launched since 1906, covered several areas.  Thus, industry reform was designed to bring workers and business owners to a consensus on labor days, pay, hiring workers, accident insurance and so on.  However, the irreconcilable and diametrically opposite positions of both sides did not allow the reform to take place.  Peter Arkadievich paid important attention to the <span>national issue of the</span> motley empire.  According to his initiative, it was proposed to create a special ministry that would study the relevant issues in the country and resolve them.  Unfortunately, such a ministry was not created before his death.  However, the most important and famous <span>reform of Stolypin</span> was agrarian.  It was called, firstly, to create a strong layer of peasants independent of the community that would become an effective pillar of the country's agriculture, and secondly, to motivate these peasants to populate the vast expanses of annexed Siberia.  <span>This reform</span> really began to give good results during the life of the minister, but was interrupted by the sudden death of the initiator.  In September 1911, P. A. Stolypin, being in one of the Kiev theaters, was mortally wounded by one of the agents of the tsarist Security Department. </p>
