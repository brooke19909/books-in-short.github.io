    <h2>  How can I use the "Autophone"? </h2><p>  You can use the device in various ways.  Firstly, with the help of "Autofon" you can quickly track the movement of a stolen car.  Secondly, by activating "Autophone", the reviews of many owners of this device confirm the corresponding possibility, it is convenient to fix the coordinates of a vehicle during the trip - for example, a friends car that moves along a different route.  Thirdly, the device in question can be used to determine the location, in principle, of any object - it does not have to be a vehicle.  You can, for example, put the device in a backpack and use it to transfer the coordinates of its owner, who travels somewhere outside the city, along the river, in the forest, in the mountains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Autophone-Thermo </h2><p>  Note that the brand "Autophone" produces not only devices involving the use <span>of satellite</span> navigation systems.  Among other notable products of this company is the Autofon-Thermo device.  Reviews about this device are also numerous and characterize it quite fully.  Avtofon-Thermo is a device for remote control of the pre-heater using GSM channels.  The user can thus activate the corresponding device via SMS commands, through the voice menu or by activating a button located in the car interior.  The device is equipped with a clock and a timer that allows you to start the pre-heater at a convenient time for the car owner and day of the week.  Both devices: Avtofon-Termo and GPS-beacon, issued by the corresponding brand, are in great demand among Russian motorists. </p>

    <h2>  Features "Autofon" </h2><p>  Let us consider in more detail what capabilities the GPS-lighthouse Avtofon has.  User reviews characterize the device as sufficiently functional.  This is probably due to the fact that it has a fairly wide range of capabilities.  Namely: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - data transmission using GSM channels in the conditions of a muffled GPS signal; </p><p>  - functioning in an autonomous mode - from batteries, within 2 years; </p><p>  - support for audio monitoring function; </p><p>  - the ability to use an accelerometer that allows you to record the beginning of the movement of a car or other object on which the device is located; </p><p>  - The use of heat-resistant SIM-card in the kit. </p><p>  It can also be noted that the ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù, the reviews of the owners of the device confirm this, it has a sufficiently high sensitivity even to reflected GPS signals, which makes it possible to use it in conditions where the sky is not in direct visibility relative to the location of the device‚Äôs antenna.  The device in question is mainly focused on civilian use, but is often also used by government agencies. </p><h2>  Modifications </h2><p>  There are several modifications of the ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù.  The most common models of the device: E, S, as well as GL.  The full name of the device may sound like ‚ÄúAutophone S-Beacon‚Äù.  What is the difference? </p><p>  First of all, satellite technology support.  So, devices E and S can only receive signals from GPS satellites.  In turn, GL-beacons also support the Russian GLONASS standard and operate by combining the signals of this positioning system and GPS. </p>

    <p>  The next criterion for the differences between the considered device models is the support of the function of interaction with the monitoring server, which involves the use of GPRS technology.  Support the corresponding option "Auto" type S and GL.  In turn, E-beacons are not compatible with this function. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The next aspect of the differences in the capabilities of the considered devices is the accuracy of determining the coordinates.  The leaders here are "Autophone" type GL.  They have an accuracy of 2.5 meters.  The indicator for devices of type E and S is 5 meters.  How significant can this difference be in practice? </p><h2>  Does coordinate accuracy matter? </h2><p>  As many reviews testify, the Avtofon as a whole is capable of solving assigned tasks, even if its accuracy does not exceed 5 meters.  However, if we are talking about narrow areas of application of the device - for example, as a tool for determining the geographical coordinates of expedition participants, backpackers - additional accuracy will not hurt.  It happens that a person traveling in nature needs a very accurate local orientation to determine the optimal route for further movement - a tree, hill or path.  His friends will be able to help him discover this or that object, having at the disposal of a map, only if they will know the most exact location of the traveler. </p><h2>  Which devices support A-GPS? </h2><p>  The next criterion for differences between different versions of the device in question is support for the A-GPS standard, which assumes the determination of coordinates in a more operational mode than using a conventional channel.  According to reviews, Avtofon, compatible with the corresponding technology, is extremely convenient to use.  Thus, they support A-GPS standard devices in modification S. Devices E and GL are not compatible with this technology. </p><p>  It can also be noted that the listed modifications also differ by such criteria as support for external power cards and additional extensions.  Compatible with these options "Autophones" in versions S and GL. </p><p>  The considered modifications of the device also differ in cost.  The most expensive ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù is in the GL version, cheaper is the E-Lighthouse, the most affordable one is in the S modification. </p>

    <p>  Of course, there are a large number of other versions of the device - such as, for example, "Autophone D", reviews of which are also very common.  What are its features?  It can be noted that the corresponding type of ‚ÄúAutophone D-Mayak‚Äù (reviews of many users about it are especially positive due to the presence of additional functions) has an RF tag designed to identify the owner of the device. </p><p>  There are other notable modifications to the device.  So, for example, ‚ÄúAutophone SE-Mayak‚Äù, reviews about which are also often found, is characterized by reduced power consumption.  The device comes with a sealed enclosure.  There is an ‚ÄúAutophone SE + Lighthouse‚Äù, which is equipped with modules for making external connections to the device.  In particular, to use external power adapters.  The delivery set also has a sealed enclosure. </p><p>  Another ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù - ‚ÄúDialog-Lighthouse‚Äù (reviews about this device are especially positive considering its functions) has a wireless relay with which you can lock the device. </p>

    <h2>  What is common between different versions of "Autophone"? </h2><p>  At the same time, there are a number of characteristics relevant to all modifications of the device.  So, all types of ‚ÄúAutofon‚Äù, be it E, S, D or ‚ÄúAutofon SE‚Äù (user reviews are very positive regarding this aspect), involve the use of 2 lithium batteries of the CR123A type, with a resource of 1.5 Ah.  The dimensions of the devices are also generally the same.  The length of the ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù is 70 mm, the width is 51 mm, and the thickness is 21 mm.  In all modifications, an accelerometer, as well as a microphone, are built-in, as we noted above, to control the balance on the account of the mobile operator with a SIM card, as well as to monitor the battery level.  In devices, you can use the security function using a pin code.  Among other notable options: sending a link to the card via SMS, having a watch, the ability to remotely control the device via SMS, as well as through mobile applications for iOS and Android. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  Now let‚Äôs take a closer look at what users say about the Avtofon device.  The feedback from the owners of the device can be classified into the following main categories: </p><p>  - those that reflect opinions regarding its effectiveness; </p><p>  - those that contain an assessment of the convenience of setting up and controlling the device; </p><p>  - those that reflect opinions regarding the functionality of the device. </p><p>  We will study them in more detail. </p><h2>  Performance Reviews </h2><p>  What do users think about the effectiveness of such a device as the GPS-beacon Avtofon?  The feedback from the owners of this device is very positive in terms of successful precedents for its use.  The fact is that the ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù can fully perform its functions only if there are no factors hindering its work in the environment of the device.  So, for example, car thieves can use various ‚Äújammers‚Äù that make it impossible for AutoPhone to transmit the coordinates of the corresponding object via a satellite channel or communication using the resources of mobile operators.  If the illegal action is committed without the use of ‚Äújammers‚Äù by the intruder, the device will really work correctly and will allow you to calculate the location of the car. </p>

    <p>  There are possible, as noted by users, situations in which in the environment surrounding the object on which the "Autophone" is located, other interference occurs - for example, due to the operation of other devices using certain radio channels.  In this case, its effectiveness may not be the most optimal.  As for the use of "Autofon" in other modes, for example, to facilitate the interaction of travelers on different routes, the functioning of the device as a whole does not cause complaints from users.  The usefulness and effectiveness of "Autofon" in the relevant scenarios of its use are noted. </p><h2>  Convenience Reviews </h2><p>  Do users find a device such as Avtofon-Mayak comfortable enough?  Feedback from the owners of the device in this aspect is positive.  Setting up the ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù does not imply any difficulties, as well as using the device.  For this, the owner of the device can use, in particular, a convenient mobile application.  There are not too many private nuances of using the device, predetermined by the specifics of its modification.  So, if a person has experience using the ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù in version E, then, judging by the reviews, he will easily master the use of the SE modification. </p><h2>  Functionality Reviews </h2><p>  The next aspect of the reviews about the device in question is those that reflect the opinions of users regarding the functionality of the device.  As we noted above, the capabilities of the device depend on its specific modification.  In this sense, the functionality of devices in different versions can vary significantly.  We can say that users evaluate the capabilities of the device in two aspects - the ratio of the price of a particular modification of the device and its functions, as well as the evaluation of those options that are presented in each version of the ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù.  Owners of the lighthouse sufficiently positively assess the combination of the cost of specific modifications and their functions, believing that the overpayment for certain options - if you compare different versions of the "Autophone", is generally justified. </p><p>  As for the capabilities present in all types of devices, their list is rated by users as quite relevant from the point of view of the needs of a modern car enthusiast, traveler, entrepreneur - any person who can use the Autofon.  In general, regardless of the specific modification, be it E, S, D or, for example, Avtofon-SE, user reviews regarding the capabilities, prices and effectiveness of the device are positive and reflect the successful experience of using options implemented by the manufacturer. </p>
