Children's crafts from plasticine</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Plasticine molding is a very useful and fascinating activity for both children and adults.  The process of creating sculptural images calms the nerves, because there are many nerve endings at the fingertips, and a massage is applied by pressing on the clay, which has a beneficial effect on the whole body.  So if the baby asks you: ‚ÄúDad, we sculpt animals from plasticine?‚Äù, Then do not refuse him, but take up the process together. </p><p>  For a child, the benefits of sculpting are also obvious.  Kneading the elastic mass, the baby develops the strength of the muscles of the fingers and hands, which he will soon need at school when writing.  When a child sculpts an object, he better understands its structure, the shape of the object.  Attention, memory, imagination and imagination, <span>orientation in space, the</span> ability to count and distinguish the size of objects are developing.  You can list useful skills for a long time. </p><p>  In the article we will tell you <span>how to make animals from plasticine,</span> what modeling methods you need to know in order for the work to turn out interesting and similar to the samples given in the photographs in the article.  So, we sculpt from clay of animals. </p><h2>  Pig with piglets </h2><p>  To work on these figures you need to roll two balls in your hands.  One should be small in size for the head, the other larger for the body.  On the head with a sharp object, for example, the tip of a pencil, two dents for the eyes are pressed through, a patch is attached.  To make it, you need to roll a piece of plasticine into a ball, then flatten it a little.  After attaching from the front to the head on the patch, two holes are pressed through. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pig with piglets" class="if uuid-2405316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2405316.jpg"></div><p>  We sculpt from plasticine animals further.  The tail of the pigs is made of thin, rolled sticks, twisting.  The legs of these animals are quite large, so you can make four small, but thick sticks.  Hooves can be made in a different color or dented as in the photograph in the article.  It remains to create triangular ears and, after attaching them to the pig‚Äôs head, bend forward a little. </p><h2>  Hedgehog with an apple </h2><p>  Blinding a hedgehog from plasticine is a painstaking task, because the animal needs to create a huge number of needles.  Work begins on the character from the torso.  On this sample, the head merges with the stomach, so for the whole body you will need one piece rolled into a ball.  Then the line of separation of the head from the body is pressed inward.  The dent is barely noticeable.  On the head of a hedgehog, a pointed muzzle is pulled out of plasticine by indentation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine hedgehog" class="if uuid-2405280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2405280.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, you need to make pens with fingers and round feet with pink heels.  The contours of the mouth are drawn in a stack, and the eyes are pushed through the shaft.  The main work is on the manufacture of brown needles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  They are placed alternately on the back of the animal.  On top of the head, the needles are larger, it turns out something like a forelock.  At the end we sculpt an apple and put it on needles.  Children's plasticine crafts ready! </p><h2>  Rainbow hedgehog with flower </h2><p>  The next sample of the hedgehog is made not quite usual.  Multi-colored needles show the true feelings of the beast, who is clearly in love and gives his love flower.  A boy can blind a girl such a figure, hinting to her about his attitude. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hedgehog in love" class="if uuid-2405291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2405291.jpg"></div><p>  Methods and techniques of modeling are identical to the previous version, the difference lies in the setting of the hands and the thickness of the needles.  Colors change on thorns in layers, in rows.  Flower petals have the same shades. </p><h2>  How to mold a dog from plasticine? </h2><p>  How to sculpt a dog depends on the position of the body of the beast.  If the dog is sitting, his hind legs are sculpted in two parts.  Need a thigh from a circle, stuck to the side of the body, and a foot, represented either by a ball or oval.  The body has an elongated shape, which extends downward.  The front legs of a sitting dog can be made of thin sticks that expand at the ends.  Claws are cut by pressing stacks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sculpt a dog" class="if uuid-2405277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2405277.jpg"></div><p>  The shape of the dog‚Äôs head depends on the breed.  There are rounded, sharp, rectangular noses.  A black ball must be present at the tip. </p><p>  If we sculpt animals from plasticine (as in the photo above), then the dog on the right will be the most difficult manufacturing option.  After all, to create an animal lying on the floor, you will need to mold many thin and long sticks depicting the fur of an animal.  The process is long, time-consuming, but such a children's plasticine craft looks very impressive.  Tongue is molded from pink plasticine at the end of the muzzle.  The nose and eyes are represented by balls of black color.  The muzzle is stretched forward, and the legs lie along the body.  It can be seen that the dog is resting and completely relaxed.  The ears of all dogs are located in different ways.  If they were simply omitted from the poodle, then the central doggie in the photo raised them fervently.  On a dog with long hair, ears are made using more thin sticks. </p><p>  The tail of the dogs also conveys their mood.  The poodle sits quietly, so its tail just lies on the floor.  The average dog is made playful, the tail betrays its mood, as it is raised up.  So, now you know <span>how to mold a dog from plasticine.</span> </p><h2>  Penguin on the ice </h2><p>  The next step-by-step photo clearly shows what shape you need to create blanks to make a penguin.  Parts are assembled in turn, as they are located on the first frame.  First, a large ball of the body sits on its paws.  Then the wings are attached and the head is placed on top. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine penguin" class="if uuid-2405308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2405308.jpg"></div><p>  Then work on small details takes place.  Attached is a white "pancake" on the stomach.  Eyes are collected from large white and small black balls.  It remains to attach a long orange beak and put the penguin on a blue ice floe. </p><h2>  Plasticine bird </h2><p>  To mold a bird, you need to make two main details.  This is a round head and an elongated torso.  The tail can be blinded separately, but most often it is made by pulling it from the body.  At the end, the tail feathers expand.  Wings can be created in a contrasting color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="insidetheartisan.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bird pecks grains" class="if uuid-2405299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2405299.jpg"></div><p>  Both wings and tail are made by drawing small strips in a stack.  The beak is made of black or brown mass.  First, the ball rolls, then one side is pulled forward and the tip is sharpened.  The eyes are made of two small breasts rolled out by balls.  Since the bird sits on its stomach, the legs can not be sculpted. </p><h2>  Cute bunny </h2><p>  <span>A plasticine hare is</span> molded of any color.  Both the head and the body have the same shape, differ only in size.  The ears of the animal are long, so you first need to blind the sticks, and then place them on the top of the head.  They can be flattened and made slightly thickened from above, or you can bend one ear in half. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to mold a bunny" class="if uuid-2405286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2405286.jpg"></div><p>  The paws are sculpted in different sizes.  The arms are long, and the legs are made round and small.  Claws are cut using stacks.  Decorate crafts with a bow or flowers.  The nose is highlighted in a different color. </p><h2>  Teddy bear </h2><p>  To mold a formidable predator of our forests from plasticine, you need to take a brown mass and divide it into several parts.  The head is created from a small breast by rolling the ball.  A slightly elongated nose is attached to the front of the muzzle with a black dot at the end.  The mouth is pushed by the stack.  The ears of the bear are semicircular.  They must first be rolled out with a ball, then flattened with your fingers and pressed down from the bottom, making it flat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine bear" class="if uuid-2406186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2406186.jpg"></div><p>  Then on the head will only attach eyes.  The body is oval-shaped plasticine, the arms and legs are smeared so that the joints are not visible.  The heels on the paws are made of light mass in the form of "pancakes". </p><p>  The article describes only a few options for creating figures of animals and <span>birds from plasticine.</span>  If you need to make other animals, use the same modeling methods.  They are identical to those described above.  Good luck in your work! </p>
