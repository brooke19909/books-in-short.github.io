Existing on one planet, plants and animals were forced to learn to coexist with each other.  The relationship between organisms is a difficult but interesting topic that will help to better understand the world. </p><h2>  Relationship Types </h2><p>  There are various types of relationships between <span>living organisms</span> .  But scientists divide them into three large groups. </p>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The second group includes those types of relationships that are called negative.  As a result of the interaction of two organisms, only one benefits, and the second is inhibited.  Sometimes the latter may even die as a result of such a relationship.  This group also includes such an interaction of organisms that negatively affects both the first and second individuals. </p><p>  The third group is considered the smallest.  This group includes relationships between organisms that do not bring either benefit or harm to both sides. </p><h2>  Positive types of relationships between organisms </h2><p>  In order to exist in the world, you need to find allies and helpers.  This is exactly what many plants and animals do during their evolutionary development.  As a result, relationships emerge, both sides of which benefit from the relationship.  Or, those relationships that are beneficial only to one side, and they do not harm the other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Positive relationships, also called symbiosis, are diverse.

    <p>  Cooperation is such a relationship between living organisms when both sides benefit.  Most often, this benefit lies in the extraction of food.  But sometimes one of the parties receives from the other not only food, but also protection.  Such relationships between organisms are very interesting.  Examples can be seen in the animal kingdom in different parts of the planet. </p><p>  One of them is the cooperation of hermit cancer and sea anemone.  Thanks to sea anemone, cancer gains shelter and protection from other inhabitants of the body of water.  Without hermit crab, anemone cannot move.  But cancer allows you to expand your food search radius.  In addition, that which does not eat sea anemone will go down to the bottom and get the cancer.  This means that both parties benefit from these relations. </p><p>  Another example is the relationship between rhinos and oxen birds.  Such relationships between organisms allow one of the parties to find food.  Cowbirds eat insects that live in abundance on a huge rhino.  Rhino is also useful neighbors.  Thanks to these birds, he can lead a healthy life and not worry about insects. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Commensalism </h2><p>  Commensalism is the relationship between organisms in ecosystems, when one of the organisms benefits, and the second does not experience inconvenience from these relations, but also does not benefit.  This type of relationship is also called parasite. </p>

But for fish-sticking, they become a chance to survive and protect themselves from other aquatic predators that are weak compared to sharks.  Adhesive fish benefit from sharks.  But they themselves do not bring them any benefit.  At the same time, there is no harm.  For a shark, such a relationship goes unnoticed.

    <p>  In the burrows of rodents you can find not only cubs, but also a huge number of different insects.  Nora, created by the animal, becomes their home.  It is here that they find not only shelter, but also protection from those animals that love to feast on them.  In the burrow of a rodent, an insect is not afraid.  In addition, here they can find enough food to lead a life without troubles.  Rodents do not experience any difficulties from such types of relationships. </p><h2>  Negative types of relationships between organisms </h2><p>  Existing together on the planet, animals can not only help each other, but also cause harm.  It is not easy to learn these relationships between organisms.  The table will help schoolchildren and students. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Types of relationships that are considered negative, in turn, are also divided into several types.  Among them there are those from which one side benefits and the other harms, and there are those when both sides suffer.  Negative examples are predation, parasitism and competition. </p><h2>  Predation </h2>

    <p>  What is predation, everyone can tell without preparation.  This is the relationship between organisms when one side benefits and the other suffers.  In order to better understand who eats who, you can make <span>food chains.</span>  And then it is easy to find out that many herbivores become food for other animals.  At the same time, predators can also be someone else's food. </p><p>  Despite the fact that hedgehogs are often depicted in pictures with apples and mushrooms, they are predators.  Hedgehogs feed on small rodents.  But they also cannot feel safe.  They can be eaten by foxes.  In addition, foxes, like wolves, feed on hares. </p><h2>  Parasitism </h2><p>  Parasitism is that type of relationship when one organism benefits from another.  But at the same time, the parasite most often tries to make sure that the second organism does not die.  Indeed, otherwise the parasite will have to look for a new habitat and a new source of food.  Or perish. </p>

For example, almost every inhabitant of the middle strip saw a <span>fungus tinder fungus.</span>  This is such a living organism, which is conveniently arranged on a tree trunk and sometimes grows to incredible sizes.  This mushroom is not so easy to remove from the trunk.  It is fixed very securely.  Thanks to the tree, the mushroom receives food, as well as a place of residence.

    <p>  There are a huge number of worms that live off a stronger organism with a complex organization.  Perhaps the most famous parasite worm is <span>human</span> roundworm <span>.</span>  White worms can be of different sizes.  They live not only in the intestines.  In especially advanced cases, they can find shelter in different parts of the body.  Thanks to man, roundworms always have food.  In addition, the temperature in the human body and the conditions necessary for the worms to exist safely and multiply.  The presence of a large number of roundworms in the human body causes inconvenience, as well as many problems that only a doctor can solve. </p><p>  In the bodies of other animals, parasitic worms also often settle.  Among them, for example, <span>liver flukes.</span>  Such a relationship between organisms becomes a real disaster for people.  And especially for those involved in animal husbandry or gardening.  The damage caused to agriculture by parasites is immeasurable. </p><h2>  Competition </h2>

    <p>  Despite bloodthirsty predators hunting for weaker animals day and night, competition is considered the most fierce type of relationship between organisms.  After all, such is the struggle for a place under the sun among representatives of one species.  And each species has its own means for obtaining the necessary amount of food or better housing. </p><p>  Stronger and dexterous animals win in the fight.  Strong wolves get good prey, while others have to either eat other, less satisfying animals, or die of hunger.  A similar struggle is waged between plants to get as much moisture or sunlight as possible. </p><h2>  Neutral relationship </h2>

Despite the fact that they live in the same territory, nothing at all unites them.  If one of the sides of this relationship disappears from the face of the planet, then this will not directly affect the second side.

    <p>  So, in warm countries, different herbivores feed on leaves of the same tree.  Giraffes eat those leaves that are on top.  They are the most juicy and delicious.  And other herbivores are forced to eat leftovers growing lower.  Giraffes do not interfere with them and do not take away food.  After all, low animals will not be able to reach those leaves that eat high.  And high there is no point in bending down and taking food from others. </p><p>  There are different forms of relationships between organisms.  And to learn them all is not so simple.  But it is important to remember that everything in nature is interconnected.  Most often, animals and plants affect each other positively or negatively, less often do not affect.  But even if they are not directly connected, this does not mean that the disappearance of one cannot lead to the death of the other.  The relationship between organisms is an important part of the world. </p>
