Ayia Napa is located on the west coast of the island of Cyprus.  Its many bars, discos, rock concerts, dance floors, <span>foam parties</span> today are worthy of competition to the resort number 1 of the same profile (the Spanish island of Ibiza). </p><p>  The bulk of vacationers in this famous Cypriot resort are Europeans aged 17 to 25 years.  Accordingly, even tourists ‚Äúafter thirty‚Äù will feel slightly ‚Äúout of place‚Äù here.  For this age, the international resort business has created other resorts, for example Lloret del Mar (Spain) or Marmaris (Turkey), where young people are more likely to perceive people aged 30-35. </p><h2>  Climate and features of the resort </h2><p>  Ayia Napa is considered one of the best Mediterranean resorts in climate and ecology (all its beaches are awarded with ‚Äúblue flags‚Äù).  ‚ÄúHoly Forest‚Äù is characterized by hot summers and rainy weather.  The holiday season here usually lasts from late April to late November.  However, the height of it, the so-called high season, falls on the summer months.  Therefore, tours to hotels at this time are bought up in 3-4 months, like hot cakes.  It is time to hesitate, and the long-awaited vacation will be frustrated. </p>

    <p>  The hotel complex offers rental bicycles; for leisure residents they are fully equipped with free billiard tables. </p><p>  For tourists traveling with children, it is important that the hotel has its own children's infrastructure: </p><ul><li>  a platform for games; </li><li>  separate safe pool, specially equipped for small spa guests; </li><li>  comfortable children's places in the restaurant. </li></ul><p>  Living in the apartment, the family can additionally and free of charge get a cot. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of guests of the Androthea Hotel Apartments 3 *, a good and solid beach vacation was initially guaranteed to all vacationers in Ayia Napa.  You must admit that the world-class entertainment infrastructure and some of the best beaches in the world are a good guarantee.  Therefore, the tourists of Ayia Napa try not only to relax on the nearest beach, awarded the "blue flag", but to taste something special. </p><p>  Perhaps that‚Äôs why they recommend: ‚ÄúBe sure to visit the Nissi Beach at least once!‚Äù  And they are right, because Nissi is not just a beach, it is a cheerful, bright, sparkling holiday with crystal clear turquoise sea and white sand, alleys of chic royal palm trees.  The food in the nearby cafes is inexpensive and tasty, there are enough umbrellas, sun loungers, air mattresses for everyone.  There are many attractions, showers, locker rooms.  Here the animators will not leave you bored, and the best DJs demonstrate everything that they are capable of. </p><p>  Note that Makronissos Beach (located near the Asterias Beach Hotel) is more suitable for older holidaymakers.  Here the rest is more calm, more measured. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The Androthea Hotel Apartments restaurant is quite small, located in the next building with the main hotel.  The hotel is small, respectively, and its restaurant is more like a cafe (by the way, that is what tourists call it by mistake).  The facade of the hotel restaurant overlooks the pool area with doors and windows.  This is convenient: vacationers (their meals are mainly half board) often order food in order to enjoy it simply on the terrace. </p>
