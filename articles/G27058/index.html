    <h2>  Where is the castle located? </h2><p>  Externally, the structure resembles a medieval castle, but this is a delusion.  This is a modern building, located near the resort town of Sozopol (Bulgaria), in the small village of Ravadinovo, which is located almost on the Black Sea coast.  Even today, despite the <span>incomplete construction,</span> you can visit it and appreciate the boldness and originality of the author's architectural solution. </p><h2>  Sozopol, Ravadinovo Castle </h2><p>  This is a fairly popular resort located on the Black Sea on a peninsula thirty-six kilometers from Burgas.  The town is one of the oldest on the coast: scientists say that the first settlements here were back in the Bronze Age. </p><p>  For centuries, Sozopol (Bulgaria) was a tiny fishing village, and only in the twenties of the last century it began to develop rapidly as a resort.  Today it is well known far beyond the borders of the country as a place where you can relax on one of the two well-equipped beaches.  Exactly from this city are excursion groups consisting of those who want to see with their own eyes the castle of Ravadinovo (Bulgaria). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sozopol bulgaria" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1432984.jpg" width="600"></div>

Experts believe that it looks much more attractive than in Nessebar, although it is not as impressive as in Plovdiv. </p><h2>  Ravadinovo - an old Bulgarian village </h2><p>  It became known to the whole world after a former athlete, and later police officer Georgi Tumpalov began to build his own "medieval" castle on this land.  This idea came about almost twenty years ago, but today the construction is still not completed.  Despite this, tourists can visit the magnificent building, immerse themselves in the atmosphere of the Middle Ages, masterfully and very accurately recreated by the author. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle ravadinovo bulgaria opening hours" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1434293.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About the construction of the castle </h2><p>  Construction work began in 1997.  Before they began, Georgi traveled a lot and paid special attention to traveling castle architecture.  He designed his creation himself.  According to him, he is engaged in construction together with his two sons, as well as a small brigade consisting of local residents.  They deliver the stones for construction to the site, mining them on Strandzha Mountain.  It is located near the Bulgarian-Turkish border, about 70 km from the village. </p><p>  Now for the interesting numbers.  The construction of the castle has already taken about sixteen thousand tons of stone.  Think about these values: ordinary KAMAZ can maximize accommodate no more than 13 tons.  But in fact, no more than 10 tons of stones can be loaded into the body.  Thus, a small team (approximately 20 people) over the years had to load and then unload about 1,600 KAMAZ trucks.  In addition, fifty tons of gilded copper went into construction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle ravadinovo bulgaria how to get" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1432978.jpg" width="375"></div>
