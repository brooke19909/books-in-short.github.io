The resort is very popular among tourists who go to the beach in the early morning or late in the evening, and spend the whole day enjoying various attractions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vietnam-guide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang Vietnam" class="if uuid-2374522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72243/2374522.jpg"></div><p>  The monsoon season is from October to mid-December.  The sea breeze brings tangible coolness, and sometimes the weather can get much worse.  Summer in Nha Trang attracts many vacationers, then hotel rooms are more difficult to find.  If Vietnam was a little closer to us, the flow of tourists to this interesting country would grow several times.  But now there are lovers of Asian exoticism and unusual cuisine who come to the coast. </p><h2>  Nha Trang beaches </h2><p>  The main beach of the city is located south of the Kai River and has a length of about six kilometers.  It is decorated with a beautiful and well-groomed promenade with walking paths, a park area, sculptures and places for relaxation.  The beach itself is quite wide, sandy.  The sea on the coast is calm, which is very convenient for swimming.  Nha Trang is one of the most beautiful beaches of Southeast Asia. </p><p>  Bai Duong Beach is located north of the Cai River.  This is a beautiful and comfortable place, but the sewer canals passing nearby spoil the impression.  The beach is popular among Vietnamese vacationers, so in the afternoon it is completely empty.  Nearby there are several seafood restaurants serving Vietnamese tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="advmotorcycletours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang Beach" class="if uuid-2374523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72243/2374523.jpg"></div><p>  Hong Chong beach is located among the rocks.  Tourists can climb to the top and admire the nearby islands from there.  Entrance to the beach is paid. </p><p>  There are several beautiful beaches on Hon Tre Island, but they are only available for recreation to the guests of Winperl Resort.  The exception is the small beach in front of the water park, which can be visited by guests who bought a ticket.  The beach offers water sports, there is a restaurant serving Russian cuisine. </p><h2>  Beaches outside the city </h2><p>  Doc Let Beach is a beautiful long beach north of Nha Trang.  Local fishing families prepare delicious meals here at an affordable price.  The most comfortable part of the beach is the one closest to the resort hotels.  The remaining sites, unfortunately, are littered with trash abandoned by local residents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang City" class="if uuid-2374524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72243/2374524.jpg"></div><p>  Long Beach - located in the areas of Cam La and Cam Ranh.  Upscale resorts are being built on the coast.  It's nice to walk along the beach, although trash can be the same problem as on the previous beach.  Especially a lot of it in areas remote from hotels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are several other beaches in the vicinity of Nha Trang.  About 30 kilometers from the city, a small peninsula overlooks the South China Sea.  Here are small hotels, and on the beaches are white sand and tall palm trees.  From Nha Trang to the beach can be reached by taxi or passing bus. </p><h2>  Budget vacation </h2><p>  In Nha Trang, there are many inexpensive hotels costing less than $ 20 per night, almost all of them are equipped with a private bathroom, air conditioning, cable TV.
