In the 16th century it was renamed Grigoryevskoye, and in 1778 it was completely transformed into a city.  Since the mid-19th century, the population of Yegoryevsk and its territory have grown several times.  At the same time, the city center remained almost unchanged, and there you can see many buildings that are more than a century old.  In addition, tourists are attracted by the ancient religious and industrial attractions of Yegoryevsk and the surrounding area. </p>

    <h2>  Alexander Nevsky Cathedral </h2><p>  This temple, located on the eponymous square, is the architectural symbol of the city.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits construction arose after the failed assassination attempt on Emperor Alexander II, and the work on its construction, begun in 1880, lasted 17 years.  The authors of the architectural project were N.N. Weiss and A.S. Kaminsky, who decided to give the construction the features of a neo-Russian style.  The lighting of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral took place in 1897, and on the eve of World War I, a bell tower was built with the money of the honorary citizen of the city M.N. Bardygin, which is reported on a plate that can still be seen on the temple wall. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Holy Trinity Convent </h2><p>  Talking about the sights of Yegoryevsk, you can not ignore the complex of buildings surrounded by a beautiful brick wall with towers that resembles a miniature of the Moscow Kremlin fortifications.  This is the Holy Trinity (Mariinsky) <span>convent.</span>  It was built on the initiative of the Bardygin spouses in 1900, and its main temple had luxurious decoration, which many capital churches could envy. </p><p>  In 1918, all the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the monastery were seized by the Bolsheviks, and two nuns were arrested and put to death.  In subsequent years, many buildings were destroyed, and the remaining ones were used as barracks and training buildings of the flight school.  Only in 2000, the monastery was returned to believers, and after a long break the divine liturgy was held in its temple. </p>

    <h2>  Khludov manufactory </h2><p>  Sights of Yegoryevsk, photos of which are presented above, belong to the category of monuments of religious architecture.  However, in the city you can see other structures.  For example, on the street on March 8 is the building of the Khludov manufactory.  It is an excellent example of an industrial-style building and was built in 1870.  The first <span>weaving production of</span> Yegoryevsk was originally located there.  The building is notable for its original English-style clock tower, a bit like Big Ben. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nicholas Radovitsky Monastery </h2><p>  If you come to Yegoryevsk, you can find the sights not only in the city itself, but also in its environs.  For example, in the village of Radovitsy (address: Shchukina St., 1-A.) There is an old monastery, founded in 1584 with the permission of Ivan the Terrible.  By the end of the 20th century, it was almost completely destroyed, and only 10 years ago, restoration work began there. </p><p>  Going to the Nikolo-Radovitsky Monastery, which Sergei Yesenin repeatedly visited in his childhood, who mentioned him in the poem ‚ÄúAnna Snegina‚Äù, you can bow to the miraculous carved image of St. Nicholas and see the restored church of the Holy Godfathers Joachim and Anna. </p>

    <h2>  "Wing" </h2><p>  The address of this modern landmark of the city of Yegoryevsk: st.  Rainbow.  The composition is a monument in the form of a wing of a military aircraft with a red star, installed at the site of the death of two pilots A. Lysenko and G. Mamontov.  In 1977, these young officers who made a test flight took the falling plane away from residential areas, sacrificing their lives. </p><h2>  House of Bardygin </h2><p>  The name of this philanthropist and <span>honorary citizen of the city</span> in the late 19th - early 20th centuries was heard by everyone who came to Yegoryevsk.  Attractions that are related to his family are found there at every step.  Among them, the bell tower of the Cathedral of Alexander Nevsky and the Mariinsky Monastery, which have already been talked about.  Of interest is the city estate of the patron, which is located at the intersection of Sovetskaya, 89, and the Paris Commune.  Its construction began in 1872.  The estate includes a 2-storey residential building with a basement, a stable, an outbuilding, a fence and a garden. </p>

    <h2>  Kazan Kolychevsky Convent </h2><p>  The cloister is located 16 km from Yegoryevsk.  It was founded in 1864 in the village of Kolychevo (Zinaida Samsonova Street, 31) at the initiative of Hieroskhimonakh Makarii, who bought the noble estate from the owners and organized a shelter for orphans and single women there.  On the territory of the monastery you can see the Kazan Cathedral, the <span>Transfiguration Church</span> and the Gate Church of St. Juvenal.  All of them differ in original architecture and will be interesting to lovers of antiquity. </p><h2>  Museum of History and Art (Egorievsk) </h2><p>  The sights of the city are concentrated mainly in the territory of its historical center.  Among them, a special place is occupied by a two-story mansion of the late 19th century, which is located at ul.  Sovetskaya, 73. Since 1911, it houses the historical and art museum, created on the basis of the collection of the patron Bardygin.  The first floor of the building is reserved for the local history department.  They demonstrate the fauna and flora of the surroundings of Yegoryevsk, including an extensive collection of mushrooms, including extinct specimens.  On the second floor you can see the exposition dedicated to the history of the city, as well as household items that its residents used 200-100 years ago. </p>

    <h2>  Church of St. George </h2><p>  Egorievsk, whose sights have long earned him the fame of one of the most interesting <span>cities</span> for tourists <span>in the Moscow region,</span> has always been a center of the Old Believers.  In March 1882, local merchants, whose ancestors did not become Nikonians during the years of the Split, applied to the Ministry of the Interior for permission to convert them into a prayer house.  Their request was granted, provided that no crosses, bells or over-door icons would be installed on the building from the outside.  Over time, the government softened its attitude towards the Old Believers, and a bell tower appeared at the church, consecrated in the name of St. George.  In 1936 it was closed by the authorities, and the 4 thousandth parish was left without a chapel.  The revival of the temple began after 60 years.  Today the Church of St. George the Victorious attracts believers from all over the <span>Moscow Region,</span> and Old Believers from the capital come to pray on feast days. </p>

    <h2>  Znamensky temple </h2><p>  This monument of history and architecture of regional significance is located in the village of Aleshino, 5 km from Yegoryevsk.  The temple, consecrated in 1889, is also associated with the name of the patron Bardygin, who allocated money for its construction and decoration, which is very magnificent.  The <span>pseudo-Russian-style</span> church building is decorated with rich decor by local artists.  In Soviet times, the temple was closed, and for several decades it slowly collapsed until restoration work began there.  Today, the Znamenskaya Church is reopened and services are held there. </p><p>  Now you know that you can see interesting things by visiting Yegoryevsk (the sights with the description are presented above), and you will probably want to go there on a sightseeing tour.  Well, good luck! </p>
