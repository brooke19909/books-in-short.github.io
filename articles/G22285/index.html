    <h2>  Askold's Grave </h2><p>  Now Askoldov Kurgan is located in a park on the right bank of the Dnieper.  Many centuries ago, this area was known as the Ugorsk tract.  According to legend, in 882, the first Christian ruler of Kiev, Prince Askold, was killed near this place.  His brother Deer was killed along with him.  Both of them died at the hands of the foreign prince Oleg (Rurikovich).  After the death of the brothers Oleg became a full-fledged ruler of Kievan Rus.  <span>Askold and Deere</span> were buried at the place of their death. </p><p>  According to historical sources, Askold was rightfully to lead Kievan Rus.  There is evidence that the prince was baptized in Constantinople.  When he was baptized, he was given the name Nikolai. </p><p>  Many historians question the fact of the murder of the brothers, claiming that these are just folk legends.  However, Askold's grave in Kiev is considered the resting place of the Kiev princes and even has a small chapel nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Church of St. Nicholas </h2>

    <p>  The Church of St. Nicholas was erected over Askold's grave in Kiev.  Her name was chosen in honor of the name of the prince at baptism.  There are two legends about the creation of the church at the Askold grave.  There is a version that Princess Olga herself took part in the creation of the temple. </p><p>  The second version says that, according to the mistake made by the chronicler, the word "Olma" was accidentally replaced by "Olga".  Some scholars put forward the version that the pagan Olma or Olmosh became the founder of the church.  This was the commander of a detachment of Hungarians, marching past Kiev in the 9th century.  For him was given the daughter of Svyatopolk, whose name was Peredslava.  Being in exile for a long time, Olmos could build a church in honor of his wedding. </p><p>  In 971, the son of <span>Princess Olga,</span> Prince Svyatoslav, destroyed the church of St. Nicholas on Askold's grave.  He was a pagan and therefore was engaged in the eradication of the relics of Christianity in his lands. </p><p>  However, in 990, the church was rebuilt by order of Prince Vladimir.  In 1036, a convent was founded here. </p><h2>  Legend of Prince Mstislav </h2><p>  There is another legend with which Askold's grave is associated.  Legend has it that in <span>1113 the</span> son of Vladimir Monomakh, Mstislav Vladimirovich, returned home from the hunt.  The prince got lost in a dark forest.  It turned out that he was driving along the road where Askold Kurgan is now located in Kiev, and saw the light emanating from the image of St. Nicholas.  This beam showed the prince the way home. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  From the translated sources, historians know that, thanks to his miraculous return, Mstislav founded a man‚Äôs monastery on the site of a convent in 1115.  It was here that Theodosius, the founder of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, lived out his last years. </p><p>  A few years later, a chapel was built at the place where Askold's grave is located.  Her light guided travelers along the right path. </p><h2>  Further construction of the temple </h2><p>  The most ancient image of the church of St. Nicholas is considered to be found on the Kalofoy plan.  It was a wooden church with three buildings. </p><p>  In 1696, the complex was rebuilt, and two more buildings were added to its structure.  Construction was paid by <span>Ivan Mazepa.</span>  The project was developed by architect Joseph Startsev. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Askold's Grave in Kiev" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/863404.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  In 1810, the chief architect of Kiev erected a small church on the site of Askold's grave.  She had 2 floors and a throne.  Under it was located the tomb, which is famous for its unique beauty iconostases of Carrara marble and gold.  This exhibition is presented to all comers by Askold's grave in Kiev.  History claims that the images were inflicted by Vasnetsov.  The most beautiful greenhouse located in this church was the work of the hands of the gardener Raphael.  There were planned paths, 9 terraces for burial, as well as stairs and passages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Soviet time </h2><p>  During the Soviet era, the church was destroyed.  The cemetery was converted into an amusement park.  In 1936, a restaurant was opened here.  In 1938, the architect P. Yurchenko rebuilt the temple into a park pavilion. </p><p>  The fame and beauty of the formerly necropolis were just a memory.  Only the old-timers of the city still kept in memory the former greatness of this place. </p><p>  In 1979, along with the opening of the city historical museum of Kiev, they began to rebuild the temple.  Here they made an exhibition center.  And in 1985, the museum staff calculated the complete plan for the reconstruction of this historical and spiritual relic. </p><h2>  Temple restoration </h2><p>  From the mass of submitted plans and projects for the restoration of the historical complex, one was selected that corresponded to the appearance of the church in 1810.  The project involved the creation of an exposition in the cellars of the Church of St. Nicholas, revealing historical data on the necropolis.  It was supposed to change the nearby territories.  The project of Kiev architects was called "Historical Area: Askold's Grave." </p><p>  However, funding was not enough to carry out all the necessary work on time.  In 1992, due to the inability to continue restoration work, the Orthodox church was given to the Greek Catholic diocese of the city. </p><p>  In 1998, the restoration reached its logical conclusion, and Askold‚Äôs grave (photo of the restored church can be viewed below) became a pilgrimage site for many Orthodox Christians. </p>

His stop is called Glory Park.  From there, the number 62 bus goes to the desired location. </p><p>  Having reached the territory of the Askold Kurgan park, visitors find themselves in an ancient atmosphere of secrets, legends and traditions associated with this place.  After all, it is not in vain that it attracts both Kievans and guests of the city.  Many writers and poets sang this historical complex.  In the works of Taras Shevchenko there are stories about Askold Kurgan.  The author of many works, Zagorsky wrote a novel about the area.  Based on this work, the opera of Verestovsky was created. </p><p>  Also close to Askold Hill is a monument to Andrew the First-Called, one of the sacred monuments associated with the history of Kiev. </p><p>  Arriving in one of the most wonderful and rich cities in Ukraine - Kiev, you should definitely visit its attractions.
