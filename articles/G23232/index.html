  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Political Science Structure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The structure and functions of political science are a logically built, holistic complex of knowledge about the organization of political life.  The update process takes place at one time or another in all spheres of life.  With the increase in the intrascientific status of humanitarian knowledge, the importance of certain branches of science also increases.  In particular, recently the attention of researchers has been drawn to the object of political science.  The most important aspect in this industry is the identification of the cause, and not the purpose of the activity. </p><p>  The term "political science" is formed by the two Greek words "politike" and "logos", which literally means "political science".  "Science" (literally means "knowledge") is defined as a system of continuously developing knowledge.  This system is designed to adequately reflect the concepts of objective reality. </p><p>  The structure of political science consists (in a general sense) of practical and theoretical knowledge.  Each knowledge certainly has its own characteristics. </p><p>  The practical area is studying the problems of transforming political processes, analyzes the means and ways by which a targeted impact on political reality is carried out.  In addition, the theoretical direction involves the development of specific recommendations to achieve a practical result.  At the same time, much attention is paid to the technique and technology of organizing power, the specific activities of various political institutions, and <span>election campaigns.</span>  When studying, the characteristics of behavior in the corresponding sphere of different social groups are of no small importance.  Conclusions obtained in the course of applied research can be the basis for the formulation of theoretical principles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The theoretical direction contributes to the formation of fundamental knowledge.  In this case, the structure of political science includes methods and methodology, the conceptual apparatus of scientific research. </p><p>  In general, the <span>branch of science</span> is called upon to reveal the factors of formation, nature, ways of institutionalizing and functioning the system.  At the same time, the structure of political science includes methods for determining the main trends and patterns in the public political sphere, as well as strategic priorities.  Based on all this, long-term goals and prospects for the further development of processes are developed.  The structure of political science, in addition, includes techniques by which politics is reflected as a way to fight and maintain power, a method and form of government.  In general, this scientific branch is developing a methodology for analysis, forecasting and technologies based on a theoretical vision of the issue and on the results of empirical knowledge. </p><p>  Being an independent discipline, political science has its own apparatus of categories and a system of methods for studying political reality. </p><p>  The categories include the most general definitions, which reflect the connection of phenomena and characteristic features that are of significant importance.  In political science, a certain number of concepts have been created, which are tools for studying. </p><p>  The first group includes definitions that explain the <span>subject, the object of science.</span>  The second group includes concepts that allow us to analyze the forces and structures that are means or goals for the political elite, leaders.  These concepts, first of all, include "domination", "power", "order".  The third group includes definitions related to the study of political institutions.  The fourth group of concepts makes it possible to analyze the system.  These concepts include "norms", "components", "political system", in fact.  The fifth group includes definitions that allow you to analyze the process as a whole.  Such concepts include "modernization", "reform", "revolution" and others.  The sixth group includes definitions that cover the sphere of <span>political consciousness.</span> </p>
