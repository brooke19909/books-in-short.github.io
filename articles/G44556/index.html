    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  For beginner needlewomen who have mastered the basics of knitting, sooner or later there is a desire to learn how to knit two-color patterns.  Schemes, a description of the technology at this stage of "development" may seem incomprehensible and extremely complex.  Many precisely at this stage abandon their hobby, without revealing their creative potential. </p><p>  The knitting technique known as lazy jacquard is especially suitable for this case.  Performing it is quite simple, you do not need to have special knitting skills, but at the same time, the work will turn out to be very beautiful and elegant.  There are many options for <span>knitting</span> .  Each needlewoman will be able to choose a suitable ornament. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For several seasons in a row, a two-color pattern, or, as it is also called, a jacquard pattern, remains fashionable.  I wonder where such an interesting designation of a multi-colored ornament came from.  The name of this style comes from the name of its inventor.  And he was a French engineer Joseph Maria Jacquard. </p><p>  At home, such patterns can be created using knitting needles and multi-colored threads.  As a rule, <span>patterns of jacquard patterns are</span> simple and even a novice can deal with them. </p>

    <h2>  The basics </h2><p>  Two-color double-sided pattern, knitted at once from several multi-colored tangles.  To do this is not easy, you must have the necessary skills and patience.  It is important to be careful when creating jacquard patterns, because one wrong eyelet, connected in the wrong or wrong color, can seriously harm and mix the whole picture of the finished product. </p><p>  In one row several times you have to change the threads, creating a pattern.  If the pattern is complex, and the next thread will go to work in more than two rows, then the working thread must be additionally crossed.  Such manipulations need to be done so that the working thread presses the auxiliary thread to the product, otherwise the canvas will be unevenly connected, and subsequently vertical gaps will appear.  These subtleties in the work must be known and taken into account.  Failure to comply with the basic rules will affect the quality of your work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to facilitate the fate of needlewomen, patterns were created, performed in a technique called lazy jacquard.  Schemes are created in such a way that the pattern is created in rows.  That is, in the process of knitting, you do not need to change the thread several times while knitting one row.  In this case, every two rows are knitted in the same color.  Knitting a two-tone lazy jacquard pattern is much easier and much faster.  That is why most needlewomen prefer this particular technique. </p>

    <h2>  Mastering the technique </h2><p>  So, let's figure out how this pattern fits.  Lazy jacquard, like most patterns, consists of front and back loops. </p><p>  The main feature of this pattern is that the next two rows, front and back, are knitted with thread from one ball.  The change of thread is made on the sides of the product.  Another feature of the technique is that when facial loops are knitted, they are most often odd.  The thread with which the removed loops are knitted should be left at work.  In the wrong rows, or even, it is necessary to do the opposite, that is, leave the thread before work. </p><p>  And finally, the third feature - the loops must be knitted as they lie on the spoke.  This applies to the wrong rows.  If a removed loop is encountered in the work, then it also does not need to be knitted, but simply left on the working spoke. </p><h2>  Scope of the pattern </h2><p>  Ornaments created in the folk style have always been and remain relevant.  And it is not necessary that the picture was created in the Slavic style.  Norwegian patterns are very popular with us.  Multicolor and bright patterns are used to create children's things: blouses, trousers, overalls, dresses, as well as mittens, scarves and hats. </p>

    <p>  For women, patterns of no more than three threads are most often used.  This pattern is used for knitting cardigans, sweaters and pullovers.  For men, a two-tone pattern remains acceptable, it should be a strict and restrained motive.  Most often, vests and sweaters are created in this style.  Lazy jacquard remains the leader in the creation of sweaters, mittens and hats. </p><h2>  Honeycomb Pattern </h2><p>  This symbolic name is explained by the visual resemblance to bee honeycombs.  The drawing can be performed as one thread, and two multi-colored.  The ‚Äúhoneycomb‚Äù pattern is two-color knitted, just like one-color, the exception is that you need to change the thread every two rows. </p><p>  In order to create this ornament, you will need threads of two colors.  It is important that they be the same thickness and the knitting needles that match your threads.  For the pattern, you need to dial the number of loops, a multiple of two.  Plus two more edging threads that are not taken into account in the picture, but are present invariably, like in any other product. </p>
