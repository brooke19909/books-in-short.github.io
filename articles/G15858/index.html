The decorative elements that add zest to the outfits have always been treated very reverently.  It could be flowers, ribbons, beads, embroidery, precious threads, etc. But the classic is a bow!  Various variations do not lose relevance, giving the product elegance and femininity. </p><p>  <span>Crocheting a</span> bow is very simple, because they decorate almost everything: hats, gloves, bags, shoes, interior items, accessories and even jewelry!  In women's attire, he may be present in the form of a brooch, necklace.  Having made the simplest little bow, you will turn an ordinary everyday look into a more elegant and delicate. </p><p>  How to crochet bows big and small, simple and more complex, we will tell further. </p><p>  The conventions used in the diagrams are presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vjazanie.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="legend" class="if uuid-2959480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2959480.jpg"></div><h2>  How to crochet a bow for beginners </h2><p>  Each needlewoman sooner or later faces a problem when she needs to decorate a knitted product with a bow.  To make such a decor with your own hands will not be difficult if you follow the instructions below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vjazanie.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bow scheme" class="if uuid-2959478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2959478.jpg"></div><p>  Here's how to crochet a bow for beginners step by step: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  First, roll an amigurumi ring from yarn and knit five air loops from it. </li><li>  In this little ring, knit five to seven columns with two crochets, and then again type five loops and with a half-column connect the chain to the ring. </li><li>  Knitting must be conducted inside the ringlet, without splitting the thread. </li><li>  Next, tie another five stitches and five to seven double crochet columns. </li><li>  We continue to work with five loops and a half-column in the ring. </li><li>  Cut the working thread, leaving a tail about 15 cm. </li><li>  The amigurumi ring needs to be tightened, and we wrap the center of the bow with a long thread, laying coil to coil. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="helloyellowyarn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting a small bow" class="if uuid-2959455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2959455.jpg"></div><p>  We hide the ends of the thread with a needle or hook.  A cute little accessory is ready! </p><h2>  Simple flat bow </h2><p>  The following decoration can decorate any knitted product. </p><p>  Before crocheting a bow, stock up on the following: </p><ul><li>  Yarn (you can take two shades). </li><li>  Crochet matching thread number. </li><li>  Needle (better than darn). </li><li>  Scissors. </li></ul><p>  At the beginning of the work it will be necessary to dial a chain of sixteen air loops.  Then, going from the second loop from the hook, knit the single crochet to the end of the chain (15 pieces). </p><p>  One lifting loop, expand the work and tie another row.  So we knit from six to ten rows.  It turns out the rectangle is the main part of the bow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now we need to tie the product around the edge with one row of single crochet posts.  If you decide to create a two-color bow, then take a yarn of a different color. </p><p>  The jumper is formed from the same thread (in the case of knitting a two-color bow) or from the main one.  For her, dial 6 loops and tie 8 rows with single crochet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thecrochetspace.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="design idea" class="if uuid-2959457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2959457.jpg"></div><p>  It remains only to collect a bow.  In the center, pull it with a thread, wrap it over a connected jumper.  Sew the edges together, and hide the ends of the thread. </p><h2>  How to crochet a small bow </h2><p>  Sometimes, for finishing a small thing (for example, a baby blouse, booties, hats), you need a tiny delicate decor.  How to crochet a bow so that it harmoniously fits into the concept of the product?  A method is suitable in which first a chain of air loops is knitted (50 pieces will be enough), and then a double crochet, half-column or single crochet is knitted into each loop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.allfreecrochet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small bows" class="if uuid-2959458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2959458.jpg"></div><p>  The thread is cut and hidden inside.  The resulting strip is folded with a pretzel and fixed in the middle, decorated with a bead, cabochon, rhinestones, etc. </p><h2>  Bow imitating knotted from ribbon </h2><p>  Small volumetric bows knitted with a hook are wonderful decoration elements.  They are suitable for decorating clothes, and for creating jewelry, and for many other purposes. </p><p>  Its appearance is quite serious, but special skills for manufacturing are not required.  Crocheting a bow for a hat is better from thin yarn.  Do not take it very thick: this will give the product a rough look, because crochet is already very tough. </p><p>  The bow looks great in a two-color version: the border emphasizes the picturesque accessory. </p><p>  So, first knit a narrow strip with the main shade of yarn.  For her, dial 50 loops, and then go through nine rows of single crochets.  Tie the edge with another thread, to form corners in each extreme column, tie four columns of the binding. </p><p>  The resulting rectangular element is folded in half, the edges are connected with a needle.  Fold the ring with a seam in the middle. </p><p>  In the same way, a jumper is created: from a chain of 15 loops we knit a strip with the help of single crochets (five rows will be enough).  We lay it in the middle and overlap the seam, fix it. </p><p>  Now, tie another long strip of yarn of the main color (the width is the same as that of the bow loops), fold it in half at an angle of 45 degrees and sew it from the inside out. </p><p>  This is how an original accessory is created from several simple strips. </p><h2>  Openwork bow </h2><p>  And for the hairpin of the little princess, tie small openwork bows.  Take cotton, thin yarn: it will perfectly emphasize the knitting pattern and hold the shape.  Remains of thread, for example, white and pink, will come in handy. </p><p>  Let the main yarn be pink.  From it we pick up 81 air loops, close the chain into a ring and continue knitting in a circle.  The scheme is attached below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="erch2014.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork pattern" class="if uuid-2959468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2959468.jpg"></div><p>  After reaching the required width, tie the edge with white thread. </p><p>  The bow of the bow is knitted with pink yarn.  We collect the accessory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="anniespictureperfect.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork bow" class="if uuid-2959466" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2959466.jpg"></div><p>  Now it remains to decorate it.  To do this, tie a small flower. </p><p>  In the amigurumi ring, we knit five air loops, connect with a half-column.  Then, in each column of the previous row, we knit two air loops, a magnificent column of three double crochets, two air loops.  We sew this flower in the middle of the product. </p><p>  Everything, openwork bow is ready!  It remains to attach it to a hairpin or elastic band and decorate the hairstyle. </p><h2>  Double bow </h2><p>  It is very easy to perform.  A stunning effect is obtained when using sectional yarn. </p><p>  We will collect 15 air loops and continue to knit with crochets in a length of about twenty centimeters.  Each craftswoman has her own knitting density, so the number of rows will be different. </p><p>  Then we knit the second strip.  You will need to dial 10 loops, and knit 24 cm. </p><p>  We sew both strips into rings and put the smaller into the larger.  We combine the seams, lay them in the middle and tighten. </p><p>  We create a jumper: we collect 4 air loops and we knit a strip for a length that can be used to wrap the tightened middle. </p><p>  Done!  Awesome bow with smooth transitions of shades is ready! </p>
