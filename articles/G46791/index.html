  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Functions of the medulla oblongata and other parts of the rhomboid</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Traditionally, in anatomy exams in non-medical universities, the question about the hindbrain is answered with the maximum number of errors.  Why it happens?  The fact is that units of different levels carry this name.  In one case, the hindbrain is called the rhomboid, in the second - a small formation that bears the name of the hindbrain itself (includes the bridge and cerebellum).  It is impossible to confuse the first formation with the second, because the second is part of the first. </p><p>  The rhomboid brain is the most ancient formation, it is found even in reptiles.  In humans, it performs simpler functions than in reptiles, because newer formations - the <span>midbrain</span> and <span>forebrain</span> - take on complex functions <span>.</span>  However, when you read about the hindbrain, you never get tired of wondering how close all species are to each other and you are convinced that all life, in principle, is built according to the same scheme, only in more advanced species the individual elements are somewhat complicated. </p><p>  The functions of the hindbrain in the broad sense (we remember that in this case the ‚Äúhindbrain‚Äù is a synonym for ‚Äúrhomboid‚Äù) are very diverse, they include the functions of the medulla oblongata, the bridge, and the cerebellum.  It is most logical to start the discussion with a story about the medulla oblongata, because it is this part that is directly connected to the <span>spinal cord</span> and is unusually ancient. </p><p>  So, the functions of the <span>medulla oblongata</span> as a whole can be divided into two classes.  Firstly, its structures conduct impulses from ‚Äúsubordinates‚Äù and from the medulla oblongata above to more authoritative centers.  However, there is a second class of functions - the functions of the medulla oblongata itself, it has its own tasks, which the centers outside the rhomboid brain do not closely monitor.  This department is a responsible "executor", which once again does not bother the "boss", but deals with the "routine" itself.  What are the functions of the medulla oblongata relatively autonomous? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Firstly, there are receptors for the content of <span>carbon dioxide</span> in the blood; it is not oxygen deficiency, but an excess of carbon dioxide that makes us breathe.  Therefore, if a person forces himself to breathe deeply for some time, <span>carbon dioxide</span> leaves more than usual, and breathing is inhibited.  After which a person feels a deficiency of oxygen.  Recall your feelings when the doctor asks for a deep breath - many people feel dizzy after this because too much carbon dioxide has gone and breathing is not stimulated.  The medulla oblongata is involved in controlling inhalation and exhalation, although it also has a small "boss" - a bridge that sets the rhythm of breathing. </p><p>  Secondly, the functions of the medulla oblongata include control of the heart.  Impulses from both types of autonomous system come to this center.  Its sympathetic part is responsible for mobilization reactions in extreme situations, and the parasympathetic part is responsible for relaxation and recovery.  It is clear that both of them control the work of the heart, accelerating or slowing down the rhythm.  And the medulla oblongata helps to coordinate their activities.  However, ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù commands can come to him from the emotional centers of the brain - subcortical structures, and then the heartbeat noticeably quickens. </p><p>  Thirdly, there is a <span>vasomotor center</span> that deals with pressure.  This part actively interacts with other parts of the brain, for example, with the hypothalamus, but in normal situations the medulla oblongata copes on its own. </p><p>  Fourth, the medulla oblongata is engaged in what we usually are not aware of.  Congenital reflexes, that is, coughing, vomiting, sneezing, swallowing. </p><p>  Let's go back to the other parts of the rhomboid brain and talk about the hind brain itself.  Its part - the bridge - makes the transition from inhalation to exhalation and vice versa.  It also houses the centers of several pairs of cranial nerves.  The functions of the cerebellum are coordination of movements and motor memory (together with higher centers). </p><p>  As we can see, the rhomboid brain performs vital functions <span>of the brain,</span> that is, necessary for every second survival.  Therefore, the brain is so vulnerable to damage to these areas. </p>
