And perhaps his best resort, undoubtedly, is the city of Nha Trang.  The infrastructure in this southern village is developed remarkably.  Tourists have the opportunity not only to have a good time on the beach, but also have a good fun.  Of course, there are good budget hotels in Nha Trang.  For example, quite comfortable accommodation is offered to guests of Vietnam by the Daisy Spa 3 * hotel.  Reviews of this hotel on the web are relatively good. </p><h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  This hotel is, in the opinion of many tourists, in a rather convenient location.  The distance to the square to them.  April 2 from it is only 650 meters.  The popular Sailing Club Nha Trang is located 800 meters from the hotel. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, the Daisy Spa 3 * beach is quite far away.  The distance from this hotel to the coastline is about 700 meters.  Hotel guests have to go to the sea for about 10-15 minutes.  To some, such walks do not seem very tiring.  Other tourists (mostly elderly) find this not very convenient.  After all, you usually have to go to the beach in the heat.  But if you wish, you can also get to the sea from the hotel by public transport.  His stop is in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The distance to the nearest <span>airport (Nha Trang)</span> from the hotel is only about 30 km.  Most often, tour operators selling trips to Vietnam with accommodation at this hotel offer their customers a service such as a shuttle bus.  But, of course, if necessary, you can get to the hotel from the airport on your own.  Many tourists hire a taxi for this purpose.  The cost of transporting people in Vietnam is relatively inexpensive. </p><p>  Although a taxi is a good way to get to the city, most of the former guests of the Daisy Spa 3 * are advised to order a shuttle service directly to the hotel if necessary.  This service in the hotel, of course, is paid.  But it costs a transfer to a hotel, judging by the reviews of tourists, cheaper than a taxi.  In addition, guests in this case are met by a hotel representative.  And this can be very convenient for someone who came to rest in Vietnam for the first time. </p><h2>  Daisy Spa 3 *: general hotel description </h2><p>  Actually, most tourists consider this hotel itself quite comfortable.  There are many good reviews on the Web about her.  This hotel is a new modern high-rise building with pretty beautiful architecture.  Each room here has a balcony, which is certainly very convenient.  Views from most of the hotel rooms open to the city.  But in some rooms, unfortunately, the windows face the wall of a nearby hotel.  This, of course, is a reason for the discontent of some vacationers. </p><p>  This hotel has earned good reviews primarily for its location in a quiet European area.  Nothing prevents her residents from relaxing in their rooms at the Daisy Spa 3 * hotel, day or night.  The only thing is that the silence of the corridors can be broken if the Chinese check into the hotel.  Each nation has its own mentality, and it often seems to European people that the citizens of the Middle Kingdom behave too fussy and noisy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Guests of <span>Nha Trang Hotel</span> Daisy Spa 3 * offers several categories of rooms of different cost.  If desired, this hotel can be rented: </p><ul><li>  double "standard" with one bed; </li><li>  Superior double room with two beds; </li><li>  double "deluxe"; </li><li>  improved deluxe; </li><li>  quadruple room. </li></ul><p>  Judging by the reviews of former guests, the rooms in this hotel, like in almost all hotels in Vietnam, are very small.  The cheapest apartments are only 14 m2, and the largest are 30 m2.  Many tourists are advised to rent in the Daisy Spa 3 * (Nha Trang) class rooms not lower than the improved "deluxe".  The sizes of cheaper rooms for a European person are not too convenient.  In any case, Russian tourists feel constrained in them. </p><p>  The small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Daisy Spa 3 * rooms (the photo below confirms the fact that they are really small), according to many tourists, is somewhat compensated by their good equipment.  In all hotel rooms, in addition to beds, bedside tables, clothes hangers and a wardrobe, there are: </p><ul><li>  telephone and air conditioning; </li><li>  a desk or a small sofa; </li><li>  refrigerator; </li><li>  minibar and safe. </li></ul><p>  An individual shower room with a bathtub is in each room.  The ability to use free Wi-Fi in all rooms is also what has earned the Daisy Spa 3 * hotel especially good tourists from tourists.  You can use a bathrobe and slippers if you wish.  This hotel service is also free of charge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Opinion of tourists about the rooms </h2><p>  The rooms in this hotel are generally praised by its guests for their cleanliness.  Local maids are very responsible in their work.  When cleaning the room, they do not even move the things of the tenants.  The furniture in the hotel rooms is new and of high quality.  Household appliances in most cases work properly.

    <p>  If desired, guests have the opportunity to order the service "wake-up call".  For those who are lazy to go to the beach, the hotel has a well-equipped sun terrace.  The pool at the hotel, according to some tourists, is not too comfortable.  The water in it is cold and not crystal clear.  Wash the pool bowl infrequently.  But then the views of the swimmers are just excellent.  The hotel‚Äôs rooftop pool is located on the eighth floor.  From here you can see not only an exotic city, but also picturesque mountains on the horizon. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  The hotel also offers bike and scooter rentals.  Unfortunately, there is no parking at the hotel.  But nearby there is a free public.  True, places on it must be ordered in advance.  Souvenirs of memory of visiting Vietnam, if desired, can be purchased directly on site.  The hotel has a small shop with the corresponding specialization. </p><p>  This hotel also has its own exchange office, as well as a banquet room.  Check-in at the hotel is open around the clock.  The guests living on the upper floors can go upstairs to their rooms.  The lift works very smoothly and quietly.

    <h2>  Reviews of tourists about food </h2><p>  Of course, as in any other three-star hotel, rooms at the Daisy Spa 3 * hotel (Vietnam) are rented with breakfast.  The food in this hotel, most tourists consider high-quality, but at the same time quite scarce.  With a large influx of tourists, breakfast at the hotel is served on a buffet.  At other times, meals must be ordered from the menu.  Unfortunately, there are no pastries and fruits (except for watermelons) in the hotel restaurant.  But soups and main dishes here, according to tourists, are served delicious. </p><h2>  Staff reviews </h2><p>  According to most of the former hotel guests, the friendly attitude of the staff towards the guests is something that, of course, can be attributed to the advantages of the Daisy Spa.  Daisy Hotel 3 * many praise precisely for the courtesy of its staff.  The hotel staff does not speak Russian, but understands English well.  In any case, the hotel staff is trying to solve the problems arising from the guests promptly, even despite the language barrier. </p>

    <p>  Tourists express some dissatisfaction only about the fact that in this hotel during cleaning they sometimes forget to report towels.  For this, former hotel guests are advised more closely.  The fact is that for missing towels this hotel has a fine.  To prove the fact that the kit was originally incomplete, in most cases it is almost impossible. </p><p>  Some tourists advise in no case do not leave money and telephones in the room.  Vietnam is a poor country and, according to many vacationers, it is not worth tempting to expose hotel staff once again. </p><h2>  Beach Reviews </h2><p>  The coastline near the hotel is quite wide and, according to many vacationers, comfortable for relaxing.  Most of the guests of the Daisy Spa 3 * hotel <span>(Vietnam, Nha Trang)</span> prefer to visit the public <span>beach of Nha Trang.</span>  Before going for a swim, hotel residents can drop by the respected and get a free towel. </p><p>  On the beach, many are advised not to take a sunbed at the first barker.

Therefore, having come to the beach, you should first look for a convenient zone.  On the ocean in Nha Trang near the Daisy Spa Hotel there are also well-equipped recreation areas with not too expensive sun loungers. </p><h2>  City infrastructure near the hotel </h2><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the hotel there are many shops, restaurants, massage parlors and markets.  Of course, there are inexpensive cafes next to the hotel.  Here, if desired, you can have lunch or dinner well without overpaying.
