    <p>  Specialists note the high quality of the materials of the case.  The screen is covered with a protective glass, the back surface of the case is made of plastic such as Soft Touch.  The sound level adjustment key is located next to the camera start button.  The corresponding element, which is designed to turn on the device, is located in the upper part of the right side of the case.  The phone cover is quite easy to remove.  It is very easy to insert a SIM card into the device, as well as an additional microSD flash memory module. </p><p>  The device is available in several color versions.

The characteristics of the devices in different color options, of course, are completely identical.  Now consider the features of the main hardware components of the device.  Where can I start a detailed study of the capabilities of the Sony Xperia Sola MT27i?  The characteristics of the device screen are a quite remarkable aspect of the study of the device in question.  Let's start with it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The screen of the Sony Xperia Sola MT27i phone is made using TFT technology.  The display resolution of the device in question is 854 x 480 pixels, the diagonal is 3.7 inches.  The quality of the picture is estimated by experts and users as sufficiently high.  The graininess of the image is imperceptible, contrast and clarity are at the level, fonts are displayed correctly.  The display supports up to 4 simultaneous finger taps.  Assessed as very sensitive.  Supports technology Floating Touch - a bit later we will consider in more detail its features.  Viewing angles, as well as the quality of the image in sunlight, approximately correspond to those observed at the nearest competitors of the device on the market. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The device‚Äôs camera can shoot videos with a resolution of 720p at a speed of 30 frames per second.  There is a function of autofocus, panoramic and three-dimensional shooting.  The phone is equipped with a very convenient camera control software interface.  The activation of the corresponding hardware component is possible, as we noted above, using a separate button.

    <p>  The camera is among the most competitive hardware components of the Sony Xperia Sola MT27i.  Photos and videos created using the device are characterized by experts and users as having a fairly high quality.  The main thing is that the shooting was carried out at the appropriate level of illumination. </p><h2>  "Iron" </h2><p>  The phone is assembled on the hardware platform SR-Ericsson.  This begs the association with the period when the market was attended by devices released under the brand Sony Ericsson.  The MT27i Xperia Sola, however, was put on sale after Sony absorbed its partner‚Äôs share of assets in 2011.  Therefore, the phone is present on the market under the Sony brand. </p><p>  The device is equipped with a Cortex A9 processor, operating at a frequency of 1 GHz, as well as a Mali-400 MP1 graphics module.  These components form the NovaThor U8500 platform.  According to experts, the performance of a phone equipped with the appropriate hardware generally allows you to meet the needs of users of the time when the device was introduced to the market. </p><p>  The smartphone can run 2D games without problems, as well as not too demanding in 3D format.  Regarding household applications - difficulties with downloading those also do not arise.  It can be noted that the Android OS in version 2, which is installed on the phone, is, in principle, compatible with a significant number of modern types of software available for download on Google Play and similar portals.  Thus, the considered phone from Sony is largely relevant in terms of enabling applications for the modern user. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Consider in more detail the software component of the smartphone Sony Xperia Sola MT27i.  The characteristics of the device in terms of hardware are on the level.  What about software installed on the phone? </p>

    <p>  The device‚Äôs software interface, based on the Android 2.3.7 platform, is generally similar to that of the Xperia S phone. There are a number of notable software options installed by default in the smartphone.  Among them - office suite Office Suite in version 5, file manager Astro, antivirus McAffee.  Additional applications are always available on Google Play and similar stores.  The software shell through which the smartphone is controlled recognizes files on plug-in microSD cards without problems. </p><p>  A very remarkable set of multimedia phone applications.  Among them - a branded player Sony.  According to many users, the corresponding type of software is one of the most convenient on the Android platform.

    <p>  Another example of exclusive phone options is Floating Touch.  This function makes it possible to control the device without touching the screen, just place your finger at a distance of about 1 cm from the display, and the smartphone will be able to recognize its basic movements. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery for Sony Xperia Sola MT27i has a capacity of 1320 mAh.  It belongs to the category of non-removable hardware components.  The battery capacity indicator is rather modest, however, in practice, the battery life of the device is quite consistent with competing models.  The battery life of the device is enough for about 1-2 days of operation with an average intensity of using it.  If you use the phone in video playback at the maximum brightness level, the battery lasts about 4 hours 40 minutes.  If we talk about modern smartphones, battery life indicators in them, if they exceed the ones noted, then not by much.  In this sense, the global manufacturers of mobile devices of the corresponding type have not yet begun to deliver, on the average price segment, solutions with revolutionary energy-saving technologies. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The Sony Xperia Sola MT27i is a mid-range device that is fully in line with the trends of its time.  In principle, it can be used to solve basic tasks that are relevant for the modern user, such as browsing the web, playing music, and video in medium resolution.  According to experts, the phone can be called one of the best in the corresponding class at the time of entering the market. </p><p>  The main advantages of the device: </p><ul><li>  excellent build quality; </li><li>  stylish design; </li><li>  large display with high resolution; </li><li>  the presence of relatively high-performance hardware components; </li><li>  support for useful options - NFC tags, Floating Touch; </li><li>  ease of management; </li><li>  high quality sound reproduction; </li><li>  the ability to play videos; </li><li>  support for external microSD cards; </li><li>  battery life corresponds to the performance of devices of a similar class. </li></ul><p>  Regarding the software component of Sony Xperia Sola MT27i, the firmware of the device, Android OS in version 2.3.7 are quite consistent with market demands that had formed at the time of the phone‚Äôs release.  Of course, by that time a newer version of Android, the 4th, was being prepared for release.  However, the basic capabilities of the 2nd, in principle, are enough for the modern user, who can consider the 4th version of Android as outdated. </p>
