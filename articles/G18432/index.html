This hotel is classified as an apartment.  Its feature is the presence of Russian-speaking employees and the administration.  So if you encounter any problems you will not experience any language barrier.  Although the hotel‚Äôs sign is only two stars, it has arrangements with other hotels regarding the provision of various services.  If you correlate this with the price of rest, then even in a crisis, it will seem very attractive to you.  However, judge for yourself.  We made a brief overview of the services and conditions of this hotel for specific reviews of tourists who lived there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dacha beach 2" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/740939.jpg" width="312"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  From Utapao Airport to the hotel - about 46 kilometers.  Dacha Beach 2 is a beachfront hotel.  But also from the center of Pattaya, namely from the famous Walking Street, it is also not too far away.  You can reach the sea by hand, and nearby are Seven-Ileven and Family Markt grocery stores that operate almost round the clock, as well as cafes and restaurants.  Nearby is the luxury hotel "Pattaya Park", near which there is a market with cheap seafood.  To the place where the tuk-tuk ride, walk about ten minutes.  And there for a few butts you can go to any corner of Pattaya.  Therefore, the hotel Dacha Beach <span>(Thailand) reviews</span> for the location put a "five with a plus."  Close to everything, clean and quiet - exactly what you need. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  There are several ways to get to this hotel.  Charter flights fly from Moscow to Utapao Airport, and you can arrive right here.  But most people get to Pattaya from the capital, especially since the message is good.  The time it takes to get your own or rented transport, as well as a taxi from Bangkok to Dacha Beach 2, is one and a half to two hours.  The bus will turn out a little longer.  Travel time is about two and a half hours.  The cost of public transport from Bangkok is about 90 baht. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews of hotel dacha beach 2" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/740938.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Pattaya </h2><p>  T-shirts with a provocative inscription are very popular in Thailand: ‚ÄúGood boys go to heaven.  The bad ones go to Pattaya. ‚Äù  This resort is associated with debauchery, revelry and wild life.  But in fact, here you can find places for a romantic getaway, and even for families with children.  She is very different, this <span>Pattaya.</span>  Dacha Beach 2 is just suitable for tourists who came to relax rather than have fun.  Firstly, it is very close to a good beach.  The water there is clean, and this is a huge plus.  Indeed, swimming in Central Beach or Jomtien Beach is really possible only with a stretch of the imagination.  You can travel to different areas of the resort in tuk-tuk, or, as they say here, in songteo.  These are jeeps with benches set opposite each other.  There are those that cost no more than ten butt, but some work in taxi mode.  So you need to know the price in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dacha beach thailand reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/740937.jpg" width="400"></div>

There are two beaches.  One of them is of the same name with the district.  It is also called Pratumnak Beach.  Another is located near Cozy Beach Hotel.  And he is called accordingly - Cozi Beach.  There are a lot of vacationers from Russia and neighboring countries.  Therefore, in many hotels, service and infrastructure are imprisoned for a certain contingent of tourists.  Such is the hotel Dacha Beach Hotel 2 (Pattaya, Thailand).  In this area there is a hill with a statue of a big Buddha and an observation deck from which you can see the entire resort. </p><p>  Unlike other Pattaya districts stretched along the coast, Pratumnak is a separate town with its own infrastructure.  It is very cozy, quiet, there are no noisy entertainments, go-go-bars and other evil places for which they visit Pattaya.  But next to luxury hotels.  One of them is Pattaya Park, a skyscraper from which the whole district is visible.  Families with children and tourist travelers come here.  Rest in Pratumnak chamber, comfortable.  And children love the water park at the Pattaya Hotel.  The beaches here are the best in the entire resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dacha beach hotel 2" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/740936.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms and facilities </h2><p>  Dacha Beach Hotel 2 is a small, cozy place to relax.  There are only 18 rooms.  But even the rooms of the most standard category are very spacious - with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã36 square meters.  In addition, the hotel also has family rooms and suites.  In the rooms there is literally everything that a traveler needs for a comfortable pastime, so don't be afraid of the low star rating of the hotel.

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Hotel Dacha Beach 2 is just a short walk from the seashore.  You need to walk about 100 meters, and the beach, which is next to the hotel, tourists consider one of the best in Pattaya.  It is located near the Cozy Beach Hotel.  There you can freely pass through the territory of the Adriatic Hotel.  The beach is very well maintained, clean, with excellent infrastructure, wide.  And this is very rare in a resort such as Pattaya.  Although in the Pratumnak area the water is cleaner than in the central part of the village.  You can really swim here.  There is no pool at the hotel.  But the administration has an agreement with the neighboring Adriatic Hotel.  Residents of the "Summer Cottage" can use their pool for their pleasure.  And in the hotel-skyscraper "Pattaya", which is also within walking distance, there is a water park on the territory.  Entrance there costs 100 butts for the whole day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Dacha Beach 2" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/740927.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Good <span>Thai cuisine</span> can be enjoyed at Dacha Beach 2. Reviews indicate that European, Russian, and Japanese dishes are served here, the prices are affordable, and the atmosphere is very cozy.  In a word, here you can taste lobsters with mussels, and borsch with cutlets.  The restaurant has a veranda.  Breakfast is standard for Pattaya - scrambled eggs, bacon, cucumbers and tomatoes, bread and toasts with butter, coffee, tea.  But for lunch and dinner there is more choice.  Seafood and cocktails are especially good here.  In the other building of the hotel there are business lunches for 150 baht per person, and they are different every day.  In addition, the district is full of various restaurants, including those with Russian and Ukrainian food, as well as macaroons and street cafes. </p><p>  You can buy fish and seafood at the market, and they will be fried or boiled for free.  A little further from the hotel there is a Nai Por restaurant with a buffet of 300 baht per person.  There are shrimp, and squid, and soups, and meat, and sushi, and fruits, and salads, and ice cream.  There are ready meals, but you can cook yourself.  In this restaurant, which is recommended by many guests of the "Summer", there is only one pitfall.  If you pick up food that you cannot eat, you will be fined.  Reviews of the Dacha Beach 2 hotel suggest that the restaurant of one of the neighboring hotels - Pattaya Park skyscraper - also offers a seafood <span>buffet</span> at 450 baht per person.  There you will be served and crabs, and lobsters, and lobsters.  And the view from there is amazing: the restaurant is located on the fiftieth floor.  However, wherever you eat, great and cheap Thai food will make a lasting impression on you.  Do not forget only if you can‚Äôt stand the spice of the local spices, ask: ‚ÄúNotice spicy, pliz.‚Äù </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dacha beach 2 pattaya" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/740922.jpg" width="400"></div>

Although many of the attractions of the latter are very extreme and are suitable only for adults and young people. </p><p>  And, of course, all the guests of Pattaya go to the islands, in particular to Koh Lan, to swim in the crystal clear water and get truly paradise pleasure.  To do this, there are ferries that take on board a few hundred people and go on schedule, and there are private gliders that will take you in twenty minutes.

This is a very decent hotel, which is advised to go without even thinking twice.  Well, of course, if the purpose of your trip is not accommodation in seven-star rooms, but swimming, trips and gastronomic delights.  It's calm, there are no drunks, noisy bikers, no intrusive sellers, no girls of easy virtue.  Nice, quiet at home.  At the same time, the audience is intelligent, in the restaurant you can drink and talk culturally. </p><p>  Among the advantages of the hotel, guests mainly call its location and small size.  Travelers who visit the hotel write that it provides much better services than the two stars in which its rating is rated.  It is suitable for those who want to relax inexpensively, quietly and truly.  So do not be afraid to go to this hotel with two stars, you will find only pleasant surprises! </p>
