Many people flock to the island every year in search of new experiences and relaxation.  In our article we want to talk about one of the island's hotels in Ayia Napa - Atlantica Thalassaki 4 *.  Reviews of tourists about this complex are very mixed, so let's figure out whether to visit this hotel or not. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel ... </h2><p>  Before starting the conversation, I want to note that we will try not only to describe the Atlantica Thalassaki 4 *.  Reviews will be the main criterion for evaluating this institution.  This is due to the fact that sometimes tour operators do not always truthfully reflect information in brochures, and in the course of a personal conversation with a client.  Therefore, we want to form our own opinion about the hotel.  Hotel <span>Atlantica Thalassaki</span> 4 * (reviews will be further given by us in the article) is located in the resort town of Ayia Napa, 600 meters from its center and 100 meters from the coast.  The most complete renovation of the hotel building was last carried out in 2009. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="atlantica thalassaki 4 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1573144.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The nearest airport is in a city like Larnaca (45 kilometers), and Paphos Airport is 60 kilometers away, and there is a public transport stop next to the complex.  The hotel was built in the tourist area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort on the first line from the sea.  Relaxing in Ayia Napa, you should definitely see one of the most beautiful places on the island - Cape Greco (it is located a ten-minute drive). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  What about the rooms in Atlantica Thalassaki 4 *?

    <p>  Baby cots are available upon request.  The hotel is cleaned daily, but bed linen is changed every three days.  The hotel offers rooms for people with disabilities, ramps and special convenient parking spaces. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Nutrition is one of the most controversial issues in any complex.  Atlantica Thalassaki 4 * (Ayia Napa) was no exception.  Reviews, as often happens, regarding food are mixed.  The hotel has three restaurants and two bars.  The complex offers guests to use the All Inclusive system.  According to this concept, the <span>food in the hotel is</span> constructed as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Breakfast - from 7.30 to 10.00. </li><li>  Lunch - from 12.30 to 14.00. </li><li>  Dinner starts at 19.00 and continues until 21.30. </li><li>  During the day, guests are served snacks (hot and cold): 10.30-12.00, 15.00-18.00, 22.00-23.00. </li><li>  Locally made ice cream can be taken at any time from 10 a.m. to ten in the evening. </li><li>  Non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks of local production (10.00-24.00). </li></ol><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  What is the infrastructure of the hotel Atlantica Thalassaki 4 * (Cyprus)?  The reviews of tourists make it possible to assert that the complex has a conference room for up to two hundred people, shops, fax, internet, a trading shop, parking, laundry and dry cleaning.  The hotel does not allow pets. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Reviews of the Atlantica Thalassaki 4 * hotel suggest that the institution organizes entertainment events, including various games in the pool.  Sometimes the complex is visited by dance groups.  Hotel guests can use the tennis court, gym.  And for young tourists there is a mini-center, a playground and a private pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="atlantica thalassaki 4 cyprus reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1573147.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the complex has an outdoor pool and an indoor heated pool in the cold season.  For tourists, there is a relaxation area with sun loungers and umbrellas.  Vacationers can enjoy massages, a jacuzzi, a sauna and a fitness center.  It features a volleyball court, a television lounge and a local guide offering sightseeing programs. </p><h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  Thousands of tourists visit Cyprus every year.  The famous resort Ayia Napa - Atlantica Thalassaki 4 * can become a possible vacation spot for those who support economical recreation.  Guest reviews suggest that the hotel is quite close to the coast.  This nuance is an indisputable advantage for a beach-sea vacation.  Since all tourists are certainly attracted to hotels on the coast.  Not every hotel can boast that it is located just a hundred meters from the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="atlantica thalassaki 4 reviews 2016" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1573148.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Like any European complex, Atlantica Thalassaki 4 * does not have its own beach.  Tourists can visit the local municipal coast.  The nearest beach is a seven minute walk.  You can also go to the famous Nissi Beach, which is a wide sand line, lined with sun loungers and umbrellas.  There are also many cafes and restaurants built along the coast. </p><h2>  Atlantica Thalassaki 4 *: 2016 reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation about the hotel, I want to determine the positive and negative nuances present in the complex at present, based on the reviews of tourists who had a rest in it in 2016. </p><p>  According to guests, this institution will be a great place to relax unpretentious tourists who want to enjoy the peace and tranquility during their holidays.  There are never screaming companies or loud music, in the complex the atmosphere itself contributes to pacification and relaxation.  If you are looking for a more active and noisy place with many recreational activities throughout the day and until late at night, then you should definitely look for another place.  The hotel has a very international staff.  Tourists of different age categories feel comfortable here: couples with kids, senior citizens, friendly companies.  It is only possible that the hotel will seem too boring for active youth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel reviews atlantica thalassaki 4" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1573150.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Check-in at 14:00, if you arrive earlier, you will be offered to wait a bit.  The maids clean the rooms every day, bed linen is changed once every three days.  But towels can be changed every day. </p><p>  The hotel offers its guests fairly good apartments with normal furniture and working equipment.  A particularly pleasant moment is the presence in the rooms of kitchenettes with all the necessary utensils.  Of course, on vacation no one will cook three times a day, but you can always please your family with delicious seafood for dinner or feed your children.  The rooms have all the necessary equipment.  Some guests complain of the presence of ants in the rooms.  Apparently, they live in part of the apartment.  In general, the rooms are acceptable for a budget holiday. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  In the complex, meals are organized as a buffet.  Standard European breakfasts do not inspire everyone, but one should not expect Turkish abundance here.  The restaurant always serves meat dishes, vegetables, snacks for lunch and dinner, but seafood does not appear on the tables so often. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ayia napa atlantica thalassaki 4 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1573151.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you do not want to eat at the hotel, then you can book a tour without meals.  In this case, you can visit the nearest cafes and restaurants.  Cypriots are hospitable people, and therefore in the catering establishments the portions serve quite large, not everyone will be able to do it. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Hotel Atlantica Thalassaki 4 * is interesting primarily for its excellent location.  The city center is within easy reach, the sea is nearby.  All the most necessary and interesting is just within walking distance.  There are cafes, restaurants, amusement parks, strip clubs.  Walking around the bustling city and plunging into the whirlpool of active spa life is incredibly fun and healthy.  But then it is no less pleasant to return to a quiet hotel and enjoy a relaxing holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="atlantica thalassaki 4 cyprus ayia napa reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1573164.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  The hotel staff is friendly enough, some employees even have a good understanding of Russian.  Therefore, problems with the language barrier do not arise.  Service is quite acceptable for an institution of this level. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  We hope that our article will be useful for those tourists who consider Atlantica Thalassaki 4 * (Cyprus, Ayia Napa) to be a vacation spot.
