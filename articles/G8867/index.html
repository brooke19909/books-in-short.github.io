    <h2>  Apple Ways </h2><p>  You can block this smartphone in two ways: through iCloud and imei. </p><h2>  How to block iPhone through cloud storage </h2><p>  To block, you need to go to iCloud and authorize using AppleID (the number that is on the stolen gadget and identifies it at the same time).  After that, you need to open ‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù and select your smartphone from the <span>drop-down list</span> .  Then it will be possible to determine from the map where the device is currently located.  If the device icon is marked green, it will mean that it is still connected to the network.  When the indicator is <span>gray,</span> you can be sure that the device is disconnected from the Internet for more than a day.  Now you need to open the menu "Lost Mode" and set a password.  And then we block the lost or stolen iPhone.  It is worth noting that, in addition to this, you can erase absolutely all the data stored on your smartphone using the special option.  But you need to remember that after such an operation the device will not be displayed on the map, therefore this service should be used only as a last resort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About how to block stolen iPhone via IMEI </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs worth considering the second question related to special code.  But all in order.  The answer to the question of how to block the stolen iPhone 5 is quite simple.  Almost all users of this smartphone know that each device has its own unique code, which identifies it among other devices around the world.  Blocking the gadget on this number should prevent the criminal from using it.  It is worth saying that it is practically impossible to implement the plan, since there are a number of legal and technical procedures.  But still, this option is worth considering.  After the theft of the device, you need to write a <span>statement to the police.</span>  It is worth saying that <span>law enforcement agencies</span> will not immediately respond to it, since they practically do not have time to request mobile operators, but may well be asked to leave imei and <span>serial number.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to block a stolen iphone 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19307/694728.jpg" width="600"></div>  So, if we assume that the police will still search for him, we will consider this process in more detail and try to figure out how to block the iPhone if it was stolen.  First of all, law enforcement agencies will make a request to the mobile operator on the abandoned imei.  Mobile companies provide the authorities with all the necessary data.  Including about which card is now located on the specified imei, as well as a phone number.  If the device disappeared with the person, then the search is performed by direction finding using two towers of mobile communication.  Then we find the "iPhone" if it was stolen.  It will not be amiss to say that this method is good enough, since it allows you to detect a smartphone within a radius of one hundred meters and at a height of 10 to 15 m.The process is extremely simple: first, two or more towers are measured in time, then the distance between the towers is measured.  Then they monitor which of the devices was close enough at the last moment.

Some people have access to the Apple database, which allows them to find out the SIM card number by imei code.  After that, a person gets the opportunity to set a Mac address.  At the time when the attacker will access the Internet, you will be able to find out his location.  If it also activates GPS, then using the Find My Phone program it can be detected with an accuracy of five meters.  Finally, if a thief visited social networks through a stolen device, then you can find out his name and surname, which will also allow him to be found.

In this case, it will not be possible to find it with the help of this program if you wish.  There is only one thing left: to protect the data contained in it.  To do this, you need to do four simple steps: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Change <span>Apple ID password.</span>  After this operation, access to iCloud, as well as iMessage and iTunes will be unavailable to the thief. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Correct all login information on sites where the user is registered. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Report the loss of the device to the police and provide the required data. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Notify your mobile operator about the theft or loss of a gadget to disable your account.  This will guarantee that the attacker will not be able to send text messages from the device, make calls and perform other actions with it.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Based on the results of this article, we can say that there are quite a lot of ways how to block the iPhone, if it was stolen, or to find this device.  But, of course, the surest option here is to try not to get into a situation where the smartphone can be stolen or its loss will occur.  Do not put it in the outer pockets of the jacket, as well as in the rear compartments of jeans or an open bag, as it would not be difficult for an attacker to pull him out of there.  And, of course, you need to constantly ensure that the gadget is always in place. </p>
