    <p>  Yalta, like the rest of the South Coast, experienced its economic recovery after, in 1838, simultaneously with the formation of the county, it was given the status of a city.  Members of the royal family erected their summer residences here.  Who has not heard of Livadia or Oreanda.  Yalta gained fame as a fashionable resort, where the whole Russian aristocracy came.  The air of the resort was declared healing: it was recommended by doctors for the treatment of bronchopulmonary diseases. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, as a tourist center, Yalta began to develop only after the October Revolution.
