Air conditioning in the restaurant and in the lobby often does not work.  Therefore, in these areas it is stuffy and hot. </p><p>  During the influx of tourists, Russians complained about the queues that accumulated near the distribution counter.  Sometimes insects flew in the restaurant.  Dishes were not always fresh.  The fruits were sour and tasteless.  The meat on the tables of vacationers is a rarity.  Chicken was cooked more often. </p><p>  The technical condition of the second building was found to be unsatisfactory.  Most often, travelers from Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan settled in such rooms. </p>
