    <p>  Adolf Schicklgruber was born in a small town located on the border of Austria and Germany.  At an early age, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe greatness of the German nation was laid in his head.  The first significant efforts in this matter were made by the school <span>teacher of the future</span> Fuhrer, Leopold Petch, himself a former ardent supporter of Prussian nationalism and a pan-Germanist.  After leaving school, the young man goes to Vienna, cherishing the dream of entering the art academy of this city.  Many people are well aware of the story of how a young man fails in exams in 1907, after which the rector of the academy recommends that he take up architecture rather than art.  Young Adolf then returns to his native Linz, however, after a year he again tries his hand and fails again.  It was in the next period that Hitler, later known to the whole world, was formed.  The biography of these years is filled with extreme poverty, constant vagrancy, housing under bridges and shelters, casual earnings and other pages from the bottom of life.  But at the same time, the young man finally formed his political views during this period, in which he himself </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flight of adolf hitler" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/267875.jpg" width="600"></div>  the process of which was described in detail later in the book ‚ÄúMy Struggle‚Äù was recognized.  Speaking about the reasons for the emergence of such a frenzied ideology, it is necessary to take into account the specifics of the Weimar period, when nationalist sentiments, ideas of anti-German conspiracies were so popular in society, many small anti-Semitic political forces were spread.  At the same time, the young man had the opportunity to observe how, under the onslaught of the Slavs and Hungarians, the Germans were losing their absolutely dominant position in Austria-Hungary.  All this happened in a very, very peculiar way, and then was rethought in the head of young Adolf.

An accident turned his fate here abruptly.  By the will of fate, he was destined to be in one of the beer establishments of the city, where the local patriotic party (then called the Workers' Party of Germany) held its meeting at the same time.  A guy who was keen on politics was interested in their ideas, and in 1920 he joined this still small society.  And soon, thanks to his own charisma and punchy perseverance, he became her most important person.  Hitler's first attempt to come to power dates back to 1923.  We are talking about the famous November Beer putsch, which ended in failure.  As a convoy of coupists marched through the streets of Munich, they were stopped by police who opened fire on the rebels.  An interesting story from the recollections of eyewitnesses is conveyed by a famous researcher (and a former journalist in Weimar and Nazi Germany) William Shearer: under the barrage of fire, the putschists were forced to lie down on the ground;  immediately after the police stopped shooting, the party leader first jumped up and started to flee from the scene of the collision, then got into the car and drove off.  Strange, but the flight of Adolf Hitler did not affect his authority.  Moreover, coping with the first fear, he very boldly behaved on </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="adolf hitler the path to power" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/267876.jpg" width="460"></div>  the ensuing lawsuit, which even added to his sympathy.  However, for the attempted coup, the young politician was nevertheless sent to prison in the Landsberg fortress.  True, he spent less than a year there.

With fiery speeches, cunning political actions, outright blackmail of other political forces, violent reprisals against his opponents and outright deceit in Nazi propaganda, the NSDAP only a few years later became the country's most influential force.  And in <span>1933,</span> Adolf Hitler forced the then President of the Republic, Paul von Hindenburg, to make himself Chancellor.  From this moment on, the NSDAP is rapidly becoming a united political force in the state, their ideology is the only true one, and Germany is plunging into a <span>totalitarian regime.</span> </p><p>  The splendor and monstrosity of the Fuhrer‚Äôs largest fight </p><p>  Having come to power, the new head of state did not hide his true face for long.  Opposition forces were quickly eliminated inside the country.  Not long did the Fuhrer prepare for foreign policy actions.  Already in 1936, in violation of the Versailles accords, he was introducing his troops into the demilitarized Rhine region.  The humble ignorance of this violation was only the first cowardly silence of the great powers in a long chain.  This was followed by outright blackmail and the seizure of first Austria, later Czechoslovakia and Poland.  In 1940, the fate of the occupation befell France.  England was barely saved.  Retelling the further biography of Adolf Hitler in detail, perhaps, does not make sense.  One can hardly find a person in our country who has not heard of the German invasion of the USSR, the first successes of Blitzkrieg and the further gradual complete loss of any adequacy by the F√ºhrer, who could not at all reconcile with defeats - first near Moscow, then near Stalingrad, and then on all fronts.  The ideologist of the Nazi party threw more and more batches of German soldiers (which is often attributed to Zhukov and Stalin), putting an entire generation of Germans on the altar of his idea.  However, the victorious tread of the Allies in the <span>anti-Hitler coalition</span> completely drove the Fuhrer crazy.  In the last days of his life, he, sick and broken, but with his former fanaticism, the last thing left of the former Hitler, declared that the German nation should perish if it could not win this war.  Adolf Hitler found his death by taking poison on April 30, 1945. </p>
