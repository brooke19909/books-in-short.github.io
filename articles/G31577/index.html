  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rosenheim (Germany): History and Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Rosenheim (Germany) is a city that is not particularly popular among tourists.  Well, hunters for instaplaces and a beautiful picture in the described area really have nothing to look for.  But for those who want to relax their soul and body, be inspired by the harmony of the townspeople and enjoy the calm atmosphere, here is the place. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Rosenheim is located in Germany (Bavaria), near the tourist favorite - Munich.  They are washed by the city on both sides of the Inn and Mangfal rivers.  Not far from the town is a picturesque lake called Chiemsee, or, as the locals call it, the Bavarian Sea.  The height of Rosenheim in Germany is about five hundred meters above sea level. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.8571272" data-lng="12.118104700000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/0/8/6/17086.png"></div><p>  In the city itself lives a little less than one hundred thousand people.  Residents are very pleasant and smiling people, why you want to come back here again and again.  But was it so pleasant in the last century?  It's time to look behind the historical screen and discover another Rosenheim. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Documents from 1234 indicate that Rosenheim Castle was erected on the site of a former Roman camp.  The settlement during the construction played the role of a pier on the Inn River and a hundred years later it became a favorite place for fairs.  The Thirty Years War brought catastrophic destruction to this area.  And until the XIX century, the life of the city stopped. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the 1850s, Rosenheim in Germany has been recognized as one of the largest railway junctions, due to which the locality has received the status of an urban settlement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uk.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="germany sights" class="if uuid-3207653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3207653.jpg"></div><p>  At the beginning of the XIX century, nothing was left of the wasteland and devastation.  Places of past warfare were built up with Art Nouveau houses with bright impregnations of eclecticism.  Visitors could relax and appreciate the taste of local beer in more than 20 breweries and bars.  Everything went on as usual. </p><p>  And again, a bloody massacre.  The Second World War demolished all the beauties of Rosenheim.  Because of the ruthless bombing, residents had to rebuild their own homes.  Today, almost nothing is left of its former luxury and beauty. </p><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the influx of visitors here is small, hotels in Rosenheim (Germany) amaze with their design solutions and affordable price list.  In the top 3 according to tourists: </p><ul><li>  D&amp;R Ferienwohnung.  This comfortable, spacious loft-style apartment has an outdoor garden.  Ideal for family holidays or a small company. </li><li>  Hotel "San Gabriel".  Visiting and spending the weekend here is a great idea.  Firstly, the aristocratic and antique atmosphere of the rooms is emphasized by vaulted ceilings and four-poster beds.  Secondly, delicious dishes in a romantic restaurant and a chic buffet will give everyone gastronomic pleasure.  Thirdly, the location of the hotel in the monastery helps guests reunite with history. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.goldbeck.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosenheim Germany Hotels" class="if uuid-3207654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3207654.jpg"></div><ul><li>  B&amp;B Hotel is a minimalist lifestyle.  Cozy bright rooms with a modern design were appreciated by young people and workers who went on a business trip. </li></ul><p>  If you can‚Äôt have lunch at the hotel, then it's time to find a place to eat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to eat? </h2><p>  This is probably one of the most important points, because nothing can be appreciated by the right to an empty stomach.  Well, the must-visit list includes: </p><ol><li>  Kastenauer Hof - a wonderful restaurant with a well-kept garden and a fountain on site.  The ancient interior and terrace on the street are very close to Russian tourists. </li><li>  L'Incontro.  This is the exact opposite of the previous institution.  The fusion-style interior with neon lights, Italian cuisine and a rich wine bar will give you the opportunity to relax after hilarious walks. </li><li>  Pastavino.  Bright interior with a hint of marine motifs.  In good company and Mediterranean cuisine, you can create many wonderful memories. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.bavaria.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosenheim Germany reviews" class="if uuid-3207656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3207656.jpg"></div><p>  For a quick bite to eat, check out local fast foods or cafeterias. </p><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  What to see in Rosenheim (Germany)?  For starters - a little to explore the beauty of the city.  Chiemsee Lake, which was mentioned earlier.  The pond itself is known not only for its crystal water, but also for two islands: Man's (Herren Chiemsee) and Feminine (Frauen Chiemsee). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.landezine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosenheim Germany what to see" class="if uuid-3207658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3207658.jpg"></div><p>  On the first island there is a palace built by the Bavarian king named Ludwig II.  There is a monastery on Feminine Island, which is the property of the Benedictine Order.  Nearby are the Old Castle (Museum of the Augustinian Monastery) and St. Mary's Church. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  In Rosenheim (Germany), the sights are amazing architectural structures that convey the spirit of the past.  So, tourists are in a hurry in the first place to inspect the gates of Mittertor. </p><p>  The unofficial symbol of the city is the parish church of St. Nicholas.  At first, the temple was built in the Gothic style, which was characteristic of the decoration in the form of a sharp spire on top.  Due to the devastating fire, the church was rebuilt already in a different guise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.citiestips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="oktober fest" class="if uuid-3207661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3207661.jpg"></div><p>  Another highlight of the area is Riedergarten.  This is a botanical garden in the center with a pharmacy garden.  It was created by the local pharmacist Johan Reeder in 1729.  In the last century, the garden became the property of the city and the most visited place in Rosenheim (Germany), according to tourists.  You can get acquainted with the traditions of citizens in two museums: woodworking and the Inn River.  In these institutions you learn to look at seemingly ordinary craft as a separate art form. </p><p>  And a little cheat sheet for those who have already bought tickets to Rosenheim.  Two currencies are spinning throughout the region: the euro and the Himgauer (Rosenheim's own currency).  Firstly, it is beneficial in the event of a sharp drop in the euro.  Secondly, a certain part of the turnover of the Himgauer goes to the care of charitable foundations. </p>
