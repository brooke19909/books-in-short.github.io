This is a large resort with luxury and luxury <span>hotels,</span> mid-range <span>hotels</span> and very simple budget hostels and villas.  Hotel Miraluna Garden 3 * (Rhodes) quite often offer modern tour operators.  That is why all potential vacationers want to understand what living conditions they will receive if they give their preference.  This is what we will talk about in this material. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  So, in January 2013, the Kiotari Garden hotel was renamed Miraluna Garden Villas 3 * (Rhodes).  Not all tourists are familiar with this information, the presence of a small number of reviews about the "new" hotel confuses and alarms them.  By local standards, the hotel is quite small, so it is ideal for tourists looking for a calm and measured vacation.  It is only 1-1.5 hours drive from the airport. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Miraluna Garden 3 * (Greece, Rhodes) has a good location - between the villages of Largos and Kiotari.  It is located in the southern part of the island, so the season here lasts longer than usual.  The beach is only 300 meters from the hotel, which is why beach lovers who plan to spend most of their time on the coast so often pay attention to this option. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  <span>Check-out time</span> at the hotel is 14:00.  But many of those tourists who arrived earlier than the indicated time indicated that they were settled earlier.  The staff meets all the guests, especially with young children, understands that everyone is tired of the road, they want to put themselves in order and start getting to know the resort.  They will refuse to check in to newly arrived guests only if at the time of their arrival there will not be a single free and prepared room. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The room fund of the Miraluna Garden Villas 3 * hotel (Greece, Rhodes island) is represented by only 40 rooms: one-room double rooms, designed for 2-3 people, and two-room superior apartments, designed for 3-4 people. </p>

    <p>  The rooms are fairly bright and spacious, each with a private bathroom, a balcony with stunning views of the island‚Äôs beauty, satellite TV, air conditioning, telephone and mini fridge.  If you rely on the reviews of vacationers, there were no interruptions in the operation of the equipment: the refrigerator freezes, the air conditioner cools the air in the room - what else is needed for a good rest.  Important note: use of air conditioning is included in the room rate.  Moreover, all vacationers with children will be provided with a special bed upon arrival. </p><p>  The rooms are fresh, with traces of cosmetic repairs.  Furniture is not of the highest quality (particleboard), but stylish and modern.  The furniture set is standard: two beds, a table with a chair, a mirror.  I would like to see a wardrobe, and so you have to keep things in a suitcase.  The mattresses are clean, even, the sheets are snow-white. </p><p>  The bathroom is small, but clean and comfortable: a marble table, sink, toilet, hairdryer, a full bath with a curtain - after each reception of water procedures, tourists will not have to wipe the puddle formed on the floor.  When checking into the room, all vacationers will find shampoo and soap.  The only drawback of the hotel is the lack of bath towels.  That is why be sure to take them with you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Room service </h2><p>  Rooms are cleaned every 2 days: they throw out trash, wash the floor, clean the plumbing, and even wipe the dust that has accumulated on the furniture.  Bed linen is changed every 3 days.  Cleaning is done during the absence of tourists, so nothing will disturb your peace. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Let's evaluate what food the Miraluna Garden 3 * hotel (Rhodes) can offer.  Reviews of tourists note that it is - for a 3 * hotel - excellent, not all fives can offer such a variety of dishes.  Breakfasts are standard for Europe: yogurt, cottage cheese, dry cereal, milk, omelet, scrambled eggs, sausages, eggs, cold cuts and cheese, fresh bread, tea and coffee to choose from.  For lunch and dinner, always served meat, sea fish, vegetables, lots of greens and salads.  Of the side dishes, you can often see spaghetti, rice, mashed potatoes, steamed and grilled vegetables. </p><p>  We were pleased with the children's menu: in the morning, cooks prepare porridge for milk for kids, bake pancakes and pancakes, and for children they serve their favorite delicacy - pasta with cheese.  During the day, an excellent pizza is prepared at the bar - there is a line for it.  The bar has enough alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, you can drink them in unlimited quantities.  Vacationers praise local wine. </p><p>  Be sure to visit the local cafe or restaurant at least once.  Rhodes is a place where you can taste delicious Mediterranean cuisine.  Do not deny yourself such a pleasure. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Miraluna Garden 3 * (Rhodes island, Greece) does not have its own beach, but only 300 meters from it there is a beautiful public beach with small pebbles.  The entrance to the sea is sometimes rocky, but this does not bother tourists at all.  The beach is also suitable for families with small children.  Some tourists are advised to purchase special shoes, which are sold in all shops of the resort.  There is a small cafe on the beach where you can buy soft drinks, ice cream, drink aromatic coffee with fresh pastries.  For an additional fee (8 euros), you can rent a sunbed with an umbrella.  But in the season there are far from enough sun loungers: tourists have to go to the beach in the early morning to take a seat. </p>

    <p>  Locals suggested a good sandy beach - what vacationers with kids need.  True, it‚Äôs 15-20 minutes to go through a small mountain through the terrible heat, but it‚Äôs really worth it.  The sand is shallow, the sea is transparent, the entry into the water is gentle.  Rent of sunbeds and umbrellas here is 7 euros.  The only drawback is that the place is very popular, so a lot of vacationers gather here in season. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Hotel Miraluna Garden 3 * (Rhodes) is consistent with its description and category.  This is a great all-inclusive budget hotel.  Good clean and bright rooms, quality food, opportunities for organizing leisure activities, living conditions for families with small children - what else is needed on vacation.  That is why we strongly recommend paying special attention to this option. </p>
