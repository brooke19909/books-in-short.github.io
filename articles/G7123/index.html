Ancient Egypt was not an aggressive state, but wars happened often, at first internecine, then, after unification, defensive.  And when the state gained strength, it began to conduct aggressive campaigns in neighboring territories. </p>

    <h2>  For what purposes did the pharaohs contain a large army? </h2><ul><li>  Firstly, of course, this is defense.  The constant raids from neighboring tribes were cruel and ravaged the lands. </li><li>  Secondly, this is the maximum increase in the number of slaves for cultivating land.  While raiding Nubia and Syria, the Egyptians massed the inhabitants of these countries into slavery. </li><li>  The third goal is to seize the sources of raw materials (metal, wood), so necessary for the development of slaveholdings.  To obtain the necessary raw materials, repeated sea expeditions to Phenicia and to the island of Crete were carried out.  With the aim of robbery, trips to Palestine and Nubia were equipped.  These are the goals the pharaohs kept a large army with.  As you can see, it was just not enough to do without it. </li></ul>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The army of the pharaoh in the ancient kingdom </h2><p>  For the first time, a standing army began to form precisely in this period.  For their good service, the soldiers received land.  The main part was a militia from the nomes of Egypt (regions).  A smaller part was made by mercenaries (mainly Nubians).  The initial equipment of the army was unsophisticated.  The main weapon is a bow and arrow.  Additional elements include mace, daggers and spears.  The helmet was leather, a <span>wooden shield was</span> also fitted with this material.  There were no units - all the soldiers belonged to the infantry.  For the first time, they also began to build fortifications. </p><h2>  Middle Kingdom Army </h2><p>  It is characterized by improved equipment.  New bows helped increase the range of the boom to 180 meters.  For the first time, chariots appear in the equipment.  The organization of the army improved, detachments with a narrow specialization appeared, for example, archers, spearmen, infantry with swords.  Each unit had a certain number of soldiers - from 4 to 600 people.  Each Mr. recruited volunteers from among young people who, after service, returned to civilian life.  A significant part was still made up of mercenaries from Nubia.  The pharaohs in ancient Egypt participated in military campaigns, their chariot always led the army.  The pharaoh dressed in special robes, an essential attribute of which was a blue headdress. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Egyptian army</span> in the New Kingdom </h2><p>  At this time, the military became a separate estate and in the hierarchy took third place with the nobles, after the pharaoh and his viziers.  The constant raids by the militant neighbors demanded improved weapons, as a result of which swords of a straight and sickle shape appeared, the body of the soldiers was protected by a leather shell with metal platinum sewn on it.  A structure appeared, and certain <span>types of troops</span> were distinguished by ammunition. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All weapons belonged to the state and were stored in special warehouses in peacetime, and only warriors bought chariots at their own expense.  The core of the army remained numerous infantry.  The main striking force was chariots - they allowed you to move faster, provide greater mobility and mobility.  As a rule, two people stood on a chariot - one drove it, and the second shot from a bow.  The privilege of going into battle in a chariot was not granted to everyone, but only to immigrants from the nobility, very often it was ruled by the young princes, sons of the pharaoh. </p><p>  The army of the pharaoh on the campaign moved, divided into separate units.  During long and exhausting stops camped.  According to the organization of the Egyptian army, chariots started the battle, they also covered the rear, followed by infantry units. </p>

    <h2>  Army and Pharaoh </h2><p>  Another answer to the question, with what purposes did the pharaohs contain a large army, was that there was a need for the pharaoh to protect himself.  Rulers always rely primarily on the army.  This is a means of enslaving and oppressing not only enemies, often their people.  This is significant support during the uprisings and riots.  This was especially true of the Nubians, they were professionals and received money for it.  But there is a second side to the coin.  The army is also an essential political force.  And very often she not only defended the pharaohs, but also actively contributed to conspiracies and the overthrow of the ruler. </p><p>  Difficult environmental conditions, the need to build irrigation facilities, the cult of the <span>afterlife</span> and, as a result, the grandiose and costly construction of the pyramids, the defense against external enemies - all this explains the purpose for which the pharaohs contained a large army.  Slaves needed to be taken somewhere, the neighbors of Egypt were best suited for this, and for capturing, of course, a permanent and professional large army was needed. </p>
