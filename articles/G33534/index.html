Nevertheless, even its small territory is divided into southern and northern parts.  I must say that the unit is not conditional, since both regions are fundamentally different from each other.  Goa resorts located in the southern part include fantastic sandy beaches, exotic nature and pompous five-star hotels.  In turn, the northern part is literally saturated with an atmosphere of freedom.  There are many <span>oriental bazaars,</span> and tourists can participate in beach parties and dances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prazeres Resort 2" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1097982.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resorts Goa </h2><p>  The coastline of this Indian state is located so that the sun's rays constantly warm the sandy areas for swimming.  The beaches bordered by palm trees are stretched in a continuous line along the coast of Goa - Candolim, Vagator, Baga, Anjuna, etc. Parasailing is the most popular form of water entertainment, although diving, sailing and windsurfing are no less common.  Here tourists can choose for themselves any affordable housing option: from luxury hotels to affordable guest houses. </p><p>  The vast majority of Russian travel agencies specializing in this area offer to visit Goa Candolim, Bagi, Calangute or a small Sinkerim.  Apparently, this is why our compatriots do not feel isolated in isolation from their native shores: here you can hear Russian speech everywhere.  Even in hotels, attendants or sellers in endless shops can communicate quite reasonably with ‚Äúour brother‚Äù.  The resorts of Goa are always crowded.  Local hotels, even the cheapest, are characterized by sufficient comfort and good service.  In general, the tourism industry is very well established.  Apparently, that's why many travelers, including Russians, prefer to spend their holidays in Goa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Goa prices" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1097992.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition to its obvious advantages - year-round sun and wonderful beaches on the ocean, cheapness is another plus that characterizes holidays in Goa.  Prices here depend on the season.  From time to time in travel agencies you can buy last-minute tours at a reasonable price.  For example, in January, Russians can pay only nineteen and a half thousand rubles for an eight-day stay in a three-star hotel with a flight, visa cost and the breakfast concept.  In the high season, for example, on the Christmas holidays, the price doubles. </p><p>  Since the main cost of the tour falls on air travel, the longer the tourists relax, the cheaper the trip is per day.  The average price of a trip to Goa for two for a period of two weeks is about eighty thousand rubles.  The price includes the tour itself and expenses are already in place. </p><h2>  Candolim </h2><p>  This resort is ideal for those who prefer a measured comfortable rest away from unnecessary fuss.  Candolim - a small village located in the very south of northern Goa - almost forms a whole with Calangute.  The resort has many hotels of various categories.  Here is the large hotel complex of the Taj Group chain, the five-star Fortune Select Regina, Golden Tulip Goa, offering a range of services comparable to European services.  Prices for accommodation are higher than for apartments in other regions of the northern coast of Goa.  In addition, there are many three-and two-star hotels in Candolim that are hidden on the shady streets of the resort, for example Prazeres Resort 2 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resorts Goa" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1097991.jpg" width="600"></div>
