Also known about his outstanding story.  He is either Russian or Ukrainian, then it seems to be Russian again.  Over the past couple of hundred years, there have been many crown events, so there is nothing surprising in this.  Let's try a little walk through its history and still decide finally, is Taganrog Russia or Ukraine?  As the saying goes, put an end to this issue. </p><h2>  general information </h2>

Where is the city of Taganrog located and what is it like?  Its location is the shore of the bay of the same name in the Sea of ​​Azov, southwest of the Rostov Region.  Taganrog is a large scientific, cultural and industrial center, a leading seaport of the Russian south.  Its population is 277.3 thousand people, according to this indicator in the region it is the second.  To Ukraine - 50 kilometers, the territory has an area of ​​more than 80 km².  The regional center is 77 km away.

    <p>  The city is located on a magnificent cape, which protrudes far enough into the sea and is surrounded by water on three sides.  Not far from it are industrial Azov and Bataisk, as well as the Ukrainian sea <span>port of Mariupol.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Before you figure it out, Taganrog is Russia or Ukraine, you need to familiarize yourself with its history.  Without this, our conclusion will be incomplete.  A very interesting fact: the construction of this settlement was carried out according to a plan developed in advance.  In 1699, in this place in a small fortress was Peter I. He gave the necessary orders, on the basis of which a plan was drawn up. </p><p>  As a result, after some time inside the defensive structure, in addition to military facilities, the royal palace, courtyards and palaces of its closest subjects, the administration of sailors, religious and administrative buildings were built.  From the end of the 18th century and at the beginning of the 19th Taganrog begins to emerge as a trading city.  It became the only place in the south of the country where trade with foreign countries was established.  That was until the middle of the 19th century. </p><h2>  So after all, is Taganrog Russia or Ukraine? </h2>

    <p>  This beautiful city has a very important place in Russian history.  And not only.  1918 year.  Taganrog is the capital of the People's Republic of Ukraine.  How?  Why? </p><p>  All this happened not just like that, but had its own premises.  First of all, if we take the entire district at that time, then Ukrainians accounted for 71.5% of the total population, although in the city there were 34.6% of them.  Russians - 21.9% and 55.2%, respectively.  Therefore, there is nothing strange about this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Secondly, in 1918 almost all of Ukraine was occupied by Kaiser Germany, and there was simply no place for the government to work there.  And then a special decree stipulated the Ukrainian status of Taganrog.  And then a special plebiscite was held.  As a result of all this, the city became Ukrainian for some time, albeit small.  The government bodies of the whole state were located and worked in it.  That is, the capital turned out, and it fully corresponded to its high rank.  After some time, Taganrog lost it, but remained part of Ukraine. </p><p>  We answer the question of whether Taganrog is where now, in which country.  The answer is short and specific - in Russia. </p><h2>  How Taganrog returned to Russia </h2><p>  This event, which put everything in its place, occurred on January 25, 1954.  A rather interesting story, with several different interpretations.  It all started with the fact that Nikita Khrushchev, as it were, presented the Crimean peninsula to the Ukrainian SSR.  Why "like"?  Because actually the peninsula was transferred by <span>G. Malenkov</span> by decree of K. Voroshilov.  N. Khrushchev at that time could not decide anything on his own, despite the fact that he was the first secretary of the Communist Party. </p>

Instead of Crimea, the Russian Federation received Taganrog from Ukraine and lands bordering it.  Moreover, their area turned out to be equal to the area of ​​the peninsula.  In addition, Kiev gave up rich chernozem areas, and in return received a saline arid steppe.  But we have already deviated a little from the topic.  Thus, the answer to the question of whether Taganrog is Russia or Ukraine is unequivocal: this is the <span>territory of the Russian Federation.</span>

    <p>  Each of us owns information that these lands are the birthplace of Anton Pavlovich Chekhov.  For this reason, every visitor to the city first of all goes to the “Chekhov’s House”, its main memorial attraction.  It is small (its area is 35.4 sq. M), built of bricks, the basis of which is clay mixed with straw. </p><p>  There are many similar buildings.  This is the house of Andrei Drossi, a friend of Chekhov, and the house of Rafailovich.  You can talk about each of these buildings for a very long time, but we will go to the embankment.  And here you can immediately see where Taganrog is located - on a flat undulating terrain.  With a small hill, and the coast is at an altitude of 50 meters from sea level, a magnificent view opens.  Due to its location, the climate here is temperate continental, with a lack of moisture and excess heat, mitigated by breezes from the sea. </p><p>  At the end of the story about this city, we note the name "Taganrog".  The main option: the combination of the word "tagan", meaning a tripod or brazier for cooking over an open fire, and "horn", meaning a cape. </p>
