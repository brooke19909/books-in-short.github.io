  <section class="page js-page"><h1>External hard drive. Which is better to choose?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We are used to the fact that new devices and various gadgets are constantly appearing on the shelves of electronics stores, which should make our life more convenient.  Someone will find them really useful, but for someone it‚Äôs just expensive toys, from which there is no real good.  These include storage devices, a flash drive and an external hard drive.  Which is better to choose a device depends on the user. </p><p>  It is worth saying that flash drives, or just flash drives, have become not just popular, but indispensable.  After they began to appear on sale, and their capacity was constantly increasing, they began to supplant the usual floppy disks, and later even DVD-RW.  Thanks to flash drives, the average user practically does not use his DVD burner, except when he needs to record music or a movie to play on the player. </p><p>  However, even despite the fact that the capacity of flash drives is constantly growing, it is still not always enough.  An <span>external hard drive</span> comes to the rescue here <span>.</span>  <span>Which is better</span> to choose will depend on the user and specific circumstances.  In fact, it is an ordinary hard drive, only it can be carried with you and quickly connected to another computer. </p><p>  Reliability and quality of external hard drives </p><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the volume of the external hard drive.  The cost will directly depend on this.  However, the best external hard drive does not mean the most voluminous.  Much depends on the quality of this device, because the external hard drive, like the internal one, is subject to wear and tear, data corruption, etc.  It must be treated with care, especially during work.  When it is connected to a computer and data is being read or written, it is better not to touch it at all. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth paying attention to the material from which the external hard drive is made, which is better difficult to say, but the case itself must be durable, in which case protect the internal moving parts.  In addition, it is worth saying that you need to disconnect the hard drive from the computer only in safe mode, if you simply pull it out of the USB port, that is, there is a risk of damaging the data and the device itself, and this risk is greater than with ordinary flash drives. </p><p>  If you follow these simple rules, then any external hard drive will last for a long time, which is better not to depend heavily on this.  You can choose almost any one, and it will serve for a long time, even with active use.  Although sometimes low-quality samples come across, this happens with similar devices.  But following the rules of safe handling will help get rid of these problems. </p><p>  Characteristics of external hard drives </p><p>  Many people think that the main and only characteristic of external hard drives is only the amount of memory, or disk size.  But this is not entirely true, because the quality of a device often depends on its speed of operation, i.e.  speed of reading and writing information.  Very often it is limited by USB speed, so you have to put up with it. </p><p>  Among the most popular companies, Seagate's external hard drive is often in steady demand, because this company has been manufacturing <span>hard drives for computers for a</span> long time <span>.</span>  Directly among external devices, one can note the company A-DATA, which produces fairly high-quality, inexpensive, and stylish devices.  There are other players in this market, in particular Transcend, which has long been engaged in the production of various drives and external drives, as well as the company WD Elements, which although it is not as popular as the others, but it presents quite interesting options.  When choosing, you need to look at the dimensions of the device, its characteristics and <span>appearance,</span> since it will need to be carried with you. </p>
